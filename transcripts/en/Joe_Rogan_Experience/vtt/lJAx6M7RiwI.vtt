1
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.643
Okay.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.590
<v 1>Hello Alonzo. What is up, Joe? Good to see my brother, man.</v>

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:11.130
It is so good to be back. I'm out. It's my first time seeing the new joint.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.080
It's absolutely amazing. So I thought you'd been here the new spot, but no,

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.040
like I said, you were building this when I did the last one and this,

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.770
this when you said you could do everything here, it's like, yeah,

7
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.420
this is the bunker. I don't live that far from here. Come on.

8
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.840
So when the bomb hits, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to Joe's spot. Well,

9
00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:31.410
if you live in the, if you're in the neighborhood, you want to use the gym,

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.290
it's always open. Thanks. Come on down. I'll bring canned goods.

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.430
Bring Water for fires. Yeah. If the shit hits the fan, Bernie had me nervous.

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.300
Bernie Sanders was just here. He had me nervous about climate change.

13
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.890
Whenever someone brings up climate change,

14
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:51.600
it's like a build that you didn't pay. Like Ah, fuck. Yeah, it's, it's real.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.590
And, okay. So now I'm gonna do my first shameless plug for my new special,

16
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.130
when I use it out now, August 23rd on Amazon prime,

17
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.880
it's called the new wave of Amazon's because I'm very excited about them.

18
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.690
They're, they're testing the water so it's good to be in. So, uh,

19
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.350
it's called heavy lightweight and I call it that cause I do some heavy topics

20
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.120
and then I mix it in with lightweight shit.

21
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:16.320
Cause that's like if you do all heavy, like it's, it's wow. That was depressing.

22
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.190
Yeah. And you know, and I talk about the climate change thing, but it's like,

23
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.560
to be honest, like look, I'm a black man. 57 I got what?

24
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:29.670
Like 10 years left. I don't give a shit. You know what I'm saying?

25
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.790
Like statistically, God bless you. Millennials have wish you luck.

26
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:37.350
But I had a good run. So Nah, Nick's amazing for 50 cents.

27
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:39.510
Thank you. Yeah, don't crack it. Well,

28
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.210
and this is why I talk about right up until the day it does. Right. So like,

29
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.600
like literally, right till the day before I die. Look Great.

30
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.490
And then what happened? Some bitch died from what black been black.

31
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:54.090
His whole life shit just caught up with him. You got fucking diabetes,

32
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:56.430
sickle cell and high blood pressure and the same day

33
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.400
and wave of malady. But no, but the, the climate change thing is real.

34
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:07.200
But I think the big problem is it's slow. It's not dramatic.

35
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:11.610
So people, it's easy to, to not think about it because you know that, yeah,

36
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:16.170
the oceans rising, but it's an inch a year, which, you know,

37
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.010
I may not, that may not be exact, but you know what I mean? It's a lot, right?

38
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:24.230
So people don't, people don't see it with the urgency. And I,

39
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:28.800
and I think that's why you have the young congress pupil talking about it

40
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.160
because they're like, hey, this is going to be in our lifetime. Right?

41
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:36.180
But then you have the older generation where it's like, Eh, you know,

42
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.120
it's interesting. I'm pretty sure, and we should check this,

43
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:40.050
make sure this is correct.

44
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:42.390
And I think we learned about this from Randal Carlson,

45
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.660
that they increase CO2 to rates also increases vegetation because vegetation and

46
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.550
greenery, they use go use carbon dioxide, right? Yeah.

47
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.650
The increased rates actually this is like one of the greenest times ever.

48
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.010
Yeah. But

49
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.100
<v 2>I wonder how does that offset versus the,</v>

50
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.850
there's less land for these plants to grow on. You know what I mean? Like,

51
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:11.851
so when you look at like rain forest jungles being with like that like is the

52
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.950
opposite of that was they say that it's makes it harder for them to grow. When,

53
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.760
what article says that? Uh,

54
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.250
is there any articles that say that's not the case because it seems like that's

55
00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:28.040
not something Randall would lie about. He was talking about how um,

56
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.230
this is like one of the most, uh,

57
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.320
green times ever in the increase of forest and in green trees.

58
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.120
I guess I'm seeing both of them then.

59
00:03:38.121 --> 00:03:40.970
So the very first things that pop up are high carbon levels,

60
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:43.850
make it harder for plants to grow from ThinkProgress. Second thing,

61
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.790
increased carbon dioxide levels and air restrict plants ability to absorb

62
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:51.140
nutrients from science. Dot. G. Dot. Se to another country. I think Sweden,

63
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.020
yes. About think progress. Sounds like a bunch of fucking hippies.

64
00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.240
Bunch of tree hugging mission. NASA says though, it's making a greener for now.

65
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.140
Yes. So I would buy that. The thing about that thing, and this,

66
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.620
it didn't this funny like with science you have to check because you have to see

67
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:09.150
if there's a political agenda.

68
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.650
NASA one you have to see if there's a political agenda behind the science,

69
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.860
right? Yeah, for sure. But with NASA,

70
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.270
I'd go with what NASA says. I think there they say go, scroll back up please.

71
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.720
Uh, CO2 is making the earth greener for now and then says, uh,

72
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.230
a quarter to half of earth vegetated lands have shown significant greening over

73
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:32.190
the last 35 years,

74
00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:36.300
largely due to rising levels of levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

75
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.110
According to a new study published in the Journal for Natural Climate Change on

76
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:41.160
April 25th. Yeah.

77
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.770
See an international team with 32 offer authors from 24 institutions in eight

78
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:48.180
countries led the effort,

79
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.420
which involved using satellite data from NASA's moderate Resolution Imaging

80
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.870
Spectrometer and the National Oceanic and atmospheric administration's advanced,

81
00:04:57.871 --> 00:04:59.790
very high resolution radio,

82
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.090
radio meter instruments to help determine the leaf area index or the amount of

83
00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:08.580
leaf cover over the planet's vegetated regions.

84
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.700
The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in

85
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.140
areas to two times that continental United States, Blah-blah-blah.

86
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.770
So Randall's right, I think, but I think, uh, either way we're fucked.

87
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.330
And then on top of that, we'll just be, we'll all die in a very green planet.

88
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.770
How much, if everything melts, if the polarized caps mount, like,

89
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:35.490
where could we, can we live in South Dakota or some shit? I don't know.

90
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.270
I don't think so. Make it in. I, I don't keep inside, you know,

91
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:41.880
I don't think so. Like, like, uh, you know,

92
00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:45.580
they want California to fall into the ocean. Right. You always hear that Texas.

93
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.980
It's like, yeah. And the title wave will kill you. Yeah. You know what I mean?

94
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.490
I don't know. Um,

95
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.710
I don't think that safe because it would be such a drastic, I mean, right,

96
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:58.130
so much

97
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.240
<v 1>of the earth's weather is controlled by the polarized caps,</v>

98
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.960
the magnetic poles, the, the rainfall, you know,

99
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.800
glaciers and it's all interconnected. Right?

100
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.470
That's why the hurricanes are getting stronger, right? Yeah.

101
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.530
So if you lose like the oceans controlled Earth's climate because the Wa,

102
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.760
you know, having to do with evaporation and so on. So anyway,

103
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.750
for sure you shouldn't be getting weather information from you or me.

104
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.940
Listen, we got to two experts, scientists here. We've been,

105
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.140
we've been talking about this for minutes and they get better for hours.

106
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.340
All totaled over our lives. But no, it, it's um,

107
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.760
it's real. Yeah. But it, but it is something,

108
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:45.260
I think it's definitely younger people are going to be more interested because

109
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:47.390
it could be a major thing.

110
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.890
Like if you're 30 now when you're 60,

111
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.790
this could be a real, real big issue.

112
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.630
It's a bad time to buy real estate in Miami. No, you don't want, you know,

113
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:02.730
when is a good time to buy real estate? A lot of coconut

114
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.120
and you'll get a party if found out you have stage four cancer,

115
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.220
but you do have a large bag that, you know,

116
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.460
I love that you mentioned that because this is been a thing.

117
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:20.150
So the the weed industry be illegal, right?

118
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:24.050
And they say there's all this money that people can't figure out what to do

119
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:28.520
with, right. The banks don't want it. Like Miami was built with cocaine money.

120
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:33.110
What happened to those money laundering guys who cleaned up all of that money,

121
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:35.930
built all that real estate. Like where are they now? Different era.

122
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.390
I can't believe that there's not people out there who can figure out how to

123
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.740
clean this weed money and boost the economy. They will be able to figure it out.

124
00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:46.940
But it's going to take a long time.

125
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.390
And the people that are trying to figure it out right now, like the,

126
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:52.010
the weed dealers that are selling it legally,

127
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:54.960
but then have all the stockpiles of cash, they've got their halftime,

128
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.730
they hire hire mercenaries and they hire blackwater guys. And Shit.

129
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.180
The fucking special ops guys to watch their money, they really have to. Um,

130
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.610
my old, uh, Condo I rented out, right.

131
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.510
So I was renting to a guy, his business was,

132
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:16.511
he handled the credit card transactions for the weed places for the dispensary's

133
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.910
and stuff. And you know, the bank shut him down and this,

134
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:21.770
and he didn't pay the rent late. And I was like,

135
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.670
I got the only guy in the weed business who can't make money like I'm renting

136
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.810
to, there's one guy in weed who can't. I was like, listen man, I take cash.

137
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.030
Just pay the rent. Like, like how can you,

138
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.690
everybody's buying it, selling weed on credit cards and you can't pay your rent.

139
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.890
How did I end up with this gun loser?

140
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.650
People are flying here to get some weed. Yeah. They tour,

141
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.840
they tour tourism and my guy, nothing, you know,

142
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.210
really took it on the fucking Chin is Amsterdam.

143
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.410
Remember when people are talking about going to Amsterdam,

144
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.640
let's go to HIMSS dam to get high. Yeah. They can get high here. Stupid. Right?

145
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.440
Nobody's [inaudible] windows though. That's true. They still got that.

146
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.370
That's true, but been there before you, if you could just see the line of,

147
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.050
if you see a video montage of all the guys coming into this school, you're like,

148
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.920
oh, oh, oh just over the last couple of weeks.

149
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.020
Joe just ruined Amsterdam tourism. Yeah. Amsterdam tourist board is like,

150
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.380
why is he picking on us? What did we do? Well they have good fights over there,

151
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.430
but they fucked up when they made mushrooms illegal. They, they,

152
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:31.890
they stopped people from selling mushrooms and the cafes.

153
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.220
Now is that because it is, why would they do,

154
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.070
I don't understand why they would do that cause I was wanting to say it's doors

155
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.390
they can regulate, but no, it's dorks go over there and blow their brains out.

156
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.230
They eat too many mushrooms and freak out and try to jump in the river and you

157
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.970
know, that's what it is. It's dorks. It's always dorks. They ruin everything.

158
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.980
Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's one of those, it's weird.

159
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:57.690
It's weird to me cause it's like, listen,

160
00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:02.430
if you can hit get a handle on your drug tourism, you know, just don't do it.

161
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:04.770
But I don't know. It can be done correctly.

162
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.140
I think if you want to do drug tours and correctly, first of all,

163
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:09.150
you need to check people, make sure they're okay,

164
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:12.240
find out what kind of medication they are and like do a blood test on them.

165
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.060
Find out what kind of medication. Oh look, you're on SSRI.

166
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.850
He didn't even tell us, hey stupid, you're not supposed to take this stuff.

167
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.410
This is gonna fuck you up next. You know, and, and really, really test them.

168
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.310
Then, you know,

169
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:27.510
find out about their psychological history and start them off with a nice light

170
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:31.260
dose today. Today's Tuesday, today we're going to give a nice light dose,

171
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.860
like a half a gram. We're just going to say that you react. That would be it.

172
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:39.420
Just, just, you know, this is how much you get in. See how you react.

173
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.670
Exactly. And then, then come back on Wednesday. Right?

174
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.190
You think about it for 24 hours.

175
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.400
You come back on Wednesday and Wednesday we're going to give you two grams.

176
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.310
Yeah. And then we go, got to cut you off. Yeah.

177
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.210
And then you come back on Saturday and you get that five grand.

178
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:59.803
<v 3>Oh</v>

179
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.070
<v 1>yeah. Just do it right with doctors nearby and ivs filled with vitamins.</v>

180
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.640
I'm sure that's why they don't because who's going to pay for all of that part

181
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.010
to works, you know, the same door

182
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.840
they would pay if you had like a,

183
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:20.841
if you could save up your money and have like a real safe mushroom trip,

184
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.710
like a legit safe mushroom trip at a medical institution where they've got

185
00:11:25.711 --> 00:11:30.180
everything locked down and everybody's safe and the mushrooms are safe and yeah,

186
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:32.040
people would pay a few hundred bucks for that.

187
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.060
But I haven't done mushrooms but would that, no, you want to try it? No, no.

188
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:40.230
Thanks man. I'm retired man. You know that from everything. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

189
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.730
yeah. We talked about this like when did you retire? Uh, 88 oh yeah.

190
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.350
That's crazy. Yeah. I mean, you know, itch. No, no, I, you know,

191
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.350
I've been high enough that I don't feel like I'm missing anything.

192
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.880
So when you talk about it, it's like fascinating to me. But then,

193
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.580
but then there's also that case of like, now, like I don't want to be that high,

194
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.150
you know what I mean? But, and again, I don't knock what anyone else does,

195
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:05.710
but this is what I wanted to ask you.

196
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.970
If you did it under those medically supervised conditions,

197
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:13.690
would it still be as much fun? Yeah. It's fun no matter what.

198
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.540
As long as they leave you alone while you're tripping. Yeah.

199
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.800
Long as they don't bother you, you know? Okay. I mean, I, like I say,

200
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:25.780
I have no idea. I have no frame of reference, so I can't say like,

201
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:29.200
that would be, you know, not be cool or whatever. I don't know.

202
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.240
Fuck with CBD at all now and good for you and it doesn't get you high. Yeah,

203
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:36.810
I know. And I don't, again, I don't knock it.

204
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.940
I don't necessarily have a reason to fuck with CBD.

205
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:44.590
I'm not in like any kind of pain or anything like that or any, you know, uh,

206
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.600
but I don't knock it as a treatment.

207
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:49.270
I know it does work and there's benefits to it.

208
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:53.400
It's just not something you need that I need or that I do, you know? Um,

209
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.200
it's like the knees, right? The need, my knees are kinda trashed,

210
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.000
but when I work out and stretch and warm them up, they're not, it's not bad.

211
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:02.770
And I've talked to doctor and doctor like, yeah,

212
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.350
eventually we're going to do a knee replacement, but you don't need it now.

213
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.340
What's going on with your knees? Arthritis. Just, you know,

214
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:12.460
you don't have to do a knee replacement. Yeah. Stem, stem cells,

215
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.730
which is something I may do. I know,

216
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:19.570
I've heard you talk about it and that might be the way it, a matter of fact,

217
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:22.900
I have a friend, um, and she's like in her,

218
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.170
she's around 80 and she said, yeah, that's what they did for her knee.

219
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:26.950
They did stem.

220
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.240
So my mom had her knees replaced before she passed away and she said, yeah,

221
00:13:31.241 --> 00:13:34.900
that's one of the things you inherited from us. Bad knees. It's like in the fan.

222
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:37.360
I was like, thank you. But, but she also made me funny,

223
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:39.670
so I couldn't really be mad at her. She had great. And I was like, all right,

224
00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:43.270
I'll take the funny and the bad knees I had the bad knees are workable. Yeah,

225
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.780
I'm telling you it CBD first of all is going to help that because it reduces

226
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:50.290
the, all the symptoms of arthritis. Like Day Foley, he,

227
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:54.010
his hands were fucked up. He had like some severe arthritis in his hands.

228
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.340
CBD completely cured it. He crew straightened his hands out.

229
00:13:57.341 --> 00:13:59.680
His hands were always at like a slight bend and now,

230
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.280
now he's got a full range of motion in his hands. He's blown away by it. Yeah.

231
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.170
My knee problem is impact, you know, just ball or basketball. Basketball. Yeah.

232
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.460
So even [inaudible] and all that stuff, that's all trashed. So even now,

233
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.720
like I can do most, like I can't jump, you know, I can run, I can do.

234
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.280
So I did this crossfit,

235
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:22.640
I tried crossfit and my knee swole up and I went to my doctor. If he's like,

236
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.390
cross, what the Hell is wrong? You jumping up on boxes. My, my,

237
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.890
uh, my doctor's diagnosis for 90% of my problems. You're old.

238
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.930
Don't do that, man. You can,

239
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.190
you can fix a lot of those problems with stem cells. A lot of those problems.

240
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:45.230
Yeah, it regenerates tissue, reduces inflammation.

241
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.970
It does a lot of amazing stuff now. And I haven't researched this at all.

242
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:52.250
I mean, you know, I've heard stuff up. My, my stem cell knowledge

243
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.230
<v 2>is about equal to my climate change.</v>

244
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.240
Well mine is slightly better cause I've, I've actually had a bunch done on me.

245
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.710
Well this is what I wanted to ask you about.

246
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:04.430
So I know when you talked about it early on, you went overseas, right?

247
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:06.700
You left the no, no, you did get it done here.

248
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.030
So that was my question because I've heard people talking about going to Panama,

249
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:16.040
Panama and Asia, et Cetera, that you don't think you want to go to Asia. Yeah,

250
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.800
they're doing over there. But Dr Riordan,

251
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:21.740
who's the guy who treated Mel Gibson and Mel Gibson's Dad,

252
00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:26.720
he actually treated my mom. My mom was in risk of a knee replacement. You know,

253
00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:30.440
she's in pretty, you know, pretty bad pain and the doctor's like,

254
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.060
you got to get a knee replacement. I'm like, okay,

255
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.480
maybe you have to get a knee replacement. I go, but before you do that,

256
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:37.310
let's send you to Panama. And they'll,

257
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:42.200
they'll do this full three day stem cell procedure. They use ivy stem cells.

258
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.740
They, they, they blast the area over three different days.

259
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:47.900
They hit it with stem cells and you know,

260
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:52.901
my mom is 73 so it was a while before it worked.

261
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.380
She, you know, for the first four months she was a little discouraged. She like,

262
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.430
I don't feel anything different and I don't know if this is working.

263
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.280
And then somewhere around five, six months,

264
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:08.300
she started feeling a lack of pain and the pain just start stopped.

265
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.670
It just stopped being like a part of her daily life.

266
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.730
And then now she could walk and it's not bothering her. She goes,

267
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:17.300
I'm walking with no pain. I can walk up hills with no pain. And she goes,

268
00:16:17.301 --> 00:16:20.030
I want to do it again. So I was like, fuck that. Let's send you down again.

269
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.740
So she's, she's headed down again to get more of it. But you did it here. Yeah,

270
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:28.880
I did it here. Well, I think, no. Is there a difference? Yes, they can.

271
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:31.790
They can go ham in Panama, they go ham,

272
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.500
they just fucking it fill you up. They just bring a fucking bucket of stem.

273
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.160
Sorry, big ass needle. There's,

274
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.110
they don't have the same regulations that they do in America,

275
00:16:42.111 --> 00:16:45.050
so they can get away with a lot of different stuff. And Dr Riordan,

276
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.620
who is one of the pioneers of this and he's written multiple papers and he has,

277
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.330
uh, you know, scientific journals all about the benefits of stem cells.

278
00:16:56.331 --> 00:17:00.410
And it's particularly effective on people with neurological conditions,

279
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.980
people with neurodegenerative diseases of like,

280
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.850
and he's written extensively about all that stuff. But when he came on, I mean,

281
00:17:07.851 --> 00:17:08.231
he,

282
00:17:08.231 --> 00:17:13.130
he blew me away and I had already had some success with stem cells in America

283
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:14.330
where like,

284
00:17:14.331 --> 00:17:19.120
I had a full length rotator cuff tear in my shoulder and they, uh,

285
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.690
injected it with exosomes,

286
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:24.840
which is like the most advanced form of stem. So they used to,

287
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.500
there was the ways they used to think is stem cells.

288
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:30.020
They felt like when you put stem cells into an injury,

289
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.320
that the stem cells were re proliferating this area with new tissue,

290
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.550
but now they think that the stem cells,

291
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.940
I'm sure I'm butchering butchering this if you're a scientist now,

292
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:44.150
I think they think that the stem cells are releasing exosomes and that the

293
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.890
access songs are actually with does it,

294
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:50.400
so now they just go straight to access homes and then they inject

295
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.650
<v 1>exosomes into these particular areas.</v>

296
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.240
Now they have another product called Wharton's jelly that's even more potent

297
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.200
than I, I just got shot into me. My name is Sam. I get an injured man.

298
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:02.940
I just fucking head on down. I'm like,

299
00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:06.020
what's the purpose of having money if I'm not fucking shooting myself up?

300
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.440
You go juicy stem cells. Here you go. But it works. If I got stem cell cash,

301
00:18:10.441 --> 00:18:15.090
I probably do. You do that, but it's not that. Yeah, you're successful. I'm no,

302
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:18.300
I do medium list, like an Amazon special. No, I do Alonzo, but listen,

303
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.770
I do all right. I tell people I do. I don't make as much as they think,

304
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.570
but I do. All right. You know what I mean? Kids?

305
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.430
Cause like when people see you on something they like,

306
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:30.990
oh well you got $10 million. Like, no I don't. I'd like to, but I don't.

307
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.170
But uh, but yeah, so, okay, well we'll talk about that then we'll talk about,

308
00:18:35.171 --> 00:18:39.990
I was on special, my push the top. I hope so. You know it, I mean, you know me,

309
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:42.630
I've been in the Biz forever. I loved the Biz. I loved the, I loved the,

310
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.960
I appreciate the love you give me on the podcast.

311
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:48.750
People always tell me when you are some gift. Oh yeah man,

312
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:52.740
they were talking about you. You know, and I, and I appreciate that. Right. Um,

313
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.850
krs one said long time ago, respect will outlast cash, you know,

314
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.230
so I appreciate that and I appreciate you too, man. But, um, yeah,

315
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:03.840
it'd be nice to have something blow up like that, right?

316
00:19:03.841 --> 00:19:08.100
I think you can so many times that it happens in careers. So, uh,

317
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.030
well they're doing a lot of specials now. They got, Gaffigan is doing Amazon,

318
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.360
a Russell Peters doing an Amazon. You, who else?

319
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.910
Someone Jimmy o Yang's got one. Yes,

320
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.140
coming up Amazon theme man, why does he have an Amazon?

321
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.390
But there's a lot of like really funny people that are doing it and as long as

322
00:19:27.391 --> 00:19:30.480
they put the money into promotion and let people know, I mean they're,

323
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.390
they're doing great right now with the Marvelous Mrs Maizel.

324
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.030
They have a lot of new Amazon prime series like that.

325
00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:37.680
Fleabag is supposed to be hilarious.

326
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.680
They have a lot of good series that they're promoting that people are really

327
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:43.800
getting into. And if you have Amazon prime, like if you order shit with Amazon,

328
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:47.430
you get free, you get free Amazon TV, TV. Yeah. People don't even know that.

329
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.320
I know. I know. And it's good. Yeah. Amazon is legit. Good.

330
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.510
Super. Yeah. So I'm rooting for them 100% yeah. And there's,

331
00:19:57.511 --> 00:19:59.820
you know, look, Netflix has almost,

332
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:06.000
I mean they've got the market kind of cornered until Amazon came along cause

333
00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:09.240
nobody wanted to do in Montgomery central anymore. Comedy central is great.

334
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.640
It's better than no special, but it airs once.

335
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.300
That's the problem with comedy central years once and then it's not in this day

336
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:19.710
and age, man. I think a, I think HBO is still the Big One, you know,

337
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.020
as far as television. Yeah. Television. Yeah. As far as the TV, one hour like h,

338
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.130
but showtime was good to me. Show time. Um, put on a couple of specials.

339
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.890
We'll show time made Sebastian oh, big guns made. Sebastian,

340
00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.120
he just clicked with [inaudible] with the width. And it's,

341
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.830
it's funny how that happens cause you really can't say why. Yeah.

342
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.930
You know that certain ones do. And that's no disrespect to Sebastian.

343
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:50.890
It's just, yeah, certain things take off and others don't. And it's like, well,

344
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.950
I mean it was really good. I mean, oh yeah. No. Like I say,

345
00:20:53.951 --> 00:20:58.810
no disrespect to them. No Sebastian, he's a great comic. He's, he's been round,

346
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:02.470
he's worked, you know what I mean? It's not like he just fell out of the sky,

347
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:06.280
got a special and didn't have anything behind it. Now the guy's a comic.

348
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:10.720
He's real for him. Who? Well, you know who blew off on showtime? Gallagher.

349
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.290
He might be the last guy that blew up on showtime before Sebastian. Right.

350
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.690
I mean, he's stop and think about it. Yeah. When, who the fuck else?

351
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.530
It's like Sebastian and Gallagher is the guys who blew up on showtime.

352
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.840
Let me think who else. Yeah, that's a comedy wise.

353
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.190
Dana Gould had a special on showtime. Who else? What should they did?

354
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:40.300
Showtime did a few, like a Billy Gardell had the new comics thing he did.

355
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.870
He tried to break some new comics on that Rodney Dangerfield type deal.

356
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.360
And um, but yeah, you're right. Yeah. But again,

357
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.920
that's where, that's where our business, like this business is fickle, right?

358
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:58.090
Cause they're always trying to figure out, you know, why is this a viral video?

359
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:01.570
You know what I mean? Like, like man, that squirrel got more views.

360
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:08.370
We spent $8 million producing this series and that squirrel got more views than

361
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:11.440
we, you know, and it's like, why?

362
00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:14.220
Yeah.

363
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.870
If you're just trying to concentrate on making things viral and you will go

364
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:21.190
fucking crazy. Yeah. You can't figure out, you know, why people are,

365
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.500
are connect to this one thing and even though others have done it or done

366
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:30.160
something similar or whatever, and then yeah,

367
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:33.640
it's a tricky fucking business. And then how about youtube?

368
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:37.210
Like Russell Peters blew up because of Youtube. Absolutely.

369
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.830
Worldwide. Boom, boom. Unbelief. And you know people,

370
00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:43.170
and it's funny cause people here,

371
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.100
they don't realize how famous Russell is because he's not that famous.

372
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.340
He's not as famous here now he can hang out over here,

373
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.090
he'd go places and he lives here. It's like got the best of both worlds.

374
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.330
Cause that mother fucker sold out the o two arena, two nights in a run.

375
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:02.740
I know that's like 20,000 plus people. You know who's like that? Uh,

376
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.980
Jimmy Carr, you know, general shore. Yeah. He's hilarious. Yeah.

377
00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:10.360
Jimmy's hilarious. And like internationally, Jimmy is a monster.

378
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:15.130
Unbelievable. But here like they check his id, you know,

379
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.610
like he pull out the black card and they'd be like, let me see your Id.

380
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:25.420
Yeah. I mean he does the roast, uh, those roadshows shows over here.

381
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:29.210
Yeah. And stuff along those lines. But yeah, he doesn't have Neal,

382
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.350
but he's working here more often. He's developing. He,

383
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.300
I saw him in Montreal and he said, yeah,

384
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:37.240
he's developing his audience in a state.

385
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:40.120
So now he's doing like small theaters here. He says,

386
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:43.360
obviously if he goes anywhere where people from the UK are like,

387
00:23:43.361 --> 00:23:46.040
so when he's in a big city and there's a lot of Brits,

388
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.120
then he can sell out like New York or Boston or something like that. Yeah,

389
00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:54.830
he's a great writer. Oh Man, that guy's funny. Sharp. Just, yeah. And so,

390
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.840
so British like so dry and completely inappropriate. Yes.

391
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.710
You know, that's what I love about him. We do in, in Montreal,

392
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:08.060
we do this a benefit show for hope and cope and it's like a, a,

393
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.490
um, rehab medical facility. You know,

394
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.780
there's some cancer patients in there and people other and,

395
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.080
and Jimmy just opens like, yeah, I've got to hurry up and don't have much time.

396
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.790
Well, I have time.

397
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.070
I was just [inaudible] Joe. And they loved it. They, they just,

398
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.380
they fell out, you know, and he's, he's like, uh, any of you here last year now?

399
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:36.350
Probably not. Anyway, at this point,

400
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:39.650
most comics go to Montreal to hang out with other comics. Oh, absolutely.

401
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:43.010
We call it summer camp man. You see your, you know, yeah.

402
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:48.011
You see friends and like I see him there every summer and then you see people

403
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:52.760
who you just don't see or don't bump into, you know,

404
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.150
regularly and your regular whatever and you get to hang out.

405
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.370
And then there's always new people you meet.

406
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:03.050
Like this year I met Nick Kroll who was cool. He's grand a, you know,

407
00:25:03.051 --> 00:25:06.890
cause I liked big mouth. It is a cartoon. And um,

408
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.690
Pete Holmes and Pete Holmes was hilarious cause he was doing this thing at the

409
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:16.220
roasts called mean Pete. So he was doing like a completely different cat kids.

410
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.480
You know, Pete Holmes, a nice guy.

411
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.350
And he was at the roast just destroying people and he just kept yelling at me

412
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:24.530
and Pete, you know, so, but, but yeah, so that kind of stuff. Yeah,

413
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:29.210
it's fun man. It just to a forever meeting. Well that was the first time,

414
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.840
I don't know if you remember, I definitely wrote,

415
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.690
it's the first time you and me hung out. When was that? Yeah, it was,

416
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:40.640
it was him or old. Yeah. So it was 99.

417
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:43.850
It was my second time in Montreal. Right. I'm doing comedy.

418
00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:47.960
I don't know about six years. So I'm still like new, like I buck.

419
00:25:47.961 --> 00:25:50.240
But I knew you from the um,

420
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.860
from laugh factory in from around town and you were hanging out with Kevin James

421
00:25:54.861 --> 00:25:59.030
and I think he had just got his show or just finished his first year of his show

422
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.500
or whatever. And you were like, come on.

423
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:04.670
And I jumped in a cab and we went around doing spots and I'm like,

424
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.350
and you would be, you'd already been on news radio and I, and I'm like fuck,

425
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:12.060
I'm hanging out with Joe and kept like we're doing spots like you.

426
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.600
You know what I mean? Like as a new comic, you're like Holy Shit,

427
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.940
just the coolest shit cause cause I,

428
00:26:16.941 --> 00:26:20.390
I could get in cause I got out the cab with youtube. So they're like, yeah,

429
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.020
yeah, you can do five. So that I remember, I still remember that. That was fun.

430
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:28.100
But that's what Montreal is. So now I'm that guy right now I,

431
00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:29.360
I've been to Montreal so much.

432
00:26:29.361 --> 00:26:32.650
I got people calling me in La asking me about Montreal left.

433
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.770
They told us to call you.

434
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:38.840
I had Chris Spencer calling me to get spots on shows and I was like, Chris,

435
00:26:38.841 --> 00:26:41.210
I don't book it. He's like, yeah, but you know, you know,

436
00:26:41.211 --> 00:26:45.030
and then I was able to get him a spot, I guess. I do know, I guess it works.

437
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.360
Yeah. But the problem is that you get into, if it works, once you know,

438
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.570
then you're the guy they call. Yeah, that's a, listen,

439
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:54.750
if you're listening to this podcast, no, I can't help you.

440
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.890
Did they still have a bunch of different venues?

441
00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.140
We can drive around and get spots? Not none, not as much.

442
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.730
Everything's booked now. You know,

443
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.400
you know the big difference now there's a lot more TV.

444
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:10.500
Like remember back then there were like two or three people had hours, you know,

445
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:14.670
not men. Now there's like a whole series of one hours that they're taping.

446
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:15.540
And then um, you know,

447
00:27:15.541 --> 00:27:19.560
like Kevin Hart did the whole lol thing there for a couple of years.

448
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:22.380
So he was taping all of that. So there's a lot more.

449
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.600
TV is more involved. This year there wasn't a whole lot of Netflix.

450
00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.510
The last two years there was a ton of Netflix and Netflix was doing a bunch of

451
00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:34.470
half hours and stuff. They were filming them at the festival.

452
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.580
So it's weird to me. It seems like the festivals supposed to be fun.

453
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.360
It's not supposed to like film us. I think it's still fun in that,

454
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:45.150
like you said, you see other comics and you get to hang out,

455
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.040
but there's um, there's not the,

456
00:27:49.041 --> 00:27:53.070
the development business that they're used to be right. That's not there.

457
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.910
But the content business is there and they figure like,

458
00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.920
we got all these comics in one place,

459
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.840
we'll set up cameras and we'll shoot bang, Bang, Bang, Bang.

460
00:28:03.841 --> 00:28:06.990
I think that's so, so there's less of the,

461
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.200
there's still some shows where you could just, you know,

462
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.980
jump on and it's friends of whoever and the midnight shows, they still do that.

463
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:17.880
They have like a whole midnight when they could midnight surprise or whatever.

464
00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:20.910
You don't even know who's on the show. And that day they call people like, Hey,

465
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:24.690
you want to do a spot? And they still have the nasty shelf. They still do.

466
00:28:24.691 --> 00:28:27.000
Nasty show is still huge. They do.

467
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.180
They do the ethnic show now remember they used to be, that's what they call it.

468
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.230
Well they used to be like the wise guys was the Italian show. Right.

469
00:28:34.231 --> 00:28:37.740
And then they had the Jewish show and then they had the uptown was a black show

470
00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:38.430
and this and that.

471
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.810
Well now they've combined all of that and they call it the ethnic show and they

472
00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:43.830
have built,

473
00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:47.100
so there'll be just different comics on there from different ethnic groups.

474
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.390
I've hosted it a couple of times.

475
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:52.110
It's a lot of fun actually to do ethnic material. No,

476
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.150
some you do some, some people do some, some don't. I think my favorite one,

477
00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.960
one year I was hosting it, Nadelman was on it. Dan Adelman,

478
00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:04.710
who you know [inaudible] he hilarious guy and he was like, yeah, ethnic. Yeah,

479
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.590
I'm a Jewish comic from New York. That's such a rare find.

480
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.110
Ethnic is a weird word to mean, isn't everybody ethnic? Yeah, but,

481
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.930
but it's there, you know, it's the right title for catchall.

482
00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:23.580
And also the other big thing is Canada. It's not as,

483
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.350
they're not as hung up on it. Right.

484
00:29:25.351 --> 00:29:29.460
So you're not as worried about being politically correct or,

485
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:33.540
or hurting someone's feel. You know what I mean? Like they understand, yeah,

486
00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:37.830
this is a comedy festival and people are gonna say shit that is inappropriate

487
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:42.610
and, and do, and, and being friends, you know,

488
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.490
can't we make fun of each other? Right. And it's so, yes.

489
00:29:46.491 --> 00:29:48.190
So your ethnic group may come into it,

490
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:52.450
but not from a point of racism or hatred or judgment. Just,

491
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.480
it's fucking funny that we're the same or different in our ethnicity or in our

492
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:01.810
background and weaken. We joke about it.

493
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:07.350
Does a comedy works exist anymore up there when undirect unfortunately to works

494
00:30:08.201 --> 00:30:12.190
went under, um, Jimbo take off. Yeah. Vanish somewhere.

495
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.810
I don't know what happened to Jimbo. I don't know.

496
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.300
I'm not sure what happened to him, but it was great. That club was,

497
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:22.750
that was the epitome of comedy, right? Yeah. You go upstairs,

498
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.510
there's 150 people in a 120 seat room isn't even that many.

499
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:32.140
It was 120 seats and, and the Fire Marshall would've shut it down every night.

500
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.540
Right. Cause if there was a fire in comedy works,

501
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.390
it would've been a horrible tragedy. And you know, but,

502
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.550
but the energy was like, you get on that stage and just kill and you know,

503
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:44.170
it's like, yeah, we got the Gallo over here,

504
00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:48.850
we got 3000 seats in the most beautiful theater you can imagine.

505
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:53.500
But you really want to see the, you really want to have fun. Go upstairs.

506
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.820
The comedy works in sweat.

507
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.020
You're literally sweating for 15 minutes because there's no air conditioning.

508
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.460
It was terrible. Worked heat rises. So we should put this place upstairs.

509
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.230
Well,

510
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.650
when they wanted to stay warm in the winter and they have like a little comedy

511
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:11.440
scene, like a local scene. Yeah. And they still have,

512
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:14.740
they still have some places. Like there was one I was working,

513
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.770
I can't remember the name of it, but it was the same kind of vibe.

514
00:31:17.771 --> 00:31:22.270
It was like an upstairs bar that they converted for the, for the festival.

515
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:25.390
They put in a hundred chairs and you, you know,

516
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:28.660
and it was great and that's where they were doing midnight surprise. So that,

517
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.710
that venue is still really cool. And then they had the theater Saint Catherine,

518
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:37.210
which is like this small stage in a long room. Yeah, I did that one man,

519
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.840
that, that one still has, you know, so,

520
00:31:39.841 --> 00:31:44.841
so there are still some places that have that funky comedy vibe.

521
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.670
I mean, you know, but that comedy works room as it still there.

522
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.000
Could somebody like turn? I don't know. I have no idea if it's,

523
00:31:52.001 --> 00:31:54.850
if it's there up, it's been redeveloped but yet works was,

524
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.610
that was the shit that was the great, that was the fun room.

525
00:31:57.611 --> 00:32:00.970
That was where you ran your set before you do your, you know,

526
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.930
Gallo or TV taping or whatever and it would just kill cracklin those,

527
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:09.070
the first time I ever saw Lenny Shoultz give us he crazy wedding, you know,

528
00:32:09.071 --> 00:32:13.630
crazy Lenny. No, he was a hilarious guy. That was right when I was coming up.

529
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:18.280
He was just at the end of his run and of his career and he says wild,

530
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:21.070
crazy old man who would bring props on stage.

531
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.140
Attitude was like so fun. Just a maniac.

532
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.120
Like he w he would pull up a a s you know a smokey the bear doll and he's like,

533
00:32:31.121 --> 00:32:34.750
only you can prevent forest fires. And he just yells,

534
00:32:34.751 --> 00:32:39.740
fuck you punches his bear the face. It didn't make sense.

535
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.360
And I'm papers though. So stupid. You're fucking holding your body.

536
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:49.010
You couldn't even stop laughing. My, my favorite random funny thing like that,

537
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:52.910
there's a guy still touring as far as I know in Canada called Mel silverback

538
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.230
ever hear melts, silverback belts, silverback half Jew,

539
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.300
half silver back mountain gorilla.

540
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.280
And he would wear the Tuxedo with the big ruffled shirt like the old Catskills

541
00:33:04.281 --> 00:33:09.020
comics and he wore gorilla hands and a gorilla head. I'm telling you.

542
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.730
And he would these old Catskills Thai style jokes,

543
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.390
that gorilla mask. Oh man, Joe, we, we,

544
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.230
he auditioned for last comic when I was a judge. We were falling out.

545
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.760
Jane Goodall, she's a whole, you should have seen her with those chimps.

546
00:33:25.761 --> 00:33:27.110
It was disgusting. Like,

547
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.070
and apparently he's a thing in Canada,

548
00:33:31.071 --> 00:33:35.270
like he's a late night dirty comic towards Canada. But,

549
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.690
but it was the dumbest thing. But to see it,

550
00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:42.020
I mean we were pounding on the table, we could not breathe cause he's,

551
00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:46.670
it was all old cheap one-liners like the Catskills.

552
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.930
And he had the suit and,

553
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.520
and he was a gorilla and he would put it all in.

554
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.660
So it was all from a super back mountain gorilla point of view. Like,

555
00:33:56.661 --> 00:34:01.460
what's your point of view? Silverback mountain gorilla is how I see the world.

556
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.290
But the good thing about that act too,

557
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.540
it's like he could die and somebody could just take us. Yeah.

558
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.540
Somebody could take over, you know, and,

559
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:10.520
and the thing was we picked him for last comic, right.

560
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.260
But then this is where TV kills comedy. So now he's on prime time,

561
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:17.360
NBC and he can't do that.

562
00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:21.830
Like you can't say she's a whore and you can't do everything that made him

563
00:34:21.831 --> 00:34:25.610
funny, was like, no, the sensors won't allow it. So now people are like,

564
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:30.350
why is he wearing gorilla hands? Yeah. It just sucks. Yeah.

565
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:35.540
TV just rip like [inaudible]. Let me see what makes you funny. Okay,

566
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:40.370
let's not do that. Do you remember Gallagher Two? Yeah. Yeah. Remember his,

567
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:42.440
that brother, you couldn't afford Gallagher,

568
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:47.330
so he was doing giant theaters and Gallagher too.

569
00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.660
His brother was doing like little comedy clubs. Yeah. Like he,

570
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.770
I would see it like in places that I was working and I was coming up,

571
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.040
it would be like, oh, and then next weekend it's Gallagher too. I'm like,

572
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.160
what's calorie? Do they get into a fight?

573
00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:05.630
Like a legal fight over ownership of cars. Gallagher wanted to come back. Yeah.

574
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.340
See Gallagher apparently like temporarily retired and he sold his act to his

575
00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:13.520
brother Gallagher. And his brother looked

576
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:19.520
as brother, looked a lot like him. And he had, you know, he just basically it,

577
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.690
he picked up like a job. It's like I have an affiliate or like a, you know,

578
00:35:23.691 --> 00:35:28.280
like a, like syndication. You syndicated the act, you know, if you,

579
00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.360
if you want to buy a seven 11 yeah. Well it's like the blue man group,

580
00:35:32.361 --> 00:35:36.210
like this different blue man groups right around the country. Yeah. Yeah,

581
00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.930
that's true. But there's no, like it was a blue man.

582
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:41.760
It was just one blue man.

583
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:46.790
Maybe that would be but so gallers Gallagher's brother took all the jokes and

584
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:51.060
the props and started buying watermelons and sledgehammers and just toured the

585
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:51.894
country.

586
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:56.970
I would love to be in court when they had that fight. Like your honor,

587
00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:01.910
here's how I smash a watermelon and then is my brother eyes special water like I

588
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.761
be, you decide.

589
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:06.360
I think it was just a matter of whether or not he could continue to do the act.

590
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.620
But I mean is it his last name? Gallagher? Is it a real name? So it is.

591
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.690
Leo was the original and Ron is the brother, but they look,

592
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.680
then they go on to Gallagher. Right.

593
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.310
It's like if a girl breaks up with you and you fuck are slightly less good

594
00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:24.090
looking sister. I don't know if this is right quite. Yeah.

595
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.480
I think right here is the original original.

596
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:32.240
This picture here would be the brother, isn't he? Sure I picked up this.

597
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.050
Wow. That is, yeah.

598
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:39.110
I wouldn't want to be the judge cause I the ballot of Ron Gallagher blog afoot.

599
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.790
It's must someone must read the story about it, but wow. So yeah, they,

600
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:49.530
it was close enough so you would kind of feel the brothers is Gallagher.

601
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.880
How weird. And so then after a while,

602
00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:58.380
I think Gallagher got tired of being retired and he said,

603
00:36:58.381 --> 00:37:00.180
I'm coming back. And his brother's like, well,

604
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:02.760
I'm fucking going to continue doing this act. And he's like, no,

605
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:06.250
you're not bitch. You gonna have to find a new way to make a living. But I only,

606
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.610
I bought it from you. Right. So I own it though.

607
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.170
Like you being in your probably forties and your brother who's like,

608
00:37:13.171 --> 00:37:17.940
if a similar age just picks up comedy and just starts doing your routine like

609
00:37:17.941 --> 00:37:22.200
100% you know, he calls himself Alonzo too. Yeah.

610
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.900
That's crazy. Well, I'm, Charlie Murphy could have done that.

611
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.100
Right? He sounded enough like Eddie that he,

612
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.180
he could, I mean, not, no, no, no, he wouldn't.

613
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:41.210
But what I'm saying is he could have done it pigging back.

614
00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.820
Piggy back to Eddie. But that's such a different way of talking. Yeah.

615
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.890
I mean his, his way of talking was so much more aggressive. Raspy.

616
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.930
Yeah. I missed that dude. Yeah. I had a good fucking time with him, man.

617
00:37:54.931 --> 00:37:59.580
We did a whole tour of the country for 30 days. Oh, nice. Him and Heffron.

618
00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:03.000
Oh yeah, yeah. We just maxim bud light tour.

619
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.600
When you remember what those a, the real men of Bud light,

620
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.130
the what they would sing the real man,

621
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.580
the guy who was commercials. Yeah.

622
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.530
The Guy who sang was the lead singer of survivor.

623
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:20.490
The eye of the tiger guy. Oh yeah. Yeah. So we were on tour with those guys.

624
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:24.150
So those guys would sing songs and they had like little punchlines they would do

625
00:38:24.151 --> 00:38:26.970
with the songs and they would have a local guy,

626
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.830
which is actually how I met Thompson girl.

627
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.030
I met Thompson girl because we were doing the Hollywood theater or celebrity

628
00:38:33.031 --> 00:38:36.340
theater, whatever it is in Phoenix. And uh, Segura

629
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.520
<v 2>was the opening act, the local opening act,</v>

630
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.370
flown them in and I think he did like five or 10 minutes and he was hilarious.

631
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.950
That's how I became buddies with them and start taking them on the road with me.

632
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:46.390
But then you know,

633
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:50.980
there'd be the real American hero guys and then it would be half fron and then

634
00:38:50.981 --> 00:38:55.960
trolley and me and we did 22 dates over a month. We had a great fucking time.

635
00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:00.650
<v 1>I only met him once, but he was real cool. I met him in Vegas and I'm just,</v>

636
00:39:00.651 --> 00:39:02.530
you know, one of those, we were,

637
00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.440
it was a dirty at 1230 and we were doing it dirty and he came by and we just,

638
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.020
you know, just hung out backstage. Met Him for a minute. But yeah,

639
00:39:09.021 --> 00:39:12.800
he seemed cool. Couldn't be cool. That was maybe a year or a year,

640
00:39:12.801 --> 00:39:14.960
maybe two years at most before he passed away.

641
00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.870
<v 2>Podcasts in the early, early, early days. We always talked about doing it again,</v>

642
00:39:21.871 --> 00:39:22.860
but it never did it again.

643
00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:25.200
But he had some great fucking stories about Mike Tyson,

644
00:39:25.201 --> 00:39:29.010
but visiting Mike Tyson and Mike Tyson was outside with a tiger and nobody

645
00:39:29.011 --> 00:39:29.844
wanted to get out of the lip.

646
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:36.970
<v 1>Well, you know that the tragic thing about comics, right, is when a comic dies,</v>

647
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:40.930
his act dies with them, you know? Whereas singers,

648
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.170
somebody else will sing the songs. I didn't. But when a comic goes,

649
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:48.590
so when you have some like Patrice, you know, like that's all gone like that,

650
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.290
you know, and, and so many comics like, yeah, when they're gone,

651
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:58.600
that act is gone. And you, you remember it and it was hilarious, but nobody can,

652
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:00.760
you can't, nobody can do their act after that.

653
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:05.380
I think there was a guy that was doing a bill Hicks tribute show and he was

654
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:09.790
doing bill hex with all Bill Hicks material and he dressed like him.

655
00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:14.200
And how far did that go? It died that day. Yeah, exactly.

656
00:40:14.201 --> 00:40:15.760
See if you can find that. This is a,

657
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:20.590
I think they were trying to do that almost like someone trying to be like Mark

658
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:20.620
Twain.

659
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:25.620
Like you could do a Samuel Clemens one man show and read the works of Mark Twain

660
00:40:26.081 --> 00:40:29.650
with a goofy mustache on, right. Well, it's like in Vegas, the rat pack,

661
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.360
you know, they can do that, but it doesn't work with comedy. You could,

662
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:38.050
you could do the rat pack. You can't do don Rickles.

663
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.770
It just, you can't do it. You can't, yeah.

664
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.190
Vegas is a weird place for fucking impersonators, right.

665
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.200
That impersonator life.

666
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:52.240
I can't imagine it cause some of them are so deep into it. Like I,

667
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:57.550
we worked, um, you know, I do jazz cruises and uh, they do other crews.

668
00:40:57.551 --> 00:41:02.551
So they had an eighties crews and we had a Michael Jackson impersonator and this

669
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:07.120
guy stayed in character for the whole cruise to where you want to like, Yo man,

670
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:09.790
you know, you're not Michael Jack. Like, I mean,

671
00:41:09.791 --> 00:41:13.420
he was like getting off the ship in port, you know what I mean?

672
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:18.420
Like when you go to the shops or have lunch or with Michael Jackson,

673
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:24.580
the whole outfit. Outfit Glove. Yeah,

674
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:29.140
the hair, the makeup that, yeah, it was,

675
00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:34.100
it was weird. Like, and, and you know, it's kind of a strange talent,

676
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:38.610
right? To be like, yeah, I'm this person. So, so what,

677
00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.010
what if that person didn't exist? Who are you? What's your woo?

678
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:46.370
What's your thing? You know, and, and I heard the prince guy is like that.

679
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.941
I don't know,

680
00:41:46.941 --> 00:41:51.760
but I've heard that is a prince guy who had surgery to look more like prince.

681
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.930
Oh,

682
00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.160
there's a few Michael Jackson guys who had surgery look like Michael Jackson.

683
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:56.083
What do you got Jamie?

684
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:56.500
<v 4>Well,</v>

685
00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.100
first Google images is just changed this to this and my mic just fucked up.

686
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:02.800
So this stuff looks weird now, but uh, I found something,

687
00:42:02.801 --> 00:42:07.030
a show that was done about 10 years ago where a guy did a show called Bill

688
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.031
Hicks.

689
00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:11.620
Slight return where he didn't show as if Bill Hicks was still here 10 years

690
00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.600
after his death.

691
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.570
<v 1>Oh, with the like new material. The fuck out.</v>

692
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.910
It's even worse than way. I'm going to preach it.

693
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.290
I'm going to project what Bill Hicks would have thought of today's,

694
00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.780
how dare you world. Yeah. South London. Oh,

695
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:31.620
fucking London. Settle Down London. Stop trying.

696
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.590
That's what I need to get Alex Jones to be Bill Hicks.

697
00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:36.870
Give him a little more hair.

698
00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.050
I think that's the closest thing I could find out what you're talking about.

699
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.550
Oh 10 a couple of shows and maybe I read it wrong cause I could've swore there

700
00:42:44.551 --> 00:42:48.720
was a guy who was doing bill Hicks material. He was doing it again.

701
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:50.430
<v 5>Hmm?</v>

702
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.800
<v 1>What does that Bill Hicks, dark poet. Lower right.</v>

703
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:57.060
Is that actually Hicks in the lower right hand side? The Blue One? Keep going.

704
00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.160
Bang. What's that? Yeah, that's it.

705
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.183
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

706
00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.980
<v 1>That's not, yeah, that's not a hex. That's the guy that pretended to be Hicks.</v>

707
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.030
<v 4>Let's see. Yeah, that's the guy. That's just,</v>

708
00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:08.410
it's the same show I was telling you about.

709
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:12.470
<v 1>BARF. This show is, oh, libre is a ride.</v>

710
00:43:12.471 --> 00:43:15.620
But this show is a bumpy journey that chose death.

711
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.060
<v 4>Oh yeah. No, this is a different guy. Even</v>

712
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.180
<v 1>[inaudible] did a show called dark poet. Stop. Look, the way they dress,</v>

713
00:43:22.181 --> 00:43:26.200
everything. Stop. You're not from Texas. Shut your mouth. Go home.

714
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.350
Go home. You fuck. Write your own act. So I'm going to think about,

715
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.210
I'm going to go to Edinburgh and pretend to be bill Hicks and hope nobody here

716
00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:36.250
has ever actually seen him get some surgery.

717
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.050
Looked like the Michael Jackson people like you got to get fucked up. Surgeries.

718
00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:44.920
Yeah. Not Regular certs. You got to get like the fucked up Chin thing. It's a,

719
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.220
it's the weirdest, like again, like you say,

720
00:43:48.221 --> 00:43:52.330
to be an impersonator and now I Guess Queen is, you know,

721
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:56.920
like as they make these movies, right. So now people are gonna want to be,

722
00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:01.450
they want overnights. Yeah. I want to get an old gotta be mercury. Can you,

723
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:06.820
can you mess up these teeth? They probably have to wear fake teeth. Yeah. Body.

724
00:44:06.821 --> 00:44:11.670
Y'All are young. That's a crazy ass teeth. What a town.

725
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:16.300
He said. Yeah. It helped his boy that w that's what he said. You know,

726
00:44:16.301 --> 00:44:20.110
in the movie that he said he could sing at that range because of his shape of

727
00:44:20.111 --> 00:44:23.100
his mouth, which may be true. I don't know. I don't know how it,

728
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:26.200
how does he know? He didn't never say he's never had a different shape. Mouth.

729
00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.400
That's true. Yeah. Well, whatever it was, it worked. He's making lemonade.

730
00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:35.130
That's what it is. But you're right. Like that talent,

731
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.000
you know, that there is,

732
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:42.870
who's like that now that every bands like that now that you know,

733
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.130
because they just could, queen kept like, every song was different.

734
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:48.600
Like you knew it was queen,

735
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:51.990
but it was completely different than the last hit that they did.

736
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.910
That's what was crazy about it.

737
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.410
I think those bands that grew up with no internet,

738
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:02.250
they will forever be unique because it was a,

739
00:45:02.251 --> 00:45:07.251
it was a different world and the kind of creativity that it took to become those

740
00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:13.371
bands like the kind of creativity that it takes to become the WHO,

741
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.300
you know, like try today the world is like a different place. Like they,

742
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.840
they develop touring and like the Beatles,

743
00:45:21.841 --> 00:45:25.830
they develop touring and performing constantly and writing and,

744
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:29.100
and you know, I mean, sure, they were influenced by other bands,

745
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:32.870
but not nearly to the extent that people are today. Yeah.

746
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.160
And also they,

747
00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.760
there's kind of a conformity today to the marketing. Like,

748
00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:43.320
we want you to be this so we can sell it. You know, uh, I was playing earth,

749
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:46.800
wind and fire for somebody and it was one of their instrumentals.

750
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.720
And I told him, I said, well, you know, earth,

751
00:45:48.721 --> 00:45:52.140
wind and fire would also play jazz with Ramsey Lewis.

752
00:45:52.141 --> 00:45:55.320
Like they would the same musicians. And they were like, oh they said,

753
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.140
cause I saw them once and they were doing this whole jazz thing and I wondered

754
00:45:58.141 --> 00:46:02.160
what it was. And it was like, yeah, they were actual musician in a band. Like,

755
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.640
or can you imagine showing up now with a band like yeah, there's 27 of us.

756
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:10.230
We got a horn section. And in addition to that, they'd be like, what? No,

757
00:46:10.231 --> 00:46:12.630
like we're not paying for actual musicians.

758
00:46:12.631 --> 00:46:17.010
Like those bands had horn sections and rhythm section.

759
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.250
It was a lot of people. How did they make money in it? Well,

760
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.870
they charge a lot for tickets. Well, you know what else?

761
00:46:24.871 --> 00:46:29.200
Seven people on the stage records, right? Records were real records.

762
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.820
So records sales, like when you sold a million records,

763
00:46:32.821 --> 00:46:37.290
you made a lot of money from selling a million records and then you had,

764
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.030
you know, those bands like,

765
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:44.060
like I did one of these 80 things with war and the number blew my mind,

766
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:48.870
but then I realized that war sold over 50 million records.

767
00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.830
Oh, right. But then when you think about it, yeah,

768
00:46:52.831 --> 00:46:57.390
they had a hit every summer for like six, seven years. Right.

769
00:46:57.391 --> 00:47:01.860
Like why can't we be friends, a low rider, um, on it,

770
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:03.360
they had a whole list of hit.

771
00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.210
Like every one of the songs would start playing like, oh yeah, I noticed,

772
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.700
I noticed song, you know,

773
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.760
50 million records.

774
00:47:11.761 --> 00:47:15.940
So how much did you think each record cost? 10 Bucks. Yeah. Yeah.

775
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.910
What will records nine 99 or whatever like that. So that's fine.

776
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:23.370
Yeah. And they probably got, they got,

777
00:47:23.371 --> 00:47:26.550
they had to get what at least a buck or two bucks off of each one after

778
00:47:26.551 --> 00:47:30.040
everybody else took their cut. Yeah.

779
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.230
<v 2>And then the, all the touring money. Yeah, I was,</v>

780
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.780
I was talking to someone who's a band is in a band now.

781
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:37.450
And they were explaining to me that these record companies,

782
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.120
they don't just take your,

783
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.080
the record sales anymore like iTunes sales and they,

784
00:47:43.081 --> 00:47:47.200
they now take merchandise, they take touring money.

785
00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:48.191
When you sign,

786
00:47:48.191 --> 00:47:51.460
you signed to an all exclusive deal cause the record companies can't really

787
00:47:51.461 --> 00:47:53.730
justify their existence anymore cause they can't really sell it.

788
00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.920
<v 1>Right. You're cancer. Yeah.</v>

789
00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:00.200
Cause all the musicians I know say the only time they sell cds or records or

790
00:48:00.201 --> 00:48:03.830
whatever is at the live show. Like they have to go out and sell.

791
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:06.860
They like us now, they got to go out and do merge.

792
00:48:06.861 --> 00:48:09.110
Like they didn't have to do that before. It's like yeah,

793
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:14.180
<v 2>imagine like you're buying a CD now who's buying the CD? Yeah, look at it.</v>

794
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.950
You know, what am I doing with this thing? Oh yeah, I have a slot for it.

795
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:19.940
<v 1>Well yeah that's what people say when they buy them after shows. They're like,</v>

796
00:48:19.941 --> 00:48:23.780
you know, and I joke about like, cause I have cds and download cards.

797
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.630
You said it's a generational.

798
00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:31.460
It is literally the line is right at about the age 40. If they're older,

799
00:48:31.461 --> 00:48:34.820
they want a CD. Right. And I g I said, you know, so,

800
00:48:34.821 --> 00:48:38.720
so if you try to sell them a download card and like what?

801
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:42.200
I'm not paying you for a business card. What is this? Right.

802
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.350
But then if you get a younger person and you try to sell them a CD,

803
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.810
but where am I gonna play this? My grandfather's house?

804
00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.510
My computers don't even come with a drive anymore. Like describe,

805
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.290
so people like,

806
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:59.090
people want to buy vinyl to sell vinyl because that's a small percentage that

807
00:48:59.091 --> 00:49:03.600
want to buy vinyl. Sound like you're into jazz and shit. Nah, they, Dale,

808
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:07.880
they're buying, you know what? Jazz fans still have CD players.

809
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:11.150
Like they made the switch from records to cds and they're like, that's it.

810
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.840
I'm not going back. I'm not sweating.

811
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:16.100
I'm not getting the records out of the garage to,

812
00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:21.020
there's not a record industry for Jackson a some, but it's for the,

813
00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:26.210
uh, it's footy. Yeah. Yeah. There's some, but it's not big blue notes doing,

814
00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:31.340
um, blue note jazz labels doing records again. And, uh, for their artists,

815
00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.960
but they're selling to the younger people, not the older people.

816
00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:41.140
Older people aren't buying turntable new turntables to play it.

817
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:45.350
That makes sense. You know, where is a good jazz place in la?

818
00:49:45.351 --> 00:49:47.840
Like if I wanted to go see Jan, you know,

819
00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:52.760
the crazy thing about La is all the jazz musicians live here and they all say,

820
00:49:52.761 --> 00:49:56.270
well we don't play here. There's no money to be made. So there there's,

821
00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:01.560
I'm on because it's La, they record here, you know, and they,

822
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:04.310
um, I'm trying to remember the name of it on sunset.

823
00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:09.460
Catalina bar and grill on sunset is good and Vibrato on Beverly Glen is good.

824
00:50:11.061 --> 00:50:15.920
But Bravo is owned by herb Alpert. Yeah. So is this something like you,

825
00:50:15.921 --> 00:50:18.590
you'll go out like on a Wednesday night or something like that? You'd go see?

826
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.560
No, I do more. Um, I,

827
00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:28.190
I love going to festivals. Yeah. I love going to festivals.

828
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:29.900
Um, I'm guilty that I,

829
00:50:29.901 --> 00:50:34.400
I'll go to a jazz club in New York more so than I would in la. Really? Yeah.

830
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:38.660
Why? Cause it's more the vibe, the vibe in New York. It just fits.

831
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:42.950
That's where they come from. And that's what a jam. Uh, but, but I've been to,

832
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:45.050
I've been to a few times. I'll go,

833
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:49.010
definitely if I know somebody who's playing there, I'll go see him at Catalina.

834
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:53.480
I have never experienced good jazz. I'm sure it's real.

835
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:58.340
I know you're not dumb. No. This guy, I got a, um, man,

836
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:59.503
this, what is this Jeremy?

837
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.880
<v 4>This is Catalina, but [inaudible] performance,</v>

838
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.180
they're kind of frequently eat performed. The only place I've even,

839
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.170
that's the only reason I know of it cause it's on sunset and Hollywood pops up

840
00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:11.990
there. Is He doing stand up? No, he does jazz. He's sings

841
00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.120
<v 1>what? So you did. But this is the thing, and this is the thing about jazz.</v>

842
00:51:16.121 --> 00:51:19.860
So you see that now call up a guy. Look up. Uh,

843
00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:21.400
well do I want to hear some of this?

844
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.590
<v 6>[inaudible] you got a cigarette?</v>

845
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.113
Okay. Stop.

846
00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.200
<v 1>Yeah. So that,</v>

847
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.740
that's old acoustic jet. But that,

848
00:51:46.741 --> 00:51:50.520
that's the jazz that keeps people from listening to jazz. You know,

849
00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:53.500
that's the Jaffe like, oh, never mind. Uh, look,

850
00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:58.450
you look up a guy like Robert Glasper who's just this brilliant young keyboard

851
00:51:58.451 --> 00:52:01.570
player and he has two bands. He has the Robert Glasper trio,

852
00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:05.890
which is a just a jazz trio, piano, bass and drums, which are brilliant.

853
00:52:05.891 --> 00:52:08.080
Then he's got the Robert Glasper experience,

854
00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:11.830
which is his electronic electric band.

855
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:16.000
And he'll have everyone singing on that from like Layla Hathaway,

856
00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.780
Donnie Hathaway's daughter, who's a brilliant vocalist to loopy fiasco,

857
00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:23.980
you know, to most deaf. They all perform together. He,

858
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:25.900
he hangs out with the route.

859
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:29.380
The roots have a jam session in New York that,

860
00:52:29.381 --> 00:52:31.300
that all these jazz artists come to south.

861
00:52:31.301 --> 00:52:35.440
So that's what's going on that I love it. It's really,

862
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:40.420
I mean jazz has always been the most creative music, you know, it's just, and,

863
00:52:40.421 --> 00:52:43.630
and that's why I love it. These guys are there,

864
00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:48.160
they're masters of their instruments and it's all about creativity and they,

865
00:52:48.161 --> 00:52:51.100
you know, even when they do covers,

866
00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.390
it's great cause they do it in such a different way. You know,

867
00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:58.780
I like Robert Glassberg experienced the first time I heard him,

868
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.860
they did smells like teen spirit. And I was like, thank you. He was cool.

869
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:05.860
He can look at it, he can look up anything.

870
00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:10.080
So that's the kind of thing in jazz, you know, um,

871
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:15.100
my buddy Marcus Miller, who's this brilliant bass player who was,

872
00:53:15.101 --> 00:53:17.920
he was Luther Vandross, his musical director,

873
00:53:17.921 --> 00:53:20.170
and he did all the music for Luther, right. And that was all great.

874
00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.560
But he also produced music for Miles Davis, you know,

875
00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:28.410
and he's done stuff again with, with anybody from like,

876
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:33.660
you know, Bill withers to, to classic, um,

877
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.560
old school jazz artists. So yeah,

878
00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:40.590
jazz covers a wide range and that's what I love about it.

879
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:45.590
But there's a lot of young jazz artists now who are bringing in hip hop and,

880
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:46.973
and

881
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.670
different John [inaudible] into jazz that are making it really cool

882
00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:56.880
international stuff. A lot of African sound coming in,

883
00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.840
Brazilian sound coming in. And these are the guys, terrace Martin,

884
00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:05.970
who's in a group called rnr equals now with Glasper terrace.

885
00:54:05.971 --> 00:54:10.971
Martin does all of Kendrick Lamars music really seed sold so fast.

886
00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:16.380
It's, it's like, yeah. It's like, yeah, I'll go with Kendrick Lamar and I, I,

887
00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:20.190
you know, I just, I need to make $5 million, so I'm gonna do this music.

888
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:24.630
But when I can just create and play and have fun and just be a musician,

889
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.950
then I go to my jazz roots and I jam with these guys in a whole different,

890
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:31.440
different vibes. So here's right here.

891
00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:35.740
<v 7>Yeah. Spirit, Jasper.</v>

892
00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:40.120
That's hilarious. What is going on with his head?

893
00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:45.150
What is up there then here? Can't help you with that. That red stripe.

894
00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:50.060
I got nothing. Like what's happening now? It's a hat. That's a hat. Yeah.

895
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.370
I can't be, it's hair, but interesting.

896
00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:02.340
<v 1>So he's using a vocoder so as he sings, it comes through the instrument.</v>

897
00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:07.130
<v 7>Wow. These guys gotta be high.</v>

898
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:12.410
<v 1>Yeah. Oh yeah. No way around it. Well, that part of jazz never changed. Yeah,</v>

899
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.680
that's, miles Davis has always been fascinating to me.

900
00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:19.350
Like all the people in musical history,

901
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:24.390
like he's always been like with this one dude. But I was like, wow,

902
00:55:24.391 --> 00:55:28.470
I would have loved to have met that guy. Me Too. So fucking intense. Marcus.

903
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.300
You know, played in this band and knew him,

904
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:34.500
I would've loved to have seen him just to see him live because, you know, he,

905
00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:36.720
he did a record called kind of blue,

906
00:55:36.721 --> 00:55:39.330
which is the biggest selling jazz record ever.

907
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:43.770
He did it in 59 it still sells thousands of copies a week.

908
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:47.970
Like it's still a big, you know, kind of blue is the standard.

909
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.590
But he also played covers of like human nature and time after time,

910
00:55:52.591 --> 00:55:57.210
like in the 80s he was doing covers of that. Wow. You know, so,

911
00:55:57.211 --> 00:56:01.590
so again, that, that was the thing about, about a jazz man. Like he was like,

912
00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:04.470
yeah, well it's good music. So I'm gonna play it. Like I don't,

913
00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:08.880
I don't care for it. It was written by Cindy Lopper or, you know,

914
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.730
Duke Ellington. That's good music. I'm gonna play it. And that,

915
00:56:12.731 --> 00:56:15.300
that's what's so cool about it. But yeah, so, so those are places,

916
00:56:15.301 --> 00:56:17.730
but when you go to the jazz festivals, you know,

917
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:21.480
whether it be the playboy jazz festival, Newport jazz festival,

918
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:26.020
but just like our comedy festivals where you get a bunch of musicians who are

919
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:29.750
like, yeah, we're all here together. Let's let this jam, let's play something.

920
00:56:29.751 --> 00:56:34.600
And sometimes the best music will be random. Not,

921
00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.420
not, you know, not part of the set, but like, oh man,

922
00:56:37.421 --> 00:56:41.440
remember when we played together and you know, 97 and mantra. Yeah,

923
00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:46.210
let come on stage and we'll play. And then you hear something that, again,

924
00:56:46.211 --> 00:56:50.890
just like in comedy, when some comics just improv in or you know, they're,

925
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.530
they're doing the same thing. They're, they're Improv to me.

926
00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.980
The big compliment I get from jazz musicians when they compliment me on my

927
00:56:56.981 --> 00:57:00.760
Improv, you know, cause it's like, yeah, you guys are experts.

928
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.060
You like Improv is, you guys created it.

929
00:57:04.061 --> 00:57:07.540
So if I'm doing something and you think it's cool, Craig Robinson,

930
00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:12.130
you know Greg? Sure. He's talked about both sides.

931
00:57:12.131 --> 00:57:16.450
Like he's got the comedy and music thing and he's respected on both these.

932
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:20.740
He's like, the musicians love him and comics love him and he's, yeah,

933
00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:24.490
Craig in Montreal. Craig did a big outdoor show.

934
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:28.780
Like it was like a block party, like the giant outdoor stage.

935
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:32.500
Yet Craig played it and it was hilarious cause he's doing his act right.

936
00:57:32.501 --> 00:57:36.760
So it's a big outdoor thing and families with their kids and he's singing take

937
00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:40.870
your panties off. And I'm like, yeah. So this I guess is the uncensored.

938
00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.630
But it was hilarious, you know.

939
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:44.833
<v 2>Very cool.</v>

940
00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:50.320
I saw dizzy Gillespie once when I was a kid when I was in a kind of,

941
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.450
had to be like second and third grade. I was living in San Francisco,

942
00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:56.930
we had a field trip. We went to see Dizzy Gillespie live.

943
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.870
And I'll never forget it. Like, you know,

944
00:57:59.871 --> 00:58:04.070
his cheeks will blow up like a bull frog. Right. It was like,

945
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:07.700
but that's not even the way you're supposed to play the trumpet.

946
00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:10.540
<v 1>Right. And that's what's so great about it. Like nobody,</v>

947
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:14.740
cause nobody taught him the right way to play it. So he just played it.

948
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:18.700
<v 2>Most people don't even know who dizzy Gillespie is. But if you see him live,</v>

949
00:58:18.701 --> 00:58:22.120
you never forget like that. Right? Like what in the fuck?

950
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:26.920
Like you see his face blow up. Like how, how,

951
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.980
how are you doing that? How is that real?

952
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:32.620
But so you're supposed to keep your cheeks tight,

953
00:58:32.621 --> 00:58:33.910
like the way they would teach you.

954
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.840
They would never teach you to do that and you probably couldn't.

955
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.220
I know I couldn't, you know, just he just had a way of doing it.

956
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.440
I wonder what year he died.

957
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:47.210
<v 8>Don't know. Um,</v>

958
00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.330
<v 2>but I was a little kid when I saw him in,</v>

959
00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:55.170
here's it died and 93 93 in New Jersey. Damn.

960
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:56.783
I um,

961
00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.573
<v 8>okay.</v>

962
00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:02.320
<v 1>I met Arturo Sun Deval and they did a movie about him.</v>

963
00:59:02.321 --> 00:59:05.050
Andy Garcia did a movie bounce, so Arturo's really? Yeah.

964
00:59:05.051 --> 00:59:08.700
He's this Cuban trumpet player and I want to say it,

965
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:09.820
what he was telling the story,

966
00:59:09.821 --> 00:59:14.821
and I want to say it was dizzy Gillespie who was in Cuba and Arturo was like

967
00:59:16.361 --> 00:59:20.860
driving him around. Right. This is like in a, I guess it would be in the late,

968
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:26.320
maybe early sixties and he asked Arturo what he does and he's like awkward,

969
00:59:26.331 --> 00:59:29.750
like, Oh, I played a trumpet. But the Cubans were like, oh yeah, that's lot too.

970
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:31.460
Like all the Cubans knew who he was.

971
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:36.710
So he played and Dizzy Gillespie in the head. I want to say it was, he might,

972
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.430
I might be wrong name, but, but they went to the US State Department,

973
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:43.040
the head of CBS records and, and said,

974
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:48.110
we have to get him in the United States. Like we, he has to be here.

975
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:51.740
And they did it. They, they, the State Department got an Arturo.

976
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:55.400
Now imagine this show. They went to the State Department.

977
00:59:55.401 --> 00:59:59.570
It was an artists thing. They said, we want this guy to come to the US, to Cuba.

978
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.450
I have no idea. But no, they didn't sneak him out. He,

979
01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:04.160
it was a state sponsored thing.

980
01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:07.130
Like they got him over here to perform and then went back. No,

981
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.940
he came over and stayed. But this was the crazy part. This is the part,

982
01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:11.810
I can't imagine.

983
01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:16.811
So he flies from Cuba into LaGuardia Airport and they take him straight to

984
01:00:17.691 --> 01:00:22.460
Carnegie Hall for soundcheck. And he plays Carnegie Hall that night.

985
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:27.170
I mean, can you imagine like, imagine your first Gig, right? Like somebody,

986
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.540
somebody saw you, you know, I don't know.

987
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:33.620
Rodney Dangerfield saw you at a club in Boston and he was like,

988
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:34.903
okay Joe.

989
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:43.160
Oh my God, it's a crazy story. And, but to this day,

990
01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:46.680
but Arturo is like, when he plays the trumpet, you know, it's him.

991
01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.370
Like he hits notes on the trumpet.

992
01:00:49.371 --> 01:00:53.450
Like only dogs can hear like he's famous for this super high notes and stuff

993
01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:56.960
like that. But yeah, that's, that's what I love about it.

994
01:00:56.961 --> 01:00:59.990
So I loved the creativity. And then, you know, Marcus was telling me,

995
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:04.400
cause he's from New York, from Queens, seventies eighties guy. He said, well,

996
01:01:04.401 --> 01:01:05.510
you know what happened with hip hop?

997
01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:09.230
He said one of the things was they took music out of the schools, right?

998
01:01:09.231 --> 01:01:12.770
They didn't, you know, they don't teach, you can't take an instrument anymore.

999
01:01:12.771 --> 01:01:14.930
They were like, it's out of the budget probably. He said,

1000
01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:18.320
well you can't stop people from creating. So these guys,

1001
01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.660
they didn't have musical instruments, but they had records.

1002
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.210
So they just started making music with their records.

1003
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:27.290
They just started mixing the records and coming up with new sounds and it was

1004
01:01:27.291 --> 01:01:29.480
like, yeah, that kind of makes sense.

1005
01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:33.470
If you're musical and nobody teaches you to play an instrument,

1006
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:35.270
but you have these records, you're like, all right,

1007
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:39.150
well what if I played this and this at the same time? Right.

1008
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:42.200
And then the next thing you know, they made that hip hop,

1009
01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:46.430
which that that hip hop caught on before. Right.

1010
01:01:46.431 --> 01:01:50.420
The idea of mixing two different records together until hip hop came around and

1011
01:01:50.421 --> 01:01:52.610
no one ever did that with rock and roll there. No, no.

1012
01:01:52.611 --> 01:01:57.410
And then hip hop mixed in rock and roll. Right. When you know, when run DMC,

1013
01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:02.530
Aerosmith walk this way, that blew people's mind ass. You know, that was like,

1014
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:05.020
wait a minute, that's black and white. What's happening?

1015
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:09.410
Can't play together. Yeah, no. Yeah.

1016
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:13.280
And Adidas Adidas was like, yes they can. And they're wearing Adidas while they,

1017
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:16.670
do you ever listen to any of the brand new heavies?

1018
01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:20.140
They did hip hop with the brand. Heavies is

1019
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.700
<v 2>a heavy wood. It's a heavy rhyme experience. Is that what it's called?</v>

1020
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:28.860
It's to this day, one of my, uh, one of my favorite old schools,

1021
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:33.540
like 1990 style rap slash

1022
01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:36.220
<v 1>yeah. The brand new heavies were great. Yeah, they were great.</v>

1023
01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:39.730
And then you had living color who I still love. Oh Man.

1024
01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:43.540
I've lived in about living color. Yeah, that was a great, and you talk about,

1025
01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:45.640
you talk about being ahead of their time,

1026
01:02:45.641 --> 01:02:50.380
like think about that song cult a personality today, right? Like,

1027
01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:55.240
yeah, right. And, and, and cm punk. Walkout music. Yeah. Yeah.

1028
01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.390
And that was another band where they were like, okay, let me get this straight.

1029
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:59.740
This is a heavy,

1030
01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:05.340
like a heavy metal rock and roll band of black guys who are sampling public

1031
01:03:06.101 --> 01:03:08.950
enemy. Right. What the fuck?

1032
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.450
Yeah. What are some weird,

1033
01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.650
some areas he had the crazy hair with the shades and you would wear the, uh,

1034
01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.440
he would wear the wet suits all the time. That's, yeah. He,

1035
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:25.720
he's like a saw school, like scoop suits. Yeah. He used to jam and those, yeah.

1036
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:30.670
Yeah. That is what he's wearing.

1037
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.960
I just want to show his dick off. Hey Yo, rock star. Why not? Back in the day,

1038
01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.030
like you ever see like those Robert Plant,

1039
01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:42.160
these tight pants on his hog that he's wearing a suit.

1040
01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:46.800
He's wearing a wetsuit when God damn Hispanics went to so weird.

1041
01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:51.520
That was his thing. Oh Wow. They fucking vanished. What happened to them?

1042
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:56.530
They w they came back out, they did the 25th anniversary. I saw it at hard rock.

1043
01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.060
They did the 25th anniversary of their record of vivid cult of personality yet.

1044
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:05.230
And they toured it. Silly swimsuit.

1045
01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:11.590
Wow. How crazy. Yeah, that was

1046
01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.930
<v 2>great fucking song. But you know, that's always freaked me out too.</v>

1047
01:04:14.931 --> 01:04:19.010
Like imagine being a band. You have one song that just out of the park,

1048
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:23.750
just in the parking lot, you know, just one fucking grand slam home run.

1049
01:04:23.751 --> 01:04:27.320
God Damn, we did it. This is huge number one song in the nation.

1050
01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:28.460
Seven weeks in a row

1051
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:32.580
<v 1>and nothing. Well yeah, but, but imagine like, well what did they say?</v>

1052
01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:35.500
You got your whole life to write that song. Yeah.

1053
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:38.760
And then we got two years to write the night. Right to do it again,

1054
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:42.770
<v 2>but this also looks like some bands, they just catch fire with what?</v>

1055
01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.510
Like do you remember warrant Cherry Pie.

1056
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.780
She is match giant fucking huge song and that was it.

1057
01:04:50.911 --> 01:04:55.911
That dude died near here and he died in woodland hills and a fucking shitty

1058
01:04:56.161 --> 01:04:57.120
hotel somewhere.

1059
01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:01.090
<v 1>I'm going to give you the one hit wonder. You want it? Okay. The twist,</v>

1060
01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.960
the twist. What did Chubby checker ever sing? Oh my God.

1061
01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.593
Come on.

1062
01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:13.330
Imagine that you had the song that was like, yeah,

1063
01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.890
that was the, what's Chubby checker's number two hit. I don't know.

1064
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.460
That's a great point because,

1065
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:25.660
but that somehow or another was good enough for him to stay famous for his whole

1066
01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:27.820
life. Your whole life.

1067
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:31.600
People hire you to play one song.

1068
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.640
He was the greatest one hit wonder ever. Then he was the eyes. The kid. Yeah.

1069
01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.330
He said go to the edge. Yeah.

1070
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:41.260
I can't even imagine anyone who's come close to that because no one's paying

1071
01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:44.500
them to sing. Sing called the personality. No one's all excited. No,

1072
01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:49.150
you call it, you might have one fan who's like worth millions.

1073
01:05:49.151 --> 01:05:53.390
Who pays you to come birthday party and treats you like shit. Yeah,

1074
01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:57.580
giving extra money. Am I gonna pay on you? Do you remember?

1075
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:02.050
And then living color, the TV show, living color came out. Yeah.

1076
01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:03.010
And then it was like, wait,

1077
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.040
what are you doing that there's already a band that's not us?

1078
01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:13.270
The show far eclipse the bar. Eclipse the band. And then they were like,

1079
01:06:13.271 --> 01:06:16.810
were you named after the show? Right? Like how many? Like, like a,

1080
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.170
what's the name? Darrius Rucker. How many times does he said my name is not,

1081
01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.213
who'd he?

1082
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:27.880
Well who these back apparently cause Darrius Rucker went off and did country

1083
01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:32.440
music and did that for a long time. But now he's back. He's back on tour.

1084
01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.260
Yeah, man. Yeah. That was another band.

1085
01:06:35.261 --> 01:06:38.170
That band was that fucking first record.

1086
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:40.930
The second record fell up at that first record was,

1087
01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.140
I think it was like serious or something.

1088
01:06:44.141 --> 01:06:47.590
But like they played it and then I went back and played it again. It was like,

1089
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:51.460
wow, I forgot how good this was. Like that album is,

1090
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.460
but the second one was not as good.

1091
01:06:54.461 --> 01:06:57.160
I don't think that was one of those albums though.

1092
01:06:57.161 --> 01:07:00.880
There's something about hoody were some people despise them and it didn't make

1093
01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:04.570
any sense to me. It's like some people just heard those songs too many times.

1094
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:08.290
It was too big of a hit and they were like all fucking Hoodie.

1095
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:11.380
That does happen though. Like Dave Matthews. Yeah.

1096
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:15.310
When something's too much of a hit and you hear it every day,

1097
01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:19.180
you get tired of the sun and then you just don't play that. You know?

1098
01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:23.320
A buddy of mine, actually mal hall, he's gonna love this shout out.

1099
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:26.680
So mal hall opens for me, really funny guy,

1100
01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:29.260
and he tours with Angela Johnson.

1101
01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.860
He hates happy that song. I'm happy. Yeah,

1102
01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.320
by Farell.

1103
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:40.670
I insist on it being his walk on music. Whenever we work, it's,

1104
01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:45.190
oh, he physically,

1105
01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:50.080
he has a physical reaction because how much did we hear that song when it came

1106
01:07:50.081 --> 01:07:53.830
out? It was like drilled it. So yeah, so now he knows people.

1107
01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:58.330
It's good for them to get angry. Before Joey Diaz, whenever I'd worked with him,

1108
01:07:58.331 --> 01:08:01.410
he would just decide, he would pick a thing and it wasn't like,

1109
01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.890
like we were talking about this,

1110
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:06.550
but I recognize what he was doing after awhile and he'd be backstage and he

1111
01:08:06.551 --> 01:08:09.460
would pick a thing and just start getting fucking mad at it.

1112
01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.850
He's fucking pussies. This is what they think Americans,

1113
01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:16.040
this is what they think the fucking world is. And he would start getting crazy.

1114
01:08:16.041 --> 01:08:18.020
And then ladies and gentlemen, Joey Diaz,

1115
01:08:18.021 --> 01:08:22.070
and he would go on stage with that momentum and just mark the place.

1116
01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:25.160
I've had that happen a couple of times with something just got,

1117
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.150
I remember it was one of those, you know when you do the set,

1118
01:08:29.151 --> 01:08:32.990
you wish you had recorded it? Yes. So I was going to the laugh factory.

1119
01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:37.220
It's Saturday night and I was on my bike and this guy,

1120
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.880
like it's stopping go right. And I'm just, and he hit my bike,

1121
01:08:40.881 --> 01:08:43.280
but it was only at like five miles an hour.

1122
01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:47.660
Like he just tapped me and knocked the bike over. But I'm like, I was bright.

1123
01:08:47.661 --> 01:08:49.790
Like how did you not see me? Right.

1124
01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:53.030
And I just went on stage and I just ranted about, you know,

1125
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:57.230
drivers and traffic and this and it was hilarious and it was like gone.

1126
01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:02.660
Did you record it? No, I never recorded. I do sometimes,

1127
01:09:02.661 --> 01:09:07.040
but I didn't record that one. And I wish I, because it was just, you know,

1128
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:11.510
sometimes you just get something gets to you right before you go on stage and

1129
01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:15.290
you, it's not written, you just go into a rents, but it's right there.

1130
01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.680
But that's why it's so important to record everything. Yeah.

1131
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:21.890
I record all of them. Yeah. I have them on my phone. It's so easy now. Yeah.

1132
01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:26.030
Now this was before phones. This was before we carried a studio in our pocket.

1133
01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:30.110
Oh, this is a while ago. This was when these are all set.

1134
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:33.350
This is when you had the, uh, the micro cassette.

1135
01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:38.540
I still have a bunch of those tapes. Those, I used to have lunch room out.

1136
01:09:38.690 --> 01:09:42.370
I'm like, I don't even want to hear them. I, um, I used to have a,

1137
01:09:42.371 --> 01:09:45.820
a little tiny mini cassette recorder. A mini desk. Yeah,

1138
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:49.940
I remember the many days. Yeah. That was when Sony kept trying formats,

1139
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:52.550
like maybe they'll buy this, right? They'll buy. So yeah,

1140
01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:55.100
we bought many disk once they fucked him with Beta Max,

1141
01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:59.510
then you sons of bitches did anyone but comics by many disks.

1142
01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:03.770
Like I set up a mini disc recorder at the comedy store.

1143
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.510
I actually installed one.

1144
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:09.290
I installed the mini district quarter at the comic store so I could record my

1145
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:12.890
sets. Yeah, yeah. Comics. We used them. I don't know if anyone else did.

1146
01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.660
I mean it just didn't work. They really never sold music on it.

1147
01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:19.670
So it was a fun man. It never really took off.

1148
01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:24.110
But then it was like cdrs, right? Yeah.

1149
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:29.060
You can record on record on cdrs. Yeah. All that stuff is like,

1150
01:10:29.061 --> 01:10:31.220
we thought that was the shit.

1151
01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:35.180
I had a block could make my own cds right on it with a sharpie.

1152
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:40.160
That's technology, man. It happens so fast. Especially in this era. Yeah.

1153
01:10:40.161 --> 01:10:43.280
I mean think about how long records existed for yeah.

1154
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:45.320
Decade after decade after decade.

1155
01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:49.340
It was just records and all of a sudden compact discs. And you're like, what?

1156
01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.840
Right. Cause. Yeah cause that started what around 1990 like laser disc

1157
01:10:56.310 --> 01:11:00.230
and then they have movies that relays or just to ask my brother,

1158
01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.500
my brother's a techie, like an early adopter.

1159
01:11:03.501 --> 01:11:08.330
So he has all that shit in his garage. So yeah, he's got some movies on 12 and

1160
01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.280
still collect those. There's a thing was out there, somebody,

1161
01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:16.830
somebody spying eight tracks somewhere.

1162
01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:21.450
Somebody in their home right now watching top gun on laser disc. All excited.

1163
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:25.920
Yeah. And Hit, they invite you over like hey, check this out and you're like,

1164
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.850
I can just hit the remote in instantly.

1165
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:34.910
The place that's the most incredible thing is like you could ask Siri to play a

1166
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:38.310
song. Yeah. Sit like, like you know like

1167
01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:43.560
play whole lot of love bitch. Listen to me.

1168
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.460
Hey Siri, play whole lot of love by led Zeppelin.

1169
01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.780
Well what kind of a world we live in. Yeah. Well that's like those commercials.

1170
01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.880
And again, getting back to the Special Ed,

1171
01:12:03.881 --> 01:12:06.640
talk about like the arguments between Siri and Alexa.

1172
01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:10.590
Like that's going to be the next thing. Yeah. I think Alexis,

1173
01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.990
more of a spy that bitches sneak. She's listening more.

1174
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:17.050
Alexis listening all that time listening all the time. Siri,

1175
01:12:17.051 --> 01:12:21.880
you have to talk to her. Yeah, but you hear this. Yeah, we think we think,

1176
01:12:21.881 --> 01:12:23.460
but you don't, you know, they,

1177
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:26.920
the privacy's in illusion now,

1178
01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.210
like when people, I'm off the grid like, no, you're not. None of us,

1179
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:35.050
none of us are off the grid. So you know, they say like your,

1180
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:37.540
your social security number yet everyone,

1181
01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:41.830
anyone can find it or your credit card numbers. Like anything you do,

1182
01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:45.480
it's out there. Well, there was a new, um,

1183
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:49.840
there's a new technology that the government is unleashing that is, uh,

1184
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:54.520
a weather balloon or a balloon that from 65,000 feet,

1185
01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:59.940
it can watch multiple cars at the same time and tracked them 65,000 feet in the

1186
01:13:02.021 --> 01:13:05.680
air. My, can you even see what the fucks, I mean, no,

1187
01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:08.200
you wouldn't even be able to see it up there, but that's, you know,

1188
01:13:08.201 --> 01:13:10.780
that's not that new. I mean, you know,

1189
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:14.800
this is apparently like the super high tunnel. I mean the,

1190
01:13:14.801 --> 01:13:17.030
just the idea of watching from that Jaime,

1191
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.350
and they've had spy planes and stuff like that. They could, you know,

1192
01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:24.670
what was that a movie I in the sky, like, yeah. Hackman or something. Yes.

1193
01:13:24.671 --> 01:13:27.730
Smith wasn't with the satellites. Yeah. That was a, yeah,

1194
01:13:27.731 --> 01:13:30.220
that was a movie where Gene Hackman would like,

1195
01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:34.390
like will Smith made a phone call and gene Hackman had to blow up his lab.

1196
01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:41.320
Damn. Uh, yeah. Back when I was in the aerospace, you know,

1197
01:13:41.321 --> 01:13:45.820
they had airplanes that would like, they're flying at 80,000 feet,

1198
01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:48.760
keeping an eye on things. Yeah. You know, and they,

1199
01:13:48.761 --> 01:13:53.761
they had cameras and now it's just so much more prevalent and yeah,

1200
01:13:55.241 --> 01:13:58.510
when you know, you've got, listen man, you, your car, right?

1201
01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.500
All the new cars have a black box in them that people don't realize. Like,

1202
01:14:02.501 --> 01:14:06.830
so if you have an accident, they can find out how fast you were going. Oh yeah.

1203
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:10.570
When you cry or if you have a warranty thing and they're like, yeah,

1204
01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.600
but you are it at 150 miles an hour, blah, blah, blah.

1205
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:15.190
[inaudible] got some cars,

1206
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:19.300
have a box in them where the police can shut your car down. Like saved.

1207
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:21.430
You're in a high speed chase in a corvette or something like that.

1208
01:14:21.431 --> 01:14:22.241
I don't know if at the core of that,

1209
01:14:22.241 --> 01:14:25.280
but some kind of car like that that's electronically controlled.

1210
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:29.440
They literally can get your vin number plugged into a machine and say shut it

1211
01:14:29.441 --> 01:14:33.460
down. They can do that with um, onstar. Right.

1212
01:14:33.461 --> 01:14:38.100
If the car is stolen on start, just shuts the car off. Yeah. Yeah.

1213
01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.860
Have you seen those new plates, those electronic plates? Yeah.

1214
01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:44.800
I know it's weird, but when you call it in, like say someone stole your car,

1215
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:49.150
then the plate changes to stolen. Oh really? Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah.

1216
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:53.680
Now it's like a little more down. Don't get your eyes lit up. It's good. No,

1217
01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:57.700
cause I was thinking how many people could mess with you like that.

1218
01:14:57.701 --> 01:15:01.750
Like now that you're just open for a practical joke, somebody like, hey man,

1219
01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:05.230
let's report his car stolen. Yeah, because that's true.

1220
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:07.540
Because who do they know? Like on the phone,

1221
01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:11.680
they don't know if it's you and all you need is the Vin or something minutes.

1222
01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.950
What do you need? Do you need some sort of second party verification?

1223
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:18.190
Did they send you a text message? Reply to this if your car is really stolen,

1224
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:22.450
you know, I doubt it. Yeah. Good point. Your ex wife,

1225
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:27.760
she's probably like this mother fucker calling your car stolen. Yeah.

1226
01:15:27.761 --> 01:15:30.940
She would have all your info, right? Like, yeah,

1227
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.360
this is some bitch every Saturday night or she knows you're doing something,

1228
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:39.050
man, do it. Your stolen car your best. This is our,

1229
01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.150
our privacy's so deteriorated from the time that we were kids to today.

1230
01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:47.350
Like it makes you really wonder how far it can keep slipping.

1231
01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:52.150
The only, but the other side of the coin is they don't like, no,

1232
01:15:52.151 --> 01:15:54.520
most people don't care. You know what I mean? In other words,

1233
01:15:54.690 --> 01:15:57.640
you're not that important. Like pillow to government spying on me. Like,

1234
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:58.361
well no,

1235
01:15:58.361 --> 01:16:02.650
they're not because you're nobody like you're not doing anything that they would

1236
01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:07.330
be interested in. Don't flatter yourself. Yeah, exactly. It do what?

1237
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:10.060
What did you do? But then there's the other side like, Hey,

1238
01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:13.510
if you're not doing anything wrong, you shouldn't worry about the government.

1239
01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:16.600
Hey, they can go look in my email. I'm not doing anything wrong.

1240
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:19.870
That's not the point. The point is, the government is people, right?

1241
01:16:19.871 --> 01:16:22.870
And people shouldn't have access to your email and who knows what kind of weird

1242
01:16:22.871 --> 01:16:23.950
shit they're doing like theirs.

1243
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:27.670
That was one of the things that Edward Snowden said that the government is like

1244
01:16:27.671 --> 01:16:31.510
sneaking in on people's emails and looking at People's Dick pecks and looking at

1245
01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:35.650
the end state. You look at all of all those things, and that's a sliding scale,

1246
01:16:35.651 --> 01:16:38.800
right? Between Security and privacy and all of that,

1247
01:16:38.801 --> 01:16:42.790
that you have to figure out what you're comfortable with. And you know,

1248
01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:47.080
shameless plug number to my podcast. No, I'm part of this new podcast.

1249
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:49.100
It's called fear not who's on it with you?

1250
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:53.320
A guy named Barry Glassner and Barry Glassner wrote this book called the culture

1251
01:16:53.321 --> 01:16:57.220
of fear, and it was all about how fear is used as business, right?

1252
01:16:57.221 --> 01:17:00.160
They keep you scared so that they could sell you things,

1253
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:03.580
whether it be security systems or [inaudible],

1254
01:17:03.610 --> 01:17:06.020
there's so much involved in it and,

1255
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:11.030
and it's about what we're scared of versus what the real threats are in it.

1256
01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:14.810
You know what I mean? Like he's like, yeah, wait, they keep you scared of,

1257
01:17:14.811 --> 01:17:16.940
you know, your kid getting kidnapped in the park.

1258
01:17:16.941 --> 01:17:18.800
Like you kid ain't going to get kidnapped in the park.

1259
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:22.370
But what you should be scared of is a number of drunk drivers on the road.

1260
01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.490
That's real. And the, the,

1261
01:17:24.491 --> 01:17:28.790
the odds of you getting hit by a drunk driver between like midnight and 2:00 AM

1262
01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:30.900
when the bar, like that's a real fear. And,

1263
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:34.640
and we talk about it in the context of different things. We did the,

1264
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:39.440
the whole anti-vaxxer thing and you know, so what's, what's you, yeah,

1265
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:43.400
you're worried about your kid getting, getting something from the vaccination,

1266
01:17:43.401 --> 01:17:48.401
but the greater good is society is protecting itself against measles or whatever

1267
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:54.880
disease, you know. So we, we talk about things like that and, and yeah, there's,

1268
01:17:54.881 --> 01:17:58.910
there's always that sliding scale of um,

1269
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:05.050
personal security or whatever versus the government, you know, and,

1270
01:18:05.051 --> 01:18:08.810
and again, the government, if the government did its job right,

1271
01:18:08.811 --> 01:18:12.290
you could trust them a lot more. Sure. You know what I mean?

1272
01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:14.690
Like the government and the, in other words, this is just my opinion,

1273
01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:17.320
like taxes. Okay. A lot of people, I hate paying taxes.

1274
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:20.840
I don't mind paying taxes because I understand the greater good.

1275
01:18:20.841 --> 01:18:25.250
We need to fix roads and we want to have good public schools and cop blah blah

1276
01:18:25.251 --> 01:18:26.450
blah. Yeah man.

1277
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:31.810
But the problem is that the government gets the money and then they fuck up.

1278
01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:35.030
Yeah. So, so that's why you don't want to pay,

1279
01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:39.860
cause you know that this politician is paying his brother who's a contractor to

1280
01:18:39.861 --> 01:18:44.540
do some bullshit work and stealing, you know, so that,

1281
01:18:45.190 --> 01:18:47.780
and, and you know, what's the solution? I don't know.

1282
01:18:47.781 --> 01:18:51.990
I mean we're all wondering what's the solution. There is a solution

1283
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:52.801
<v 2>on the horizon.</v>

1284
01:18:52.801 --> 01:18:55.300
Did you see what happened with Neil degrasse Tyson that Neil degrasse stars and

1285
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:58.890
got in trouble for tweeting something the other day after the mass shootings.

1286
01:18:58.950 --> 01:19:01.650
<v 1>Right. People are pissed at him because it pulled up,</v>

1287
01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:05.730
pulled the tweet up cause it's pretty interesting cause it's, it's just

1288
01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.713
<v 2>accurate.</v>

1289
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:10.980
And people were angry and they're saying he's using his platform irresponsibly

1290
01:19:10.981 --> 01:19:11.730
and no,

1291
01:19:11.730 --> 01:19:16.730
he was trying to let people know that although these shootings are a tragedy,

1292
01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:21.810
they are a small number of deaths and there's so many other deaths that

1293
01:19:21.811 --> 01:19:24.030
happened. Here it goes, the past 48 hours,

1294
01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:29.220
the USA horrifically lost 34 people to mass shootings on average across 48

1295
01:19:29.221 --> 01:19:34.080
hours. We also lose 500 to medical errors, 300 to the flu,

1296
01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:38.970
250 to suicide, 200 car accidents, 42 homicides via handgun.

1297
01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.750
Often our emotions respond more to spectacle than to data.

1298
01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.480
Now that is not a bad tweet.

1299
01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:50.130
But I saw a scientist who was writing, I am unfollowing him.

1300
01:19:50.131 --> 01:19:54.150
He is using his platform irresponsibly. A lot of fucking virtue signaling.

1301
01:19:54.151 --> 01:19:58.710
Really, because what he's saying is not that there's anything wrong with,

1302
01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:04.050
uh, you know, feeling her horrified by these tragedies. I mean,

1303
01:20:04.051 --> 01:20:09.051
he's saying we horrifically horrifically 34 people to mass shootings,

1304
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:14.220
but he's saying it's interesting that there's people dying left and right all

1305
01:20:14.221 --> 01:20:18.150
throughout this country all day long, just not at the hands of one person.

1306
01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:21.360
So we look at it differently and he's just saying,

1307
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.910
he just giving you data as a scientist, that's exactly what it is.

1308
01:20:26.911 --> 01:20:28.350
He's a science. Yes.

1309
01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.100
And so a scientist can separate the emotion,

1310
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:36.150
but people don't find this apology because as soldier soldiers,

1311
01:20:36.151 --> 01:20:37.050
even more interesting,

1312
01:20:37.051 --> 01:20:42.051
people will consider a mass shooting much worse than,

1313
01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.250
you know, heart attacks. Yeah. So listen to this.

1314
01:20:47.251 --> 01:20:48.270
So this is the other thing.

1315
01:20:48.271 --> 01:20:52.440
Yesterday I posted in reaction to the horrific mass shootings in America over

1316
01:20:52.441 --> 01:20:53.490
the previous 48 hours,

1317
01:20:53.491 --> 01:20:57.960
killing 34 people spawned mixed and highly clear critical responses.

1318
01:20:57.961 --> 01:20:58.794
If you missed it,

1319
01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:03.180
I offered a short list of largely preventable causes of death along with their

1320
01:21:03.181 --> 01:21:06.270
average two day death toll in the United States.

1321
01:21:06.271 --> 01:21:10.530
They significantly exceeded the death toll from the two days of mass shootings

1322
01:21:10.531 --> 01:21:15.300
including the number of people 40 who on average die from handgun homicides

1323
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:16.530
every two days.

1324
01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:21.330
I then noted that we tend to react emotionally to spectacular incidences of

1325
01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:26.331
death with the implication that more common causes of death trigger milder

1326
01:21:27.361 --> 01:21:28.590
responses within us.

1327
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.270
My intent was to offer objectively true information that might help shape

1328
01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:37.020
conversations and reactions to preventable ways we die.

1329
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:41.430
Where I miscalculated was that I genuinely believe that the tweet would be

1330
01:21:41.431 --> 01:21:44.310
helpful to anyone trying to save lives in America.

1331
01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:49.260
What I learned from the range of reactions that a is that for many people,

1332
01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.240
some information, my tweet in particular can be true but unhelpful,

1333
01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:58.740
especially at a time when many people are either still in shock or trying to

1334
01:21:58.741 --> 01:22:01.770
heal or both. So if you are one of those people,

1335
01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.840
I apologize for not knowing in advance what effect my tweet could have had on

1336
01:22:06.841 --> 01:22:07.674
you.

1337
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:12.830
I'm therefore thankful for the candor and depth of critical reactions shared in

1338
01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:15.720
my Twitter feed. As an educator,

1339
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.760
I personally value knowing with precision and accuracy. What reaction?

1340
01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:23.970
Anything that I say or write will instill in my audience,

1341
01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:27.210
and I got this one wrong, respectfully submitted,

1342
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:31.920
and then it says Neil degrasse Tyson. Now even that people were saying,

1343
01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:35.190
not enough, not good enough of response. It's almost like today,

1344
01:22:35.191 --> 01:22:39.510
there's certain people today to d they don't give a fuck whether or not you're,

1345
01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:42.810
you're saying something with sincerity. Whether you are sorry, they don't,

1346
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:45.660
sorry is not enough. Like they don't, they just want,

1347
01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:48.060
they want to be mad at you. And even if you're, sorry,

1348
01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:50.580
if you admit you made a mistake, there's no forgiveness.

1349
01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:53.670
There's no road to redemption. There's no, there's no,

1350
01:22:53.671 --> 01:22:54.900
I get what you were doing.

1351
01:22:55.830 --> 01:23:00.090
I think that it depends on, you know, as far as is the,

1352
01:23:00.091 --> 01:23:03.630
sorry enough for whatever depends on the pattern of the person.

1353
01:23:03.631 --> 01:23:06.160
Now with Neil degrasse Tyson, this is what I think happened

1354
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.150
<v 1>in here. It is my opinion. He's a scientist. So he gives the information.</v>

1355
01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:12.670
So he saw this and said, oh, wait a minute,

1356
01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:16.390
this many people died from medical mistakes. This may be,

1357
01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:20.860
and people didn't react what he doesn't, where he messed up with the timing.

1358
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:24.260
Yes. You don't say that the day after the mass shooting,

1359
01:23:24.261 --> 01:23:27.370
you say it maybe a week later or something like, Hey, you know,

1360
01:23:27.371 --> 01:23:31.090
people die in a lot of weight, blah, blah, blah. Now what he's saying is,

1361
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.940
I didn't know that I'm a scientist. I didn't,

1362
01:23:33.941 --> 01:23:36.100
I wasn't aware of the emotional impact.

1363
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:41.730
Thank you for telling me the emotional impact and I'm sorry that I hurt people's

1364
01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:44.470
feelings, which to me is totally legitimate.

1365
01:23:44.471 --> 01:23:47.620
Especially coming from who he is and what,

1366
01:23:47.650 --> 01:23:51.310
what I would think the scientific mindset is.

1367
01:23:51.311 --> 01:23:54.160
Now there are some people that, yeah, exactly what you said.

1368
01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:57.330
They decided you're a terrible person for saying this,

1369
01:23:57.331 --> 01:24:00.280
so that apology isn't enough. There's nothing he could do,

1370
01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:02.680
but see that there's certain people, right?

1371
01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:07.840
There's nothing you can do that's going to change their mind. You know,

1372
01:24:07.841 --> 01:24:11.050
you look at, look at the Obama birth certificate, right?

1373
01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:13.090
So even when the birth civic came out,

1374
01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:15.040
there's a certain percentage of the people that are still like,

1375
01:24:15.041 --> 01:24:16.060
what now that's fake.

1376
01:24:16.150 --> 01:24:21.150
Like there was no way he was ever going to be American to these people or what

1377
01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.210
they, there's a certain, you know, you, you travel,

1378
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.850
you know like [inaudible] there's certain groups like you ain't going to get

1379
01:24:30.851 --> 01:24:33.760
them. Their minds made up in their, in their bubble.

1380
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:35.820
They're in their whatever it is, and they,

1381
01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:39.040
they're surrounded by likeminded people. Like you said,

1382
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:41.260
like this is the disadvantage of the Internet, right?

1383
01:24:41.261 --> 01:24:45.520
The advantage of the Internet is all of this information. The disadvantages.

1384
01:24:45.521 --> 01:24:49.360
You find people who only think like you and you only talk to them and you build

1385
01:24:49.810 --> 01:24:54.610
this bubble wealth. Well, yes. So there's a group of people, a percentage,

1386
01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:56.110
I don't know, however you want to describe it,

1387
01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.480
that decided the moment he said that this is an unfeeling, horrible person,

1388
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:03.450
blah, blah, blah. I mean, I said, you know, my thing with the,

1389
01:25:03.451 --> 01:25:07.210
with the mass shootings, I'm like, listen, we don't care.

1390
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.960
We say we care individually. Like it's very sad for that family.

1391
01:25:12.961 --> 01:25:13.790
It's very, to me,

1392
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:17.560
the worst part of a mass shooting is somebody went to Walmart that day.

1393
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:19.540
They didn't know what's going gonna be the last day of their life.

1394
01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:23.780
They never going to see their family again. Somebody went out to a club in,

1395
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:27.250
in Ohio, they didn't know they'd never come.

1396
01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:32.470
That's the tragic part. And that is sad. But in the grand scheme of things,

1397
01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:35.100
we don't do anything. We don't, you know, we,

1398
01:25:35.101 --> 01:25:37.450
we say it doesn't work before we even try it.

1399
01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:41.380
Like there's nothing we do that changes. Even after Vegas,

1400
01:25:41.381 --> 01:25:43.720
when they said they were gonna ban, what was it called?

1401
01:25:43.721 --> 01:25:45.760
The bump stop or whatever it was,

1402
01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:50.761
that thing that helped shoot faster and then ultimately they didn't even band

1403
01:25:50.821 --> 01:25:52.810
that. You know, so,

1404
01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:57.040
so as a society we say we care,

1405
01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:00.970
but we don't because we don't change anything. You got to change something.

1406
01:26:00.971 --> 01:26:03.010
Nothing changes. If nothing changes, right.

1407
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.440
Well then we're getting way off track here. But with Neil, the grass, Tyson,

1408
01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:11.000
the, the outrage thing didn't outrage me. No, no, I didn't outrage you either,

1409
01:26:11.001 --> 01:26:11.391
right? No,

1410
01:26:11.391 --> 01:26:16.250
because he's assigned what he said is truth and data is true and data is

1411
01:26:16.251 --> 01:26:17.480
delivered without emotion.

1412
01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:22.540
And why people were upset is because he delivered truth with no emotion.

1413
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:25.700
Right. And he said, he said horrifically. I mean,

1414
01:26:25.701 --> 01:26:27.590
he was talking about the tragedy. Yeah.

1415
01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:32.090
The thing is that just people are looking to be upset. Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

1416
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.800
Absolutely. People look for for something to be mad about. Yeah.

1417
01:26:37.190 --> 01:26:41.510
Or something to be outraged about and that you know what that takes away from it

1418
01:26:41.511 --> 01:26:46.120
takes away from real outrage. Yes. Right. Yeah. It diminishes it.

1419
01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:50.660
If you're outraged every day, then you know, then, okay,

1420
01:26:50.661 --> 01:26:53.690
so what's really outrageous, right? If I'm going to be upset,

1421
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.350
if I'm going to be upset at a scientist for giving me scientific data,

1422
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:02.000
what do I want? Yeah. I guess the timing was the issue.

1423
01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:05.810
The timing was issue wasn't an issue with me. I mean, I get what he's doing.

1424
01:27:05.811 --> 01:27:08.450
I'm not a moron. It's simple.

1425
01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.720
He was just giving you all sorts of different horrific deaths that occur all

1426
01:27:14.421 --> 01:27:17.540
throughout the country. And I think on that same weekend,

1427
01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:20.180
there was some unprecedented number of people that were shot and killed in

1428
01:27:20.181 --> 01:27:25.070
Chicago. Chicago was a fucking Chicago's. And it's like, you know,

1429
01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:29.780
it's a war zone. And the thing is, you know, people say what about the gun laws?

1430
01:27:29.781 --> 01:27:32.780
And it's like, yeah, but [inaudible] all you gotta do is go to Indiana.

1431
01:27:32.781 --> 01:27:36.170
Like you go two hours away and you can get whatever you want. Just, you know,

1432
01:27:36.171 --> 01:27:38.300
that's the, that's the thing. So,

1433
01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:43.040
so having a car as a city Chicago is like, look, we were trying,

1434
01:27:43.041 --> 01:27:44.840
but we can't, you know,

1435
01:27:44.841 --> 01:27:49.340
what are we going to set up borders and check every car coming into Illinois?

1436
01:27:49.690 --> 01:27:53.450
God Damn, man, you'd have to go in every house. Exactly. So you can't,

1437
01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.460
you can't do that. Yeah, it's, it's, but yeah, his thing, I think it was a time,

1438
01:27:58.461 --> 01:28:01.970
and I'm like, you, that didn't offend me. I get what he was saying.

1439
01:28:01.971 --> 01:28:04.160
And then this is sh can't offend you.

1440
01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.530
You're a rational human that can offend you.

1441
01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:11.710
You know what bothers me when people pretend to be ignorant of something and

1442
01:28:12.081 --> 01:28:17.000
they're not? How so what when people like, like for example with this,

1443
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:20.780
like there's some people like, oh we can use this to,

1444
01:28:20.781 --> 01:28:25.450
to create some dislike against Neil Tyson or,

1445
01:28:25.451 --> 01:28:29.150
or whatever. It's generally, it's generally politicians do it right when they,

1446
01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:31.730
they say something and they're like, oh,

1447
01:28:31.731 --> 01:28:35.690
I didn't know that was offensive or wrong. It's like, yes you did,

1448
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:39.800
but you know, your followers didn't you see what I mean?

1449
01:28:39.801 --> 01:28:43.180
Like you can give me an example. I'm trying to, trying to think of an example.

1450
01:28:43.210 --> 01:28:46.400
Okay, well, well with the mass shootings, right? So,

1451
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:51.020
so the whole thing of saying that Trump's tweets had nothing to do with it.

1452
01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:56.780
Yes, they did get, nowadays they didn't directly. But yeah,

1453
01:28:56.781 --> 01:28:58.520
it did normalize.

1454
01:28:58.521 --> 01:29:03.120
And this guy used the same language of the, you know, invasion,

1455
01:29:03.121 --> 01:29:06.870
et cetera. So you can't say that it's completely unrelated.

1456
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:10.860
You know what I mean? You can't, you can't, don't print. And again,

1457
01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:12.430
it's not saying direct, but,

1458
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:17.570
but you can't pretend there's no connection and direct people quotes.

1459
01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:22.920
There are people who are intelligent enough to know that, but they'll say, no,

1460
01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.410
no, there's no, and it's like, yes there is. And you know,

1461
01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:28.740
there are don't feign ignorance. That's what I mean. But you know,

1462
01:29:28.741 --> 01:29:29.790
the guy in Dayton,

1463
01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:33.390
the really fucked up one was that guy's an Elizabeth Warren supporter who

1464
01:29:33.391 --> 01:29:35.700
actually wrote about gun control. I mean,

1465
01:29:35.701 --> 01:29:40.260
he was just a horrific homicidal fucking psychopath.

1466
01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:44.250
And then listen, that you have to have some,

1467
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:48.330
there has to be something wrong with you to do that. You're like, even,

1468
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:52.590
you know, regardless of your political beliefs,

1469
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.960
there has to be something wrong with you.

1470
01:29:54.961 --> 01:29:59.850
But you can be sparked or you can be Egged on. Sure.

1471
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:01.950
Yeah. By the words of,

1472
01:30:01.951 --> 01:30:06.000
of leaders or political people or powerful people and didn't have influence.

1473
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:08.220
Perfect way to put it, yet people of influence.

1474
01:30:08.221 --> 01:30:13.221
And that's why I think people of influence have to be responsible in what they

1475
01:30:13.231 --> 01:30:17.550
say. Yeah. You know, but, but this, but Neil degrasse Tyson,

1476
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:18.480
this is a different thing.

1477
01:30:18.481 --> 01:30:23.481
I think this is just a case of a scientist pointing out information without,

1478
01:30:24.301 --> 01:30:28.200
you know, like, like uh, you know, you were talking about earlier, dorks, nerds,

1479
01:30:28.201 --> 01:30:30.600
whatever you want to say. Th where it's like, yeah,

1480
01:30:30.601 --> 01:30:34.770
well this is just information. I'm not trying to be emotional. And people like,

1481
01:30:34.771 --> 01:30:34.981
well,

1482
01:30:34.981 --> 01:30:39.960
you have to be happy to connect you even though you're from a lab environment.

1483
01:30:39.961 --> 01:30:43.050
You have to understand not everyone is, but that's not, that's a,

1484
01:30:43.051 --> 01:30:46.620
one of the more uncomfortable things about today with social media is that

1485
01:30:46.621 --> 01:30:50.940
there's a bunch of people that are really just, they're just authoritarian.

1486
01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:54.720
They're there, they demand certain types of behavior,

1487
01:30:54.721 --> 01:30:58.140
and they do some under the guise of compassion. They do so under it.

1488
01:30:58.141 --> 01:31:00.900
Like they're trying to enforce the way people communicate.

1489
01:31:00.901 --> 01:31:04.440
Like the Neil degrasse Tyson thing, this you use,

1490
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:09.540
there's no indication whatsoever that he was minimizing the no deaths,

1491
01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:12.570
but people are pretending that he's doing. So, yeah,

1492
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:15.270
there were some people who believe he did,

1493
01:31:15.271 --> 01:31:19.200
but there were a lot of people pretending to be offended to be upset.

1494
01:31:19.201 --> 01:31:23.040
They're finding a nice target. Right. I, you know,

1495
01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:26.550
there's too many voices. Alonzo, too many words,

1496
01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:29.160
too many people out there spewing. Again,

1497
01:31:29.161 --> 01:31:33.630
that's the days we spew the positive and the negativity of the Internet. Yeah.

1498
01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:37.260
That's a positive and a negative. The positive is everyone has a voice.

1499
01:31:37.261 --> 01:31:41.640
The negative is everyone has a voice. But this is no,

1500
01:31:42.130 --> 01:31:45.480
and everyone's like,

1501
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:50.220
and the thing is the, the middle, the comments,

1502
01:31:50.221 --> 01:31:54.720
voices, the, the reasonable voices are the least heard. Of course.

1503
01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:59.410
Yeah. Well that's Facebook, right? Facebook's algorithm favors outrage.

1504
01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:03.700
So if you are on Facebook and you get upset about abortion,

1505
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.070
that's the kind of shit you're going to get in your feet, right?

1506
01:32:06.071 --> 01:32:08.050
If you get mad about climate change, they go,

1507
01:32:08.051 --> 01:32:09.760
you're going to get a lot of climate change talk.

1508
01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:14.560
That's what's going to show up. And God damn, that makes people nuts. I mean,

1509
01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:19.540
oh, again, and this is living in a bubble. You don't get to hear the other side,

1510
01:32:19.730 --> 01:32:22.990
you know, and, and, and, and it's not even the,

1511
01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:26.830
it's the reasonable part of the other side. You know what I mean?

1512
01:32:26.831 --> 01:32:28.840
Like politically. Yeah, I'm left.

1513
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:32.830
I have friends who I call reasonable Republicans and I could talk to a

1514
01:32:32.831 --> 01:32:36.640
reasonable Republican, can't talk to a crazy Republican. Right. You know,

1515
01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:41.410
if you, if you say that the mass shootings are based on transgender marriage,

1516
01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:46.090
then we can't talk. We, we got nothing. I can, I'm sorry I can't work with you.

1517
01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:50.380
But if you say that taxes should be lower to stimulate the economy and blah,

1518
01:32:50.381 --> 01:32:53.410
blah, blah. Yeah, we could talk about that in, you know what I mean? That's,

1519
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.190
that's, that's the difference. Um, and you know, and just,

1520
01:32:57.191 --> 01:33:01.150
just like on the left, look, I believe in the environment, this and that.

1521
01:33:01.151 --> 01:33:04.450
But now if you're asking me to give up gasoline, we may have a problem.

1522
01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:08.980
I may not be ready to go that far just yet. Here's my thought.

1523
01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:11.260
If there's too much co two in the air,

1524
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:15.300
can we make something to suck CEO two out of the air? Why are we wasting,

1525
01:33:15.370 --> 01:33:18.820
I mean, wouldn't that be better to me? There are certain air filters,

1526
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:20.140
just giant air filters.

1527
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:24.370
There were certain forms of technology were areas I don't understand.

1528
01:33:24.371 --> 01:33:26.030
This is the one that bugs me to down here.

1529
01:33:26.410 --> 01:33:30.880
Can we come up with a better way to build a road? But what's a better way?

1530
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:33.160
I don't know, but, but the, that's my point.

1531
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:35.110
There's some really smart people out there.

1532
01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:40.900
It takes forever to do road construction like you said about what you got to do.

1533
01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:43.270
Well, that's what I'm saying. No, somebody, somebody,

1534
01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.060
somebody's got to come up with them with a better way. Like when, uh, you know,

1535
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:49.540
really bought more roads. Well, fixing them,

1536
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:53.800
we got to fix them just fucking later or concrete or whatever the fuck it is.

1537
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.770
Like the high speed train thing, right? Like, I don't know.

1538
01:33:56.771 --> 01:34:00.940
How long have you been in la? 94. I moved here. Okay.

1539
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.770
I moved here in 80. Damn right out of, right out of high school.

1540
01:34:05.771 --> 01:34:10.090
I came here. So ever since I've been here and ever since you've been here,

1541
01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.670
they've been talking about a high speed rail. Yes.

1542
01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:16.570
From San Francisco to La to Las Vegas, right, isn't you?

1543
01:34:16.710 --> 01:34:19.870
I'm just going to do that now though. The hyperloop, this is my point.

1544
01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.040
Companies like Lockheed, Rockwell, Northrup,

1545
01:34:24.041 --> 01:34:26.800
these aerospace companies have come up with, you know,

1546
01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:30.670
stealth aircraft hypersonic Echo.

1547
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.820
You can't tell me that if you went to Lockheed and said, listen,

1548
01:34:33.821 --> 01:34:35.080
here's $10 billion,

1549
01:34:35.081 --> 01:34:40.040
we need a train that'll go 200 miles an hour from San Francisco to La to say

1550
01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:43.120
that they couldn't do it. They absolutely, you know what I mean?

1551
01:34:43.121 --> 01:34:47.560
They have the scientists and the technology wait like we spend so much money on

1552
01:34:47.561 --> 01:34:51.060
the wrong shit. Like I get, we need defense and this and that. But yeah,

1553
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:55.540
let's cut 20 billion to the side to figure out how to move people around more

1554
01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:57.950
efficiently. Cause that's, these companies do,

1555
01:34:57.951 --> 01:35:01.820
these are engineering and design companies. They come up with shit like this.

1556
01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.780
They, you know, so, so I've always said, why not just do that? Why not?

1557
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:10.790
Why not take some of this brain power and this engineering and development and

1558
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:16.730
use science for the masses. So now if you had, because if you had that,

1559
01:35:16.731 --> 01:35:21.731
think about if you could just go to the train station and get to Vegas in two

1560
01:35:21.951 --> 01:35:26.810
hours or hour and a half, how many people wouldn't drive if it was that easy?

1561
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.570
You know, flying to Vegas is a pain in the ass, right?

1562
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:32.330
You've got to go to the airport and then you've got to go, you know, you,

1563
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:33.270
you're doing all,

1564
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:36.620
you spend spending an hour getting ready for a 40 minute flight. Right?

1565
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:42.080
But a train is so much easier if, if it existed. Yeah. If it exists,

1566
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:43.280
why is it easier than a plan?

1567
01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:47.300
Because you just get on and you go and you can do things on the train.

1568
01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:47.661
Do you ever,

1569
01:35:47.661 --> 01:35:52.661
you ever like back east from going from DC to New York?

1570
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:55.910
I found it's easier to do it on a train.

1571
01:35:55.911 --> 01:36:00.470
It's the same amount of time is going to the airport flying and getting to your

1572
01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:05.750
cause cadets and they traveled to and from security and that time he just sit in

1573
01:36:05.751 --> 01:36:09.020
the train and sit in the train. You got Wifi, you got every, you know,

1574
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:12.410
it's easy and you go from downtown to downtown.

1575
01:36:12.411 --> 01:36:15.110
That's the other thing about trains. They don't go to airports,

1576
01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:19.640
which are way out there downtown to downtown. Where do you go on a train from?

1577
01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:24.320
LifeSafe say from downtown DC to Penn station. Like an old tiny person. No,

1578
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:28.580
I've, no, there's an express train I found. No, you know, I found this,

1579
01:36:28.581 --> 01:36:31.330
I found this out from people who do it. They realize, oh yeah,

1580
01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:34.850
that's the best way. Three, three and a half hours. Oh, that's not bad. Yeah.

1581
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:38.150
Yeah. You're definitely, it's better than driving. Yeah.

1582
01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.590
And it probably goes just as fast as a car. Probably not any faster than a car.

1583
01:36:42.850 --> 01:36:47.060
No, no fast. But if we had a high speed train that can travel it, you know,

1584
01:36:47.061 --> 01:36:51.640
200 miles an hour or whatever, 180 whatever those bullet trains, travel.

1585
01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:54.260
And I was just in Italy, we took the train over the countryside.

1586
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:58.790
It was beautiful. It was fun. Not, not bad. No. Just sitting down and relaxing.

1587
01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.100
They come by, you know, get a diet coke. It's a different, yeah,

1588
01:37:02.101 --> 01:37:04.190
it's a different form of try again,

1589
01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:08.870
not the most efficient but comfortable and disturbed me so much though.

1590
01:37:08.871 --> 01:37:13.430
When the crash, when those motherfuckers derailed. Yikes. Yeah, that well,

1591
01:37:13.431 --> 01:37:18.330
cause that's a lot of a lot of energy and there's no seatbelts now it's

1592
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:19.940
everybody just goes flying. Yeah.

1593
01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:24.170
You'll just put fucking seatbelts on trains because who's gonna wear them?

1594
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:27.740
I would wear them some, I guess. Funny.

1595
01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.020
There's not really an abrupt stop. Very old logging road.

1596
01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:37.940
That's the problem is when someone fucks up. Yeah.

1597
01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:43.040
There's a very abrupt stop. Right. But that's true. You know that's true.

1598
01:37:43.150 --> 01:37:45.950
Your car. Yeah. But you wear a seatbelt in your car. Yeah.

1599
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:49.840
Hopefully there's still people who don't, which just blows my mind. Well,

1600
01:37:49.841 --> 01:37:52.730
how about you? You're on a motorcycle. Yeah. No,

1601
01:37:52.731 --> 01:37:54.320
they talk about how crazy we are.

1602
01:37:54.321 --> 01:37:59.321
I've got an explosive fluid between my legs above a hot engine and my only air

1603
01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.350
bag or minis and your sin Saint Joe. But going in between cars too.

1604
01:38:04.351 --> 01:38:08.670
But it's easy to park. Yes. You don't drive a car at all, right? Oh yeah.

1605
01:38:08.671 --> 01:38:11.160
I drive Jew, but well, you know, when I drive,

1606
01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:13.660
like yesterday I was driving around. What kind of car? You got?

1607
01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:17.730
Some stuff right now I've got a truck, I got a um, a raptor.

1608
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:23.670
Ooh. Yeah. Big Ass fucking filler truck. Yeah,

1609
01:38:24.150 --> 01:38:28.100
it's, it's fun. Um, I'm almost over it. Really? Yeah,

1610
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:31.020
it had about a year and it's like, okay, I'm almost done with this truck thing.

1611
01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:34.200
It's fun to have this big ass truck. Like this.

1612
01:38:34.201 --> 01:38:37.530
A girl was in the truck with me and his car was pulling on and I was like, oh,

1613
01:38:37.531 --> 01:38:42.450
he ain't gonna hit me. And if he does, I'm not even gonna stop.

1614
01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:45.960
I'm gonna win. Like he's gonna hit my tire and I'm going to run over his hood.

1615
01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:50.250
But uh, yeah, but you know, that's just me. I get bored with stuff, right.

1616
01:38:50.251 --> 01:38:53.190
So I drive something for a year, year and a half, and I'm like, all right,

1617
01:38:53.191 --> 01:38:57.390
I'm over it. Let's try something else. So Lisa's, no, no,

1618
01:38:57.391 --> 01:39:00.930
because Lisa's are harder to get out of. Oh, that's true. Oh,

1619
01:39:00.931 --> 01:39:03.990
so you just know how you are. I, I've learned, I've,

1620
01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.910
I have wasted enough money over the years. I have bought my way out of shit.

1621
01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.360
You know who my brother used to love it because I would lease something.

1622
01:39:12.361 --> 01:39:13.200
This is what I found out.

1623
01:39:13.201 --> 01:39:16.050
So if you lease something for three years and you want to get rid of that too,

1624
01:39:16.051 --> 01:39:19.020
they're like, yeah, fine, but you still gotta pay us for the third year.

1625
01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:22.320
So I would call my brother like, Hey Ben, you want to drive this thing?

1626
01:39:22.530 --> 01:39:25.860
I gotta pay for it anyway. And he's like, ship it

1627
01:39:27.710 --> 01:39:30.960
back. He, no, he would pay the ship and I like, like I can't pay the shit,

1628
01:39:30.961 --> 01:39:34.620
but yeah, and you would just keep paying the bill and pay it anyway.

1629
01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:38.220
You have to get it back to the, you could return it there.

1630
01:39:38.221 --> 01:39:42.750
You could return it to any dealership. So if you lease, like I had a, a,

1631
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:48.420
what was it, the infinity at 45 and something and he,

1632
01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:51.360
yeah, so he just returned it to an infinity place there.

1633
01:39:51.361 --> 01:39:54.200
And so you realized after a few of these fuck ups, this is, yeah,

1634
01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:57.520
just buy it and sell it. You know?

1635
01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:03.140
And I hope like what I found is I'm not the only one with this disease.

1636
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.390
Like there's a bunch of us out there,

1637
01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:10.680
so I try to buy it from the guy who's just like me. Like I bought my raptor,

1638
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:15.480
it was like five months old. It had like 3000 miles.

1639
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:19.830
So like, cause that guy had the sickness, you know what I mean? So he was like,

1640
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:23.310
man, I gotta get rid of this rafter. I was like, yeah, okay, I got it.

1641
01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.210
If you're a single guy and you don't,

1642
01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:31.250
and you have a good job like you and you don't have real financial obligations,

1643
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:36.870
yeah, yeah. It's, it's so you, you just wanna try something different.

1644
01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:41.160
So it's like, okay, I don't know. I don't know. You know, I was,

1645
01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:44.940
I've been looking around and a buddy of mine just went for the new corvette.

1646
01:40:45.630 --> 01:40:48.450
He just put his money down on that and I was talking and then,

1647
01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:52.380
then I started looking. I was like, Whoa, this might be like,

1648
01:40:52.381 --> 01:40:55.840
I always had a problem with Corvettes because I've driven them. They're good.

1649
01:40:55.890 --> 01:40:57.460
They were a little small inside.

1650
01:40:57.730 --> 01:41:01.330
And also there's the baggage of having a corvette, right? Yeah. Oh look,

1651
01:41:01.331 --> 01:41:04.750
a middle aged single guy in the corvette, but this new one,

1652
01:41:04.751 --> 01:41:07.240
I don't think it carries that. I don't think it carries it.

1653
01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.960
I don't think he carries the creeper factor, you know?

1654
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:14.680
Oh well the creeper factor or fire, it'll, it'll fire up eventually.

1655
01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:16.300
I feel like it's a,

1656
01:41:16.301 --> 01:41:21.301
it's definitely the next step in terms of like design and evolution.

1657
01:41:21.521 --> 01:41:25.020
It just looks better. Oh, it's bad ass car. Yeah. I think,

1658
01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:26.890
I think they got a big hit. You know,

1659
01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:31.330
it has a gps that recognizes where you are and raises the nose up and so you

1660
01:41:31.331 --> 01:41:32.730
don't hit bumps in chits.

1661
01:41:32.731 --> 01:41:37.450
Speed bumps until it knows where like low dry are. Yeah.

1662
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:41.080
It's crazy. Yeah. We had that, like Rolls Royce had that way to like,

1663
01:41:41.081 --> 01:41:46.081
there's a camera that sees bumps in adjust the suspension for the bumps coming

1664
01:41:46.931 --> 01:41:49.530
up in front of you. That's the milliseconds. Yeah.

1665
01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:54.780
The new corvette is the fastest ever zero to 62 which is amazing because it's

1666
01:41:55.031 --> 01:42:00.031
200 plus horsepower less than the Zio six or the dizzy Zr one rather.

1667
01:42:01.570 --> 01:42:05.950
And it's still way faster, which is crazy as well. The design is, I mean,

1668
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.950
it's going to be a phenomenal, phenomenal cars.

1669
01:42:09.951 --> 01:42:13.810
So I don't want to be an earlier adopter though. I don't know if I'd be that.

1670
01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:18.850
Whoo. God Damn, that looks good in black. Yeah. Wow.

1671
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:21.490
Look at that fucking thing. That's to be, you know,

1672
01:42:21.610 --> 01:42:24.790
and they're going to be all shit gonna be all over La. Holy Shit.

1673
01:42:24.791 --> 01:42:26.620
That thing looks good. It'd be a bad ass car.

1674
01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:31.990
That is as good looking as an American car has ever been. Yeah. Literally.

1675
01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:34.930
And you know something that's like, like the Ford Gt cost, what?

1676
01:42:34.931 --> 01:42:37.600
Like a half a million dollars, not 60 grand.

1677
01:42:37.601 --> 01:42:41.140
This is 60 with the dealer markup, they'll get 70 for it.

1678
01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.770
And I bet it's just as fast. Yeah, I bet it's pretty close.

1679
01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:48.880
And it still has a trunk. Yeah, there's a trunk in the front end. The back,

1680
01:42:48.881 --> 01:42:53.360
right. That is nasty. Yeah. So that might be next. Why not, man,

1681
01:42:53.361 --> 01:42:56.050
I might be next. Fuck. Look at that God damn thing.

1682
01:42:56.140 --> 01:43:00.220
That's going to be bad ass. I love a good looking car.

1683
01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:04.240
It's going to be a bad ass monster car and the top comes off. Woo.

1684
01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.870
That's a beast, man. And that's the entry model.

1685
01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.570
And wait until they start pumping, when they start pumping up and see,

1686
01:43:10.571 --> 01:43:13.120
oh six and the year one. When is that gonna Happen?

1687
01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.780
I think in 2021 or 22 two zero s I can't wait.

1688
01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:21.250
I was going to ask, you're going to get one now that I'm looking at this.

1689
01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.750
Thank you. That's why I was, yeah, it's probably hard to get them.

1690
01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:28.210
Yeah, there's a waiting list and it, you know,

1691
01:43:28.211 --> 01:43:33.211
the dealers are gonna get a mark up and for sure that thing's nasty.

1692
01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:36.880
Tony Hinchcliffe fast one. You're not this one. His last year's one.

1693
01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:41.110
It's fucking amazing. So they're great cars. Great cars. Well,

1694
01:43:41.130 --> 01:43:43.690
you know who's going to get one like Leno is going to get,

1695
01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:47.950
does he get the first one or like which, which one did she get? Yeah,

1696
01:43:47.951 --> 01:43:52.820
he probably gets garage. Yeah. Fuck yeah, it's, I should say garages. Yeah.

1697
01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:57.500
It's gotta be confidence warehouses. Yeah, it's, it's, it's,

1698
01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:59.450
but you know what, it's what any,

1699
01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:04.460
any car nut would do with unlimited cash. Yes. Yes. Right.

1700
01:44:04.461 --> 01:44:06.290
If you had unlimited funds in Europe,

1701
01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.580
you're a gear head and he's truly a gear head. Like he knows his stuff.

1702
01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:15.190
Like he doesn't just buy it, like he actually knows all about it. Yes.

1703
01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:18.170
Fabrication Machinery in his studio.

1704
01:44:18.210 --> 01:44:23.030
He's build fenders. He's had it for so long. That's the thing.

1705
01:44:23.031 --> 01:44:25.910
It's not like three d printing isn't new to him. No.

1706
01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:31.210
I remember he has this jet powered car and the wheels,

1707
01:44:31.491 --> 01:44:36.491
he was telling me about the wheels and he said that he showed me they brake dust

1708
01:44:36.561 --> 01:44:40.050
won't stick to him. Like you know how that you get that black dusty Andy?

1709
01:44:40.130 --> 01:44:44.780
And he said, yeah, I'll call. He sent me the hunk of aluminum, like what?

1710
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:48.920
They sent him the metal and he made the wheels like, are you kidding me?

1711
01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.313
Like that's,

1712
01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:55.430
that's the extent of machining you have that you can just make the wheels for

1713
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:57.020
[inaudible] ridiculous. Brilliant.

1714
01:44:57.050 --> 01:45:01.970
He's making a wheel that is so preposterous. Yeah.

1715
01:45:01.971 --> 01:45:03.650
His place is a trip, man. I mean,

1716
01:45:03.710 --> 01:45:07.310
you could wander around it for hours and he loves explaining everything to you.

1717
01:45:07.311 --> 01:45:11.990
Oh, my favorite was, you know, he, he'll, he'll let you take in a group.

1718
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:14.180
Right. And he's really cool about this. He's like,

1719
01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:18.140
you donate money to a charity. And then he's like, okay,

1720
01:45:18.141 --> 01:45:21.830
you can bring in this many people. So it's almost like it's not selling tickets.

1721
01:45:21.831 --> 01:45:25.340
It's helping charity, you know, he does it cool now. Yeah, it was really cool.

1722
01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:29.990
So he had this guy and the guy passed away. I can't remember his name,

1723
01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:33.680
onset was Jimmy something. But, but this was the guy who would give tours.

1724
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:38.210
So he's walking around and he's like, this is this, this, what is it?

1725
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:41.850
When did we get this one? It was so, he's like, what the hell is this?

1726
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:46.520
He's probably always picking Shit up, right? Yeah. It was a guy, I was like,

1727
01:45:46.730 --> 01:45:50.070
well, where did this come from? What is dies?

1728
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:54.830
The only thing I can think is they make it a museum. Yes.

1729
01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:57.290
That's the only thing that got paid off. That's a good move.

1730
01:45:57.350 --> 01:46:00.230
I'm charged tickets. I would think I pay,

1731
01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:04.790
I would think he probably has something set up to maintain it.

1732
01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:10.010
I hope so. Because how are you going to sell those things? What are you going,

1733
01:46:10.011 --> 01:46:13.290
you know what I mean? Like what the fuck's gonna buy that steam car, right.

1734
01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:16.940
One of the steam cars like this, like a few steam cars,

1735
01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:20.750
just ones with metal wheels that he actually had rubber installed on the outside

1736
01:46:20.751 --> 01:46:22.960
of the metal wheel so he could drive around town. Yeah.

1737
01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:27.260
And then he has those giant cars that are like 25 feet long,

1738
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:31.490
but they only seat two people that look like two V12 engines in the front of

1739
01:46:31.491 --> 01:46:34.940
you. And Yeah. But it's fantastic though, you know, and,

1740
01:46:34.941 --> 01:46:38.570
and you know that. I, I love that. Um,

1741
01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:41.000
and there's a few people like that, but I don't know.

1742
01:46:41.110 --> 01:46:44.300
But anyone who does it on the scale? No, no, he does.

1743
01:46:44.301 --> 01:46:48.950
I mean j Jerry Seinfeld is uh, he's got, he's just Porsche. He's all,

1744
01:46:49.710 --> 01:46:51.480
which is weird. Corolla.

1745
01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:56.050
Adam has m Paul Newman's old race cars. You have,

1746
01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:58.110
you have been to his spot? Yes. Yeah.

1747
01:46:58.111 --> 01:47:03.111
He's got Paul Newman's old Nissan and Dotson race cars and he racism and vintage

1748
01:47:04.230 --> 01:47:07.500
races. Oh yeah. I've seen that. I've seen videos of it. Yeah. So that,

1749
01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:11.430
that's pretty cool. Yeah, that is pretty cool. You have,

1750
01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:15.150
what year is your gt? Three it's a 2007 okay.

1751
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:20.490
That is maybe the greatest car, like the gt three

1752
01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.570
in the argument, the greatest car mate.

1753
01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:29.130
It's a very exciting car to drive. It's a thrilling,

1754
01:47:29.131 --> 01:47:32.850
fun car to drive. It's super lightweight and mind's a shark works car.

1755
01:47:32.851 --> 01:47:36.120
So it's got 518 horsepower.

1756
01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:39.390
There's a place called speed Vegas.

1757
01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:43.830
It's a track outside of Vegas. You go there and you pay, you can drive whatever,

1758
01:47:43.831 --> 01:47:46.710
you know they have like Ferrari's and landlords and stuff.

1759
01:47:46.711 --> 01:47:50.730
So I've been there a few times and the last time I went they had the new gt

1760
01:47:50.731 --> 01:47:54.000
three with the rear wheel steer. Oh yeah. And I was like,

1761
01:47:54.001 --> 01:47:58.290
what if this is God's own sports car? It's like the handling,

1762
01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:03.000
you think it and it does it and the whole time you're driving it,

1763
01:48:03.001 --> 01:48:05.610
the car's laughing at you. Like I'm so much better than you are

1764
01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:11.160
in half electronic nanny shit. The new ones have.

1765
01:48:11.161 --> 01:48:15.010
But the new ones are quite a bit faster and the new one is the,

1766
01:48:15.011 --> 01:48:18.890
the gt three touring is the shit because it doesn't have all the crazy fins.

1767
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:21.480
It's because he, most of the time you're not driving and on track.

1768
01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.280
He just driving it around town.

1769
01:48:23.281 --> 01:48:28.281
So you get all the feel of a gt three but you don't ha it's more stealth.

1770
01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:32.820
It looks almost like a regular nine 11 yeah, they look man,

1771
01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:38.060
they have barely deviated from their style since like the 19 fucking sixties I

1772
01:48:40.531 --> 01:48:43.830
am such a fan of the nine 11 it's, it's my favorite car.

1773
01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:47.310
I've had a few nine eleven's of all the cars I've had, the,

1774
01:48:47.311 --> 01:48:51.150
the one I regret was the 88 turbo. I regret getting rid of that.

1775
01:48:51.151 --> 01:48:55.230
I'll always regret having gotten rid of that. That call was, it was a beast.

1776
01:48:55.231 --> 01:49:00.210
It was hard as car, but, but when it was going, it was like perfect, you know?

1777
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:04.870
And those cars there so tail happy. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. It was,

1778
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:08.850
it was trying to kill you all the time. The call was literally like,

1779
01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:12.300
if you get scared and let off the gas, I'm going to kill you. And that boost,

1780
01:49:14.370 --> 01:49:17.100
you know what I liked about it, it was motorcycle fast.

1781
01:49:17.670 --> 01:49:20.820
It was this crazy motorcycle,

1782
01:49:20.821 --> 01:49:25.770
kind of like just high rpm and then the boosts would kick in and the rear end

1783
01:49:25.771 --> 01:49:29.850
would snap and you'd just be flying like you better be pointed in the right

1784
01:49:29.851 --> 01:49:34.300
direction, you know? Have you driven a Tesla yet? Yes. He'd driven the,

1785
01:49:34.301 --> 01:49:37.830
the fast one. The p 100 no, I haven't driven that one.

1786
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:42.110
I've driven the, I guess it's the regular [inaudible].

1787
01:49:42.190 --> 01:49:45.780
I drove one with ludicrous mode though. So maybe that is a,

1788
01:49:45.781 --> 01:49:49.450
people get to experience that. So fastest thing I've ever driven in my life.

1789
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:53.860
Yeah. That's zero to 60 in like 2.4. 2.4. Yeah.

1790
01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:57.250
And then the roadster is going to come out. That's 1.9. Yeah.

1791
01:49:58.850 --> 01:50:03.670
You know that that was like when um, motorcycles went crazy with a horse.

1792
01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:06.440
I mean now their bikes would over 200 horsepower,

1793
01:50:06.441 --> 01:50:10.580
but when they first came out with like the higher bussas and stuff like that,

1794
01:50:10.581 --> 01:50:12.560
a friend who was a dealer and he said, you know,

1795
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:17.300
you're going to be able to buy the rear half of these cars. He said like,

1796
01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:20.680
people just go to open the throttle and crashing and shit. You know, he's like,

1797
01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:24.540
it's like, yeah, you can get the clean back half of a higher booths or an Arwan.

1798
01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:27.030
When you sell a kid a high of Bussa,

1799
01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:30.140
what percentage of those kids wind up cripple or dead?

1800
01:50:30.630 --> 01:50:34.850
I'm not a high percentage, honestly, not out of laundry. Nothing. Maybe.

1801
01:50:36.710 --> 01:50:40.340
But I don't even know if it's that high because if you told jokes and one out of

1802
01:50:40.341 --> 01:50:42.500
a hundred people in the crowds heads exploded. Yeah.

1803
01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:45.800
Well you haven't been to my show. I really do that Joe. I get them.

1804
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:49.880
I get so deep and cerebral. Then I throw in a Dick joke. Oh

1805
01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:56.240
No. You know the thing about, yeah, motorcycling is dangerous but

1806
01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:57.353
<v 9>okay,</v>

1807
01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:02.090
<v 1>I know why more people die on Harleys and cruiser.</v>

1808
01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:03.950
Sound like Neil degrasse Tyson right now. No,

1809
01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:08.960
I'm going to tell you the reason why is because they're the ones who they only

1810
01:51:09.531 --> 01:51:13.670
ride once in awhile and they go to a bar, right?

1811
01:51:13.671 --> 01:51:17.930
And they hang out in the afternoon drinking and then they get on their Harley

1812
01:51:17.931 --> 01:51:22.250
and go home. They don't wear a helmet and they crash and they die.

1813
01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:27.970
That happens more often than a kid racing around because you know he's a kid,

1814
01:51:28.851 --> 01:51:32.750
he's got quicker reflexes and in a real sport by guys are wearing the right

1815
01:51:32.751 --> 01:51:35.330
protective equipment cause it's part of the culture.

1816
01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:39.860
But unfortunately it happens. I was just at a motorcycle event last week.

1817
01:51:39.861 --> 01:51:44.861
I was doing a show and they do these rides and one of the guys died on,

1818
01:51:44.871 --> 01:51:47.150
you know, during the event and it was really sad.

1819
01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:51.250
But unfortunately that that's part of it. But whenever people hit me with them,

1820
01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:52.790
like yeah, people die in cars too.

1821
01:51:52.791 --> 01:51:55.720
Like that's the Neil degrasse Tyson side of it. Like yeah,

1822
01:51:55.730 --> 01:52:00.440
people die in cars too. And this is, this is what I choose to do. And I've,

1823
01:52:00.730 --> 01:52:04.250
I've managed the risk. We've talked about this, right. So you know,

1824
01:52:04.251 --> 01:52:05.630
my thing would would bikes is,

1825
01:52:05.631 --> 01:52:07.610
look if you live through your twenties you'll be fine.

1826
01:52:08.450 --> 01:52:11.510
Your twenties is when you're stupid when, but yeah, but,

1827
01:52:11.511 --> 01:52:12.680
but it would be the same thing.

1828
01:52:12.681 --> 01:52:15.950
Imagine if you had a gt three and you were 22 years old.

1829
01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:20.690
I had the odds of the fast cars when I was in my twenties I always spent all my

1830
01:52:20.691 --> 01:52:23.000
money on fast cars. Yeah. And, and you know,

1831
01:52:23.001 --> 01:52:26.540
the odds are against you on that too, you know, cause cause you do,

1832
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:30.590
you do stupid shit and also don't know how to handle them correctly.

1833
01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:34.310
Don't know the, the limitations. You don't know how to turn or stop,

1834
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:39.440
well you don't know when to turn off. Yeah. Yeah. Any you're like,

1835
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:40.520
oh that was too late.

1836
01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:44.810
Know when you feel the tires break and you're still going straight and like,

1837
01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:48.170
yeah. Or you don't know the road you're on.

1838
01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:52.070
Like you've never been on this road before and suddenly you suddenly learned

1839
01:52:52.071 --> 01:52:54.160
what decreasing radius means. Yes.

1840
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:59.720
It's just amazing how fast bikes are. And now they're making electric bikes.

1841
01:52:59.750 --> 01:53:02.990
Yeah. Don't have any shifting, which is very interesting to me.

1842
01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:06.710
Harley has a new bike. Carly's got an electric bike. The live wire.

1843
01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:10.070
No I haven't. I've written electric bike but I haven't written Harleys.

1844
01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:14.210
It's supposed to be stupid fast. Um, they, they all are. It's,

1845
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:17.210
it's all just numbers. You know, it's just like cars, right?

1846
01:53:17.211 --> 01:53:22.211
Like how many cars now have a top speed of a hundred 5,080 and most or whatever.

1847
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:26.720
But it's just the number. But cause you're, you're not going to get there.

1848
01:53:26.721 --> 01:53:30.940
Right. So it just becomes that even, even the zero to 60, you know yet.

1849
01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:31.910
Well with the Tesla,

1850
01:53:31.911 --> 01:53:36.911
you could do it cause you just step on the gas would step on the accelerator and

1851
01:53:37.581 --> 01:53:41.330
do it. But most cars yet it can go that quick.

1852
01:53:41.331 --> 01:53:46.190
But you can't cause you're not that good a driver, you know, so you,

1853
01:53:46.191 --> 01:53:48.020
you and it's the same thing with bikes.

1854
01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:52.490
So bikes can be super quick but you're not skilled enough to do it.

1855
01:53:52.491 --> 01:53:55.220
Like we laugh about it all the time. That's it right there. Yeah.

1856
01:53:55.221 --> 01:53:56.930
That's the hardest. Oh look at that thing.

1857
01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:03.230
What is that crazy shit between your legs up the batteries? Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

1858
01:54:03.231 --> 01:54:07.250
That's the batteries cause of all small. What a fucking beautiful bike. Yeah.

1859
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:11.150
What kind of um, range you think these things have?

1860
01:54:11.690 --> 01:54:14.840
The one I rode had like uh, 80 mile.

1861
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:16.970
I have no idea what the Harley miles,

1862
01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:19.950
well it can't carry big batteries like right.

1863
01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:23.630
I have no idea what the range of 110 mile range. Yeah.

1864
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:29.690
Interesting city dwelling consult, consumer travels in traffic frequently.

1865
01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:32.780
110 mile ranges were realistic. Okay. So,

1866
01:54:32.781 --> 01:54:37.781
so cut that down because 70 yeah cause you're going to be opening it up every

1867
01:54:37.941 --> 01:54:42.200
chance you get balls. Batteries will recharge from zero to 80% in 40 minutes.

1868
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:45.890
That's pretty good. That's using a stage street supercharger connection.

1869
01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:48.950
That's another thing with electric cars and electric bikes,

1870
01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:53.070
they're going to have to standardize this charging. You know,

1871
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:56.450
cause it's like okay so Tesla uses one charger.

1872
01:54:56.451 --> 01:54:59.540
Then like Audi uses a different one. Now Harley's gonna be like,

1873
01:55:00.130 --> 01:55:05.130
you're going to have to come up with some one size fits all so that you can just

1874
01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:10.340
plug your car in and charge it. You can't have each company having their own.

1875
01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:15.880
Well you have a universal ones at the airport and the airport.

1876
01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:18.380
I plugged my car into the airport this past weekend. Yeah.

1877
01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:21.050
And that's the first time I've ever done it. I was like Ooh,

1878
01:55:21.051 --> 01:55:23.580
I found a spot electric and I a yeah,

1879
01:55:23.610 --> 01:55:27.800
just a little adapter you put on their universal one and it plugs into the

1880
01:55:27.801 --> 01:55:32.210
Tesla. Okay, well that charge charge while I was gone and got their full charge.

1881
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:36.140
That'll work then. Yeah. Cause that's what I was thinking. Cause you know,

1882
01:55:36.141 --> 01:55:39.500
cause I heard like Porsche's developing a network of charges,

1883
01:55:39.501 --> 01:55:42.260
which I imagined Porsche and Audi, you're going to use the same one.

1884
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:45.870
You're right. If you have a Tesla supercharger, can you plug a portion into it?

1885
01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:49.410
I don't think so. That's stupid. Yeah, they good.

1886
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:51.840
They gonna have to figure that out. Yeah, that's weird.

1887
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.040
<v 2>Where are they going to be? Like apple, you know,</v>

1888
01:55:54.170 --> 01:55:57.670
like you only use a lightning cable. You can't use a use USB-C.

1889
01:55:57.860 --> 01:56:02.090
<v 1>I'm an apple guy. The domino where apple. This, this is where I drew the line.</v>

1890
01:56:02.091 --> 01:56:05.480
So I uh, I got the iPad right?

1891
01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:09.590
And then I got an iPad mini and then I wanted to get the pencil.

1892
01:56:10.490 --> 01:56:14.660
Do you notice a separate pencil for the mini iPad and irregular? I was like, no.

1893
01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.670
I was like, no, it's a really, yeah. Why exactly. I was like,

1894
01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:20.300
are you kidding?

1895
01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:24.320
So you want me to spend 99 bucks for each one of these pencils and then figure

1896
01:56:24.321 --> 01:56:28.460
out which one is which. Right then I can't, what if I accidentally had it was,

1897
01:56:28.461 --> 01:56:31.250
it was ridiculous. It's like, come on, do way worse than that.

1898
01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:34.790
There's a website that I follow. There's a youtube channel rather than, I follow

1899
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:39.990
<v 2>what's the guy who repairs computers and he was talking about how apple goes out</v>

1900
01:56:40.121 --> 01:56:44.770
of their way to make things so that they can't be repaired from developing

1901
01:56:44.771 --> 01:56:47.830
proprietary screws that other people don't have a screwdriver for,

1902
01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:52.510
to literally having motherboards where you cannot replace a piece,

1903
01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:56.440
it's not not possible. So this piece goes bad.

1904
01:56:56.441 --> 01:56:59.350
They have to replace the entire motherboard. And he's like,

1905
01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:02.410
that is so irresponsible. Yeah. And he's like,

1906
01:57:02.411 --> 01:57:05.590
the only reason why this exists is because people allow apple to do it.

1907
01:57:06.050 --> 01:57:10.810
He's like any other company, whether it's IBM or over Lenovo or fucking Dell.

1908
01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:14.880
When you buy a laptop from them you, there's all these parts,

1909
01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:17.920
you could bring it into a place they can replace this or replace that.

1910
01:57:17.921 --> 01:57:20.320
And here's the chip and here's the that. And it's easy.

1911
01:57:20.590 --> 01:57:25.170
But with apple they make it so it's difficult. Third party only apple. Yeah.

1912
01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:30.370
Third Party people. They don't want anyone messing with it. Fucking gross, man.

1913
01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:33.760
Yeah, it's gross. You know? And then the lightening seed, the seed cable,

1914
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:38.590
the lightning bolt a thing versus USBC lightning bolt is not as good.

1915
01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:40.780
It's not as good. The bandwidth's not as fast.

1916
01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:44.020
It doesn't transfer data or power as quickly.

1917
01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:45.080
<v 1>That's another thing.</v>

1918
01:57:45.081 --> 01:57:48.920
The cable thing is something like every time you get a new gadget,

1919
01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:50.420
you got another cable.

1920
01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:50.781
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1921
01:57:50.781 --> 01:57:55.781
Well if they just went with USBC USB standing USB secret android phone,

1922
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:59.510
every fucking one of them uses USBC. Yeah,

1923
01:58:00.170 --> 01:58:03.920
<v 1>because you, the fact that you have to carry a different k and then you're like,</v>

1924
01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:07.870
does this fit that and then you know, then yeah, it's pain in the ass. Only

1925
01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:11.350
<v 2>thing that apple has gone forward is privacy in terms of phones.</v>

1926
01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.300
They are way better with their privacy,

1927
01:58:13.690 --> 01:58:17.350
but because of that privacy and protecting your privacy,

1928
01:58:17.351 --> 01:58:19.390
that's also why apple maps suck.

1929
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:22.900
Like apple maps is not nearly as good as Google maps because Google maps is

1930
01:58:23.230 --> 01:58:27.130
following you to the bathroom and they're sending all that shit to Cupertino or

1931
01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.340
where the hell they are. They, they, they get all the data, all of it.

1932
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:34.450
Everything from ways from this, from that. That's also why it works so well,

1933
01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:35.351
you know,

1934
01:58:35.351 --> 01:58:40.351
but their text messages and all the different things is not as secure as I

1935
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.000
<v 1>message I message is all scrambled and encrypted and could well,</v>

1936
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:48.580
and the other thing would, apple is, you know,

1937
01:58:48.581 --> 01:58:52.600
for someone who's not a techie or whatever, it's the integration,

1938
01:58:52.601 --> 01:58:56.830
the seamless integration between the apple products. Oh, including your, um,

1939
01:58:56.890 --> 01:58:59.760
if you have, I, what is it? ITV? What is it? Apple TV.

1940
01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:03.580
If you have apple TV you can like type shit up in your phone.

1941
01:59:03.581 --> 01:59:07.420
Your phone syncs out, your phone syncs to your TV and your Ramon as a keyboard.

1942
01:59:07.470 --> 01:59:09.560
Yeah. That's your remote. Yeah. Every and,

1943
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:14.560
and you don't have to know how to do it. Like it says, Oh, I'm talking to blog.

1944
01:59:14.970 --> 01:59:18.790
Like, like you put the password in on your phone, then you open up your, your,

1945
01:59:19.410 --> 01:59:24.070
um, iPad and it gets the password from the phone and it's already connected to,

1946
01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:26.440
you know, whatever networking, stuff like that.

1947
01:59:26.441 --> 01:59:27.970
So you're getting better at that though.

1948
01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:31.300
They're getting closer and closer to filling the gap.

1949
01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:34.150
I mean the new Samsung phones are as good,

1950
01:59:34.151 --> 01:59:36.970
if not better than anything Apple's ever put out. Yeah. The thing is,

1951
01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:40.330
are you in the apple ecosystem? That's all it is. Yeah. Which one?

1952
01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:44.530
Which one is your normal? Yes. Which one is, are you used to it?

1953
01:59:44.531 --> 01:59:46.030
And as a hilarious bit about it,

1954
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:49.450
here's a hilarious bit about being both Vegan and android.

1955
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:54.760
Most a person could ever get discriminated against. It's fucking hilarious.

1956
01:59:55.150 --> 01:59:59.650
It's really funny that little, the little dots,

1957
01:59:59.710 --> 02:00:01.540
like if someone's, like if I send you a text message,

1958
02:00:01.541 --> 02:00:04.780
you applying and you start replying, I see the dot, dot, dot. And then it stops.

1959
02:00:05.050 --> 02:00:06.550
It's like what's going on? What happened?

1960
02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:09.050
You just use ghosted me and just pull me off.

1961
02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:10.860
You were gonna reply it and you're like, can you change?

1962
02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:15.160
But like with the green message fits an android.

1963
02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:19.540
You don't know when it's coming. You don't know. I've got that message.

1964
02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:21.490
Part of me likes that better.

1965
02:00:21.850 --> 02:00:25.390
Like I don't necessarily want you to know I read your message and it used to,

1966
02:00:25.391 --> 02:00:28.190
I used to get reflux when they know you read it. Yeah.

1967
02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:32.540
Cause now they know you're intentionally not answering me. Well.

1968
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:35.470
That's those little dot, dot, dot. Yes. Those little dot, dot.

1969
02:00:35.471 --> 02:00:39.780
Dots are ratting you out. Yeah, that's what Ian says. Oh No.

1970
02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:44.830
Need everyone to know that I read your message, man.

1971
02:00:44.831 --> 02:00:45.940
That dude is so funny.

1972
02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:51.060
He's hilarious and I'm so happy he finally has a comedy central special fine.

1973
02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:56.800
Yeah. You talk about overdue. He's so good. You know who's knacks? Owen Smith.

1974
02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:59.530
Yeah, he's a mother fan on.

1975
02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:03.190
Me and Owen were talking and we were talking about the business side cause he

1976
02:01:03.191 --> 02:01:07.750
was talking about the whole writers thing about writers giving up their agents

1977
02:01:07.751 --> 02:01:11.470
and this and that and that. And he was, he's so smart on it. But yeah,

1978
02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.490
Owen's hilarious. One of the best comics on the planet earth. Yeah.

1979
02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.360
People don't know. Great writer and great performer too. Yeah.

1980
02:01:19.690 --> 02:01:23.980
He's so funny man. I've been working with him a lot lately. Oh yeah. Yeah man.

1981
02:01:23.981 --> 02:01:26.830
We did a lot of gigs together. Especially like a providence store.

1982
02:01:27.250 --> 02:01:31.120
He's as good as anybody. Yeah, definitely. And people don't know. Definitely.

1983
02:01:31.230 --> 02:01:31.841
Hey, listen,

1984
02:01:31.841 --> 02:01:34.960
the last thing I need is people publicized in another tall black car

1985
02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:41.450
when Smith who publicizing finally got an appreciate it show. No,

1986
02:01:41.451 --> 02:01:43.040
it, it's, it's great.

1987
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:47.210
But that is funny that there's a kid named Andre Leclerc out of New York.

1988
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:51.260
Funny Guy. He did new faces last year and my manager, uh,

1989
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:53.000
signed him and I was like, you know, you know,

1990
02:01:53.001 --> 02:01:56.960
it's over when you manage your son's a younger, better looking version of you.

1991
02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:59.730
Like that's the last thing I needed was,

1992
02:01:59.870 --> 02:02:04.040
but he's a funny kid and that's not a good benefit to being good looking in

1993
02:02:04.041 --> 02:02:07.930
comedy. No. If you want to do sitcoms but they don't really exist.

1994
02:02:08.110 --> 02:02:09.080
Say if you want to do,

1995
02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:12.470
if you want to get into movies and do like a Romcom thing.

1996
02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:16.450
I think it comes like that was what Montreal was all about.

1997
02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:22.160
He got a development deal and you did sitcoms. Yeah. Now you, um,

1998
02:02:22.190 --> 02:02:25.700
well now it's streaming services and um,

1999
02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:30.050
movies I, it's still, movies are still like a different animal.

2000
02:02:30.051 --> 02:02:34.680
That's a different breed. I have zero desire but streaming services and uh,

2001
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:39.460
you know, it's really funny too, because people talk about acting like I get it.

2002
02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:43.130
I'm not an actor and I'm okay with not being an actor.

2003
02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:48.230
I like hosting stuff. Like if, and I like unscripted TV and stuff like that,

2004
02:02:48.231 --> 02:02:51.590
but, but you know, when p like, would you want to show? Well yeah,

2005
02:02:51.591 --> 02:02:53.810
of course I'd want to show. I mean, it's, you know,

2006
02:02:53.811 --> 02:02:55.820
ton of money and this and that,

2007
02:02:55.821 --> 02:02:58.970
but the actual doing it and creating it,

2008
02:02:58.971 --> 02:03:03.140
like my mind has never worked like that. You know what I mean? Like,

2009
02:03:03.141 --> 02:03:03.951
like some people,

2010
02:03:03.951 --> 02:03:08.720
they love playing characters and stuff like that and all due respect to that,

2011
02:03:08.721 --> 02:03:12.590
but it's not what I do. But people are almost like, well, why don't you,

2012
02:03:12.591 --> 02:03:17.030
and it's like, cause it's not my thing. I have a joke about that. Yeah. Yeah.

2013
02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:20.510
The comedy is the only thing where they ask you to do something else once you do

2014
02:03:20.511 --> 02:03:24.440
it right. Yeah. Yeah. If you're a cook, they never ask you, do you farm,

2015
02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:28.340
you know? Yeah.

2016
02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:31.360
But it was always the way that everybody got famous. Right.

2017
02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:35.150
[inaudible] and Seinfeld and Tim Allen and all those guys,

2018
02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:39.320
they got sitcoms based off and stand up and then they basically became actors.

2019
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:42.650
But you look at the numbers, you know,

2020
02:03:42.651 --> 02:03:46.280
there's a hell of a lot of comics for every one of them that made it to that.

2021
02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:50.330
You know what I mean? Like overwhelming. There's, you know, and um,

2022
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:52.010
but for some guys that was like,

2023
02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:54.590
the thing that drove him crazy is that they never got that call.

2024
02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:56.790
Like Richard Jenny, he was, you know,

2025
02:03:56.810 --> 02:04:00.120
I remember I saw Jenny in Montreal and uh,

2026
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.250
at the comedy works murdering God. He was funny. I mean,

2027
02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:08.930
he was a beast on stage. These people, I mean,

2028
02:04:08.931 --> 02:04:11.360
you could see his specials and you kind of get it,

2029
02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:14.510
but if you saw him in real life, you'd be like, fuck yeah,

2030
02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:17.880
he's the one of the most forgotten GM salute.

2031
02:04:18.710 --> 02:04:22.880
He was a brilliant standup. So good. I saw him, fuck.

2032
02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:25.160
Speaking of what she was talking about, a corvette,

2033
02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:29.720
a salesman trying to sell him on options on a corvette.

2034
02:04:30.110 --> 02:04:33.740
And he was talking about that in Montreal at, at the comedy works.

2035
02:04:34.130 --> 02:04:37.650
I remember sitting in the back of the room and I remember knowing that he was

2036
02:04:37.651 --> 02:04:42.420
bummed out because he couldn't get a sitcom. He had that one. Platypus man.

2037
02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:45.300
Yeah. And he was in the mask and platypus. Man.

2038
02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:50.460
The HBO special was wanted a great one hour she go ever see, have like,

2039
02:04:50.461 --> 02:04:54.750
if you can find it, it's one of the great one hours of comedy. He was a monster,

2040
02:04:55.170 --> 02:04:59.820
but he was one of those guys that really wanted a special, or excuse me,

2041
02:04:59.821 --> 02:05:02.250
really wanted a television show. Really wanting to show,

2042
02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:05.990
I wanted to be validated. You know who I am. I never understood,

2043
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:09.780
never got a show. I mean he's had shows but didn't have a sitcom. Dumb,

2044
02:05:10.170 --> 02:05:13.920
dumb or rural. Yeah. Cause he's such a natural character.

2045
02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:16.380
When he was honestly a con with Damon for awhile for, yeah.

2046
02:05:16.381 --> 02:05:21.381
I think for like half a season and he had the sports show on comedy central.

2047
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:24.100
Right, right, right. That was funny. The football show. But,

2048
02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:29.040
but it just seems like he was such a natural character, just being dumb. Like,

2049
02:05:30.150 --> 02:05:34.050
you know, nobody gives a fuck less than dom Irrera. God. That's true.

2050
02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:36.570
That's what he said. And he goes, he goes,

2051
02:05:36.571 --> 02:05:39.180
I wish I was gay just so I can come out of the closet.

2052
02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:42.940
That's how little I give a fuck. Say it.

2053
02:05:43.590 --> 02:05:46.720
I wish I was gay. Sarah would tell you I'm gay. That you know,

2054
02:05:46.890 --> 02:05:50.970
fucking hilarious. I love watching him. I love watching George Wallace.

2055
02:05:51.150 --> 02:05:55.360
So those guys are just masters of the art. Yes. Yup.

2056
02:05:55.710 --> 02:06:00.690
Just go on stage and just kill it effortlessly because it seems like George

2057
02:06:00.690 --> 02:06:04.150
Wallace is back in Vegas, is that correct? Yeah, he went back last year.

2058
02:06:04.190 --> 02:06:08.670
I do the road for a bit and he's like, ah, no. He, I think it was one of those,

2059
02:06:08.671 --> 02:06:11.670
I think they made an offer, made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

2060
02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:15.060
I think it was one of those deals. He's got that great following in veins.

2061
02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:18.510
I mean he always was things that people would go and they were on vacation in

2062
02:06:18.511 --> 02:06:21.300
Vegas. They would go to see George George. Absolutely.

2063
02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:25.830
There was like Rita Rudner had that carrot top hat that there's not a whole lot

2064
02:06:25.831 --> 02:06:30.290
of residents in Vegas these days. Not Anymore. Not like,

2065
02:06:30.330 --> 02:06:34.080
not on that level where you're aware of it, like carrot top lawyers be there.

2066
02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:38.920
But it's a tricky one. Cause if you commit to that, you give up all that, the,

2067
02:06:38.921 --> 02:06:43.020
the road momentum, you know? Well you gotta be able to market it.

2068
02:06:43.021 --> 02:06:44.700
I mean that's where George was brilliant.

2069
02:06:44.701 --> 02:06:49.350
George figured out just what you said for people to go home and tell their

2070
02:06:49.351 --> 02:06:52.340
friends, hey, when you go to Vegas you gotta see George was like,

2071
02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:57.030
he figured that out and that translates on the road and no, no,

2072
02:06:57.031 --> 02:06:59.070
you got to, uh, I mean, again,

2073
02:06:59.071 --> 02:07:02.220
you have to figure out how to build that and it takes time to build.

2074
02:07:02.221 --> 02:07:06.090
It doesn't build right away. So you gotta be working with a place.

2075
02:07:06.091 --> 02:07:08.250
So working with a producer or somebody who's like, yeah,

2076
02:07:08.251 --> 02:07:13.251
we're going to spend a year building you as a destination show and you have to

2077
02:07:13.621 --> 02:07:18.600
be willing to live in Vegas. Yeah. That's like, you're,

2078
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:23.010
you're, you're almost, you just in some weird purgatory.

2079
02:07:23.250 --> 02:07:26.940
If you can handle it, it's okay but it, but if you got advice,

2080
02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:32.130
if you have any advice, Vegas is going to find it and destroy you with it.

2081
02:07:32.131 --> 02:07:36.340
You know? Oh there's gambling or pussy or I just worked with Mau.

2082
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:38.350
Mau had this great Choco in Vegas.

2083
02:07:38.351 --> 02:07:42.160
He said Vegas is the only city you can watch someone become homeless.

2084
02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:49.090
You can watch them at the table. You just watch them. Yeah. Like your,

2085
02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.310
your whole life is falling apart right now. Yeah, I know.

2086
02:07:51.311 --> 02:07:55.930
But this next role they will let you mortgage your fucking house.

2087
02:07:56.530 --> 02:07:57.670
Absolutely. Like, yeah.

2088
02:07:58.180 --> 02:08:00.730
What do you want to do and on the role of a dicer hand of cards,

2089
02:08:00.731 --> 02:08:01.564
what do you want to do?

2090
02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:05.530
Vegas is the only gig where they will pay you in advance. Yes.

2091
02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:09.580
Pay the first night. Yeah. Want it. Here's some money. Yeah, here you go.

2092
02:08:09.581 --> 02:08:13.270
Tomorrow. Thanks. That fact. I don't know if you win too much.

2093
02:08:13.330 --> 02:08:16.870
They stop you from coming back. [inaudible] like Dana white from the UFC.

2094
02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:19.630
He gets banned cause he's really good at blackjack.

2095
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:23.620
So he'll win like $1 million in a night and they banned him from casino cause

2096
02:08:23.621 --> 02:08:26.520
they know who he is but they're banned him cause he's winning. Yeah.

2097
02:08:26.590 --> 02:08:30.250
Like what is this fucking what you only play if you win you piece of shit.

2098
02:08:30.450 --> 02:08:33.850
It's their game. But that's their house. But that's a ridiculous rule.

2099
02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:37.620
They should, they should have to go under they shit. They all, you know it's,

2100
02:08:37.690 --> 02:08:40.420
it's like their rules and they, they're all in it together.

2101
02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:43.390
But that seems like rejecting service, you know.

2102
02:08:43.391 --> 02:08:45.310
I mean it just seems like they shouldn't be able to do that.

2103
02:08:45.311 --> 02:08:46.240
And then what's the sign?

2104
02:08:46.241 --> 02:08:50.380
You always see we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Yeah. Right.

2105
02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:54.710
So where do you work when you do Vegas? I do.

2106
02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:57.890
Brad Garrett took the MGM, that's a great spot. It grew.

2107
02:08:57.900 --> 02:09:01.090
Loved that room and I just did Kimmel's new club. I heard that's great.

2108
02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:04.720
Too beautiful as well. That the Rio, no, it took the link.

2109
02:09:04.721 --> 02:09:07.240
It's that where that big Ferris wheel is.

2110
02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:10.720
They opened like that midway strip. It's on there.

2111
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:16.180
Sometimes the Rio too is not a new one. The seller. Oh, that's, yeah,

2112
02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:18.460
the sellers at the Rio. That's great too.

2113
02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:22.090
I heard that's what to Vegas has like they have the laugh factory now.

2114
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:26.230
It's comedies made like part of wide. When George left,

2115
02:09:26.231 --> 02:09:29.800
he said one of the things was like for a long time there weren't that many

2116
02:09:29.801 --> 02:09:33.730
comedy shows. He said then suddenly every place had a comedy show.

2117
02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:37.870
So that cuts into the ticket sale. That make sense?

2118
02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:42.130
The Mirage is the shit. That's my favorites yet. I fucking loved that room.

2119
02:09:42.131 --> 02:09:46.030
I used to do bigger rooms and I even if I would sell out the bigger room,

2120
02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:50.800
I'd be like, fucking Mirage. Yeah. It's so good. So now I just do the Mirage.

2121
02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:54.780
I'm there all the time. It's from where I'm standing. It's quality situations.

2122
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.030
It's the best man. It's like you. I was watching, um,

2123
02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:03.040
one time Joey Diaz was on stage and I was in the back of the room and in the

2124
02:10:03.041 --> 02:10:05.260
back of the room at the Mirage. It was cool.

2125
02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:09.340
Crystal clear sound that that works for comedy rooms. Right.

2126
02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:13.990
You gotta be able to hear him and see him. Yeah.

2127
02:10:14.410 --> 02:10:18.880
You know somebody, I forget who it was, but this, um, it was a musician.

2128
02:10:18.881 --> 02:10:22.330
He said the best room is when you can see everyone's eyes.

2129
02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:26.290
[inaudible] cause he had done like big rock concerts and all that.

2130
02:10:26.291 --> 02:10:29.740
And he was like, yeah, if you can see everyone's eyes, you got a good room.

2131
02:10:29.890 --> 02:10:33.130
That's the ice house heights or like you said, comedy works,

2132
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.880
places like that where you can,

2133
02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.660
you can actually connect with everybody in there.

2134
02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:40.580
The ice houses stuff to fuck with.

2135
02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:44.540
That might be the best the ice ever created room.

2136
02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:46.940
We used to say, if you bomb,

2137
02:10:46.941 --> 02:10:50.690
you should be allowed to go to the ice house the next day just to get your

2138
02:10:50.691 --> 02:10:53.420
confidence back. Right. Just cause like, Oh man,

2139
02:10:53.421 --> 02:10:56.180
I don't know if like you could do it, man, go to the ice house, you can do it.

2140
02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:58.190
And then you walk out like, yeah, I can do this. You know,

2141
02:10:58.191 --> 02:11:01.940
there's agents that won't accept tips from the ice house cause it's just too

2142
02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:06.420
easier with them. It's cause it's, you do great. Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

2143
02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:10.040
I saw this great comedy. Magic is, is pretty God damn good. Yeah.

2144
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:13.340
Comedy magic is like, and you know Mike and Richard,

2145
02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:17.790
they're so nice to you tonight. It's just like confuses you. Stop.

2146
02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:22.970
Cause now, cause now you've ruined people for anywhere else, you know,

2147
02:11:22.971 --> 02:11:24.200
food. Oh

2148
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:30.230
steak that you could get at a fucking steak house when I had broken my wrist,

2149
02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:34.070
right. And now I was living in studio city and this was in her most a beach.

2150
02:11:34.071 --> 02:11:38.030
So to your listeners, that's 30 miles apart in la traffic,

2151
02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:40.790
hour and half hour at least. Right.

2152
02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.690
Mike was like, you know, if you, if you want,

2153
02:11:44.691 --> 02:11:48.290
we can send a server to bring food to your house. Like if you can't like Mike,

2154
02:11:48.291 --> 02:11:50.990
I live in [inaudible]. He's like, yeah, I know. And he would've done it.

2155
02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.420
You know, it's like are you kidding me? Like

2156
02:11:55.250 --> 02:12:00.250
[inaudible] store in 2007 he reached out to my agent and said we would love if

2157
02:12:00.531 --> 02:12:03.770
Joe could work at the comedy Magic Club. We support him.

2158
02:12:04.230 --> 02:12:06.800
We'd never hired joke thieves. And you know,

2159
02:12:06.801 --> 02:12:08.690
when we know that this is going down with him,

2160
02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:12.920
we would love for him to come here. Like, he's that nice of a guy. Yeah. He's,

2161
02:12:12.921 --> 02:12:17.560
he's a, he's a super nice guy and, and Richard the manager,

2162
02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:21.110
Richard still goes places to see comics to see if they, you know,

2163
02:12:21.111 --> 02:12:25.960
good for the club. Yeah. That's like nobody does that anymore. Like you,

2164
02:12:25.961 --> 02:12:29.810
you, you got video trickles down the top, you know,

2165
02:12:29.970 --> 02:12:34.400
the love and respect of the comedians and then just to be treating performers

2166
02:12:34.401 --> 02:12:38.540
well. Yeah. And that's why all the old pros still work there. You know.

2167
02:12:38.690 --> 02:12:42.350
That's why, you know, Ray Romano was all that. Like they still go there.

2168
02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:44.900
Leno's still there every Sunday cause it's like yeah,

2169
02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:47.810
he still goes every Sunday, every Sunday. That is crazy.

2170
02:12:47.811 --> 02:12:51.370
Cause I kind of stopped for a while when he was not doing the tonight show on

2171
02:12:51.371 --> 02:12:55.100
him. Yeah, he took a break. But yeah, he's still pretty regular there on Sunday.

2172
02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.750
I haven't not seen him on stage. Do stand up ever. I have,

2173
02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:02.930
I've only seen him on television. As a matter of fact,

2174
02:13:02.931 --> 02:13:07.931
we did a benefit together last year and it was fun watching him work like as the

2175
02:13:09.501 --> 02:13:13.850
comic, you know, cause he was doing, he was doing bits and all that,

2176
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:15.620
but he'll still tell a joke.

2177
02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:19.940
But like he's a really good joke teller so he'll tell just a regular joke.

2178
02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:23.390
But it's hilarious cause it's so good. And then, and uh,

2179
02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:28.600
in Montreal I just did a gala and Howie Mandel hosted and it was so much fun

2180
02:13:28.881 --> 02:13:32.460
watching how we be a comic again, how he was doing.

2181
02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:36.450
He was cracking on the crowd like during the commercials, like what are,

2182
02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:39.930
you know, during the breaks he was just, and I was like, man, it's,

2183
02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:43.830
you could see that he was having fun, be in a comic,

2184
02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:47.880
not being a TV guy, not being a g t guy. Just, yeah,

2185
02:13:47.881 --> 02:13:51.450
I'm just being a standup comic and Gig is a great gig.

2186
02:13:51.451 --> 02:13:52.860
I'm sure he gets paid a lot of money,

2187
02:13:52.861 --> 02:13:56.130
but if you go back and listen to how he man down in the eighties and the

2188
02:13:56.130 --> 02:13:58.590
nineties when he was just doing standing up, he was fucking brilliant. Yeah.

2189
02:13:58.710 --> 02:14:02.430
He was brilliant. A lot of those guys, you know,

2190
02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:04.590
and and women with those comics,

2191
02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:09.390
people don't realize how great a comic they had to be to get that job.

2192
02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:12.390
They're like, ah, he just does that. It's like, yeah, dude,

2193
02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:13.920
our Cineo is like that.

2194
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:17.970
Like I've seen people who see Arsenio do stand up and it's like, well yeah,

2195
02:14:17.971 --> 02:14:21.930
there was a reason he got the show. They didn't just say, hey man,

2196
02:14:21.931 --> 02:14:25.800
that's a funny name. Like Arsenio's a beast when he does stand up,

2197
02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:27.720
Taylor knows one of the weirdest cases, right,

2198
02:14:27.721 --> 02:14:31.790
because he doesn't have a body of work. Well, because he never recorded it.

2199
02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:34.680
He said he would never record it because then you sell it,

2200
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:38.280
then you can't do it anymore. And they said so he would just,

2201
02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:42.180
but yet he wrote jokes every week for the tonight show. Like, Hey, Jay,

2202
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:46.500
put your shit out there buddy. I mean, people don't know. But then again,

2203
02:14:46.710 --> 02:14:50.510
you know, what did he lose? You know what I mean? It's like he didn't,

2204
02:14:50.590 --> 02:14:53.280
he certainly didn't need the money. I don't think James ever like, man,

2205
02:14:53.281 --> 02:14:56.730
I should've sold merge. You know,

2206
02:14:58.110 --> 02:15:00.780
people knowing how good he is, I would think. Yeah,

2207
02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.580
I think the people would want to know he was,

2208
02:15:02.910 --> 02:15:07.080
I guess he's comfortable where he's at, you know, and, and people do well.

2209
02:15:07.230 --> 02:15:10.200
And also, you know, if you do go see him live, that is great that you,

2210
02:15:10.201 --> 02:15:12.540
you get to see him and you get to enjoy it.

2211
02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:16.140
Nobody wears a Jean shirt unless they're comfortable. You gotta be,

2212
02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:20.220
you have to be not wear it everyday. No. God Damn you got a uniform. Yeah,

2213
02:15:20.250 --> 02:15:24.870
he does. Listen, Alonzo, I gotta wrap this up. All right.

2214
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:28.350
You got an Amazon special. It's out. What? What's the day?

2219
02:15:44.371 --> 02:15:47.550
You go to whole foods and just watch it. No, I'm kidding.

2220
02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:51.520
But what the hell owns it, right? Yeah. He owns it. No,

2221
02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:54.690
