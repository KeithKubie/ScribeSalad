so I think something almost everybody

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250
so I think something almost everybody
 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.660
so I think something almost everybody
can relate to is the mismatch some that

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670
can relate to is the mismatch some that
 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.940
can relate to is the mismatch some that
we all experience between objective time

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950
we all experience between objective time
 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.150
we all experience between objective time
and subjective time so everybody's

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160
and subjective time so everybody's
 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.829
and subjective time so everybody's
familiar with this notion that time

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:17.839
familiar with this notion that time
 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.689

boils when you're tightly engaged in a
 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:25.569
boils when you're tightly engaged in a

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579
task or where you're doing something

that you find enjoyable time we say time

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:29.899
that you find enjoyable time we say time
 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.550
that you find enjoyable time we say time
seems to fly by which means that your

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560
seems to fly by which means that your
 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.980
seems to fly by which means that your
internal clock is probably going a bit

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990
internal clock is probably going a bit
 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.420
internal clock is probably going a bit
slower than external an external clock

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430
slower than external an external clock
 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.730
slower than external an external clock
because you're surprised that maybe an

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740
because you're surprised that maybe an
 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.280
because you're surprised that maybe an
hour has elapsed an external time but

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290
hour has elapsed an external time but
 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.720
hour has elapsed an external time but
your internal clock is telling you no

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730
your internal clock is telling you no
 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.330
your internal clock is telling you no
maybe only 15 minutes have gone by now

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340
maybe only 15 minutes have gone by now
 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.580
maybe only 15 minutes have gone by now
in order to understand that it's very

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590
in order to understand that it's very
 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.190
in order to understand that it's very
important for us to distinguish between

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200
important for us to distinguish between
 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.080
important for us to distinguish between
two types of timing one we call

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090
two types of timing one we call
 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.000
two types of timing one we call
prospective timing and when we call

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010
prospective timing and when we call
 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.090
prospective timing and when we call
retrospective timing so this relates to

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100
retrospective timing so this relates to
 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.200
retrospective timing so this relates to
something called the vacation paradox so

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210
something called the vacation paradox so
 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.870
something called the vacation paradox so
maybe you're on vacation here in Athens

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880
maybe you're on vacation here in Athens
 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.090
maybe you're on vacation here in Athens
for the first time during the day you're

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100
for the first time during the day you're
 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.450
for the first time during the day you're
experiencing a bunch of new events and

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460
experiencing a bunch of new events and
 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.410
experiencing a bunch of new events and
new sights and sounds and as it's going

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420
new sights and sounds and as it's going
 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.590
new sights and sounds and as it's going
by that is prospectively it seems to be

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600
by that is prospectively it seems to be
 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.620
by that is prospectively it seems to be
flying by in retrospect however maybe

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630
flying by in retrospect however maybe
 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.539
flying by in retrospect however maybe
the next day or you're back on vacation

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549
the next day or you're back on vacation
 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.690
the next day or you're back on vacation
looking back upon that and it seems to

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700
looking back upon that and it seems to
 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.469
looking back upon that and it seems to
be a long day

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479
be a long day
 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.770
be a long day
so retrospectively it seems that it was

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780
so retrospectively it seems that it was
 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.469
so retrospectively it seems that it was
an extended period of time and this is

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479
an extended period of time and this is
 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.149
an extended period of time and this is
something that was pointed out as far

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159
something that was pointed out as far
 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.849
something that was pointed out as far
back as William James and his and his

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859
back as William James and his and his
 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.859
back as William James and his and his
principles of neuroscience over 100

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869
principles of neuroscience over 100
 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.370
principles of neuroscience over 100
years ago and the point is is that

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380
years ago and the point is is that
 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.480
years ago and the point is is that
retrospectively we're not so much

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490
retrospectively we're not so much
 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.109
retrospectively we're not so much
telling time but were rebuilding or

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119
telling time but were rebuilding or
 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.289
telling time but were rebuilding or
estimating how much time has elapsed

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299
estimating how much time has elapsed
 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.779
estimating how much time has elapsed
based on the number of experiences we

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789
based on the number of experiences we
 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.029
based on the number of experiences we
have in memory so retrospectively or

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039
have in memory so retrospectively or
 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.459
have in memory so retrospectively or
more estimating how much time has

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469
more estimating how much time has
 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.269
more estimating how much time has
elapsed if there was a period of full of

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:03.279
elapsed if there was a period of full of
 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:05.980
elapsed if there was a period of full of
new memories then you're left with

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990
new memories then you're left with
 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.510
new memories then you're left with
impression that it was a long period of

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520
impression that it was a long period of
 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.820
impression that it was a long period of
time retrospectively but prospectively

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830
time retrospectively but prospectively
 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.550

as it was taking place you were paying

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560
as it was taking place you were paying

querying that was telling you that not
much time has elapsed because you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990
much time has elapsed because you
 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.350
much time has elapsed because you
weren't paying much attention to time so

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360
weren't paying much attention to time so

prospectively you're attending to time
you're very you're at the airport their

you're very you're at the airport their
 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.880
you're very you're at the airport their

you're waiting for it for news about

whether you're going to make your trip
 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.840
whether you're going to make your trip
or not and then you find out it's going

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850
or not and then you find out it's going
 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.890

to be in six hours

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900
to be in six hours
 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.350

you're now you're just in sort of this

you're now you're just in sort of this
 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.490
you're now you're just in sort of this
this unhold mode in which time seems to

be dragging going very slowly
 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.780
be dragging going very slowly
prospectively you look back on that and

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790
prospectively you look back on that and
 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.910
prospectively you look back on that and
that's merely a blip in time there's

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920
that's merely a blip in time there's
 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.430
that's merely a blip in time there's
because retrospectively there's not many

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440
because retrospectively there's not many
 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.319
because retrospectively there's not many
items in your memory there's nothing

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329
items in your memory there's nothing
 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.390
items in your memory there's nothing
particularly exciting about visiting the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400
particularly exciting about visiting the
 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.550
particularly exciting about visiting the
plant Airport bathroom for the first

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560
plant Airport bathroom for the first
 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.140
plant Airport bathroom for the first
time so that's doesn't stick in your

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150
time so that's doesn't stick in your
 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.410
time so that's doesn't stick in your
memory so you're left with this feeling

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420
memory so you're left with this feeling
 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.170
memory so you're left with this feeling
retrospectively at that time actually

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180
retrospectively at that time actually
 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.140
retrospectively at that time actually
was not very long-lasting so you have

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150
was not very long-lasting so you have
 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.940
was not very long-lasting so you have
this paradox in which retrospectively

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950
this paradox in which retrospectively
 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.300
this paradox in which retrospectively
times seem to have not occupied much of

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310
times seem to have not occupied much of
 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.160
times seem to have not occupied much of
your your conscious experience but

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170
your your conscious experience but
 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.680
your your conscious experience but
prospectively you were aware of the
