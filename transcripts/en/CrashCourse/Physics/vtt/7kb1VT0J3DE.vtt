00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.580
Here’s a question that’s plagued physicists
for centuries.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.400
What exactly is light?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.860
When we talked about this earlier, we came
to the conclusion that light is a wave.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.980
Which it is.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.599
Or at least, light behaves like a wave, when
you you use it in certain experiments.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.360
So for most of the 19th century, it seemed
like the question had been settled.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.760
Physicists agreed: light is a wave.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.410
Then, new discoveries made them start to question
that.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.550
They started getting more and more clues that
light could also behave like a particle.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.980
Which led to the strange concept that light
was both a particle and a wave.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.100
This kickstarted the development of a
little something you might have heard of,
called quantum mechanics.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:50.440
[Theme Music]

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.860
One of the most important clues that light
had to be more than just a wave was what’s
known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.460
And that name isn’t really an exaggeration
– the ultraviolet catastrophe was disastrous for
conventional thinking about the physics of light.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.020
We’ve talked before about how objects radiate
heat.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.620
Specifically, the amount of heat they radiate
over time is proportional to their temperature
raised to the fourth power.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.880
But there’s more going on there than just
heat.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.580
Objects actually radiate energy that covers
a whole range of frequencies on the electromagnetic
spectrum – all different kinds of light.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.680
Now, there’s this thing called a blackbody,
which is basically the idealized version of
a radiating object.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.300
No true blackbodies exist, but in theory,
they absorb all incoming light without reflecting
any, and radiate energy accordingly.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.540
Not all of the energy coming from a blackbody
has the same intensity.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.840
You can predict the intensity of the energy
coming from a blackbody – or blackbody radiation
– based on its temperature.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.820
But when physicists came up with an
equation for this intensity, using the idea that
light is a wave, they ran into a big problem.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.080
The equation they came up with, known as the
Rayleigh-Jeans law, predicted that the higher
the frequency of the radiation

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.500
– and therefore, the shorter the wavelength –
the higher the intensity.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.880
And that matched up with experimental results
really well but, only to a point.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.740
Once the frequency of light got into the
ultraviolet range or higher, the Rayleigh-Jeans law
didn’t fit the results of experiments at all.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.200
Instead, experiments showed that blackbodies
had a peak intensity, based on their temperature.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.480
At a certain frequency, the light would be at its
most intense, and after that, the intensity would
actually drop as the frequency increased.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.840
The warmer the object, the higher the frequency
of the peak intensity.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.320
But there was always a peak.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.020
It wasn’t supposed to be this way.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.920
Even worse, if you summed up the contributions
of higher and higher frequencies to calculate

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.300
the total power emitted by a blackbody, the
Rayleigh-Jeans law predicted that you’d find
infinite power.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.040
Which contradicts the principle of conservation
of energy.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.080
This was the ultraviolet catastrophe.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.700
Something was clearly wrong with the way
physicists were thinking about light.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.020
As far as they knew, intensity was only supposed
to keep getting stronger, as the frequency got higher.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.420
So, what were they missing?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.460
The catastrophe was resolved using an equation
derived by German physicist Max Planck –

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.100
an equation that basically led to the entire
field of quantum mechanics.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.780
The equation, known as Planck’s law, was
actually very simple, but the concept it was
based on was very new.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.200
Planck’s law says that electromagnetic energy
takes the form of tiny, discrete packets, called quanta.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.220
In other words, at a certain point, you can’t
divide energy into anything smaller than these packets.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.080
And the energy in each quantum is equal to
the frequency of the light, times a very small

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.480
number called Planck’s constant, represented
by the letter h.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.260
If you take Planck’s law into account when you
try to predict the intensity of blackbody radiation,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.900
you end up with an equation that
predicts the experimental results perfectly,
including those weird peak intensities.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.300
So, the ultraviolet catastrophe was resolved.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.300
But now there was this whole new idea that
had physicists rethinking everything:

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.820
Energy could only exist in discrete packets: quanta.

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.829
Before, physicists thought energy was a kind
of continuous flow.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.920
But it turned out that at a certain point,
you couldn’t divide up energy into smaller amounts.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.299
Our old friend Einstein played a big part
in reworking physics using this new information

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.480
– and he won a Nobel prize for it in 1921.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.340
Einstein argued that light energy traveled in
packets we now call photons, which would
essentially make light behave like a particle.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.740
Which was weird, because remember: there
had been lots of experiments that showed that
light behaved like a wave.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.180
But Einstein suggested a way to prove whether
light traveled in these discrete packets:

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.600
an experiment involving the photoelectric
effect.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.520
The photoelectric effect describes what happens
when you shine a beam of light on a metal plate.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.340
Electrons leave the plate and hit a nearby
collector, creating a current.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.300
Einstein realized that by studying the way
the electrons left the plate, physicists could
learn a lot about the properties of light.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.860
Because, both the wave theory and the
particle theory of light predict that light knocks
electrons out of the metal.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.420
But each theory has a different explanation
for why this happens – and different predictions
when it comes to the details of the experiment.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.520
Wave theory says that when a light wave hits
an electron, it exerts a force on the electron
that ejects it from the metal.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.080
According to this theory, if you increase the
intensity of the light, you increase the strength of
the electric field hitting the electrons.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.640
So you eject more electrons, and these
electrons have a higher speed, and achieve
a higher maximum kinetic energy,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.440
which is the kinetic energy of the
fastest-moving electrons leaving the plate.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.740
One important thing to note here is that,
according to wave theory, the frequency of
the light shouldn’t make a difference.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.400
Only the intensity matters.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.220
Particle theory, on the other hand, says that
electrons get ejected from the metal when
they’re hit by individual photons.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.540
The photon transfers its energy to the electron,
which pops out of the metal.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.760
And the photon is destroyed in the process.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.640
But there’s a minimum energy that the photon needs
to transfer, in order to get the electron to overcome 
its attraction to the metal and pop out.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.900
That minimum energy is called the work function,
W_0.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.040
If the photon has less energy than the work
function, the electron won’t go anywhere.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:48.220
But if the photon has more energy than the work
function, then some of the photon’s energy will be
used up to tear the electron away from the metal,

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.740
and the rest will give the electron
kinetic energy.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.840
And some electrons will be more strongly attracted
to the metal than others.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.200
But the electrons with the maximum kinetic energy
will be the ones that took the bare minimum amount
of energy to separate from the metal.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:08.080
So, according to particle theory, we can say that the
energy of the photon is equal to the work function,
W_0, plus the maximum kinetic energy.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.540
And the energy of the photon is also equal
to Planck’s constant times the frequency.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:19.340
This equation tells you that if you increase the
frequency of the light, the maximum kinetic energy
of the electrons should increase accordingly.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:28.500
And if you go below a certain frequency – f_0
– where Planck’s constant times f_0 would be
equal to the work function – then you’re not
going to eject any electrons at all.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:35.500
This means that increasing the intensity of the
light increases the number of electrons ejected, but
it doesn’t affect their maximum kinetic energy.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.060
So if you want to know whether the wave theory
or the particle theory is right, all you have to do
is try a few simple tests:

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.760
Is there a cutoff frequency below which
electrons aren’t ejected from the metal, no matter
how long you wait?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.880
What happens when you raise the frequency
higher?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.140
And when you increase the intensity of the
light, does that affect the maximum kinetic
energy of the ejected electrons?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.840
Turns out, there is a cutoff frequency, and
the higher the frequency is above the cutoff,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.640
the higher the maximum kinetic energy is of
the electrons.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.440
And sure enough, increasing the intensity of the
light only affects the number of electrons ejected.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.560
It doesn’t change their maximum kinetic
energy.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.060
The results of all these tests with the
photoelectric effect matchup with the predictions
of the particle theory of light.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.880
So, photons really exist.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.160
Light travels in discrete packets and behaves
like a particle.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.550
But what about all those other experiments
that showed light behaving like a wave?

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.050
Well, the thing is light can behave like both.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.180
In certain circumstances, it can behave like
a particle.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.240
In others, it can behave like a wave.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.360
This is called the wave-particle duality.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.340
When it comes to the physics of the very small,
your intuitive understanding of the world
just doesn’t apply.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.240
You can’t describe things like light using
the concepts you’re used to, that work on
a larger scale.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.780
When you’re trying to explain something totally
outside the way you’ve directly experienced the world,
you’re going to run into some brain-bending physics.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.600
And the discovery of Planck’s law – along with the
idea that light energy traveled as discrete packets –

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.360
turned into the foundation for the concepts and
equations that we use to analyze the behavior
of the very small.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.900
And that field of physics, which studies how
quanta behave, is what we call quantum mechanics.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.580
Today, you learned about the ultraviolet catastrophe,
and how it was resolved by Planck’s law.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.400
We also talked about photons, and how the
photoelectric effect proves the particle nature of light.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.060
Finally, we discussed the wave-particle duality.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.530
