1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,530
In regards to subordinate leadership.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,580
How do you begin to change the culture
slash school of thought of an industry or

3
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:08,414
a company?

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,270
You know,

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,750
I'm not sure if they mean in regards
to how do you change your subordinate

6
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:20,170
leaderships or if you are subordinate.
I'm not sure what,

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,090
which one of those it is,
but regardless,

8
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:26,080
doesn't matter because guess what I'm
going to do? I'm going to lead you.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,840
That's what I'm going to do.
Whether I'm on,

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,100
whether I'm the subordinate guy or
the superior guy, I'm going to lead,

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,370
oh, we're going to, I want to change
things and make them a certain way. Cool.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,010
I'm going to do those things.
I'm going to make those things happen.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,860
That's how you do it and if you're doing
the right things for the right reasons,

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,010
your message is going to spread.
Yeah.

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:53,230
You know how many bad sequel
platoons I was in? How many? Zero.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,330
You know why? Because me and my
buddies, we always had a good attitude.

17
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,810
We always had the right attitude and
that spread to the other people that were

18
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:05,630
with us. [inaudible] now

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,850
there's a red flag that
you can get for yourself.

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,560
And this is frustration when
you start saying yourself,

21
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,470
which I'm not saying this necessarily,

22
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:23,580
but this kind of question is coming from
somebody that wants change to happen,

23
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:24,480
but it's not happening.

24
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:27,720
So they're getting frustrated and they're
thinking they aren't on board or they

25
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,300
don't care and they aren't professional.

26
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,790
They're not motivated like me,

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,030
and they don't have a good attitude.

28
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:38,970
So there's a lot of blame
going on right there. Yeah.

29
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,860
So this isn't about them though.
It's about you.

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,030
And it's about leading from any
level in the chain of command.

31
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,600
If you're leading,

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,800
if you're doing the right
things for the right reasons,

33
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,640
that's going to spread. So
when I, the classic example,

34
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:04,450
I talk about it all the time is if
you're exercising extreme ownership,

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,930
if you're saying, you know
what, I got this, it was a
mistake made, it was my fault.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,450
That spreads.
If you're humble,

37
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,670
that spreads.
If you have an open mind that spreads,

38
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,570
if you're being aggressive, not, again,
not aggressive towards other people,

39
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:27,880
but if you're being aggressive in pursuit
of your goal, that spreads [inaudible].

40
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,770
You know what doesn't spread is when
you're aggressive at people. Oh,

41
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,030
actually it does spread, but it's
negative. You don't want that, you know,

42
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:38,840
it doesn't spread.

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,510
It doesn't spread when you're trying
to get people to do things because it's

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,390
gonna make you look good.
Yeah. That doesn't spread.

45
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,890
You can't get people to behave
better because you want to look good.

46
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:53,270
It doesn't work. Yeah. People
see right through that. Oh,

47
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:55,880
he wants to look good. You know
what? I'm gonna do sabotage.

48
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,930
Now,
the other thing I've been seeing lately,

49
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,210
because people are surprised or whatever,

50
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,240
or not surprised,
but they're concerned,

51
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,080
they don't see how it's going to work
so fast. And I say, you know what?

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,100
It's not gonna work fast. It's
gotta be, and here's the word.

53
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,550
It's got to be a campaign.
It's gotta be a campaign.

54
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,640
It's not like World War
II was not one battle.

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,290
World War One was not one battle.
It's a campaign to win in Europe.

56
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,260
It's a campaign to win in the Pacific.

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,230
They takes battle after battle
after battle. And guess what?

58
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:40,080
You don't win them all. Yeah. You lose
some of them. And so you're going to,

59
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,670
on this campaign, you're going
to win and you're going to lose.

60
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,940
But you got to have the persistence and
the patience and the persuasiveness to

61
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:50,860
continue [inaudible]

62
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,220
and another piece of this is, okay, cute.

63
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,370
You are best off if you go
indirect and not be like,

64
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,090
Hey, you need to act like me. No,

65
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,450
people don't like that.

66
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,420
[inaudible] you need to
just act how you're acting.

67
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,740
And if you're doing it though,
like I said,

68
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,390
the right things for the right reasons,

69
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,290
people are going to see you and
they're going to follow. Mm.

70
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,690
So that's how you begin to
change the school of thought.

71
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,101
Yeah.

72
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:34,510
That genuineness like tends to show
itself or that like if you're not genuine,

73
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:35,860
it tends to show itself,
you know,

74
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,590
just because of the dynamics
of Vinny mind tends to,

75
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,720
it just straight shows itself.

76
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,830
So when you're doing it for
the right reasons like you,

77
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,450
you can't help but expose that, you
know, that will be explicitly, yeah,

78
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,990
people will sign up, sign right
on, and then you end up gaining,

79
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,960
like how you say it's a campaign. It's
like you'll gain a little bit of ground.

80
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:55,540
You might win this guy over,
like, hey wait, that's, you know,

81
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,480
that's a cool way of doing it,
or whatever the group is.

82
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,890
And you make these small little steps
and you kind of hold that ground and yet

83
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,650
before you know it, it's Kinda of, Dang,
the whole culture of this, I don't know,

84
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:08,940
office or whatever.
It's Kinda changing you.

85
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,050
It just happens.
