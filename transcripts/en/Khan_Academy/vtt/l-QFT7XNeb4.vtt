(pop music)

00:00:03.626 --> 00:00:07.552
Larry: It started with just a
few little videos on algebra

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:11.447
to help out a cousin who
needed assistance in school,

00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:15.128
and, from there, it grew
and grew and grew into more

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:21.049
than 3,200 YouTube videos,
giving all kinds of instruction.

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:24.724
It's known as the Khan Academy,
but, more than just that,

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.231
it's leading to a rethinking
of how education is

00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:30.046
delivered in the nation's
classrooms and at home.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:32.466
Salman Khan's new book, The One World

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.836
School House: Education Reimagined.

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:36.391
Sal, thank you for joining us.

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:37.351
We appreciate it very much.

00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:37.960
Sal: Thanks for having me.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.065
Larry: Take us back to what was going on.

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:43.350
Here you are, you're doing your

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.985
hedge fund management and research,

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:48.747
and you have a cousin who needs some help.

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:50.392
How does it all spring from this?

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:52.246
Sal: Yeah; she needed help.

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:53.598
She's 12 years old.

00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:55.969
She was in New Orleans,
which is where I grew up.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.391
I was in Boston at the time.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.558
I offered to tutor her
everyday after work for me,

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.935
after school for her; she agreed.

00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:03.748
It worked out.

00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:07.263
We just work out, do it
over the phone, and we used

00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:09.756
a little bit of this Yahoo
Chat to kind of communicate.

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:12.764
She eventually got into the kind of

00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:14.762
the more appropriate math track for her,

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:16.647
and I start tutoring her brothers.

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:19.182
Word got around in the family
that free tutoring was happening.

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:20.950
So, you fast forward about 18 months,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.747
and I was tutoring about
10 or 15 family members

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:25.849
everyday after work; and it was a friend-

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.679
By this point, I had moved
out to Northern California,

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.947
and a friend said, "Well,
to help yoursef scale,

00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:32.054
"why don't you put some
of these on YouTube?"

00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:35.197
and I thought it was a silly
idea, that YouTube was for

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:39.195
cats playing piano, but I gave it a shot.

00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:41.779
&gt;From there, it just caught on, I guess.

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:44.472
Larry: How long did it take
for the word to get out

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:46.913
and for people to start
using these videos?

00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:51.062
Sal: It was just this I
think word of mouth thing,

00:01:51.062 --> 00:01:53.979
that starting in 2006 a parent
would tell another parent,

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.294
a student would tell another student,

00:01:55.294 --> 00:01:56.654
a teacher would tell another teacher.

00:01:56.654 --> 00:02:00.349
By 2009, there were several
hundreds of thousands

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.380
of people using it on a regular basis.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.849
That's when I quit my day
job to start this as a

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.748
not for profit and work on this full time,

00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:11.348
and then, by 2010, it had grown.

00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:14.149
By that point, we started to get
a little bit of press as well.

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.549
We're now at about
almost 7 million students

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.411
every month are using it.

00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:18.852
Larry: Wow.

00:02:18.852 --> 00:02:22.452
There's a criticism from
The Washington Post,

00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:26.152
where this teacher has his
own company, I guess it is,

00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:28.808
and was featured in a blog
in The Washington Post,

00:02:28.808 --> 00:02:32.151
and part of the knock was
that you said you spend

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.951
a couple of minutes researching and do it,

00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:36.650
but I thought part of the
appeal of the videos is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.303
there is a sort of a naturalness there.

00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:43.339
It's the less formal aspect of
it I think is part of the appeal.

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:44.053
Sal: Yeah.

00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:46.052
I think there's two
dimensions to preparation.

00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:48.472
I think one dimension is
preparation of your mind,

00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:50.555
which is hopefully happened
over your entire lifetime,

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:52.889
but obviously if I go
into a topic that I'm not

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.472
expert in at the moment,
I will spend hours on it.

00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:58.550
But I agree with you.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.670
I think what people connected to
was it was very conversational.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.750
They could tell it was some guy
making this for his cousins.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.385
I didn't edit out my thought processes.

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:09.390
You could kind of hear
me thinking in real time.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.752
Sometimes I would go down one avenue,

00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:13.751
that was a logical avenue, but say,

00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.069
"Well actually, this isn't working out.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.894
"Let's back up."

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:17.751
Too often in math and science,

00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:20.389
you just get the final
solution, and it seems

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.671
so easy and perfect, but
it seems impossible to you.

00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:25.262
I think people appreciated
that it felt much more human,

00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:26.730
much more approachable in this way.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.649
Larry: Much like it is
in a show like this,

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.151
which is unscripted and a conversation,

00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:33.559
or a program like Morning Edition,

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.471
where it's all scripted
and you have two anchors.

00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.883
Both have their place.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.154
They're just different approaches.

00:03:38.154 --> 00:03:39.059
Sal: Exactly.

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.152
I think when I talk to a lot of
... and I've had the privilege of

00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:44.552
working with a lot of amazing
teachers, and they tell me.

00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:46.561
I mean, the things that
connect with students more

00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:48.051
are the ones that are unscripted.

00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:50.159
Your mind has to be very
clear and very distilled about

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.651
what you want to talk
about and how you might

00:03:51.651 --> 00:03:54.386
communicate it, but
humans realize when you're

00:03:54.386 --> 00:03:56.490
reading something versus
when you're actually

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.766
thinking and communicating
from your heart.

00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:01.990
Larry: Let's talk about
taking this as a model

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.985
and incorporating it into
the classroom in Los Altos,

00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:08.166
up in the Bay Area, where you reside.

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:09.842
They're actually incorporating this.

00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:10.848
How does it work?

00:04:10.848 --> 00:04:13.051
Sal: They first reached out to us 2010,

00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:14.451
when we got our first real funding from

00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:16.185
Google and the Gates
Foundation to work on this.

00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:18.951
At the time, we thought it was
a completely supplemental thing.

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:21.099
Khan Academy is your free tutor out there.

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.760
But, as I write about in the book,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.273
they kind of reached out to us and said,

00:04:24.273 --> 00:04:26.847
"What would you do with a
5th grade math classroom,

00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:28.738
"now that you exist, your tools exist?"

00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:31.637
I said, "I don't think
it makes sense to use

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.787
"class time to give lectures anymore.

00:04:33.787 --> 00:04:36.357
"Lectures might be useful, but now you can

00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:38.537
"pause and repeat and
watch them on demand.

00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:40.537
"Let's use class time for
something more constructive.

00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:42.643
"Why don't we ask student
teaching each other?

00:04:42.643 --> 00:04:44.739
"Why don't we have more one
on one time with the teacher?"

00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:47.244
And as soon as you also remove
lectures from the classroom,

00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:49.239
now, all of a sudden,
you don't have to have

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:50.737
every student working at the same pace.

00:04:50.737 --> 00:04:52.743
You could have them all kind of

00:04:52.743 --> 00:04:54.440
mastering concepts then moving on.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.982
They thought it was an interesting
idea, so they gave it a shot.

00:04:57.982 --> 00:05:01.561
This was two years ago, and since
then it's been district-wide,

00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:04.238
and they've been seeing some
pretty interesting results.

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:07.440
Larry: You know the
criticism that some have,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.143
the concern is that for the students

00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:11.739
who don't have much parental support,

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:14.055
have difficult time
getting access to computer,

00:05:14.055 --> 00:05:15.393
they're going to be left behind,

00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:17.063
and the whiz kids are going to do great

00:05:17.063 --> 00:05:18.645
because they can go at their own pace.

00:05:18.645 --> 00:05:20.737
Sal: Well, I think this addresses that

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.491
more than the traditional model does.

00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:24.739
The traditional model
that we all grew up in,

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:26.388
you go home, you have homework,

00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:28.238
and that's where frankly
a lot of the learning

00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:30.480
should happen, when you're
doing the problem solving.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.386
It's the educated kids
who have older siblings,

00:05:34.386 --> 00:05:36.090
or who have parents who might be able to

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.426
help them on the
schoolwork, or whose parents

00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:39.804
are even home and they're not at work,

00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:41.473
and then they go to class
and they do something

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:43.057
very passive and they get frustrated.

00:05:43.057 --> 00:05:45.393
What we're advocating is
that actually doing the

00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:47.338
problem-solving, which is
a much more important part,

00:05:47.338 --> 00:05:50.239
in class, where they're
surrounded by peers

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:51.540
and they have a support network,

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.282
so you don't have the child whose parents

00:05:53.282 --> 00:05:55.037
aren't home from work or
whose parents don't have

00:05:55.037 --> 00:05:57.320
a high school diploma, who can't help them

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.357
on an algebra homework,
getting frustrated.

00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:00.781
Now they're in class; they're surrounded.

00:06:00.781 --> 00:06:02.940
They have the teacher, the
peers, there's a ton of help.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.776
There's one classroom
where there was a student

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:06.039
who spoke very little English.

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.037
In a traditional classroom,
that kid would just be

00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:11.275
left behind, even though
actually we found out

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:12.688
he was quite good at mathematics.

00:06:12.688 --> 00:06:14.934
What allowed to happen
in this model is that

00:06:14.934 --> 00:06:17.540
the teacher was able to
spend extra time with him.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.370
The teacher didn't speak Spanish,

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.782
but several of the students
did, and so the students

00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:23.539
were able to be peer tutors and make sure

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.239
that the student could keep up.

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:28.238
I think there is an issue
about access to technology,

00:06:28.238 --> 00:06:30.692
and we are working at
charter schools in San Jose

00:06:30.692 --> 00:06:32.939
and Oakland, places that
are more underserved,

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:36.268
but actually they were seeing
some of the biggest gains.

00:06:36.268 --> 00:06:38.951
The trick is how do we give
access to the technology?

00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:41.757
But you could do it by keeping
computer labs open longer,

00:06:41.757 --> 00:06:43.749
by having after school
programs and other things.

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:45.668
Larry: So even if they're
not a quiet space at home,

00:06:45.668 --> 00:06:47.674
there's another place that kids can go

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:49.257
to see those lectures.

00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:50.757
We're talking with Salman Khan.

00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:53.168
He's the founder of the
nonprofit Khan Academy,

00:06:53.168 --> 00:06:55.506
and author of The One World School House:

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:58.595
Education Reimagined;
and part of the case that

00:06:58.595 --> 00:07:00.668
he makes in this book is that the kind of

00:07:00.668 --> 00:07:03.540
low cost delivery of
education in this model

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.257
could revolutionize
underdeveloped countries,

00:07:06.257 --> 00:07:09.451
those that just don't
have access to education,

00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:12.944
that this could be a huge
way of addressing that.

00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:14.669
How would you, though, deal with

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.174
that kind of problem
solving, the in classroom,

00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:20.520
the need for the educated professional?

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.668
Sal: Yeah, well, in the developed world,

00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:24.509
where students have access to a teacher,

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:28.595
I think this supercharges
that physical part of it.

00:07:28.595 --> 00:07:31.750
This isn't about virtual versus physical.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.050
It's not Amazon.com
versus Barnes and Noble's.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.056
This is about let's take
lecture off the table,

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:40.655
because lecture, and we have
in the book a study that proved

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:43.576
that lecture is probably the
worst possible use of time

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:45.152
and very little learning actually goes on,

00:07:45.152 --> 00:07:47.751
make that on demand, at a student's time,

00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:49.570
they can remediate and not be embarassed,

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.789
and make class time all
about problem solving,

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:53.287
all about interaction with the teachers.

00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:54.954
So, in our mind, if you have a teacher,

00:07:54.954 --> 00:07:56.751
they become that much more valuable

00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:58.371
because you get to interact with them.

00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:01.151
In the developing world, you
have a different problem.

00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:03.452
Even if you have the
resources, you might not have

00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:06.551
a teacher in the village
who can address that topic.

00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:09.648
Even if you do, the students are
at all different skill levels.

00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:10.783
Some might be illiterate.

00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:13.146
Some might be somehow roughly
at their own grade level.

00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:15.440
What we say is, in those context,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.877
and there's an orphanage in Mongolia,

00:08:16.877 --> 00:08:19.223
actually several that
are using us in this way,

00:08:19.223 --> 00:08:21.646
it's better than nothing.

00:08:21.646 --> 00:08:23.957
It can give you a very
strong academic scaffold.

00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:26.375
You have a community of learners
online who can help you.

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.569
And sometimes you're getting help

00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:29.952
from a teacher on the
other side of the planet,

00:08:29.952 --> 00:08:31.576
or another student on the
other side of the planet.

00:08:31.576 --> 00:08:32.936
Or some of these kids are actually

00:08:32.936 --> 00:08:34.451
helping kids in the developed world.

00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:37.653
So, for us, it's not an either/or.

00:08:37.653 --> 00:08:39.683
The ideal is you have amazing teachers,

00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:41.897
but if you have nothing,
like these orphanages

00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:43.650
in Mongolia, you're getting something.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.250
Larry: You can use
webcams, things like that

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.486
to be able to make a two-way,

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.393
interactive followup to online lectures?

00:08:51.393 --> 00:08:53.064
Sal: Yeah, that's stuff
that we have planned.

00:08:53.064 --> 00:08:54.750
I talk a lot about it in the book.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.394
I think Khan Academy is in
very, very early stages,

00:08:57.394 --> 00:08:58.985
and we set it up as a not for profit,

00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:01.342
so it really has this potential
to be this institution

00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:03.897
to deliver education
for the world for free.

00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:06.144
I hope in 50 or 100 years, well after ...

00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:07.853
well, hopefully I'm around in 50 years,

00:09:07.853 --> 00:09:11.250
but even after I'm gone,
people will still be

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.066
working on the problem
of how can we make this

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:14.393
more interactive, more engaging,

00:09:14.393 --> 00:09:15.751
and connect more learners
around the world?

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.752
Larry: Salman Khan,
author of The One World

00:09:17.752 --> 00:09:20.650
School House: Education Reimagined.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.254
I'd love to hear from you
your questions or comments

00:09:23.254 --> 00:09:26.051
about Khan Academy, about the more than

00:09:26.051 --> 00:09:29.293
3,200 YouTube teaching
videos that are there,

00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:31.230
how it's being used by school districts,

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.329
by individual schools as well.

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:40.230
We're at 866-893-KPCC, 866-893-5722,

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.871
or the AirTalk page at KPCC.org.

00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:46.530
TR asked an interesting
question he has on the page,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.956
"Are there tests that an
adult can take to assess

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:52.230
their math shortcomings
on the Khan Academy site?"

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.126
Sal: Yeah.

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.829
That's what we're working on right now.

00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:56.552
We already have a significant exercise.

00:09:56.552 --> 00:09:58.380
Anyone can go to Khan Academy, log in.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.728
Actually, our team now, we're
36 people; it's not just me.

00:10:00.728 --> 00:10:03.041
Most of them are software
engineers and educators

00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:05.557
who are working on exactly
what's being described.

00:10:05.557 --> 00:10:07.329
You get as many problems as you need.

00:10:07.329 --> 00:10:08.289
It assesses you.

00:10:08.289 --> 00:10:09.742
It keeps progressing you forward.

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.295
You get feedback on what you're doing.

00:10:11.295 --> 00:10:13.629
What we want to do is
broaden that to well beyond

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:15.631
mathematics, so you can
get assessment on things,

00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:17.785
diagnostics, and then show what you know,

00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:19.329
and if you're having
trouble in a certain domain,

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:21.372
there are these tutorials
that can help you out.

00:10:21.372 --> 00:10:22.631
Larry: One thing I forgot to mention,

00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:25.230
because this is really a
central part of your approach,

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.929
is that everybody needs to be able to show

00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:30.036
that they've mastered a step before

00:10:30.036 --> 00:10:31.459
they move on to the next one,

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:34.542
and schools are in a tough
spot trying to do that.

00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:37.290
Sal: I talked about in
the book pretty heavily is

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.829
all the debate about education
essentially misses the point.

00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:43.729
It's all kind of on the fringes
of this model that we have

00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:46.131
that few people realize we
inherited from the Prussians,

00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:49.630
a country that does not
exist anymore, 200 years ago.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.547
The Prussian model was based on how do we

00:10:52.547 --> 00:10:54.527
educate a lot of people cost effectively?

00:10:54.527 --> 00:10:56.638
Well, it was the beginning
of the industrial revolution,

00:10:56.638 --> 00:10:57.835
so we'll do the same thing.

00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:00.223
We'll bash them together
in these age cohorts.

00:11:00.223 --> 00:11:01.545
They go to the same pace.

00:11:01.545 --> 00:11:03.837
They go to these stations,
which are these classes.

00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:05.553
Knowledge is applied to them.

00:11:05.553 --> 00:11:07.736
Some, it sticks; some, it doesn't.

00:11:07.736 --> 00:11:10.637
Then you sift out the product,
and some become doctors

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:13.337
and some don't become
doctors or engineers.

00:11:13.337 --> 00:11:15.964
What we're saying is we think we can

00:11:15.964 --> 00:11:17.543
break out of that
Prussian model now because

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:19.882
that Prussian model
pretty much dooms people

00:11:19.882 --> 00:11:21.969
to hit walls in their understanding.

00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:25.336
Right now, in the model,
you get a C on your exam

00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:28.337
on basic exponents, it moves you
to the next topic the next week,

00:11:28.337 --> 00:11:30.238
where you go to negative
exponents or logarithms,

00:11:30.238 --> 00:11:31.936
somehow expecting you to master that,

00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:34.480
even though you had that weak foundation.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.401
And so, we say no.

00:11:36.401 --> 00:11:39.067
Master that concept, at least
get a basic proficiency in it,

00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:42.096
and only then is it realistic
for you to be able to

00:11:42.096 --> 00:11:43.800
understand something
that builds on top of it.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.932
Larry: It's funny, when I was in
6th grade, it was way pre-Internet,

00:11:46.932 --> 00:11:50.047
I was in an experimental
classroom public school

00:11:50.047 --> 00:11:51.738
in Inglewood here in Southern California.

00:11:51.738 --> 00:11:54.139
They were trying something
where they combine

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:57.939
5th and 6th grade, so it
was a joint classroom,

00:11:57.939 --> 00:12:00.337
and there was almost no lecture.

00:12:00.337 --> 00:12:01.837
The teacher sat in the middle of the room,

00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:05.462
and we had work stations in
different subject areas, again,

00:12:05.462 --> 00:12:09.430
so there are no videos, essentially,
but all kinds of stations.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.337
You work at your own pace.

00:12:10.337 --> 00:12:11.966
There were tests along
the way to make sure

00:12:11.966 --> 00:12:13.547
you had mastery before you moved on;

00:12:13.547 --> 00:12:15.960
and it was my favorite
year of school, because

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.138
in areas where I was good,
I could go really fast;

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:22.046
in areas where I needed more
help, I had the teacher available,

00:12:22.046 --> 00:12:24.882
one on one, to be able
to help me through it.

00:12:24.882 --> 00:12:28.230
I don't know how long that ever
last or what happened to it,

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.551
but for me it was perfect
for my learning style.

00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:34.137
It just seems like those
kinds of experiments

00:12:34.137 --> 00:12:36.048
were often very hard to
come by when you've got

00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:39.298
such disparate student
level of achievement.

00:12:39.298 --> 00:12:40.138
Sal: Yeah.

00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:43.380
I think what you're describing,
it's not just for you.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.635
I think almost any human being

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:46.138
would say that is how
they naturally learn.

00:12:46.138 --> 00:12:48.633
In the book, I talk about that
is how people naturally learn,

00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:50.952
through activity, through personalization,

00:12:50.952 --> 00:12:52.537
through interaction
with other human beings.

00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:55.036
What I think is special
about this time in history

00:12:55.036 --> 00:12:56.567
is that there are many
experiments like the one

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.536
you were a part of in your childhood.

00:12:58.536 --> 00:12:59.779
There are a lot of schools that are moving

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.279
in that direction, but
it's not mainstream.

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:03.445
What we're seeing now is
because of the technology,

00:13:03.445 --> 00:13:05.635
because of this broad
adoption that things like

00:13:05.635 --> 00:13:08.452
Khan Academy are seeing, it's
starting to be mainstream.

00:13:08.452 --> 00:13:11.370
The coordination is starting
to empower teachers to do that.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.038
Larry: We still do group projects, too,

00:13:13.038 --> 00:13:14.250
which I know your summer camp,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.365
that's a big part of it, right?

00:13:16.365 --> 00:13:17.137
Sal: Right.

00:13:17.137 --> 00:13:19.638
One thing I talk a lot about
in the book is everyone's

00:13:19.638 --> 00:13:21.736
all paranoid about are we
falling behind Estonia or

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:25.362
South Korea or Finland because
of our algebra test scores,

00:13:25.362 --> 00:13:28.236
and it's worth not being
complacent about that,

00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:32.137
but what I emphasize
is America is becoming

00:13:32.137 --> 00:13:34.036
more and more the center
of the world's innovation,

00:13:34.036 --> 00:13:36.336
and that's because we have
this culture of creativity.

00:13:36.336 --> 00:13:38.638
Failure isn't stigmatized.

00:13:38.638 --> 00:13:40.538
What I see, instead of
making our Prussian model

00:13:40.538 --> 00:13:42.737
more like the one in
Finland or South Korea or

00:13:42.737 --> 00:13:45.452
Singapore, let's make ours more American,

00:13:45.452 --> 00:13:47.365
where it's more personalized, more time

00:13:47.365 --> 00:13:49.870
with other human beings,
and time for creativity.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.946
Creativity is probably the single

00:13:50.946 --> 00:13:53.452
most important thing today,
but our current model

00:13:53.452 --> 00:13:55.947
completely squeezes time
for it out of the equation.

00:13:55.947 --> 00:13:58.236
Larry: Bill in Huntington
Beach, you're on AirTalk.

00:13:58.236 --> 00:13:59.290
Bill: Hi.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:04.037
I want to express my
gratitude for the Khan Academy

00:14:04.037 --> 00:14:07.784
and all the tapes that are out there.

00:14:07.784 --> 00:14:14.537
I'm a 55-year-old grad student,
returning to civil engineering.

00:14:14.537 --> 00:14:19.567
It's been 30 years since I first
took calculus and I'd lost it all.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.952
And so, I really literally
relearned the subject

00:14:22.952 --> 00:14:25.427
over the span of a few months.

00:14:25.427 --> 00:14:28.565
Thanks to Sal and his great tapes.

00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:30.738
Larry: Wow; so not just kids?

00:14:30.738 --> 00:14:31.738
Sal: No.

00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:32.951
We see that in the data.

00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:35.788
Stories like that is what
keep our whole team motivated.

00:14:35.788 --> 00:14:38.536
Larry: Maurice in San Dimas, welcome.

00:14:38.536 --> 00:14:40.135
Maurice: Hi, Larry.

00:14:40.135 --> 00:14:42.447
My wife is a teacher
in San Gabriel Valley,

00:14:42.447 --> 00:14:45.788
teaching chemistry, and
she loved the videos,

00:14:45.788 --> 00:14:49.639
and actually uses it
as homework assignments

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.038
as a review, more than anything.

00:14:52.038 --> 00:14:54.866
The main problem that I see
is that the school district

00:14:54.866 --> 00:14:56.837
doesn't let her actually play the videos

00:14:56.837 --> 00:14:59.227
in the classroom because it's on YouTube.

00:14:59.227 --> 00:15:00.429
Sal: Yeah.

00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:03.777
That's a very real issue.

00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:05.302
A lot of classrooms block YouTube.

00:15:05.302 --> 00:15:07.016
Some countries block YouTube.

00:15:07.016 --> 00:15:10.961
On Khan Academy, there's
like a little link where

00:15:10.961 --> 00:15:13.545
you can acces it on mirrored
sites, some of the videos,

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:16.881
but I think school districts are ...
and that's a short term solution.

00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:18.244
The school districts
are starting to realize

00:15:18.244 --> 00:15:20.045
that YouTube does have educational value,

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.543
and YouTube is starting
to realize that as well.

00:15:22.543 --> 00:15:24.964
I think collectively we're
all working on solutions

00:15:24.964 --> 00:15:26.545
to address exactly what you described.

00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:28.047
Larry: Roxanne in West Lake Village

00:15:28.047 --> 00:15:30.373
says she's a math tutor, refers students

00:15:30.373 --> 00:15:31.962
to Khan Academy all the time.

00:15:31.962 --> 00:15:34.460
Then parents ask, "Why do
I need to hire tutors?"

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.345
But there's still a great need because

00:15:36.345 --> 00:15:38.373
kids need to practice the hands on,

00:15:38.373 --> 00:15:40.243
just like when learning baseball.

00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:42.043
Sal: Once again, Khan
Academy is not there to

00:15:42.043 --> 00:15:43.845
replace humans; it's there
to supercharge humans.

00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:46.435
All of this started off as me
being a tutor, and it wasn't

00:15:46.435 --> 00:15:49.834
to replace myself, it was
really to allow my ...

00:15:49.834 --> 00:15:51.850
and get the half an hour
that I had with Nadia

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.543
to be more constructive,
so I didn't have to lecture

00:15:53.543 --> 00:15:55.380
for things for her and
she didn't have to be

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.243
embarassed to ask a
question from 4th grade.

00:15:57.243 --> 00:15:58.446
She could get it on demand.

00:15:58.446 --> 00:16:00.544
And so, yeah, that's what
you've got to tell parents,

00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:02.944
that the tutor is now more valuable

00:16:02.944 --> 00:16:04.648
and can take things to
another level with students.

00:16:04.648 --> 00:16:06.212
Larry: Jennifer in Fullerton,

00:16:06.212 --> 00:16:09.446
wondering about translation
for other countries.

00:16:09.446 --> 00:16:11.172
You're looking at new videos to serve in

00:16:11.172 --> 00:16:13.079
other languages or dubbing yourself?

00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:15.613
Sal: We actually have a
fairly extensive project.

00:16:15.613 --> 00:16:19.447
We've translated and
redone 7,000 videos into

00:16:19.447 --> 00:16:21.843
other languages, the 12
major languages of the world.

00:16:21.843 --> 00:16:24.090
If you go to the bottom of the
site, you see a little drop down.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.590
We have actually 1,000 in Spanish,

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.127
1,000 in Portuguese,
and a bunch of others.

00:16:27.127 --> 00:16:27.448
Larry: Wow.

00:16:27.448 --> 00:16:28.739
Jonathan in Long Beach says,

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:31.662
"The technology really
streamlined the college system."

00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:33.844
He's a student at Long Beach City College.

00:16:33.844 --> 00:16:35.537
He says, "Lectures go on and on,

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:37.839
"regurgitation and inefficient."

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:39.938
Salman Khan, thank you for being with us.

00:16:39.938 --> 00:16:41.351
Appreciate it very much.

00:16:41.351 --> 00:16:43.269
We'll see how much your
ideas make their way

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.037
into mainstream American education.

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:45.855
Sal: Thank you.

00:16:45.855 --> 00:16:47.941
Larry: The One World School House:

00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:50.264
Education Reimagined, by the founder of

00:16:50.264 --> 00:16:52.770
the nonprofit Khan Academy, Salman Khan.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.441
It's AirTalk on 89.3 KPCC.

00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:56.936
Have a great afternoon.

00:16:56.936 --> 00:17:00.936
BBC News Hour comes up
next, and then The World-
