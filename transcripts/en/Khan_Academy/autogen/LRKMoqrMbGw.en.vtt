let's do some more practice word

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190
let's do some more practice word
 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.420
let's do some more practice word
problems Patricia is building a sandbox

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430
problems Patricia is building a sandbox
 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.720
problems Patricia is building a sandbox
for her daughter it is to be five feet

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730
for her daughter it is to be five feet
 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.709
for her daughter it is to be five feet
wide and 8 feet long so let me draw that

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719
wide and 8 feet long so let me draw that
 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.820
wide and 8 feet long so let me draw that
so the five feet wide it is to be five

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
so the five feet wide it is to be five
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.070
so the five feet wide it is to be five
feet wide so there you go that's five

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
feet wide so there you go that's five
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.519
feet wide so there you go that's five
feet right there and eight feet long

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
feet right there and eight feet long
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.609
feet right there and eight feet long
other than an orange eight feet long so

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619
other than an orange eight feet long so
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.900
other than an orange eight feet long so
this is like if we're looking down on

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
this is like if we're looking down on
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.500
this is like if we're looking down on
the sandbox eight feet long eight feet

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
the sandbox eight feet long eight feet
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.179
the sandbox eight feet long eight feet
long so the sandbox if we're looking

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
long so the sandbox if we're looking
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.470
long so the sandbox if we're looking
down on it would look something like

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
down on it would look something like
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.540
down on it would look something like
that that would be five feet and then

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
that that would be five feet and then
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.340
that that would be five feet and then
this side over here would also be eight

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
this side over here would also be eight
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.619
this side over here would also be eight
feet all right she wants the height of

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
feet all right she wants the height of
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.170
feet all right she wants the height of
the sandbox to be four inches above the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
the sandbox to be four inches above the
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.049
the sandbox to be four inches above the
height of the sand okay so if we were to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
height of the sand okay so if we were to
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.840
height of the sand okay so if we were to
draw the sandbox like this so if we were

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
draw the sandbox like this so if we were
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.910
draw the sandbox like this so if we were
to draw it in draw three so that's eight

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
to draw it in draw three so that's eight
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.420
to draw it in draw three so that's eight
that is that distance right there is

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
that is that distance right there is
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.880
that is that distance right there is
five feet and then there is some height

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
five feet and then there is some height
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.740
five feet and then there is some height
which I think we're going to have to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
which I think we're going to have to
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.590
which I think we're going to have to
figure out let me draw the whole box

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
figure out let me draw the whole box
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.320
figure out let me draw the whole box
just like that and just like that the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
just like that and just like that the
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.060
just like that and just like that the
sand is going to fill a certain amount

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
sand is going to fill a certain amount
 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.450
sand is going to fill a certain amount
of the sandbox so the sand is going to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
of the sandbox so the sand is going to
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.469
of the sandbox so the sand is going to
fill maybe until right over there so

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
fill maybe until right over there so
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.060
fill maybe until right over there so
that's how much the sand is going to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
that's how much the sand is going to
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.969
that's how much the sand is going to
fill of the sandbox so all of that is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
fill of the sandbox so all of that is
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.550
fill of the sandbox so all of that is
sand and she wants the height of the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
sand and she wants the height of the
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.190
sand and she wants the height of the
sandbox to be four inches above the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
sandbox to be four inches above the
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.109
sandbox to be four inches above the
height of the sand so she wants this

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
height of the sand so she wants this
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.149
height of the sand so she wants this
distance right here the amount that the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
distance right here the amount that the
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.219
distance right here the amount that the
height goes above the sand itself to be

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
height goes above the sand itself to be
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.300
height goes above the sand itself to be
four four inches or a third of a foot

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
four four inches or a third of a foot
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.010
four four inches or a third of a foot
depending how you want to think about it

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
depending how you want to think about it
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.719
depending how you want to think about it
now she has 30 cubic feet of sand she

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
now she has 30 cubic feet of sand she
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.749
now she has 30 cubic feet of sand she
has 30 cubic feet of sand so this sand

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
has 30 cubic feet of sand so this sand
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.340
has 30 cubic feet of sand so this sand
right here is 30 feet cubed how high

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
right here is 30 feet cubed how high
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.310
right here is 30 feet cubed how high
should the sandbox be so this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320
should the sandbox be so this
 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.170
should the sandbox be so this
information right here the volume of the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
information right here the volume of the
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.719
information right here the volume of the
sand tells us we using it we can figure

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729
sand tells us we using it we can figure
 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.819
sand tells us we using it we can figure
out how high the level of the sand will

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
out how high the level of the sand will
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.370
out how high the level of the sand will
be because the let's view it this way

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
be because the let's view it this way
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.229
be because the let's view it this way
let's call let's call L let's call L or

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
let's call let's call L let's call L or
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.449
let's call let's call L let's call L or
we gonna choose X let's say X is the

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459
we gonna choose X let's say X is the
 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.870
we gonna choose X let's say X is the
height of the sand

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880
height of the sand
 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.800
height of the sand
X is equal to height of sand so the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810
X is equal to height of sand so the
 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.080
X is equal to height of sand so the
total volume of our sand is going to be

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090
total volume of our sand is going to be
 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.710
total volume of our sand is going to be
the height of the sand times the length

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720
the height of the sand times the length
 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.340
the height of the sand times the length
of the box times 8 times the width of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350
of the box times 8 times the width of
 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.250
of the box times 8 times the width of
the box times 5 and this is going to be

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
the box times 5 and this is going to be
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.960
the box times 5 and this is going to be
the total volume which they told us is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970
the total volume which they told us is
 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.810
the total volume which they told us is
30 cubic feet it is 30 cubic feet we're

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820
30 cubic feet it is 30 cubic feet we're
 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.500
30 cubic feet it is 30 cubic feet we're
taking X feet times 8 feet times 5 feet

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510
taking X feet times 8 feet times 5 feet
 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.750
taking X feet times 8 feet times 5 feet
so we'll get 30 feet cubed if we were to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760
so we'll get 30 feet cubed if we were to
 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.150
so we'll get 30 feet cubed if we were to
keep track of the units so what is this

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160
keep track of the units so what is this
 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.560
keep track of the units so what is this
8 times 5 is 40 8 times 5 is 40 so we

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570
8 times 5 is 40 8 times 5 is 40 so we
 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.860
8 times 5 is 40 8 times 5 is 40 so we
get 40 X is equal to 30 if we divide

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870
get 40 X is equal to 30 if we divide
 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.490
get 40 X is equal to 30 if we divide
both sides by 40 both sides of the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500
both sides by 40 both sides of the
 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.890
both sides by 40 both sides of the
equation by 40 let me do that you divide

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900
equation by 40 let me do that you divide
 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.340
equation by 40 let me do that you divide
both sides by 40 you get X is equal to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350
both sides by 40 you get X is equal to
 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.710
both sides by 40 you get X is equal to
that just becomes an X X is equal to 30

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
that just becomes an X X is equal to 30
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.410
that just becomes an X X is equal to 30
over 40 where it equals 3

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420
over 40 where it equals 3
 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.340
over 40 where it equals 3
it equals 3/4 of a foot so this right

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350
it equals 3/4 of a foot so this right
 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.610
it equals 3/4 of a foot so this right
here this right here is going to be 3/4

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620
here this right here is going to be 3/4
 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.030
here this right here is going to be 3/4
of a foot now what is 3/4 of a foot we

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040
of a foot now what is 3/4 of a foot we
 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.240
of a foot now what is 3/4 of a foot we
know let's see 3/4 of a foot we know

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250
know let's see 3/4 of a foot we know
 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.360
know let's see 3/4 of a foot we know
that there are we know that there are 12

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370
that there are we know that there are 12
 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.630
that there are we know that there are 12
inches per foot the feet cancel out 12

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640
inches per foot the feet cancel out 12
 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.200
inches per foot the feet cancel out 12
times 3 over 4 is what you can divide 12

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210
times 3 over 4 is what you can divide 12
 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.350
times 3 over 4 is what you can divide 12
by 4 and get a 3 divide the 4 by 4 you

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360
by 4 and get a 3 divide the 4 by 4 you
 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.720
by 4 and get a 3 divide the 4 by 4 you
get a 1 you get 3 by 2 times 3 this is 9

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730
get a 1 you get 3 by 2 times 3 this is 9
 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.650
get a 1 you get 3 by 2 times 3 this is 9
inches 9 inches so the height of the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660
inches 9 inches so the height of the
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.030
inches 9 inches so the height of the
sand right there is 9 inches now she

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040
sand right there is 9 inches now she
 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.190
sand right there is 9 inches now she
wants the height of the sandbox to be 4

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200
wants the height of the sandbox to be 4
 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.470
wants the height of the sandbox to be 4
inches above the height of the sand so

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480
inches above the height of the sand so
 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.480
inches above the height of the sand so
this is 9 inches she wants four more

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490
this is 9 inches she wants four more
 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.850
this is 9 inches she wants four more
inches so what she wants the height of

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860
inches so what she wants the height of
 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.140
inches so what she wants the height of
the sandbox height of sandbox it should

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150
the sandbox height of sandbox it should
 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.520
the sandbox height of sandbox it should
be the 9 inches of the height of the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530
be the 9 inches of the height of the
 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.600
be the 9 inches of the height of the
sand plus 4 which is equal to 13 inches

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610
sand plus 4 which is equal to 13 inches
 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.120
sand plus 4 which is equal to 13 inches
and we are done let's do the next

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130
and we are done let's do the next
 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.250
and we are done let's do the next

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260
problem it was a sale day in Macy's and
 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.680
problem it was a sale day in Macy's and
everything was 20% less than the regular

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690
everything was 20% less than the regular

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360
price Peter bought a pair of shoes and
 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.730
price Peter bought a pair of shoes and
two using a coupon

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740
two using a coupon
 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.680
two using a coupon
got an additional he got an additional

10 per centimeter than a different color
 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.520
10 per centimeter than a different color
he got an additional ten percent off the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530
he got an additional ten percent off the
 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.120
he got an additional ten percent off the
discounted price the price he paid was

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130
discounted price the price he paid was
 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.820
discounted price the price he paid was
$36 the price he paid for the shoes and

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830
$36 the price he paid for the shoes and
 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.279
$36 the price he paid for the shoes and
do that in a different color the price

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289
do that in a different color the price
 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.809
do that in a different color the price
he paid for the shoes was $36 how much

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819
he paid for the shoes was $36 how much
 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.960
he paid for the shoes was $36 how much
did it originally cost so let's just use

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970
did it originally cost so let's just use
 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.920
did it originally cost so let's just use
so X is equal to original original cost

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930
so X is equal to original original cost
 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.749
so X is equal to original original cost
so there was just a regular sale on that

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759
so there was just a regular sale on that
 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.450
so there was just a regular sale on that
day everything was 20% less than the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460
day everything was 20% less than the
 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.490
day everything was 20% less than the
regular price

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500
regular price
 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.770
regular price
so using that information on that day if

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780
so using that information on that day if
 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.180
so using that information on that day if
you want to buy the shoes the cost of

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190
you want to buy the shoes the cost of
 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.779
you want to buy the shoes the cost of
the shoes would be X minus 0.2 Oh X or

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789
the shoes would be X minus 0.2 Oh X or
 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.830
the shoes would be X minus 0.2 Oh X or
0.2 Oh which is equal to 0.8 X right if

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840
0.2 Oh which is equal to 0.8 X right if
 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.350
0.2 Oh which is equal to 0.8 X right if
you have 20% off of a price you're going

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360
you have 20% off of a price you're going
 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.149
you have 20% off of a price you're going
to be paying eighty percent of the

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159
to be paying eighty percent of the
 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.159
to be paying eighty percent of the
original price so this is the price that

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169
original price so this is the price that
 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.020
original price so this is the price that
everyone would have paid without a

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030
everyone would have paid without a
 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.820
everyone would have paid without a
coupon and that's what that line is

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830
coupon and that's what that line is
 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.899
coupon and that's what that line is
telling us right there

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909
telling us right there
 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.749
telling us right there
now Peter got a pair of shoes and using

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759
now Peter got a pair of shoes and using
 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.850
now Peter got a pair of shoes and using
a coupon got an additional 10% off of

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860
a coupon got an additional 10% off of
 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.010
a coupon got an additional 10% off of
this an additional 10% off of that so

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020
this an additional 10% off of that so
 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.740
this an additional 10% off of that so
he's paying 10% less than this or

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750
he's paying 10% less than this or
 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.540
he's paying 10% less than this or
another way to think of it is he only

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550
another way to think of it is he only
 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.770
another way to think of it is he only
had to pay 90% of this price right if

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780
had to pay 90% of this price right if
 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.779
had to pay 90% of this price right if
you take if you take 0.8 X and from that

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789
you take if you take 0.8 X and from that
 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.050
you take if you take 0.8 X and from that
you subtract 10% of this so from that

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060
you subtract 10% of this so from that
 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:02.300
you subtract 10% of this so from that
you subtract 10 percent of that of 0.8 X

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310
you subtract 10 percent of that of 0.8 X
 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.860
you subtract 10 percent of that of 0.8 X
alright this is the same thing right

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870
alright this is the same thing right
 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.659
alright this is the same thing right
this is 1 times 0.8 X this is the same

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669
this is 1 times 0.8 X this is the same
 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.719
this is 1 times 0.8 X this is the same
thing as 1 minus 0.1 so this is the same

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729
thing as 1 minus 0.1 so this is the same
 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:19.790
thing as 1 minus 0.1 so this is the same
thing this is equal to 90% of 0.8 X of

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800
thing this is equal to 90% of 0.8 X of
 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.189
thing this is equal to 90% of 0.8 X of
0.8 X and it might actually be very

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199
0.8 X and it might actually be very
 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.200
0.8 X and it might actually be very
natural for you to go straight to this

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210
natural for you to go straight to this
 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.409
natural for you to go straight to this
it's natural for me if I paying 20% less

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419
it's natural for me if I paying 20% less
 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.089
it's natural for me if I paying 20% less
than the regular price that means I'm

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099
than the regular price that means I'm
 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.279
than the regular price that means I'm
going to pay 80% of the regular price

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289
going to pay 80% of the regular price
 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.680
going to pay 80% of the regular price
and if I get an additional 10% off of

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690
and if I get an additional 10% off of
 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.320
and if I get an additional 10% off of
that that means I'm only going to pay

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330
that that means I'm only going to pay
 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.650
that that means I'm only going to pay
90% of that so this is what he

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660
90% of that so this is what he
 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.510
90% of that so this is what he
is going to pay and we they tell us that

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520
is going to pay and we they tell us that
 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:49.150
is going to pay and we they tell us that
that price is $36 that price is equal to

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160
 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.000
$36 so if we want to figure out X well

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010
$36 so if we want to figure out X well
 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.090
$36 so if we want to figure out X well
we can multiply 0.9 times 0.8 let's do

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100
we can multiply 0.9 times 0.8 let's do
 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.510
we can multiply 0.9 times 0.8 let's do
that

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520
that
 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:04.040
that
so 0.9 times 0.8 9 times 8 is 72 we have

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050
so 0.9 times 0.8 9 times 8 is 72 we have
 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.050
so 0.9 times 0.8 9 times 8 is 72 we have
two numbers behind the decimal one two

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060
two numbers behind the decimal one two
 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.980
two numbers behind the decimal one two
so it's 0.72 so you get 0.72 X is equal

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990
so it's 0.72 so you get 0.72 X is equal
 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.990
so it's 0.72 so you get 0.72 X is equal
to 36 or maybe we could say 72 over a

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000
to 36 or maybe we could say 72 over a
 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.020
to 36 or maybe we could say 72 over a
hundred 72 over 100 X is equal to 36 or

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030
hundred 72 over 100 X is equal to 36 or
 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.640
hundred 72 over 100 X is equal to 36 or
we could even say this is the same thing

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650
we could even say this is the same thing
 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.260
we could even say this is the same thing
as what is that that's the same thing as

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270
as what is that that's the same thing as
 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.480
as what is that that's the same thing as
36 over 50 right 36 over 50 X is equal

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490
36 over 50 right 36 over 50 X is equal
 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.450
36 over 50 right 36 over 50 X is equal
to 36 and this isn't even in lowest

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460
to 36 and this isn't even in lowest
 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.800
to 36 and this isn't even in lowest
common forms I could keep if I could

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810
common forms I could keep if I could
 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.070
common forms I could keep if I could
this is the same thing as 18 over 25 but

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080
this is the same thing as 18 over 25 but
 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.720
this is the same thing as 18 over 25 but
I like this number because it I have a

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:41.730
I like this number because it I have a
 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.300
I like this number because it I have a
36 here and so I can multiply both sides

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310
36 here and so I can multiply both sides
 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.530
36 here and so I can multiply both sides
by the inverse of this 50 over 36 times

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:48.540
by the inverse of this 50 over 36 times
 

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.570
by the inverse of this 50 over 36 times
this I have to do it to both sides of

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580
this I have to do it to both sides of
 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.750
this I have to do it to both sides of
the equation 50 over 36 36 is canceled

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:53.760
the equation 50 over 36 36 is canceled
 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.690
the equation 50 over 36 36 is canceled
out 50 s cancel out 36 is canceled out

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:56.700
out 50 s cancel out 36 is canceled out
 

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.560
out 50 s cancel out 36 is canceled out
and you're left with X is equal to $50

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:00.570
and you're left with X is equal to $50
 

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.450
and you're left with X is equal to $50
the shoes originally cost $50 next

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460
the shoes originally cost $50 next
 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.340
the shoes originally cost $50 next
question

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.350
question
 

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.310
question
Rosa has saved all year and wishes to

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:10.320
Rosa has saved all year and wishes to
 

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.080
Rosa has saved all year and wishes to
spend the money she has on new clothes

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.090
spend the money she has on new clothes
 

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.290
spend the money she has on new clothes
and a vacation she will spend 30 percent

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300
and a vacation she will spend 30 percent
 

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.750
and a vacation she will spend 30 percent
more on the vacation than on the clothes

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:17.760
more on the vacation than on the clothes
 

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.600
more on the vacation than on the clothes
so let's say let's see that C is amount

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:22.610
so let's say let's see that C is amount
 

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:29.600
so let's say let's see that C is amount
spent on clothes she's going to spend 30

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:29.610
spent on clothes she's going to spend 30
 

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.510
spent on clothes she's going to spend 30
percent more on the vacation so let's

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520
percent more on the vacation so let's
 

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.770
percent more on the vacation so let's
say V is equal to the amount spent on

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:38.780
 

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.750
vacation well they just told us that the

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760
vacation well they just told us that the
 

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.820
vacation well they just told us that the
vacation she's going to spend 30 percent

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:43.830
vacation she's going to spend 30 percent
 

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.020
vacation she's going to spend 30 percent
more than on the clothes

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:45.030
more than on the clothes
 

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.120
more than on the clothes
so the vacation is going to be equal to

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.130
so the vacation is going to be equal to
 

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.220
so the vacation is going to be equal to
the amount she spends on the clothes

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:49.230
the amount she spends on the clothes
 

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.450
the amount she spends on the clothes
plus 30 percent of the amount she spends

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:53.460
plus 30 percent of the amount she spends
 

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:53.600
plus 30 percent of the amount she spends
on

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:53.610
on
 

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.079

equal to one thousand dollars divide
both sides by two point three I'll get

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640
both sides by two point three I'll get
 

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.329
both sides by two point three I'll get
the calculator out for this one so we

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339
the calculator out for this one so we
 

00:09:56.339 --> 00:10:00.170
the calculator out for this one so we
have one thousand divided by two point

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:00.180
have one thousand divided by two point
 

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.040
have one thousand divided by two point
three is equal to four hundred thirty

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.050
three is equal to four hundred thirty
 

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.000
three is equal to four hundred thirty
four dollars and seventy eight cents so

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.010
four dollars and seventy eight cents so
 

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.949
four dollars and seventy eight cents so
C is equal to I already forgot the

00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959
C is equal to I already forgot the
 

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:16.250

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.230
number 434 78 434 and seventy eight
dollars so that's the amount she spends

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240
dollars so that's the amount she spends
 

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.300

is going to be one thousand minus four
hundred thirty-four point seven eight

00:10:31.579 --> 00:10:31.589
hundred thirty-four point seven eight
 

00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:34.100
hundred thirty-four point seven eight
under the calculator for this one so

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.110
under the calculator for this one so
 

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.720
under the calculator for this one so
let's see let's make this into a

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:35.730
let's see let's make this into a
 

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.620
let's see let's make this into a
negative number and then let's add one

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:39.630
negative number and then let's add one
 

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.670
negative number and then let's add one
thousand to it and we get five hundred

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680
thousand to it and we get five hundred
 

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.329
thousand to it and we get five hundred
and sixty five dollars and 22 cents so

00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.339
and sixty five dollars and 22 cents so
 

00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:49.790
and sixty five dollars and 22 cents so
five hundred and sixty five dollars and

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800
five hundred and sixty five dollars and
 

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.540
five hundred and sixty five dollars and
22 cents and I'll leave it up to you to

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:53.550
22 cents and I'll leave it up to you to
 

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.160
22 cents and I'll leave it up to you to
check it this this is how much she

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.170
check it this this is how much she
 

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.110
check it this this is how much she
spends on the vacation these add up to a

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120
spends on the vacation these add up to a
 

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.389
spends on the vacation these add up to a
thousand dollars and this should be

00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399
thousand dollars and this should be
 

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:02.240
thousand dollars and this should be
exactly thirty percent more than this

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.250
exactly thirty percent more than this
 

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.340
exactly thirty percent more than this
amount the amount she spends on her

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:04.350
