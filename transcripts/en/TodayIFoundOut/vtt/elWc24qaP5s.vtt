00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.830
For many Americans in the 20th century, holiday
meals meant getting out the special Oneida

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.830
Silverware.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.820
Stainless steel, ornamental and moderately
expensive, it wasn’t a fancy dinner unless

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.650
there was a Silverplate Oneida spoon on the
table.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.199
Despite its traditional look, the history
of Oneida Silverware is anything but.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.390
The company was originally founded by a 19th
century upstate New York religious community

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.260
who believed in communist ideals (while simultaneously
exploiting capitalism for their own benefit),

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.329
women’s and workers’ rights, parents not
being overly fond of their own children, and

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.570
polyamorous relationships.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.770
Here now is the story behind the forks, spoons
and knives that grandma puts on the table

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.579
every Thanksgiving.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.550
John Humphrey Noyes was born to a financially
comfortable family from Vermont in 1811.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.180
His father, John Noyes, was a United States
Congressmen and uncle to future US President

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.680
Rutherford B. Hayes.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.170
Noyes’ mother was an ardently religious
woman who often forced her views onto her

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.170
children.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.960
As a teen, Noyes was hormonal like any boy
his age, but painfully shy around the opposite

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.640
sex, convinced his red hair and freckles made
him ugly.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.780
By 1831, at 20 years old, he had enough of
his mother’s persistent badgering.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.970
So, in the fall of that year, he attended
a tent revival service by famed preacher Charles

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.970
Finney.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.650
Thanks to that event, he was converted- one
of thousands that were overtaken by the “Second

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.759
Great Awakening” during the early 19th century.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.110
Now determined to be a preacher, Noyes took
off for Yale Divinity School.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.680
However, while his ideas included some of
the beliefs of so many other groups during

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.229
the Awakening, his exact belief system had
a few twists not shared by most, which would

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.640
soon get him into trouble.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.650
While at Yale, Noyes adopted the religious
doctrine of perfectionism – that man has

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.740
the ability to be spiritually and physically
perfect – which led him to the belief that

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.070
he, himself, was perfect and had already achieved
complete holiness on Earth.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.000
Needless to say, this didn’t sit well with
many.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.079
He was kicked out of Yale and began preaching
his version of perfectionism across the Northeast.

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.400
His family begged him to come home, but he
instead continued his impoverished, homeless

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400
wandering.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.699
john humphrey noyesWhile he initially had
little success convincing anyone to follow

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:38.330
him (not many are interested in listening
to a raving homeless man), eventually his

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.610
message won over a select few, including a
woman named Abigail Merwin.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.750
Noyes was smitten with Abigail, but Merwin
was not as much.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.650
While she believed in his message, she was
married to another man.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.040
Noyes’ distress over this situation lead
him to come up with the concept in 1837 of

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.700
“spiritual spouses,” which evolved into
“spiritual polyamory.”

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.430
His belief was that traditional marriage made
each person the “selfish possession of one

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.609
another” and did not give them the ability
to love all men and women equally.

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.550
He noted in a letter in 1837,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.100
When the will of God is down on earth as it
is in heaven there will be no marriage.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.730
Exclusiveness, jealousy, quarreling have no
place at the marriage supper of the Lamb.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.650
I call a certain woman my wife.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.199
She is yours, she is Christ’s, and in him
she is the bride of all saints.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:37.130
She is now in the hands of a stranger, and
according to my promise to her I rejoice.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.990
My claim upon her cuts directly across the
marriage covenant of this world, and God knows

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.990
the end.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.380
Under these pretenses, Noyes eventually married
another woman, Harriet Holton, but still had

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.540
latitude to engage in other relationships.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.540
Not only accepting her new husband’s beliefs,
Holton also happened to be the beneficiary

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.930
of a very large inheritance, helping Noyes
take his little community to the next level.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.979
By the mid-1840s, the membership of “The
Society of Inquiry” (as Noyes called it)

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.800
had swelled to nearly three dozen followers.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.579
In 1846, the idea of spiritual polyamory also
took the next step when Noyes encouraged 10

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.660
people, including himself and two of his sisters,
to enter a marriage contract, meaning that

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.600
all were married to one another.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.260
The contract also made “John H. Noyes…
the father and overseer whom the Holy Ghost

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.730
has set over the family thus constituted.”

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.260
Months later, Noyes was arrested on charges
of adultery (which was illegal then, whether

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.280
consensual or not), but he was freed and,
to escape further persecution, moved his group

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.000
to a farm along Oneida Creek in New York.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.110
oneida_communityAs the years went on, membership
in Noyes’ religious group, which changed

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.490
its name to “The Community,” and the eccentricities
of the man grew.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.310
Rules were adapted to his whims.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.210
Believing that new members needed more indoctrination,
he asked all newbies to live under one roof

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.210
together.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.350
Seemingly because he didn’t do well with
emotional attachment, Noyes discouraged emotional

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.940
attachment to one another and told his followers
to devote that energy to the group instead.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.570
Even more cult-like, parents who showed too
much “sticky love” towards their own children

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.530
(or vice-versa) would be barred from seeing
them for a period until they could prove that

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.690
they did not care for their own children any
more than any of the others in the community.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.630
This did not stop some from secretly harboring
special affection for their offspring, and

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.690
children to their parents.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.560
For instance, one boy would later write about
his experience when his mother would manage

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.560
to get him alone.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.501
(Community children did not live with either
of their parents, but in a Children’s House

00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:43.540
building where they were cared for by nurses
and teachers after being given up by their

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.510
mothers at the age of 18 months.)

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.320
He stated his mother would say to him “Darling,
do you love me?”

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.260
And that, “I always melted.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.300
My marbles and blocks were forgotten.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.320
I would reach up and put my arms about her
neck.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.130
I remember how tightly she held me and how
long, as though she would never let me go.”

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.320
Perhaps most disturbingly, once the children
went through puberty, they would be assigned

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.760
to older men and women to engage in sexual
acts.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.400
Specifically, around 14, males would be sent
to “interviews” with a spiritually devout

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.730
postmenopausal woman, with these women chosen
specifically so they would not get pregnant

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.850
from the boys, who had not yet learned to
control their climax.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.911
You see, rather than using the withdrawal
method, coitus interruptus, which was one

00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:27.120
of the most effective birth control methods
historically, and is surprisingly just as

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.120
effective as condoms at preventing pregnancy,
even in real world practice, the community

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.010
instead practiced coitus reservatus as their
main method of birth control- where the man

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.870
was not to orgasm at all.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.190
The idea was that this would simultaneously
prevent pregnancy, ensure the man maintained

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.889
his vitality (the belief at the time was that
the loss of semen negatively impacted a man’s

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.730
health), and made sure the woman was optimally
pleasured for maximal spiritual benefit.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.190
On the other side, around the age of 12, females’
were likewise given so-called “interviews”

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.920
with the old men in the community.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.570
This mandate that the young teens exclusively
only have sex with older men and women, partially

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.050
to control pregnancies and partially to make
sure more “holy” members were the ones

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.350
to introduce the youth to the “holy pleasures
of sex,” was lamented by some teens in the

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.720
community, but nevertheless was a strictly
maintained practice until the teens were deemed

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.610
old enough to have “interview” requests
with one another granted by an intermediary.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.690
Needless to say, this practice was extremely
out of touch with the morals of both that

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.720
age and this.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.389
(And, note, contrary to popular belief, it
has never been the norm for young teenage

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:34.400
girls or boys to marry in Western society.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.780
In fact, the lowest median age of first marriage
since the early 1700s was by the baby boomer

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:46.710
generation, where the average age of women
marrying dropped from about 22-24 to 20.5

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.150
years in 1950.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.940
Perhaps not surprisingly, it was also the
baby boomer generation that saw divorce rates

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:58.540
rise to their highest in the last half century,
peaking in the 1970s and early 1980s, and

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.720
declining ever since, again contrary to popular
belief.)

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:05.540
Looking past the extreme child abuse, Noyes’
attitude towards sex was relatively progressive

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.280
for his era, particularly in the sense that
he believed female sexuality was healthy and

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.980
positive, going against the Victorian thinking
of the day.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.889
Just as scandalous for the age was that he
firmly believed that being pregnant was essentially

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:21.100
the bane of a woman’s existence.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.970
He felt it stopped women from fulfilling their
spiritual potential, reduced their happiness

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:31.360
and harmed their health, owing to the perpetual
state of being pregnant and caring for babies

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.080
(a fair percentage of which died in infancy)
that was the life of so many women of that

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.240
time period and region of the world.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.460
As such, Noyes strongly advocated for birth
control, which resulted in just 40 children

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.950
being born from 1848-1868 in the community.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.670
This was despite that the community comprised
of 200-300 members during that period and

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.700
that frequent copulation with different partners
was the name of the game.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.880
Eventually, if a woman wanted to become pregnant,
not just have sex, she and the man of her

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.900
choice had to apply to do so.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.740
If the couple were deemed sufficiently spiritual
by a committee, they were allowed to procreate.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.910
While seemingly overly strict, it is noted
that there are only nine known instances of

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.430
applications to have a child being rejected
in the community.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:21.210
The women of Oneida also were encouraged to
engage in the same physical activities as

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.110
the men, which included manual labor and sports.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:29.240
Freed from having to raise children and other
such domestic affairs, a female in the Oneida

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.850
community was just as likely to be chopping
down a tree as cooking a meal in the kitchen.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.100
Likewise, the men did household tasks like
laundry when the need arose, all of which

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.830
was mostly unheard of in 19th century America.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:47.470
By the beginning of the Civil War, the Oneida
community was numbering in the hundreds, but

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.780
struggling financially.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:54.970
With war and rising money demands, they needed
to find a way to bring in money and fast.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.010
Despite the commune nature of the community,
with no member allowed to accumulate possessions

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:04.980
for themselves outside of basic necessities,
Noyes never had any issues with the idea of

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.760
the community as a whole accumulating wealth.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.120
The group’s first major business venture
was trying to grow and sell fruit, but the

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.810
harsh winters of upstate New York made the
task difficult.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:21.000
Next, they turned to several other business
ideas, such as making leather bags, fine thread,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.280
and metal traps.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.800
While the women of the community never wore
fur coats themselves, they were happy to benefit

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.190
from such fads happening outside of their
community with trapping business being a booming

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.899
industry in America during the mid-19th century.

00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:37.790
Needless to say, their metal traps sold well.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.690
But it wasn’t going to last and the community
sought to diversify its income sources even

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.690
more.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.870
The story goes that in 1877, a member of the
community whose offspring would eventually

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.680
write a book about this group, was sitting
on the banks of the river and noticed a silverware

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.320
factory nearby.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.920
He figured they were on the same river, so
they could just as easily make such silverware.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.580
By 1879, the Oneida Community was doing just
that.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.500
A year later, the religious community collapsed
due to certain new marriage laws banning such

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.020
complex marriages in the United States.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.610
A now-deaf Noyes abandoned his community,
fleeing to Canada.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.770
Without his leadership, and with many youth
of the group having come back from colleges

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:23.520
with a new outlook on their home life, the
community crumbled and the members mostly

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.460
paired off with their favorite partner into
more traditional relationships.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:33.190
There was at this point still the matter of
all the community’s assets, including Oneida

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.190
Silverware.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.640
It was ultimately decided that a corporation
should be formed with shares granted to former

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.620
community members based on how much they original
contributed financially to the community upon

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.590
joining and how hard they’d worked while
members.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:52.440
Of course, most had not worked that hard at
all, with it being typical for community members

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.710
to only work a few hours per day.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:12:01.160
For reference, the average work week in the
United States in 1890 was around 90-100 hours

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.760
per week for most tradesmen according to a
federal government survey.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.400
This lack of much work time had actually forced
the community to hire outside laborers working

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.690
more traditional extreme hours for the day
to do much of the work in their various business

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.690
ventures.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.980
Led by former members of the community, including
Noyes’ son, Oneida Community, Limited was

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.790
born in 1880.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:27.310
Buoyed by very successful marketing in newspaper
and magazine advertisements, Oneida Silverware

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.310
took off into the 20th century.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:34.140
Celebrity endorsements, like Princess Margrethe
of Denmark, and appealing to the dream of

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:39.670
having a high-class home, made Oneida Silverware
the largest seller of silverware in America

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.400
in the mid-20th century.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.880
The descendants of the community hung onto
the company until 2006 when bankruptcy forced

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.410
a sale to EveryWare Global (who, themselves
filed for bankruptcy last year).

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.801
Today, Oneida Silverware is still being sold
and being used by grandmas everywhere, who

00:12:55.801 --> 00:13:01.279
are likely completely unaware of the communist,
polyamorous religious community that originally

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:36.350
made 

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.360
the cutlery.
