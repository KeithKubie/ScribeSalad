Hey everybody, Doug Walker here.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.380
I'm sick.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.400
Um...

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm getting a lot better,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.080
Uh...

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.780
Actually, I've gotten a lot better, we're going to film

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.420
the review, probably while you're watching this,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.120
I'm filming, uh, the next review. But sadly, that means no editorial today,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.160
What we're gonna do about it is,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.940
The editorial is written, I just, I couldn't film it.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.920
So I'm gonna film it NEXT week, so it's still gonna be tied into Sequel Month

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.960
It's just gonna be, you know, on a delay. So the review is still coming out next week, and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.009
the editorial for Sequel Month will come out the week after.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.960
And after that, we'll just go back to sorta the normal Nostalgia Critics.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.720
It was the Norovirus.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.160
Which I have never had before, and I've had stomach flus before, but this...

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.180
This was the worst, this was awful and literally, the morning I woke up,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.640
My wife did some research on it, and just,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.620
Apparently everyone got it at the exact same morning I did, cause it was on the news,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.820
It was spreading like wildfire, and it's super contagious.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.580
I had to do something I never done before,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.940
I had to cancel a Con.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.280
Kami-Con I had to cancel sadly.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.000
Which I felt so bad for, cause I was building it up and everything,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820
And a lot of other people here got sick.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.440
My brother got sick, and Tamera got sick, so...

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.020
I'm so, so sorry and it really sucks, but:

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.900
A) I was feeling awful, and  B) I didn't want to contaminate other people at the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.320
convention cause apparently this like, UBER-contagious. So...

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.540
Yeah, you know the set-up now, and I'm so sorry I couldn't get you an editorial this week,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.740
But it will be up two weeks from now, and the regular review, "Garfield 2",

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.300
That's still gonna be up a week from today, so um, guys I'm already feeling better,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.240
So I've no need for the well wishes or anything,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.240
Just giving you a heads up on what's going on.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289
So that's about it and hope all is well,

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.020
And I'll talk to you later, bye!
