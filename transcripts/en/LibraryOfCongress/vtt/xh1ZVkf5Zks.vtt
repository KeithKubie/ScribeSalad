00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Good afternoon.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.330
I'm Jane McAuliffe, the
Director of National

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.350
and International Outreach here
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.670
And I'm delighted to welcome
you to this afternoon's lecture.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.670
As I make this welcome, I
will also make the request

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.420
that you are now very
used to which is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.770
to silence your cell phones
before we get started.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.360
And also to say that we are
filming the lecture today,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.400
and it will be placed
on both the Library

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.920
and the Kluge Center websites.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.720
Because our lecture
this afternoon is hosted

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.800
by the John W. Kluge Center.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.310 position:56%
I like to characterize the Center
of which I was recently the Director

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.590
as the place in the Library
of Congress that supports,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.170
that showcases, and that
celebrates scholarship.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.690
We support scholarship by hosting
over 100 senior and junior scholars

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.810
in spacious offices and
carrels right next door here

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.110
over the course of a year.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.060
We showcase scholarship by
events like this afternoon,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.420
where we have distinguished
lecturers, sometimes symposia,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.820
sometimes panels, usually
in this room.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.970
And we celebrate scholarship

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.910
by awarding every few years
the Kluge Prize for the Study

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.050
of Humanity, a Nobel
Prize-level award

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.990
in the humanities and
social sciences.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.710
Today's lecture is by Dr.
John Sexton and is titled

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.190
"The American Research
University, the Decades Ahead."

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.140
Dr. Sexton notes that for more

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.910
than a century the
university has been one

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.990
of America's most durable
institutions.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.110
Yet globalization, technology,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.770
and market forces are reshaping
the research university's form

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.070
and its functions.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.100
So the question for this
afternoon is what kind

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.860
of future can our colleges
and universities anticipate?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.810
John Sexton is President Emeritus,
the Immediate Past President

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.920
of New York University where he's
also the Benjamin Butler Professor

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.530
of Law and the Dean
Emeritus of NYU's Law School.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.040
He took a BA, an MA, and a PhD from
Fordham University and then went

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.130
on to do some JD magna cum
laude from Harvard University

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.130
that he completed in 1979.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.540
All through his undergraduate

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.030
and graduate years he
coached the debate team

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.030
at a Catholic girls' school, Saint
Brenden's, in Brooklyn, New York,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.680
and took them to five
national championships.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.250
After law school John served
as a Supreme Court Law Clerk

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.410
to Justice Warren Burger,
Chief Justice Warren Burger,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.600
and then joined the NYU
Law Faculty in 1981.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.020
He was named Dean of
the Law School in 1988.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.020
And in 2001 he was named
President of the University,

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.100
a position that he held
until just this past January.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.010
As President at NYU he led the
University's global expansion,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.630
opening campuses in
Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.520
He doubled student applications,
he doubled student financial aid,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.980
and grew the endowment
from 1.14 billion

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.060
in 2002 to 3.49 billion in 2014.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.630
John's been honored
in very many ways.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.550
He's a Fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.700
and a member of the Council
on Foreign Relations.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.120
He's the recipient of 17
honorary degrees, and counting.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.000
And he's written and
published widely.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.260
He has a leading case
book on civil procedure.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.780
He's written on the Supreme Court.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.730
Nice that he spent time here, so
close to the court, once again.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.280
Entitled <i>Redefining the
Supreme Court's Rule,</i>

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.390
<i>a Theory of Managing the
Federal Court System </i>.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.320
His latest book is entitled
<i>Baseball as a Road to God,</i>

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.740
<i>Seeing Beyond the Game </i>.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.430
It was published just
over two years ago

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.910
and became a <i>New York
Times </i>bestseller.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.410
The book is based on an
undergraduate seminar

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.050
that John teaches each
spring at NYU.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.040
For the last five months John
has been in residence here

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.870
at the Kluge Center
as the Kluge Chair

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.730
in American Law and Governance.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.310
This is one of the
five chairs articulated

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.620
in the original founding
documents of the Kluge Center.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.340
During his time here he's been
putting together a book based

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.220
on essays that he wrote during
his years as NYU's President

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.120
about the place and
promise of higher education.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.940
I can guarantee you
a very stimulating

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.860
and interesting conversation
this afternoon.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.660
John Sexton.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.660
[ Applause ]

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.960
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: Hmm.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.710
Thank you very much, Jane.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.850
And thank you to each of you
for being here this afternoon.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.210
I see several of my colleagues
from the Kluge Center.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.470
I know how valuable the time
is, both for the senior scholars

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.540
and for those that are more
junior in their careers.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.590
It's a great honor to me
that you would take time away

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.520
from your workshop to come here.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.880
All of us at the Kluge
Center I think echo the words

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.520
of the great Jaroslav
Pelikan in our own way.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.720
Pelikan, who was the
first Kluge Professor,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.600
at least in the first class, said
that being the Kluge Professor

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.460
at the Library of Congress is like
being a mouse in a cheese factory.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.180
And in one way or another I think
we've all had that experience.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.060
I want to thank the Library of
Congress and thank the Kluge Center

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.850
and most of all thank Jane

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.970
because Jane is an extraordinary
leader in higher education.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.800
I came to know her first when
she was still Dean at Georgetown

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.200
and then through her time
as President of Bryn Mawr

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.860
and her time leading the
Center here and then now

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.350
on to even more important
duties at the Library.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.590
She's a great friend and
an extraordinary educator.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.580
And I know I wouldn't be here

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.260
but for her indulgence
of my eccentricities.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.620
Now she knows my eccentricities
as do many at the Library,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.080
and one of them is that it's
a very rare thing for me

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.460
to be shackled to a podium.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.830
I think the prophylactic against
my usual behavior is the fact

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.500
that there was no one in the
front row until people realized

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.740
that because of the digitization
of this and the stern lecture

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.530 position:56%
that I got about the necessity of
preserving whatever I'm going to say

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.440
for the archives, I
can't leave this space,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.440
so I want you to know you're safe.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.110
But I do mean it.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.720
Thank you for giving me an hour of
your time today, those that stay

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.380
for the fullness of our talk and
the Question and Answer after it.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:43.050
I want to thank especially a
dear friend who in the process

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.010
of being a friend also happened to
become Governor of New York State,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.620
my friend David Patterson who is
down principally to have dinner

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.690
with me and a mutual friend, but
somehow wandered into the Library

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:02.150
and decided that he could take as
much as four or five hours with me

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.810
since he's got to leave here after
a session with me and go to dinner.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.750
I want to say this about David.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:14.940
In my 14 years as President of
NYU, dealt with four governors

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.230
of our state and -- the other
three were strong personalities

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.710
and in some ways strong governors.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:27.800
There was no one of the other
three and very few leaders

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.260
that I've encountered anywhere who
appreciated fully the importance

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.150
of education, of higher education,
and of the research university

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.610
in particular the way David did.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.950
He would frequently point
out that it was in the depths

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.340
of the Civil War that Abraham
Lincoln signed the Morrill Act

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.050
and created the Land
Grant University School.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.410
That's what leadership is about,

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.600
seeing the long run even
in the darkest days.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.940
And in a way that's what
my talk is about today.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.540
Now I'm going to start
by covering some ground.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.510 position:56%
I'll do it in some ways elliptically

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.180
because we will reserve some
time at the end for colloquy.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.520
If you have an irresistible urge,
you can interrupt me at any time.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.750
I'm not adverse to that.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:19.370
But the way I planned it, at least,
is I'll talk for about 40 minutes

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.350
and then we'll open
it up for questions.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.530
I want you to know
as we go into this

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:31.620
that notwithstanding the very
kind introduction from Jane,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.470
you could not penetrate through
that except if you really played

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.720
out the fact that I spent 15 years
working with high school kids

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.060
in Brooklyn in and around
an educational program built

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.360
on a debate team.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.210
You couldn't really begin to
glimpse how eccentric it is for me

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.410
to be here as the Kluge
Professor and to speak to you

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.180
about higher education after the
eccentric way in which I was Dean

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.050 position:56%
of NYU's Law School for 14 years and
President of New York University.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:06.400
First of all, never in those 28
years did I lose the essential

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.930
definition of professional
self which one faces,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.370
or at least faced before
global entry,

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.810 position:56%
when you had to list your profession
on the card as you returned

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.350
to the country or entered
another country.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.840
And for me it's never been anything
but the simple word "Teacher."

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.270
I can't even elevate
it to Professor.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:33.360
It seems to me that the
teaching element is the core

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.000
of what I've been professionally.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.130
It was what I was put
on Earth to do.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.780
So my identity is very much that.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:48.500
I was a reluctant Dean and a
reluctant President in both cases.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:54.130
My son came up with a great phrase
to describe this which carried me

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.930
through 28 years in such positions.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.570
And he did it, thankfully,
in the very first year.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.740
We had been invited
by the Tisch Family.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.840
Now that's a name with
which you conjure at NYU.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.600
And we'd been invited by the
Tisch Family to go to their --

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.210
to the owner's box at a New
York Giant football game.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.070
And I took my son.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:23.330 position:56%
And the other guests in the box were
Barbara Streisand and Dan Rather

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.400
and people of that note, you know.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.760
And it was a good football game.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.510
Jed and I were pretty much locked

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.470
in our seats watching the
game for most of the time.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.440
And in the car on the
way home he said to me,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.580
"Dad, you're a comma person."

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.640
And I said, "What do you
mean, a comma person?"

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.440 position:56%
He said, "Well, didn't you notice
that when people came in at halftime

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.530
to pay homage to Mr.
Tisch he would say, 'Oh,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.580
and you know Barbara Streisand.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.760
Oh, you know Dan Rather.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.370
And you know John Sexton, comma,

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.470
the Dean of NYU Law School
[laughter].'" He said,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.870
"Your presence had to
be explained to people."

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.840 position:56%
He said, "It wasn't even the case
that my presence had to be explained

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.990
because I was the little
Sexton kid, you know.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.030
That once you were
there, I was there."

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:16.520 position:56%
And that's a very useful concept
and it was easy for me to embrace it

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.000
because you have to understand

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.370
that you are the left-hand
side of the comma.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:27.490
That's where you love, that's where
you deal with the transcendent

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.310
and beautiful things in life.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.630
And that's where you
are as a human being.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.040 position:56%
And then there's the right-hand side
of the comma, and you get all kinds

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.730
of -- you know, I had to tell
the comma person story in French

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.730
when I was inducted
into the Legion of Honor

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.070 position:56%
because I wanted them to understand.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.800
I knew they weren't
inducting John from Brooklyn

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.060
into the Legion of Honor.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.670
NYU had been in Paris for 40
years and they couldn't induct NYU

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.940
into the Legion of Honor,
so, you know, there I was,

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.370
the French comma person, you know.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.880
So you get the adulation,
you get the vilification.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.020
I have to say one of the
huge things that's happened

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:12.190 position:56%
since January 1st is that, you know,
I am now just the left-hand side

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.430
of the comma, and if I
get vilified it will be

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.350
because of something I
do, thank you very much,

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:21.010
not because somebody scrolled
something in a bathroom someplace.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.750
But one can never forget
the privilege,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:33.650
the privilege of being asked to
represent a school, a university,

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.610
as a Dean or as a President,

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.170
and to carry the right-hand
side of the comma.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.020
Although throughout my time, and
this is more the eccentricity,

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.490
I continue to write, as Jane
indicated, and I continue

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.970
to teach a full faculty
schedule, so in my last year

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:54.130
as President I taught five
courses, five full courses,

00:13:54.130 --> 00:14:02.900
and did it by myself because that
reminded me what it was about.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.450 position:56%
And it was also, to just put the
final touch on the eccentricity part

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:12.710
of this, it was also my practice
not to go on any for-profit boards,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.350
that I would only go on
boards if they related

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.480
to education, higher education.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.930
In the one case of the Federal
Reserve Board in New York,

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.010
the connection was not
obvious to me at first,

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.770
but I became convinced
it was important

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.260
to have the education
voice in that conversation.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.700
And I think it was.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.080
And I was able to persuade
my friend, Lee Bollinger,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.140
to succeed me as Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Bank in New York.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.240
And I think that's been
an important post for us

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.490
to have for higher education.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:49.420
So I come to my conversation
about the University

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.160
and about the vocation
of being a professor,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.970
being part of the University
as if approaching the sacred.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.900
This is important terrain for me.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:07.950
This is the terrain
where I began operating.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.520
It's now 56 years ago since I
walked into my very first classroom

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:19.820 position:56%
in a formal sense, and it's been
the last 56 years and every semester

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.390 position:56%
since I've never taken a sabbatical.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:24.850
So, to the University.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.810
First of all, some prefatory words.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:33.950
There are 85 institutions
in the world today

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:40.070
that exist today the way they
existed 500 years ago, in form, 85.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:44.930
So the British Parliament,
the Vatican,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.510
eight cantons in Switzerland.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.600
That's 10 of them already
off the table.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.780
Of the remaining 75,
70 are universities.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.080
That tells us something.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.070
That tells us something
about the durability

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.690
of this powerful instrument.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.560
And, of course, the reason for the
durability is it deals with that

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.110
which makes us human at our core --

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:13.570
thought and knowledge
and creativity.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:21.860 position:56%
What I want to say today is that
this durability is to be celebrated.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.820
But it's very fragile.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.520
And particularly fragile
today, I think,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:36.750
and I fear that we can
see the undermining

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:40.220
of this extraordinary
institution and the values

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:45.170
for which it stands
if we're not careful.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.760
So there's danger.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:55.110
On the other hand, the maintenance
of the University, I will submit --

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.400
this is the other part
of my argument.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:06.400 position:56%
The maintenance of the University is
key to any genuine feeling of hope

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.070
about the advancement
of mankind, humankind.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:17.770
If one narrows it to the
American Research University,

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.280
I think most people would
say -- I certainly --

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.600
there was a collectivity of
us in Athens two years ago

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.910
from all parts of the world.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.910
We had 12 people and we
played a game, you know,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.670
we each wrote on a piece of paper
how many of the top universities

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.480
in the world were American.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.630
And there wasn't a
single person at the table

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:44.140 position:56%
that put the number at less than 40.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:50.180 position:56%
And then we played a second
version of the game which was to say

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:56.610
by 2050 how many of
the top 50 universities

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.910
in the world would be American.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:02.670
And there wasn't a single person
at the table that put over 25.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.980
So I think we could say that the
American Research University today

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.760
is in a halcyon time.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.000
I think it's easy in
conversations like this

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.480
to miss the broader picture.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.050
So let me take a moment to note

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.770
that I just used the
number 40/50, you know.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.940
I'm in double digits here.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.430
I was the Chairman of the
American Council on Education.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:29.730
There are 5000 colleges and
universities in the United States.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.890
I've actually had two careers
in colleges and universities.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.830
The latest one was
described by Jane.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.810
While I was working with
those high school kids I was

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.360
at St. Francis College in Brooklyn.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.040
I call it the Harvard of Brooklyn

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.400
because it's the oldest
college in Brooklyn.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.900
But it's a college,
it's a teaching college.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.700
It's for first generation
college kids.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.170
It's got the lowest tuition
of any private school,

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.560
certainly in New York,
maybe in the nation.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.180
And it's a glorious place
where I was Chairman

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.160
of the Religion Department.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.760 position:56%
And if you were to ask me, you know,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.500
so which of these is the superior
institution, I would say that's

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.630
like asking which is
the superior fruit

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.330
between a banana and a tangerine.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.240
They're two different beings.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.600
Each excellent in its own way.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.330
And we frequently, in conversations
about the research university,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.080
because so many of
us come from it --

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.660
certainly so many that are
constituents of this Library come

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.780
from it -- we forget that
American higher education has

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.080
as a core strength the fact

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.800
that it presents itself
as a symphony orchestra.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.910 position:56%
And you can't do the "1812 Overture"
without the percussion section.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.260 position:56%
And I'm not going to say whether Sr.
Francis is the percussion section

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.620
of NYU is the percussion section.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.160
But it's important to
have good percussionists

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.230
and good brass section
and a good string section

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.610
and so forth in any orchestra.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.700
And we should begin to think

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.750
of American higher
education in that way.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:00.040
That will become important for some
of the issues I'll raise later.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.000
Now there's among the 5000,
be sure, there are schools

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.210
that I would not speak about
with the pride that I speak

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.940
about Sr. Francis College or NYU.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.990
I mean I'm not saying that all

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.230
of American higher
education is excellent.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.980
But be careful because
when it's said

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.440
that American higher education
is the best in the world,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.440
it's usually a much less
remarkable statement.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.070
It's talking about
a very narrow band.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.430 position:56%
And it's worth focusing on that band

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:36.290
because the research university
is the most complex and complete

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.120
and sophisticated version of
tertiary education we've created.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.970
And it deals with the full
panoply of human activity

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.810
and the advancement of thought.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.940
But we shouldn't forget the
rest is there, the other.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:58.650
Now as the center of
gravity of excellence

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.010
in the research university
shifts in the direction

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.110
that that Athens dinner
suggested it might,

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.620
all kinds of things
will be happening

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.290
to the other sections
of the orchestra.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.780
And some of the topics we're going
to talk about today are going

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.440
to be playing out differently in
other sections of the orchestra.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:22.150
And I don't think any of
this is to be resisted.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:27.000
I certainly don't think that
the concentration of excellence

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.510
in research universities in the
United States is to be resisted.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.030
The knowledge is not
a zero-sum game.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.230
Indeed, it's a positive-sum game.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.150
And Americans -- and it strikes
me particularly at this moment

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.270
in our history -- Americans
are extremely focused

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.960
in a very narcissistic way about
various vertical concentrations,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.880
be it of wealth or other resources.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.500
We don't talk enough about the
enormous concentration horizontally

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.900
in all of America and
a few other countries,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.820
vis-à-vis most of the world.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.910
And in a just world we have to
redress not only the vertical

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:08.410
but also the horizontal
maldistributions that exist.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.440
The question really should be,

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.380
does it have to be a zero-sum
game or a negative-sum game?

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.680
I don't think it does.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.430
I think it could be
a positive-sum game.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.110
And if that's the case, then
it becomes about quality.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.170
How do we maintain
quality and access,

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.960
which is talked about
far too little?

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:35.550
So to me, just to give you the
punchline, a good outcome to all

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:40.540
of this depends upon
some very simple things.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.210
Two, really.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:49.590
The first is that each element
of the orchestra be able

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.590
to articulate clearly and pursue
vigorously what the Jesuits taught

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.930
me to call the Ratio
Studiorum, the Ratio Studiorum.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.860
What's the purpose of this
particular part of the orchestra?

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.160
What is the purpose of NYU?

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.440
What is the purpose of
St. Francis College?

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.890
What is the purpose
of any institution?

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:08.280
What's the purpose of this class
as an offering of the school and --

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.690
or this department, as
a segment of the school?

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:16.820
So the Ratio Studiorum, first and
second it -- I think it turns on,

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.780
frankly, the quality of faculty.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.020
The faculty have to be --

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.930 position:56%
this doesn't seem to be a remarkable
statement, although it's honored

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.700
in the breech -- the faculty
have to be at least as good

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.140
as the best students in the school.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:33.570
You know, we know how to
destroy education systems.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.700
You do what the New York City
Public School System's done

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.420
for the last five years.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.670
You know, you hire teachers
that have lower SAT scores

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.850 position:56%
than the students you're graduating.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.430
That's a ticket for failure
because you're hiring

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.570
from the bottom half
of the existing class.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.460
And how can they teach
the top of the class?

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.460
So what we have to do is get
faculty that are at least as good,

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:01.640
and that are dedicated to what
they're doing, and see themselves

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.450
as part of the common enterprise
of what a university is.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:11.870
Failure to attend to these two
simple things is very easy.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.780
It's politically palatable.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.740
But it's corrosive and it's
the real danger that I see.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.080
So I'm going to talk roughly for
about five or six minutes each

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.300
about three broad trends, and
then tie it into one final point.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.570 position:56%
And that will be the next 24 minutes

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.560
or so before I open
it up for questions.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.840
And the three broad
trends are the following.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.510 position:56%
A trend I perceive which is
relevant to the research university,

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.570
for universities and colleges
generally, that has to do

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:48.260
with civic discourse and
the life of the mind.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.240
The second is globalization.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.540
The third is technology.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.330
Those are three extremely
broad trends.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:25:01.120
The fourth topic I want to hit
brings it all together I think

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.740
and essentially it speaks about
both the peril and the promise

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:11.820
of education as a determinant
of how these trends play out.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.300
And I think the way we approach
education can either make it turn

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.490
out quite well or quite poorly.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.780
So let me start with civic
discourse in the life of the mind.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.470
I'm going to move through
this with rapidity.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.070
I'm going to use phrases

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:37.940
that I think will capture the
reality certainly one sees today

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.710
in the political and civic
discourse of this country.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:49.810
I start off by saying the core and
essence of the university has to be

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:56.460
that the disciplines that have
been developed over generations,

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:01.870
working together increasingly,
discovering connections

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:06.550
between themselves in a
wonderful way, drive a process

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:11.680
of knowledge inculcation,
knowledge advancement, creativity.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:16.780
And importantly in the modern
American research university,

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:21.620
providing soul to the
professions, be it the doctor

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.820
who understands the patient
as well as the disease,

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.060
or the lawyer who is
[inaudible] and Jeffersonian.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:34.180 position:56%
Those are the purposes of the
common enterprise of the university.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.480
And I say common enterprise

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.860 position:56%
because the university merits the
full engagement of its participants.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:46.830
And it should embrace and value
different viewpoints as long

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.080
as the viewpoints are backed with
evidence and not simply assertion.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.880
I say to my students, "You're not
entitled to opinions in my class.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.620
You're entitled to viewpoints
and viewpoints can be defended

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.860
with argument and evidence."

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:05.890
But the university has to --
it doesn't have a viewpoint.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.710
It values a diversity of
backgrounds and viewpoints.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.160
It's not a political
tool owned by some,

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.060
to be taking positions
on various issues.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.270
In fact, rarely should a
university, as the university,

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:26.010
act politically outside the
core of its means, in my view.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:27.710
Now I think we're at a time

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:33.640
when broad societal trends threaten
the maintenance of excellence.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.210
If you want a full explication
of this, as Jane said,

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:41.950
I'm collecting various what
I call reflections of that.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:46.640
I've written about 10 of them
over my time as President at NYU.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.610
They're in the nature of pathway
arguments, pastoral letters.

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.940
They're not postcards.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.640
They're not research papers.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.210
They tend to be 40/50 pages long.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.510
They're not footnoted.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.590
I rarely quote from anyone.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.590
But I try to make visible
all the parts of my argument.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:11.640
And the one that's most relevant
here I wrote in 2005 and I call the

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.480
"Dogmatism and Complexity,

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.090
the Research University
and Civil Discourse."

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.830
And I'm going to read.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:24.810
It's one of the few times that
I quote in the reflection.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.080
I quoted this little book which,

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.880
if you haven't read
it, you should read.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.650
It's quite remarkable.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:36.340
It's even rarer for me to quote
something in a talk like this.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.880
But this is worth your rearing
just for the shock value of it.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:45.410
Keeping in mind that it was written
25 years ago by a man who was

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.760
at that time in his
80s, Albert Hirschman,

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.230
at the Institute of
Advanced Studies.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.670
In a book called <i>The Rhetoric</i>

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:57.960
<i>of Reaction </i>he examines three
movements -- the French Revolution,

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.780
the Suffrage Movement,
and the Great Society.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:08.520
And he traces the rhetoric
used both by the progressives

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.710
and the reactionary
in each case, and --

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:16.060
It's interesting that he says at
the top -- just listen to this.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.270
This is the basic thesis
of the book.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.790
"The very stability
and proper functioning

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.090
of a well-ordered democratic
society depend

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:30.380
on its citizen arraying themselves
in a few major, ideally two,

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.560
clearly defined groups
holding different opinions

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.840
on basic policy issues.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.700
It can easily happen that
these groups become walled off

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.000
from each other.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.980
In this sense, democracy
continuously generates its

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.340
own walls.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.950
As the process feeds upon itself
over time, each group will,

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.170
at some point, ask about the
other in utter puzzlement

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.590
and often with mutual revulsion.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.780
How did they ever get
to be that way?"

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.090
Now he wrote that in 1991,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.840
And I quoted it because
I was concerned

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:10.750
after watching the Presidential
Debates in 2004, okay?

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.850
Today in 2016 things
are exponentially worse.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.610
Just a couple of bullets.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.530
These are things that one
easily could not notice even

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.110
if you're not a sports fan.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:30.190
Tonight, before you turn
to MSNBC or Fox or to CNN,

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:36.290
turn on <i>Sports Center </i>on ESPN
for 15 minutes and watch it.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.470
And you're going to find that the
political coverage uses the same

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:44.150
kind of music, the same kind of
hype introduction, the same level

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:49.680
of content, frankly, as
does <i>Sports Center </i>.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.980
There's a focus.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.160
Just start doing a mental
clock on this, okay,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:59.580
as you watch the coverage on
MSNBC, Fox, CNN, whatever you want,

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.800
even the <i>New York Times,
the Wall Street Journal </i>.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.180
Focus on who's ahead,
predictions on the race.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.140
It's like the Kentucky
Derby's coming up.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.980 position:56%
Okay? An obsession with personality.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:17.510
The salacious, the provocative,
indulgent of demagogues.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.810
You know, right and left.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.930
You know, one says that
everybody in politics is a moron.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.730
Another says the politics
is all corrupt and rig.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:31.320 position:56%
I mean, it's the same kind of
broad-stroke demagoguery in my view.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.100
So nice to be, after January 1st,
when I'm not a comma person anymore

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.470
and I can just tell you what I
think about things like this.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.080 position:56%
Very little attention to the issues.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.130
Still less to what we
in competitive debate --

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:49.180
my book on high school kids know

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.570
that if you don't extend
the argument, you know,

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:52.870
the first negative makes a point,

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.510
the second affirmative
has to extend on that.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:57.580
Then the second negative and
into the rebuttals, right?

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.730
It doesn't happen, doesn't happen.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.030
Just stay away from this year.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.010
I'll use an example from 2004.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.550
John Edwards, remember him?

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.570
Serious candidate.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:10.460
Forty debates I watched.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.690
In every one of those 40 debates
he said, "I grew up in a mill town.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:14.990
My father lost his job.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.290
I didn't vote for NAFTA."

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:20.020
One of my Brooklyn High
School girls would have asked

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.020
in first course examination,
"Would you repeat NAFTA, Senator?"

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.730
He was never asked that
question in debates.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.370
He was asked two-thirds of
the way through the campaign

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.990
by the <i>New York Times</i>
Editorial Board, and he said,

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.600 position:56%
"Of course I wouldn't repeal NAFTA."

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.000
What just happened to
your campaign, Senator?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.730 position:56%
Okay. But we don't extend arguments.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:44.330
And there's such a
devaluation of seriousness

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:49.290
that you actually hear
experts saying that a person

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:55.990
that takes issue seriously and
gets into detail and nuance

00:32:55.990 --> 00:33:01.450
and complexity, by virtue of
doing that lacks charisma.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:05.130
Right? So that's the
ultimate critique, isn't it?

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:09.730
So we've developed, as a society,
a shrinking attention span.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.580
We've allyded [assumed
spelling] news and entertainment.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.630
We've got a coliseum culture that
we've developed, and an allergy

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.560
to nuance and complexity.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.430
Ladies, and gentlemen, what
do research universities do?

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.340
We do nuance and complexity.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.810
This is not good for us, okay?

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:33.310
This portends, I am telling
you, an evitable working

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:39.580
out over the next generation, with
no end in sight, of a disinvestment

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.730
in education generally,
in high higher education.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:51.040 position:56%
That has to come from a society that
is making thought an accusation.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.100
You think too much.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:58.600
Less investment in research,
less investment in education

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:04.130
as a public good, and, certainly,

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:06.780
scapegoating as to
the results, right?

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:12.750
So even as the money is withdrawn
from subsidizing the cost

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.830
of higher education,
we scapegoat those

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.730
who are running higher education.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.030
The money's gone away.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:24.050 position:56%
Oh, by the way, one of the
solutions we'll do is we'll increase

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.350
compliance reporting.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:29.300
So you have to hire more people and
then we will point to the increase

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.370
in the number of administrators.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.670
Okay. You're looking at the
President of one of the 20 colleges

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:38.300
and universities that was chosen,
quote, at random, close quote,

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:43.700
by Senator Grassley
for a full IRS audit.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:48.180 position:56%
Just at random, you know, like the
little thing that goes off with TSA.

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:56.680
And a year-and-a-half, four IRS
offices at NYU day in and day out.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.840
Imagine the administrative
time consumed by that.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.690
We got a clean bill
of health in the end.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:05.060
But a year-and-a-half.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:09.240
And then, you know, we,
ourselves, undermine the ideal.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.730
I was, of course, a
member of the Association

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.710
of American Universities
beginning in 2001.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:22.680
And as we began to launch
a major justification

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.830
of the research university
with the Norm Augustine report,

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:31.470
"Rising Above the Gathering Storm,"
I argued as vigorously I could,

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:35.060
to no effect, that this
was a Faustian bargain,

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.260
that if you start justifying
what universities do

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:43.030
on a basic utilitarianism,
you're going to run directly

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:48.440 position:56%
into undermining yourself as
there's an impact on the humanities,

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.660
and then the social sciences,
and then on basic research

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.310
in the sciences, and
creativity goes off the agenda.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:58.530
And short term results
become important.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:03.690
Now, that's the dark side.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:08.830
It's still the case that our
universities are the greatest

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:14.570
counterforce to these
activities and these trends.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:15.870
Or at least they can be.

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:18.240
It requires profiles in courage.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.420
This is a moment where
we have to stand up,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.960
where we have to sing
the song of thought.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:29.900 position:56%
And we have to start honoring people
who engage in serious conversation

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.430
and we have to shame
those who don't.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.130
And we have to figure out vehicles.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.440 position:56%
And I suggest some in my reflection.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:42.000
We have to figure out vehicles
whereby to do that with consortia

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.620
that essentially say, people are --
you know, like the Pinocchio stuff,

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.800
but on a more serious level.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.370
Are people engaging in
serious conversation?

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:58.770
Okay. So there's a dogmatism
that's developing an allergy

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.310
to nuance and complexity.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.350
That's not good for universities.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.910
But if we have the courage to step
forward and we see it coming --

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:10.040
we have been around for
more than 500 years.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.340
We are -- we do do thought.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:12.650
That is what makes us human.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.010
What about globalization?

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.870
I'm going to be brief on this and
technology because I want to get

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:23.690
to the questions, and I do want to
reserve some time for my windup.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.840
So, on globalization.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.770
Look, hello, here I am.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:35.800
PhD in Religion, Fordham, in
college for four to five years

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.170
at a Vatican Council,
then getting my PhD

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.040
in the wake of the Vatican Council.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.660
The word ecumenism
means something to me.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:48.750
Okay. It means, when you translate
it into the secular sphere,

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:55.020
that there's a big premium that you
receive if you can look at life,

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.540
not through the one window
you're given at birth,

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:06.460
but through the many windows in
the many rooms of the mansion.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:12.710
This is the ecumenical, the
secular ecumenical mindset.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.010
Globalization is happening.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.350
And I'm not just talking
about economic globalization.

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:19.490
I mean the other is in our lives.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.120
The world is miniaturizing.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.240
The question is, how
do we respond to it?

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.230
And there were two responses.

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.570
One is building on the elegy
to nuance and complexity,

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:37.410
the devaluation of thought, is
to move to a competitiveness we

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:42.010
versus they rationale, around a
world, most recently in Austria.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:46.390
You see the answer in
neon signs, "Let me alone.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.750
Let me live with folks like me."

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:54.890
You see the response of
essentially building up walls.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:39:02.160
We don't put in the hard work
of understanding globalization.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:09.190
My cousins, who are carpenters
and electricians and real workers,

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.850
you know, people that really
do things and I adore them

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:16.970
and I adore their values as human
beings, but they want to shop

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:23.450
at Walmart and Costco even as they
complain about the jobs leaving

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:26.330
that are creating the products that
they're getting at a lesser price

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.890
because the jobs have left, so --

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:32.140
and no one wants to get into
the genuineness of that.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:36.360
And the problem is, in
part, that there is a face

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.910
on the negative effect
of globalization,

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:44.530
whereas there's no face on --
maybe the closest is Pope Francis.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.620
But think, is there a world leader
out there that's stepping out

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.820
and explaining globalization?

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.470
The answer's no.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:57.620
So reaction one is fear,
negativism, protectionism.

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.280
Reaction two, which is, by the
way, where universities have been

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.050
through the centuries, has been
the ecumenical reaction, okay?

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:10.570
Embrace engagement, see
the gifts of difference,

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:17.540
and the other as a great
gift to be studied.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.610
The choice is for or
against common enterprise.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:23.030
And I would submit
to you that, again,

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.330
universities are the key here.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.080
The universities have
always been global.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.380
There's always been a
world community of ideas.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:35.210
Universities have been about
communication and understanding.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.440
Increasingly the world
is developing a network

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.330 position:56%
of what I call idea capitals, ideals
capitals that are animated not only

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:46.020
by the old things -- FIRE,
FIRE, finance, insurance,

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:50.270
and real estate -- but a
new element that's necessary

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.070
for the modern idea
capital, the intellectual,

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.580
cultural, and educational, ICE.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.000
We have to FIRE and ICE together.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.140
And universities are in
the FIRE and ICE business.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.470
We do ICE.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:08.220
We do the intellectual,
cultural, and educational.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.970
Now, how universities will respond
to globalization and embrace

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.310
that notion of ecumenism
in the [inaudible].

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.020
We have many, many different ones.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:21.920
I mean, NYU is all in,
but others will do it

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.250
through bilateral arrangements,
associations

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.800
and consortia, co-chairing.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.670
There are any number
of ways to do it.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:32.510
But most of all, we have
to model a set of things

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.620
as we address globalization.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.470
We, the university community,
we have to model the celebration

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:41.500
of thought, the positive-sum
consequences

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.650
of common enterprise
and cooperation.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:50.900 position:56%
This means maybe coopetition, if not
cooperation, but not competition.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.750
It's not seeing it as zero-sum.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.820
It means sharing.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.170
Sufferings is to technology.

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:06.360
Technology will be, as they
say, disruptive insofar

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.050
as it will cause change
in many areas.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:14.470
But it's easy to overstate
the degree of disruption

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:18.050
that technology will
cause in higher education.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.100
Those who make a major
claim of disruption tend

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:25.950
to have a very narrow
understanding of what education is.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.720
They see it principally as
information acquisition.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.230
And there'll be parts
of the orchestra

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:38.500
where that will be significant,
but not the part of the orchestra

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.250
in which the research university
does most of its operation.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:43.600
I'm going to get more
concrete on this in a moment.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.530
But I mean, look, my life now,

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:50.690
in addition to my being a faculty
member at NYU, is occupied trying

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:54.980
to bring education to kids around
the world -- primary, secondary,

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.540
and tertiary -- who
just don't have a shot

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.740
at a meaningful education today.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.620
Want to hear a scary number?

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:07.010
Eight-five million, 85 million
primary and secondary-age children

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.250
in the world will go through
life, unless we change things,

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.210
never having met a teacher.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.660
Nobody's even trying to
educate them, you know?

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:22.280
And some of them are in cities
in India or Brazil, in the slums.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.400
Some of them are in remote areas.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.530
Some of them are in warzones.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.080
Some of them are in
abjectly poor countries.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.250
Some of them are in refugee
camps where, once a kid gets

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:32.730
to a refugee camp,
the average time he

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:35.470
or she is there is 10 years, okay?

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:40.280
Eight-five million kids
never meet a teacher.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.860 position:56%
Another 260 million, even if they
get a stamp that says they graduated

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.320
from high school, won't
be able to read.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.130
They have a fourth-grade
reading level.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:54.630
So, you know, technology
can help a lot, okay?

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.270
But it's not a panacea
even for those kids.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:58.630
That's where I'll end.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:04.740
But the key is, would
we want our kids

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:12.730
to have what those kids
are likely to have?

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:18.810 position:56%
Yeah, we have people in this country
saying to the poor, the uninformed,

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.110
the unconnected, send your kid

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:26.540
to an online school,
$10,000 college degree.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:31.570
And those same people are paying
tutors to prepare the kids

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.320
for the SAT so that they can
get into a list of 20 or 30

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.380
or 40 schools that I guarantee
you are not online schools.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:43.380
So we have to be a little bit, you
know, Rawlsian about this, right?

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.680
A little John Rawls here.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:50.610
Am I advising others to do
what I would do with my kids?

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.850 position:56%
This is, you know, the
educational version of fighting wars

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:55.510
with other people's children.

00:44:55.510 --> 00:45:00.270
The argument is made, though, what
-- even in the research university,

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:06.720
technology or, you know, it will
help address this issue of cost,

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.960
you know, cost is going
up, it's going up.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.740
We've got to suppress cost.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.670
Well, yeah, there are
places, I could tell you.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:18.550
You know, we -- I have lived for
the last five years for a budget

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.480
with an annual operating
budget north

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.510
of $7 billion a year
throughout my [inaudible].

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.100
I think we started
at $5 billion a year.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.210
These are big budgets, you know.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.420
Can you save money with
technology in them?

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.720
Sure, you know.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.480
In fact, we managed to
save a good bit of money.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.570
But what about in the
academic sense?

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.590
Well, yeah, there are places.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.490
You know, Language
101 courses, you know.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:47.180
The most basic language courses.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:54.330
You could save money there by
doing it technologically rather

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:59.090
than with a professor or a
supplement of professors.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.250
But most of the areas where
you would integrate technology

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:05.680 position:56%
into the research university either
do not save money or drive costs up.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.580
So to flip a classroom makes the
experience in the classroom better

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.430
by having the kids to technological
exercise before they come.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:15.990
But it doesn't save money, okay?

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:20.000
In fact, when you think about it,
at the really top universities,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.080 position:56%
the ones we're talking about when
we use the word research university.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.090
I mean I can't -- at
my Tisch Film School,

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:29.750
I can't have a camera
for more than two years.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.870
Otherwise I'm not training
the kids for the industry.

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.800
So there's a technological
half-life, you know.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.990
The first decision I had
to make as President was,

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:39.190
you know, you go for an MRI.

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:42.410
There's a 1.5 Tesla Machine
that reads you for the doctor.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:46.680
Research university, it's a
3 Tesla Machine which is --

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:50.140
it's logarithmic so it's much
more than twice as powerful, okay?

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:54.500
My guys wanted the only 7
Tesla Machine in the country.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.900
Seven Tesla.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.010
"How much does that cost,
Bob," I said to the Dean.

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:00.520
Forty million dollars.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.960
This does not save money, okay?

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.830
Now, it might cure
diseases more quickly.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:09.410
Technology does not save money

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.900
at research universities,
net, net, net, net, net.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:19.440
So the biggest impact of
technology in my view,

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.860 position:56%
and this is where I'll close on this
and segue to my final punchline.

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:29.360
The biggest impact is, frankly,
when it's rarely mentioned.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.470
I think everything from the mooks

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.880
to something called the
University of the People.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.780
Now I'm Chairman of the Board
at the University of the People.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.270
I've been Chairman for seven years.

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:43.530 position:56%
What's the University of the People?

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.450
Well, if you're a high school
graduate, you're fluent in English,

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:50.350
you have access to the Internet,
and you are abjectly poor,

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.240
you're automatically admitted.

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.070
Welcome aboard, no matter
where you are in the world.

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:58.810
And you'll get an accredited
in the United States,

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:03.390
accredited, free college education.

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:07.640
Here it is.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.070
All open source materials.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:12.300
You sign up for courses.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:17.360 position:56%
There are volunteer professors that
have made up the curriculum and work

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.770
with the 32 students in the class
that do peer-peer learning largely.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:24.780
And then they get the final exam
and they take a secure final exam

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.820
and they get a grade and they've
now passed, you know, English 10.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.150
And you aggregate your 36 courses
just the way you would in a college

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.890
if you were in Amherst
or New York City

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.780
or Washington, D.C.,
and you graduate.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.600
You've got an accredited degree.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.280
We had the graduation ceremony for
our first seven students last year.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.370
But we're now up to 3000 students.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:48.960
And that's technology
doing something good.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.100
But, but, but, but,
now wait a minute.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.400
What about this Rawlsian thing?

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.590
What about these other people's
children thing, you know?

00:48:56.590 --> 00:49:00.310
Would you send your Jed or
your Katie, your children,

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.080
to the University of the People?

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:06.380 position:56%
No. And we shouldn't trap anybody in
the University of the People either.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.340
So what we've started
to do, and so far,

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.130
we've got three cooperating
universities --

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:19.090
NYU, Berkeley, and
University College London --

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:21.120
that at the end of the
first year, the University

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:27.130
of the People will look at the top
10% of the class for transfer in

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.720
and now you're moving up a ladder.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.020
Thank you very much.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.930
Now maybe the first step would
be the St. Francis College

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:35.180
when we get this thing
going worldwide.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:39.660
But use technology and things
like the University of the People,

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:43.280
things like mooks, as
search engines for talent.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.570
But then make the ladders
up available.

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:48.940
That's the way technology
could be used.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.010
And this brings me to my
fourth and final topic.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.160
That is this.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.560
There's peril and promise in
what I see in the decades ahead.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:06.440
The peril is that, as we've
seen work out in so many areas,

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.960
that now higher education, formerly
the instrument of opportunity,

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:17.780
will become the way to lock in a
caste system that is more powerful

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:22.250
than any caste system ever
created by a religion,

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:24.970
where we send the children
of the poor, the uninformed,

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:29.350
the unconnected, to
$10,000 online colleges

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:33.620
where they neither get the quality
of education that we understand

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:38.370 position:56%
at some level, the kids at St.
Francis and at NYU and at Georgetown

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:39.670
and at Harvard are getting.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:41.130
You know, we get that.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:42.430
You know, there's something
going [inaudible] because that's

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:43.730
where we want to send our kids.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:46.050
You know, I come from a city

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:52.980
where people pay $35,000
a year for kindergarten.

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:58.130
And they fight the people that have
all the knowledge and all the money

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:01.470
and all the connections
to get their kids in.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.260
What do they know?

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.610
What do they know?

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:07.740
Okay? It's so simple.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:11.460
Just will you do it for your kids?

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.430
And the fear is that, you know,

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.690
in the past the elites would
give a fortune to their kids

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:20.280
and there was some chance
their kids would squander it.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.670
But now we're giving kids
of the elite's education

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.060
that others aren't getting and
we're giving them a network

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:29.210
of relationships that
comes from that education,

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.750
at least if it's not online.

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.600
So what's the answer?

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:40.250
Well, I think the answer is to push
the quality of our higher education

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:46.500 position:56%
as far as we can, paying attention
to the issues I've put on the table.

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:52.300 position:56%
But it's also to make sure that
everybody has access and information

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:56.540
and the capacity to
climb ladders up.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:00.860
So, I would create literally
a worldwide clearinghouse

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.240
of educational opportunity.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.690
I'm involved now with an effort

00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:09.040
with Former Prime Minister
Gordon Brown to do just that.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.470
And I think that we will have
the college version of that up

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:14.980
and running within a year.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:20.410
And we intend to try to do it
for all levels of education.

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:22.790
I think that we then
have to supplant that,

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:30.250
because you can't expect many of
the kids out there that are as good

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:34.390 position:56%
as any kids that are in the best
schools anywhere in the world, okay?

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:37.510
That's the thing I want
you to understand, okay?

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:42.000
I want you to know, and excuse
me just for giving one example,

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.810
because we've run this
experiment with NYU Abu Dhabi,

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:48.760
where we were sent out with the
ability to find kids that were

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.470
as good as any in the world.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.710
That was the admission
standard for NYU Abu Dhabi.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.390
Clearly admissible to
any school in the world.

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:59.500
Far higher than the admission
standard for NYU New York.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.840
So we found Moosebah
[assumed spelling].

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.920
Who is Moosebah?

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.320
Moosebah homeschooled himself
grades one through eight

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.790
in tribal village in Ethiopia.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:14.120
He walked five days to Addis
Ababa, knocked on the door

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.810
of the International School, and
said, give me any test you want.

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:18.540
I want to be in your school.

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.480
He got the highest grades
in the entrance exams.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.900
They gave him a spot
and a scholarship.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.910
They didn't find out for six
months he was living alone

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:27.440
as a 13-year-old in the airport.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.140
And they gave him housing
at that point, and food.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:34.050
He graduated at the
top of his class,

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:36.710
came as part of the first
graduating class to NYU Abu Dhabi.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:41.280
Graduated magna cum laude along
with the best kids in the world.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.040
He was not alone in that
first class of 150 kids

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.220
with that kind of profile.

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.930
Twenty percent of the class
had that kind of profile.

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:50.940
Those kids could have been wasted.

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:53.540
What I'm saying is we have
to get out and we have to --

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.580
we won't always have, you know,

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.540
a Sheikh Mohammed bin
Zayed who's willing to pay

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:00.540 position:56%
for Moosebah's education or
Teyho's [assumed spelling] education

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:06.150
or the education of the now more
than a hundred kids of that ilk

00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:08.440
that have graduated
from that one school.

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.190
We've got to generalize this.

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:14.600
And that means we have to have
something like Teacher America,

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.800
except guidance counsellors
for America that have to be

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.540
out there showing kids
how to get through.

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.110
And not just guidance
counsellors for America

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:24.350
but guidance counsellors
for the world.

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:27.990
And then the question is,
after the match is made --

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.350
and we have a serious
problem of undermatching

00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:36.060
in the United States --
[inaudible] in the world, okay.

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:38.880 position:56%
But just focus on the United States.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.390
Okay. Systematically -- read
Bill Bowen's work on this.

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:48.170
Systematically, when you control
for everything, kids that come

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:51.700
from lower socioeconomic groups
go to colleges that are less good

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.430 position:56%
than the colleges they should go to.

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:55.730
Controlling for everything.

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.690
And when they get to
the less good place,

00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:01.900
when they're matched less
well, they do less well.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.020
Why? Because they're
not as stimulated.

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.630
They want the support
services, right?

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:07.440
All that stuff.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.860
It just flows.

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.160
It's weird.

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:16.130
It happens in part because you
have political leaders saying go

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:19.220
to a $10,000 online school.

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:21.950
So they think only about the price.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.080
You'd say community
college is going to be free.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.380
Oh, that's a bargain.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:30.450
So you end up going to a community
college in your area instead

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:32.970
of investigating further.

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:35.910
Or maybe you do investigate
further and you make it

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:37.560
into the school you
should make it into.

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.740 position:56%
But then some less good school comes
along, gives you a scholarship,

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.100
and buys you down in a way.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.910
I mean, the system is perverse.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:49.460 position:56%
And it's a system of a lack of
transparency, a lack of information,

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:52.330
a lack of guidance,
and then, finally,

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:57.540
a lack of an ability
to pay in the end.

00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:00.780
And that's where we've
got to take seriously --

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.000
we're never going to get back
to the time that I grew up in.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
And I wouldn't have gone to
college if it hadn't been

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.160
for Nelson Rockefeller and his view

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.020
that higher education
was a public good.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:14.040
And if you were a smart kid, you
got a regent state scholarship.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.960
And as long as you went to school
in New York State, it was for free.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.260
Public or private.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.580
You found the best school for you.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:22.880
For me it was Fordham.

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.000
It was a private school.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.870
But my tuition was covered
by my state scholarship

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:29.030
because higher education
was a public good.

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:31.440
Ronald Reagan changed that.

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.870
Right now, higher education
gives you this private good.

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:35.170
You borrow.

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:36.940
We got to get it back to at
least the quasi-public good.

00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.400
That's where I'm trying to go.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.140
So the pay-as-you-earn program.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.310
This is not something
I thought up, okay?

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:45.730
It's done in Australia.

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:48.290
It's done in the U.K. now.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:50.270
Argonne has started it.

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:53.020
The Brookings Institute
has great stuff on it.

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:59.180
I would go farther than any
of those have gone however.

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.110
I would say essentially what
Nelson Rockefeller said,

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:05.840
but I would treat -- you
find a school, you go to it,

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.820
we'll pay for it, you pay
the loan back over 20 years

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:13.000
but you never have to pay more than
10% of your income over $50,000.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.320
The first $50,000 you don't
pay anything off, okay?

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.410
So the key is about matching
and then capacitating.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:22.500
Matching and then capacitating.

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:26.110
Now, if we do that, starting in
this country, and then we do it

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:33.360
in the world, then circling back,
I think we got a chance, a chance.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.810
But, you know, we all
have to play Don Quixote.

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:38.650
Okay? This is -- call
it the [inaudible].

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:39.990
I'll be a theologian here again.

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:42.780
This is the educational
version of Pascal's Wager.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.310
It's no sense betting
against ourselves here.

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:56.470 position:56%
If we do this, we can have a chance
to turn back this creeping dogmatism

00:57:56.470 --> 00:58:00.560
that is killing civil
discourse, and going to kill us

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.000
as a nation if we're not careful.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.370
We've got a chance of
turning globalization

00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:09.570
into the positive it should be
-- a genuine ecumenical world,

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:13.140
a community of communities,
into locking each identifiable

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:15.570
like the elements of a watch,
but creating something greater

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:17.360
than the whole of the parts.

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.360
And we've got a chance
to use technology well.

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.630
Thank you all for your attention.

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.430
I appreciate it.

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:30.990
[ Applause ]

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:32.290
Should we do questions or --

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:33.590
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Well,
I promised to stimulating.

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:34.890
And I think John delivered.

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:39.690
We've got time for probably
about 10 minutes of Q&amp;A.

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:43.090
We have microphones.

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:45.410
So let the first brave
person [inaudible].

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:48.880
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: It would be nice

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:50.600
if you could just tell
me who you are, sir.

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah. My name is Gregory Gums.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:55.350
I'm from the Caribbean.

00:58:55.350 --> 00:59:00.100
And I must say I find your
thought very interesting.

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:02.900
And you touched on some
of the issues that I have.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.390
I'm from the Caribbean as I said.

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:07.270
We have in the Caribbean, you know,
the University of the West Indies.

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:09.920
I come from a very small
island [inaudible] Dutch.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.680
And I went to school [inaudible]
so I went to the Netherlands.

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.980
A lot of people in the school.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.740
And they went to Paris.

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:20.870 position:56%
I'm saying this to create a context
of what I'm going to ask you, right?

00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:24.070
And you have touched on some
of the issues here, right?

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:26.740
This kind of -- and it
couldn't be otherwise.

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:30.840
You know, I've been in universities
all over America from USC and stuff

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.440
like that in Southern California.

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.760
The issue that we face obviously
in the world, and you have kind

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.080
of touched on that, is
the fact that, you know,

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.860
these research institutions
are fundamentally grounded

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.490
in the north, right?

00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:47.780
Now we have a little bit China
starting to come, you know.

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:50.920
Actually, it has some
good universities.

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.010
Africa is still basically
nowhere, right?

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:55.840
A place that was colonized
by Europeans.

00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.200
You have Oxford, Cambridge.

00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.330 position:56%
They could have easily have put
like Oxford and Cambridge in Africa.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.630
Why didn't they do that?

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.540
Well, I think you can figure
out why they didn't do it

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.840
because it could lead

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.600
to intellectual competition,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.490
But this is a huge problem
for the world, right,

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:13.970
as the world globalizes, as
people become more world citizens.

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:17.260
And another big problem you
have, you didn't touch on it,

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:21.260
but universities came about
largely also in the West

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.850
as a handmaiden of
colonialism, right?

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.150
There was some criticism of it,

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:29.160
but it played a tremendous
central role in this whole process.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.050
So the fact that a
lot of the knowledge

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:35.330
in the world right now is
dominated by the North, right,

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:37.470
told from a Northern perspective,

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:41.050
often with very problematical
view of other people, right?

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:45.720
I mean, you talked about the fact
and I'm very positive about that,

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.700
that, you know, there are
so many talented people,

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.000
you know -- not from the Caribbean.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.260
I mean, Caribbean people have
been known to be talented.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:54.700
But from Africa, Central
Latin America,

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.630
who simply are outed to the sea.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:59.560
They have no chance to get
into these universities.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.670
And the consequences of that for
the world as we go forward, right?

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:10.150 position:56%
The need in essence, in essence
globalized that research institution

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:11.980
with all of the problems
that come along with that.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.380
So I would like to hear some
of your thinking about it.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.130
And also some of your thinking
of the limitations of the fact

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:19.150
that these research universities
have been in the North.

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:24.000
And a lot of the ideas have been
highly problematical for the South.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.400
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: So, I'm going
to put aside a few of the very,

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.470 position:56%
very big topics you raise because I
don't think they're necessary for me

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:35.770
to get to the heart [inaudible],

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.930
but I want to acknowledge
I'm putting them aside.

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:43.400
Western objectivism does not
capture all of reality, stipulated.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.510
You know, I'm a PhD.

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:53.010
I've taught major religions,
North, South, all time periods.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.770
I get it, okay?

01:01:54.770 --> 01:02:00.420
So it's not all about the
Western perspective on the world.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.250
That's the heart of my
ecumenical argument, okay?

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:04.550
So I accept that.

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:08.300
I don't want to get into
the history of colonialism

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.660
in the university and so forth.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.030
I mean, that's a complex story.

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:16.270
I'm interested in looking to
the future from where we are.

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:21.100 position:56%
And on that I agree with you
completely, which is that I've lived

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:26.120
through the experience
of NYU Abu Dhabi.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.090
We're now -- we're up -- we're
building to 2000 undergraduates

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.810
and a thousand PhD students.

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:34.990
So 3000 students overall.

01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:37.980
They are drawn literally
from around the world.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:42.900
So there are 124 countries that are
represented, genuinely represented.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.130
Not the children of expatriates
who live in Abu Dhabi.

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:48.000
But we're scouting
all around the world.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.230
And Moosebah is not
an isolated example.

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:56.710
And the fact of the matter
is that they're running

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:58.220 position:56%
with the best students in the world.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.660
Okay? We've graduated less
than a thousand students.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.780
In fact, I think it's only
about 700 students so far,

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.970
because we started off
with three small classes.

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:10.450
And we have six Rhodes Scholars
out of those 700 students.

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:12.060
And they've gone to Rhodes
Scholars and done very well.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.750
They're proving your point in
a way when given the chance.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:18.160
So the key thing becomes, how
do we get the change to them,

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.980
and how do we begin having a
genuinely ecumenical higher

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.280
education system?

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.580
And I accept that.

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:28.200
That's the response I
argue for on globalization.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.720
And I think it's a
positive-sum game.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.050
It is not a zero-sum game.

01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:34.030
I think American universities
-- I mean, look.

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:39.380
America is noted for its
nativism and its chauvinism.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.970
I think that those of ecumenism
would be very, very helpful.

01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:47.230
And I -- if you look at my
14 years as President of NYU,

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:50.100
that's where we move
as a university.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.360 position:56%
So I don't disagree with you at all.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.500
But I don't think dwelling
on the past and how we got

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.970
to where we are now is
particularly helpful.

01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:09.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My name is Rufus Game, a product
of the best schools in this country.

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:10.690
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: That must
be the Jesuit schools.

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:13.640
&gt;&gt; And [laughter].

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.490
Actually, one of them was.

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:20.570
And I'm now a judge --

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:21.870
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: Oh, you have to sit

01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:23.610
down so they can see me while
you're asking your question

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.030
or moved to the side, Rufus.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:26.330
That's a great idea.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:27.630
&gt;&gt; Here we go.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.350
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: But
it's a little hurtful.

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:33.790
I just succeeded as Jane
and Governor Patterson

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:36.020
and Jan will attest
-- I've just succeeded

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:40.040
on a 35-pound weightloss program
and a challenge form my kids.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.530
They had actually named
my stomach Rufus.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:43.830
But --

01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:45.130
&gt;&gt; Ooh [laughter].

01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:46.500
You know how to cut.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.720
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: I'm -- no.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.020
Go.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.890
&gt;&gt; My sense, having gone
to the best schools,

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:58.860
that it is that at the very top,
schools have themselves kind

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.560
of figured it out, how to
line up a way to get people

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.210
who want to go there to go there.

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:13.370 position:56%
But that really your -- the thrust
of your concern is working that back

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:17.640
down through the entire
array of schools.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:23.680 position:56%
And I -- if that's correct, I'd like
your comments on how do you spread

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.520
that so that the people
hoping to get

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:32.530
into some school have the same
opportunities that they would

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:36.490
at the best schools if people were
looking for them with scholarships.

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:37.790
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: Yeah.

01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:42.280
So let me -- this is not
a dissenting opinion.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.660
It's what we would call at the
Supreme Court, where Jan Hobley

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.990
and I worked together,
opinion concurring

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:51.240
in part and dissenting in part.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.740
So I just want to put a
little caution flag up.

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:56.010
I think having been educated

01:05:56.010 --> 01:06:00.270
at at least one Jesuit school
you'll probably accept this dialog

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:03.910
as a friendly amendment.

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:08.860
Speaking for one of the two or
three dozen most selected schools

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:17.020
in the country, you know, NYU, I'll
see we have not figured out how

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:21.370
to get a opportunity
down deep in society.

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:27.010
What we've figured out is how to
make ourselves extremely attractive

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:29.800
and to have people want us a lot,

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.760
and to get a sufficiently
diverse student body

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.400
that our consciences
are not shocked.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.290
But I could give you story
after story after story.

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:47.030
I mean, I told you I've not
gone on for-profit boards.

01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:52.280
Therefore, I've been a very
active member on various boards

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.520
that are consistent with the
message I'm giving you today.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:01.300
And I'm on one board, for example,
that -- for a foundation --

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:06.350
relatively small, but it spends
a lot of effort and resources

01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:10.970
out into places where
no one looks for kids.

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:15.640
And it pulls those kids in
and on three campuses --

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.940
Princeton, NYU, and Harvard --

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:21.850
it runs a five-week boot
camp for those kids.

01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:28.930
And I think the average rise out
of 1600 on the SAT for the Kids,

01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:32.850
and it's something like 80 to 100
kids that are in those boot camps,

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:38.930
the average rise is something like
450 points out of 1600 on the SAT,

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.360
proving that it is
eminently coachable.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.070
But these kids never would have
gotten the coaching, right,

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:49.250
that in my city, people
routinely pay for, you know?

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:52.850
Hundreds of dollars an hour
they pay for the coaching.

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:59.030
So -- and those kids end up going
to the places that we would want

01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:02.860 position:56%
to send our kids, those schools
you're talking about, including NYU.

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:06.100
But they end up going only
because somebody has reached out,

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:10.690
discovered them, told them
it's important as a choice.

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:14.210
See, there's a whole lot of
information along the way that,

01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:17.510
if we don't work systematically
as a society --

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.920
first, I'm saying there's
a big enough problem here

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.220
in the United States.

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:26.820 position:56%
My life is now about raising the
standards for those tens of millions

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.120
of kids around the world.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.520
That gets to this point
that was raised

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.130
with the first question, okay?

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:38.430
And -- because out there, I'm
telling you, there are students

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:41.710
that are as good as better than
the students that are going

01:08:41.710 --> 01:08:43.750
to the schools that
you and I care about.

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:45.210
But they haven't been found.

01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:46.510
And you know what?

01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:47.810
They're smart.

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:51.580
And if we don't give them a
chance, if we don't give them hope,

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:56.290
they're going to get angry and
then you got smart angry people

01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:57.590
out there.

01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:03.300
And when you have not hundreds or
thousands or hundreds of thousands

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.310
or millions, but tens of millions

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:08.340
of smart angry people
out there, you know.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:16.320
I got 1.2 million, 1.2
million Syrian kids in Turkey,

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.580
Lebanon, and Jordan, as we speak.

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:21.880
One point 2 million.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.450
Syria had a pretty good education
system before 500 schools were

01:09:25.450 --> 01:09:28.330
destroyed and they were
forced to flee their country.

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:31.230
Eight-five percent literacy rate.

01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:32.980
But three years those
kids have been either

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.280
in the camps or on the street.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.970
Seventy-five percent in the
camps, 25% in the streets,

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:38.440
getting no education at all.

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.200
They know what they're missing.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.500
They know what they're missing.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:46.690
Now the sad thing is when I go
around and speak to governments

01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:49.280
about helping that, when I speak to
the United States State Department,

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:54.480
the humanitarian argument
doesn't raise the dial very much.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:59.090
The economic argument, it will be
good for -- raises [inaudible].

01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:01.210
The security argument,
ehhh, ehhh, ehhh.

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:04.000 position:56%
You know, now -- because you want to
know where the next people are going

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.040
to come from that are going
to be angry and smart enough

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.210
to do something about it?

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:14.700
So we got to get to this and
we got to get to it here.

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.170
But we got to get to it worldwide.

01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:20.120
Yes, we have very,
very good schools.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.870
And they're diverse.

01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:24.170
But not enough.

01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:25.470
&gt;&gt; Question [inaudible].

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:26.770
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: Yeah.

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:28.070
Thank you.

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:29.370
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] I'm here.

01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:30.670
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: Okay.

01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:31.970
I'm sorry.

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:33.270
My answers are too long.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:34.570
I apologize.

01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:35.870
&gt;&gt; Yes, I know.

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.170
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: I'm sorry.

01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:38.470
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Professor Sexton.

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:39.770
Actually, President Emeritus,
comma, Sexton, for this talk.

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:41.070
I was actually very touched by
some of the comments you made.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:44.160
But actually some [inaudible] and
also -- but not for your own fault.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.460
But my name is John del Pino.

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.760
I'm now 47 years old.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.470
But back in 1988/'89 I wrote
about some of these very issues

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:54.950 position:56%
that you talked about at, again, one
of the leading research institutions

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:56.560
in the world -- I would
argue the best in the world,

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.070
the University of Chicago.

01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:01.930
At the time I was President of
the Hispanic Student Association.

01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:05.140 position:56%
And, ironically, I've been rereading
something I wrote back then,

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.440
even before your talk.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.140
I didn't know you were
touching these issues.

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.940
I wrote a series of essays back
then in April, May, and June.

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:13.200
1990, called "What is the Future

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.560
of the Spanish [inaudible]
our Education?

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.600
And I'm more happy to
share with you later on.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.320
But it was published actually
in Chicago [inaudible] in which

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.620
in a six-part series of essays,

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.160
I talked about these very
themes that you talked about.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.260
Unfortunately, not through any
lack of neglect on your part,

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.750
but it seems like kind of sad to
me how you regress to much more

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:32.010
than I would have anticipated on
some very topics that you raised,

01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:34.890
whether it's some of
these kids you mentioned

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:38.940
about who make their last grasp for
education at high school diplomas

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:41.980
or lack of access information,
whether [inaudible] of poor schools

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:47.140 position:56%
or a lack of being fully engaged in
access information by having parents

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.030
who necessarily might not be
engaged in the total process.

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:50.950
Unlike our communities in
the U.S. are more aware

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:52.970
of simply knowledge
and opportunities.

01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:58.600 position:56%
Not through any of these deliberate
design but just simply by awareness.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.480
And also by somewhat
political neglect

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.260
and sometimes almost
by deliberateness.

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.400
As [inaudible] you know, the recent
statistics about there's more --

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.530
regresses more [inaudible] in
some parts of the country now.

01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:12.080
And for lack of time,
I just want [inaudible]

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.760
by saying I really applaud you

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.340
for having the courage
to raise these issues.

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:20.310
I certainly hope an ideal
situation we can really fully

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:21.610
progress further.

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:24.460
I know for one I've not given
up thinking about these issues.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.250
And I for one am fully proud
[inaudible] my institution,

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:28.550
many others around the world.

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:30.080
You also [inaudible]
others to continue

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.990
to encourage the life of the mind.

01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:36.350
And with all due respect
to the first gentleman,

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:40.880
I think these very issues that
I became aware at the University

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.700
of Chicago and elsewhere, when I've
not fully been aware throughout my

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:46.160
knowledge of history
and to men of courage.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.570 position:56%
I'm going to encourage to help them.

01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:49.950
Try to push the ball further
down the field so to speak.

01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:51.250
And I applaud you for them.

01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:53.150
Like you said, let's not
dwell too much on the past.

01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:54.450
Let's try to go forward.

01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:57.030
But also learning -- minding of
the certain lessons of the past.

01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:59.570
And [inaudible] tonight, I
said, to paraphrase, you know,

01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:01.360
not to repeat the same mistakes.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.720
We try to learn from
and move forward.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.700
Thank you very much.

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.000
&gt;&gt; John Sexton: Thank you, Joh.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.450
It's a good place to close.

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:14.320
I'll just use your comments to
just connect the dots once again

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.160
in case I've not made myself clear.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:25.450
So I began by talking about
three topics that we could talk

01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:29.130
about outside of the
context of higher education.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:35.550
You know, what you see in our
civic and political discourse --

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:39.700
I mean, just remember, the
Hirschman quote I read was 1991.

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.170 position:56%
The Edwards example I gave was 2004.

01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:44.510
I didn't give any from this year.

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:46.150
You're living it.

01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:51.050
Go home and watch <i>Sports Center</i>
tonight [laughter], okay?

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:52.910
And see what we've done.

01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:57.600
But what it is, what
it is, you understand,

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.600
that we may be witnessing is
the death of thought, right?

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.850
I mean, if we just
continue to devalue thought

01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:09.870
and put aside whether it's good
or bad for research universities.

01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:11.170
It's obviously bad.

01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.540
But it's not good for society.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.840
It's not good.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.700
You know, we were put on
Earth as homosapiends, right?

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:21.280
I mean, it's -- so then you see

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.330
that the university can be
an antidote to this, right?

01:14:24.330 --> 01:14:25.630
And it's quixotic.

01:14:25.630 --> 01:14:29.310
But it can be an antidote to it.

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:34.330
Then you move to globalization and,
again, it's an unavoidable thing.

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:39.190
I mean, you know, the
phenomena that are working

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:44.630
out are just what [inaudible] de
Jardin spoke about in the 1940's.

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:47.390
So the world is coming together.

01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:50.660
Now are we going to come
together and cause a combustion,

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.090 position:56%
or are we going to come together and
create a community of communities?

01:14:53.090 --> 01:14:55.180
Again, this is a very big question.

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:59.630
Again, higher education has
a key role to play in it.

01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:05.960
And then you get to technology
and technology is not the enemy

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.310
of what we're trying to do here.

01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:09.440
It's -- I don't worry
about it being disruptive.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.470
It's not going to disrupt.

01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:19.990
It's going to change many
different parts of the orchestra.

01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:22.460
And if we use it right, it will
democratize higher education

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.180
as long as we have ladders up.

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:30.560 position:56%
Okay? But it can't be used to stamp
other people's kids with a BA degree

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.200
and declare a political victory.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.990
That's the danger, you see.

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.290
That's the danger.

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:39.000
It's that it runs down the value.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.160
And, you know, oh, look, our
college graduation rates are up.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.310
And then the final element that I
meant is meant to tie it together.

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.570
And this is, John, the
point that you're making.

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:51.800
And I tie it back positively
to the point

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:56.450
that was made out of the Caribbean.

01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:58.130
For me, it's a moral issue.

01:15:58.130 --> 01:16:01.440
For the, the humanitarian
argument is enough.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.070
You cannot waste a
mind that's out there.

01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:06.650
And I've lived it because I
teach these kids in Abu Dhabi.

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:09.660
And I'm telling you it's
an amazing thing to see.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:12.750
And they -- and to know that
the Moosebah's and the Teyho's

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:16.970
and the others would
have had nothing

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:18.270
because they never
would have been found

01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:19.930
and they never would have
known it made a difference.

01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:25.510
And then to see the Syrian kids and
they know it makes a difference.

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:29.240
So it's not enough.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:32.320
This is where the flavor of
Rawlsianism has to come in.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.040
And it was my last, my kind of
punchline that pulls it together.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.670
As we think about the --
elevating civic discourse

01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:44.160 position:56%
and embracing globalization and
utilizing technology to the maximum,

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.470
it's only going to work if
we generalize it in a way

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.800
that we don't know where, you know,

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.130
in the Rawls Table
we're sitting, you know?

01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:57.810
And it works for everybody
at the table.

01:16:57.810 --> 01:17:05.600
And that requires a fairly
massive investment of resources

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:09.260
because the education that we want
at those best schools, by the way,

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:13.600
is -- and I'll just close
by recommending a book --

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.050
<i>Why Does College Cost So Much </i>?

01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:19.950
Okay? <i>Why Does College
Cost So Much </i>?

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:23.070
And it's because in a
well-functioning economy,

01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:27.150
a high-talent service industry goes
up more rapidly than inflation.

01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:28.670
So then the only question
becomes, okay,

01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:31.490
if it's the cost that's
going up, what's the subsidy?

01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:34.270 position:56%
And cost minus subsidy equals price.

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:37.030
And it doesn't require a
rocket scientist to figure

01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:40.120
out if you withdraw subsidy
and cost is going up,

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.970
price is going to go up.

01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:44.910
Or quality is going to go down.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.600
So we, you know, we got
to get out of this kind

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.770
of very simple minded
debate that, you know --

01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:52.680
and it all works synergistically
to me because that's

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.570
when the demagogue can say to
those who are allergic to nuance

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:59.410
and complexity, your
costs are going up.

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:00.770
So the solution is what?

01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:04.000
Give everybody -- freeze tuition.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.350
Okay, freeze tuition.

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:09.040
I'll go on record right now and
say that is a stupid policy.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.700
Freezing tuition gives Donald Trump

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:15.440
and William Gates's
children scholarships.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.160
Okay? It doesn't make sense.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.900 position:56%
But it's hard to -- there will be
another talk to explain that to you.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:23.140
But I'm telling you, that's
not the good social policy.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.630
And we got to get to
ourselves to a point

01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:27.590
where these four things are
working together positively.

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:29.480
And then we can have a
world that we're proud of.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.720
It's not going to happen
in my lifetime,

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.700
but it will happen
in Jane's, I'm sure.

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.000
All right.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.800
Thank you all very, very much.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:44.180
[ Applause ]

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:46.380
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Thank you
President Sexton and thank you

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.930
to all of you who were
here this afternoon

01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:51.000
for this lecture at
the Kluge Center.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.730
We do have refreshments for you.

01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:54.670
I hope the conversation
will continue.

01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:56.970
Thank you.

01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:01.760
