00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.440
The thing behind how you
build an ad words campaign,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.650
is similar to how you
build any campaign.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.060
Just remember to understand
your user and target audience.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.560
Explore different key words and
different messaging and

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.895
keep iterating and
optimizing until you see your desired.

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:14.443
Results.

00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:17.335
Now, Ad words can be a bit expensive
when you're new and starting out,

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.045
because it's a popular tool and
competition can be high.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:21.855
But, people keep searching and

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:26.225
they keep paying attention to the top
paid result, so it's worth optimizing.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:26.835
But don't worry.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:28.505
There are other options you can explore.

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:30.305
You can try looking for
younger channels,

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:32.785
like paid ads on YouTube or Instagram.

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:35.395
Or you can even explore
completely untapped platforms and

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:36.705
find new opportunities for growth.
