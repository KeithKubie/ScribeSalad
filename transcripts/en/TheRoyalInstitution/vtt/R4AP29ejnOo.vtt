00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.960
Antimatter.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.395
That word probably makes you
think of Star Trek or Doctor

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:19.440
Who, or something
else like that.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.450
But far from being
science fiction,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.350
antimatter is science fact.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.840
And it's one of the
most interesting

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.880
substances in the Universe.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.000
In fact, its behaviour is one of
the biggest mysteries that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.470
we have in fundamental
physics today.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.460
And I work on an experiment at
CERN's Large Hadron Collider,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.750
which is devoted to trying to
understand this illusive stuff

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.940
in more detail.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.340
So why is it so important?

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.150
Well, the deal is that we
understand that everything in

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.450
the Universe is made of
fundamental particles--

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.200
matter--

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.250
and we know that every type of
fundamental particle has an

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.350
antimatter counterpart that
behaves as a mirror image,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080
oppositely-charged version.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.540
The interesting thing about
antimatter is it when it meets

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.989
normal matter, it annihilates,
releasing

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.860
enormous amounts of energy.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.420
So if I have a quarter of a
gramme of antimatter meeting a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.970
quarter of a gramme of normal
matter, the resulting

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.740
annihilation has the explosive
force of 5 kilotons of TNT.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.180
Now, that's something you'd
notice, but it doesn't seem to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.320
be happening around us on Earth
and it doesn't seem to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.610
be happening out in space,
anywhere, where we've been

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.794
able to look.

00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:29.110
And that is the mystery.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.910
That's really strange, because,
we think, that when

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.170
the Universe started in the Big
Bang, half of it was made

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.400
of antimatter.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.000
And just after the Big Bang, the
fundamental particles that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.465
composed the Universe met, and
the antimatter and matter

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:46.120
versions annihilated each other,
and these annihilations

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.660
created photons of light, that
then could split into new

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
pairs of matter and antimatter
particles.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.450
And this whole process of
annihilation continued, as the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.180
Universe expanded
and cooled down.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.110
Until, eventually, a few seconds
after the Big Bang,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.650
the Universe had cooled so much
as it had expanded that

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.870
there was no longer enough
energy left in these

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.190
annihilation from the
antimatter-matter collisions

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.200
to make new pairs of matter and
antimatter, and the whole

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.166
process of annihilation
stopped at that time.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:23.430
Of what remains in the Universe
now, what built stars

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.960
and galaxies, and us is a
consequence of a very tiny

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.010
difference between the amount of
matter and antimatter that

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.840
must have existed
at that point.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.800
But the fact that there was
that difference is so

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.300
significant, because it tipped
the Universe in favour of

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.370
matter and let us exist today.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.830
And it's for that reason that
we really need to understand

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.780
antimatter.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.600
It's still one of the biggest
unsolved mysteries in

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.600
fundamental physics.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.430
And that's why our experiments
are eagerly taken data to try

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.956
and find the difference
from LHC collisions.

00:02:57.956 --> 00:03:02.720
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.070
We have no underlying
explanation for why antimatter

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.450
should be different.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.970
We almost had no expectation
that antimatter should exist.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.270
And only that equation that
predicted it, well, that's our

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.000
only theoretical input.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.510
And that predicts matter and
antimatter should be the same.
