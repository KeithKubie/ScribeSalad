00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.520
OLIVIA: We are incredibly
lucky and delighted to have

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.960
two of the best,
and most well-known,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.050
restaurateurs and chefs
proprietors in San

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.240
Francisco in the Bay Area,
Chef Hiro Sone and Chef Lissa

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.170
Doumani.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.420
Good friends of
mine, but the people

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.520
who put Napa on the map
with food, many years ago

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.280
with their restaurant Terra.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.470
And then they opened
Ame, in the city.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.010
And then there is something
they may reveal later

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.240
about another restaurant.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.600
But those two are perennial
Michelin star restaurants.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.869
In 2003 you were named
James Beard best chef?

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:49.410
HIRO SONE: Yes, Best
Chef California.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.070
SPEAKER: Best Chef California.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.450
And so, very early on
Terra was the place

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.620
I went to for astonishingly
beautiful food that

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.150
was so fresh and so local.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.160
I'll let them talk about
their romance later,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.990
but they met at
Spago in Los Angeles.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.130
And so it was a
trans-Pacific romance,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.957
and all sorts of things right?

00:01:14.957 --> 00:01:16.290
LISSA DOUMANI: A language issue.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.402
OLIVIA: A language issue.

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:18.110
HIRO SONE: Still.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.693
OLIVIA: Still.

00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:20.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:21.910
LISSA DOUMANI: Before
It really was one,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.484
now it's because we're married.

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.919
OLIVIA: Intense-- that gets
more intense, but I-- OK.

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:28.710
I will leave that--

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.632
HIRO SONE: Yeah, we
try not to go there.

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.640
OLIVIA: So, they
have, of course,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.492
their beautiful
cookbook "Terra,"

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:42.150
but this new book
is a departure.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.692
The official title, "A Visual
Guide to Sushi-Making at Home."

00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:46.316
LISSA DOUMANI: It's
a really long name.

00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:48.660
OLIVIA: And I think it comes
from very deep within them.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.550
It's been described
as autobiographical.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.170
And I think it is
what they love to do,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.290
and what they love together,
and probably love to eat.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.640
And the book is
incredibly accessible

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.800
for the American home cook.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.150
And so, although I don't
think any of the restaurants

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.979
will officially have
sushi on the menu,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.910
we are especially lucky
that they are telling us

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.720
how to do it and
do it perfectly.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.759
So, welcome.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.050
Welcome to Google, both of you.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.500
LISSA DOUMANI: Thank you.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.840
HIRO SONE: Thank you very much.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.370
OLIVIA: And you're going to do
a couple of things mix-and-match

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.220
from the book.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.760
So, I'm going to
leave it to you.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.590
Tell us what you're going to do.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.820
HIRO SONE: Good afternoon.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.111
LISSA DOUMANI: Ok, first I'm
going to explain something

00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:34.380
because the first question when
we came in is, Olivia asked us,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.670
would we like chefs' jackets.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.340
And usually when we
do cooking classes,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.820
we do wear chefs' jackets.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.780
But this is sushi from home.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.386
We do not wear them at home.

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:43.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.600
So we thought for
this we should be

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.940
just like when we would be
when we're actually making it.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.570
And yes, he usually
leaves wherever

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.770
I am and goes someplace else.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.350
So, that's why we don't
look like we usually

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.250
do when we do this.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.050
You can talk now.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.210
HIRO SONE: OK.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.410
So we have a limited
time and first we're

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.350
going to start with
making sushi rice,

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.630
basically using Japanese rice.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.710
There are instructions
in our book, how to wash

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.200
and how to cook.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.696
So, steaming hot
Japanese rice here.

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:19.070
And we're going
to put it in now.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.319
LISSA DOUMANI: Ok, at home
we don't have one of these.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.350
I've never seen one.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.100
HIRO SONE: You don't
have to use this.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.100
LISSA DOUMANI: So
don't try to find that.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.400
It looks like what you put your
personal things in the laundry

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.147
with.

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:31.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.350
HIRO SONE: Yeah.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.450
And this special vessel is
called hangiri in Japanese.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.625
Basically, cutting
rice, it means cut rice.

00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:43.280
LISSA DOUMANI:
Does this say fan?

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.946
HIRO SONE: No, it says Google.

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:49.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.570
LISSA DOUMANI: Ok,
that's not kawaii.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.110
HIRO SONE: So this is sushizu.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.320
Also in the book, how to make.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.430
Basically vinegar,
Japanese vinegar,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.820
rice vinegar, sugar and kelp.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.150
Boil it together and
salt, and strain the kelp.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.830
There's some remaining in
here but, it's good for you.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.549
So just--

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.840
LISSA DOUMANI: It adds texture.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.220
HIRO SONE: It has
to be hot rice.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.379
OLIVIA: Is that a special
fan people have to have?

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.822
LISSA DOUMANI: You have
to go make this fan.

00:04:17.822 --> 00:04:18.269
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.820
You don't have to
have it say Google,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.279
it can say anything you'd like.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.690
HIRO SONE: So basically, we
don't want to smash rice.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.520
We're going to cut
rice and make it flaky.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.537
First, kind of looks like
smashing, but touching rice.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.600
OLIVIA: And why is it important
to have a chef fan it for you

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.650
while you're cutting?

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.358
LISSA DOUMANI: It
makes him feel special.

00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:46.540
HIRO SONE: You can see
the evaporation here.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.580
If you don't make more
evaporation happening.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.570
Sushi rice gets wet.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.332
So, you want to evaporate excess
water, moisture from the rice.

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:00.790
LISSA DOUMANI:
It'll make it gummy.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.370
HIRO SONE: Also, this
special vessel, it's wood,

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.470
so it dissolves
all the steam too.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.540
So, that's going to help absorb.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.041
Yeah.

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:10.623
LISSA DOUMANI: So,
at home, of course,

00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:11.850
we actually had one of these.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.270
He lost it.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.770
But, we don't usually, we don't
really-- he's still looking.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.650
We don't really know--
we don't use this.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.250
HIRO SONE: Fan here please.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.747
LISSA DOUMANI: Fan here please.

00:05:18.747 --> 00:05:19.247
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:19.247 --> 00:05:20.238
I'm not doing my job.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.690
OK.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.260
So we just use a wide
bowl and do this.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.910
And you know that
thing, this thing?

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.470
Because when you do
this by yourself,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.570
that's what this feels like.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.570
Because you're trying to
cut the rice and fan it

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.067
with the other hand.

00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:39.900
Sometimes you just have
to stop, because you

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.416
can't chew bubble gum and walk.

00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:43.290
HIRO SONE: You can't?

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.010
LISSA DOUMANI: Its
like the same problem.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.910
HIRO SONE: So, as you see, you
can see the individual rice

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.410
grains.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.370
It's not clumped.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.550
That's what we want.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.930
And we want to fan until it's
almost like body temperature.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.170
So you keep doing that.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.135
Let's taste.

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:06.260
LISSA DOUMANI: Yeah, let's.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.936
He's not going to
give me a taste.

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:09.560
OLIVIA: Chefs, what
kind of temperature

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.130
are you trying to take this to?

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.180
HIRO SONE: Your body
temperature, basically.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.680
OLIVIA: Ok.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.180
Alright.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.210
HIRO SONE: Pretty good.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.120
So can you keep doing this?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.120
LISSA DOUMANI: Yeah,
because I can walk and do--

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.271
OLIVIA: It gets expensive
to get her to do that.

00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:27.270
LISSA DOUMANI: It's going
to cost you something.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.880
HIRO SONE: Or you can use a fan.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.590
An electric fan.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.030
That's what most
restaurants use.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.370
Just blowing, keep blowing.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.620
LISSA DOUMANI: We don't have
one of those, we have me.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.820
HIRO SONE: Then after
you make the sushi

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.470
rice you want to keep it in a
vessel, or something like this.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:50.840
Or, home, you can keep a cloth
napkin and put the rice here.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.400
And try to keep it warm,
like body temperature.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.670
That's the best, at
that temperature,

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.370
You can taste rice really
well at that temperature.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.370
So you can keep warm water
and put a small bowl,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.410
and you can put the lid, and
you can keep the rice that way.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.910
And if the rice
starts getting cold,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.680
change the water to warm it up.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.900
So you can maintain
the temperature.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.585
Can I get some in here?

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.852
Let's see.

00:07:25.852 --> 00:07:26.810
It's cooled off enough.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.404
OLIVIA: How large a batch
would you make at home, chefs?

00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:33.070
HIRO SONE: Home?

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.632
We cook maybe
three cups of rice.

00:07:34.632 --> 00:07:36.090
LISSA DOUMANI:
Three cups, I think.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.210
I can't remember exactly
what the recipe says,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.880
but it's plenty.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.840
And you don't need
to make all the rice

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.060
you cook into sushi rice.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.190
Am I done?

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.532
HIRO SONE: Yes, and Chef
Jerome can help you.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.380
Next, I'm going to
show you using tuna

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.310
to make three different sushi.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.330
Actually, two different
sushi and one sashimi.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.664
So let's get the tuna over here.

00:08:01.664 --> 00:08:04.121
LISSA DOUMANI: So one of the
things in the book that you'll

00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:05.920
notice, is that more
than a third of it

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.030
is designated to how
to break down fish.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.600
We spent a lot of
time, we argued more

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.100
than any two people
are supposed to.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.860
Because if he used turn the
fish 180 degrees, and then

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.540
45 degrees to this, and
put the tail on your head,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.790
I was going to hurt him.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.851
Because obviously,
this isn't what

00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:25.350
you're going to buy
at a fish store.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.840
But eventually he's going to cut
it to a piece that you can buy.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.230
Now what.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.270
And so, it was important
with every fish

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.590
that we show how you
actually clean an octopus,

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.659
prepare a squid, do a scallop,
do a whole side of a tuna,

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.317
do a sea bass, everything.

00:08:41.317 --> 00:08:42.650
So that you could do it at home.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.760
We realize not
everyone's going to.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.410
But it's something
that at least helps

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.570
you understand when you're going
to slice the fish, what you're

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.420
looking for.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.110
Because you can buy good
fillets of things at markets.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.867
The hard one is the shape
that you want the tuna from.

00:08:56.867 --> 00:08:58.950
That you actually have to
go to a Japanese market,

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.740
or do it yourself.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.720
HIRO SONE: So, this is
almost a quarter of tuna.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.830
The tail part is missing.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.720
This side has a head,
and this right here

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.210
is the belly, and another belly.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.210
Another loin comes here.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.380
So basically, almost
quarter of the fish.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:23.420
And you see, at the sushi bar,
they call it toro, or chu-toro.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.070
It usually comes from this area.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.860
As you see, the color
is very different.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.740
This is almost red,
and this is pale.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.970
You can see the
color difference.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.475
And big eye tuna has more fat.

00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:44.150
Of course bluefin has more
fat here, that's real toro.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.310
This is yellowfin.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.070
And so, it doesn't
have very much fat.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.550
So, I know you don't get
this kind of fish at home,

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.050
but basically, let's see.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.440
I'm going to break down this.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.750
LISSA DOUMANI: You
can get this quality.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.660
HIRO SONE: A nice
indication is to take

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.690
a look at this
dark part of meat.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.010
It's what we call
bloodline, and usually

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.730
if fish gets old it
really becomes black.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.060
That's too old.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.550
You've got the nice
one right here.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.140
It's almost dark pink.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.380
OLIVIA: Chef, does the
blood in the bloodline

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.200
actually diffuse into the
flesh if it's too old?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.200
HIRO SONE: Yes it does,
if you keep it too long.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.820
But you can see
this nice dark red.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.370
That's a good sign of
good, nice, fresh fish.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.740
So I'm going to
take-- Let's see.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.850
The sous chef usually keeps out
a section of tuna called saku.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:46.360
That's a section,
loin, ready to slice.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.130
So usually, the
length is about this.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.950
Some chefs use a finger
to measure the size.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.636
Some chefs use some
kind of things.

00:10:55.636 --> 00:10:57.790
But, I usually
cut almost, how do

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.036
you say-- How many
inches is that?

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:01.827
LISSA DOUMANI: Six.

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:02.821
HIRO SONE: Six.

00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:05.290
Six inches.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.540
LISSA DOUMANI: And you're
also not using a long knife,

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.100
you're using a heavier knife.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.320
HIRO SONE: Yeah, because I
had to cut through the skin

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.800
and they usually come
off with some scales.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.890
So I wipe it off.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.740
You can see, if we go to
Tsukiji Market in Tokyo,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.010
they use knives with
lengths about this long.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.780
Almost like a samurai sword.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.020
And I'm going to give
this one to Chef Jerome.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.940
So you can use that.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.490
And this one too.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.275
So after this--

00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:53.390
LISSA DOUMANI: So
we're still not

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.950
to the size you would buy
at the grocery store yet.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.830
HIRO SONE: You can
see some nice fatty

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.800
area and the dark red area.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.890
Very lean meat here.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.170
And a lot of people
prefer this area,

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.820
because there's more
flavor in the fat.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:17.750
So I'm going to trim the
bloodline, the dark black spot

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.250
first.

00:12:20.162 --> 00:12:21.620
LISSA DOUMANI: So
this is something

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.394
you would do really slowly.

00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:24.810
Really watch where
you're cutting,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.700
because you don't want to
gouge into the part of the meat

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.980
that you want.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.180
And you can always go back and
trim just a little bit more.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.011
He's going to have to go
back and get some of this.

00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:38.260
So don't think you have to
get it all in the first go.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.950
HIRO SONE: Then you
see the big sinew here,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:57.840
so I go knife from
here to bottom.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.310
Touch the skin and go up.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:05.090
Then you get the almost
skin-free loin here.

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:08.400
Then this side.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.650
Again, just slide
the knife slowly.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.510
OLIVIA: Is that
side for me chef?

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.330
HIRO SONE: Maybe.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.710
So I left some meat.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.460
This is good for
chopping too, right here.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.300
Very flavorful meat.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.680
Chop and make a hand roll.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.680
LISSA DOUMANI: And if you
don't have that skill,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.240
you could use a
spoon and scrape it.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.429
HIRO SONE: This part
you can eat too, but--

00:13:32.429 --> 00:13:34.470
LISSA DOUMANI: That would
be a whole other class.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.130
He's very proud of himself.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.939
He made tuna bloodline
blood sausage the other day.

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:41.480
HIRO SONE: Yeah,
the other day I did.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.217
OLIVIA: Ooh.

00:13:42.217 --> 00:13:42.800
AUDIENCE: Yum.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.610
LISSA DOUMANI: And
he used the tuna

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.030
fat to make the
little dots in it.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.680
HIRO SONE: So, after
you clean the tuna

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.240
you want to change
the cutting board

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.815
to a skin or scale-free zone.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.765
So I'm going to get the saku.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.270
LISSA DOUMANI: You
need to explain.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.560
Remember how you decide where
to cut it so that they know.

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:25.930
This is a class.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.540
HIRO SONE: We made a little
piece of paper like this size.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.270
So, how many portions you
can get from the loin.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.600
You can take a look.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.980
Attach the little
piece of paper.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.600
But, you get the idea.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.770
So what I tried to
do is basically,

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:45.210
try to get something like this.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.617
You see this one in the
sushi bar, in the showcase.

00:14:47.617 --> 00:14:48.450
That's what you see.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.420
So this is a
technique sushi chef--

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.580
because each time tuna
is a different size,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.840
different shape.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.610
But you have to always get
almost the same size saku.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:23.460
So many experiences give you the
best way to get-- even smaller.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.790
LISSA DOUMANI: The
other thing that we

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.460
tried to explain in
writing which was hard,

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.874
is that you don't
buy a chunk that big.

00:15:30.874 --> 00:15:32.290
You're going to
buy a piece that's

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.410
maybe an inch to
two inches in size,

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.340
because you're
doing this at home.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.300
This you can see
is a lot of tuna.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.210
Yes, we can probably
eat that, but you

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.470
might want to have something
more than just tuna.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.380
So you would buy
a smaller piece.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.950
You may not be able to
do it standing upright,

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:49.760
like he did it.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.580
You might need to
lay it on its side,

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.400
but the cutting
process is the same.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.300
So, if you think about how
he cut down from the bottom,

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.790
if it's laying down, you
cut across the bottom.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.690
So that you can get
these same pieces.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:06.470
HIRO SONE: So this one, as you
see, there's a lot of sinew.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.630
And you can test it first.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:13.570
You can eat without
treating anything.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:18.700
Or you have to scrape
off meat from sinew.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.140
This is pretty tender so, I'll
go ahead and make another saku

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:22.890
from this.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.940
You can get another
portion from this.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.530
If you taste it's
too sinewy, you're

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.380
going to scrape
off with the spoon.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.370
So the technique will be--

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.780
LISSA DOUMANI: Is that my job?

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:43.960
HIRO SONE: Yeah.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.900
Lissa can show you.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:59.660
So take a spoon and gently
scrape off the meat.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.910
LISSA DOUMANI: You're going
just between the sinew.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.944
HIRO SONE: This is
like a sous chef's job.

00:17:04.944 --> 00:17:07.036
Chef doesn't do it.

00:17:07.036 --> 00:17:09.119
LISSA DOUMANI: Chef has
to wash the dishes though.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.660
HIRO SONE: Oh, why
don't you do this?

00:17:11.544 --> 00:17:12.960
LISSA DOUMANI:
Wow, that was mean.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.640
HIRO SONE: So actually,
sushi connoisseurs

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.770
prefer this part of
the meat because it's

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.119
very flavorful meat.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.492
Just looks a little ugly.

00:17:27.492 --> 00:17:29.200
LISSA DOUMANI: Doesn't
look ugly once you

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.227
put chopped green
onion and stuff in it.

00:17:31.227 --> 00:17:32.560
HIRO SONE: Let me wash my hands.

00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:36.792
LISSA DOUMANI: I also
like it because it's

00:17:36.792 --> 00:17:37.625
kind of idiot-proof.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.540
OLIVIA: So, how often
are you making sushi

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.180
at home for yourselves?

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.460
HIRO SONE: Before we made
this book, almost every week

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.769
we make sushi.

00:17:52.769 --> 00:17:55.310
LISSA DOUMANI: And lately, he's
been getting beautiful tunas,

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.810
and half a tuna to Terra.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.110
And so, somehow just a little
bit of the belly comes home.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.286
it's the parts like
this, not those.

00:18:04.286 --> 00:18:05.370
But, it's ok.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.590
OLIVIA: So, do people
walk into Terra and say,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.620
would you please, please,
please make me some sushi?

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.710
LISSA DOUMANI: They don't
because, we don't have rice.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.680
So we only do sashimi and
crudo and that sort of thing.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.100
We do now do, almost from any
fish we have that we can do it,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.640
we roast the heads.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.200
And we're really surprised at
how many people like the tuna

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.000
head.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.350
We'll do a half a tuna head.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.670
It, of course, comes
out this big on a plate.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.140
And there's a few places
there's chunks of meat.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.210
But, people are
really into them.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.540
It's so cool.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:44.430
Or you've done yellowtail,
you've done hamachi, salmon.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.220
It's really nice.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.700
It's good to see that people
aren't afraid to get--

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.400
Do you want this
now or something?

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.860
You look very worried.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.050
HIRO SONE: No.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:57.530
So, I'm going to show you
the fish called tataki.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.056
It's a huge sheet pan.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:02.920
It's basically seared.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.070
Sashimi preparation,
but it's seared outside.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:12.700
So you can do it in a saute
pan, with a little oil.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.730
High temperature,
cook quickly, seared.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.830
Or, you can use a torch.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.370
If you have it in the house.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.920
LISSA DOUMANI: Or
if not, go buy one.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.800
They're good for everything.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:30.590
[BLOW TORCH FIRES]

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:35.780
HIRO SONE: Traditionally,
Japanese people use bonito,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.915
but with the tuna, you can
use this technique too.

00:19:39.915 --> 00:19:41.290
LISSA DOUMANI:
And you've noticed

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:46.640
how tataki has entered into the
American cooking terminology.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.460
We tataki New York
steak, we tataki fish.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.670
I think they've
tataki-ed vegetables.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:56.070
I don't really know what
that means, but I've seen it.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.553
it's now become
common terminology.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.710
Now when were writing the
book, there was always a recipe

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.310
that we had a lot
of arguments about.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.700
And this was one of them.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.540
Because Hiro is truly
a purist, and he

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.400
wants to teach things from
the very basic of what it is.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.490
So, it's in the book.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.470
We finally said, fine, you can
have your little paragraph.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:21.254
You have to go out and find
rice hulls, the whole sheath,

00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:22.670
and the whole thing
from the rice.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.390
And you have to build a
little fire, and have a grate,

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.570
and you put these little
skewers through it,

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.370
and that's how you
grill the tataki.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.802
Because somewhere in
Japan that's what they do.

00:20:33.802 --> 00:20:36.010
HIRO SONE: So that's a
tradition they did, basically.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.087
LISSA DOUMANI: I don't know
where you buy the rice.

00:20:42.087 --> 00:20:42.920
Maybe in Sacramento.

00:20:46.337 --> 00:20:47.920
HIRO SONE: So, one
of the dishes we're

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.530
going to prepare for you
today is tataki, which

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:58.190
is seared, almost
seared, sashimi plate.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.330
So beautiful.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:06.050
The inside is bright red and
it has a thin, white rim.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.600
And also, searing
the skin, and it

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:16.020
sits on a sauce called ponzu,
it absorbs ponzu really well.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.330
And it stays on this
dry area, cooked area.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.420
So that helps.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.100
Instead of the sauce
slipping off from tuna,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.186
it's going to stay on the skin.

00:21:31.186 --> 00:21:32.310
LISSA DOUMANI: It holds it.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.255
I get an answer margarita
today, for this.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:49.916
HIRO SONE: This is lemon,
just thinly sliced lemon.

00:21:49.916 --> 00:21:52.490
Going to put it on the
bottom of the bowl,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.062
and the three slices of tataki.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.290
And this is wasabi leaf.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.660
Everybody know wasabi?

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.940
It looks like this.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.710
Just like a horseradish,
a Japanese horseradish.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.250
It grows in a clean stream.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.560
So, Olivia picked it up
for us from Half Moon Bay,

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.584
it comes from Half Moon Bay.

00:22:19.584 --> 00:22:22.000
LISSA DOUMANI: That was the
one thing we got to teach her,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.610
because she really
knows everything.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.680
But she didn't know there
was wasabi in Half Moon Bay.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.490
HIRO SONE: We're going to
make a little julienne.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:36.380
So just roll the
wasabi leaf and cut.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:43.070
OLIVIA: So chef, how important
is it to have a sharp knife

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.340
to cut raw fish with at home?

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.330
HIRO SONE: Also, a sharp
knife really helps.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:53.080
Usually, if you have a dull
knife, you cut yourself too.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.070
Because you force it.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.210
If you have a sharp
knife it's easy

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.390
because, the weight
of the knife really

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.470
cuts everything,
instead of forcing.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.650
So, it really helps.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.720
And also, for
sashimi, you can see

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.180
how shiny the surface
of the sashimi.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.120
Maybe if have a
dull knife, you're

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.580
basically breaking
each cell of flesh.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.560
Almost sometimes
with a sharp knife,

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.960
you cut yourself and
you don't feel it.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.139
LISSA DOUMANI: Yes,
I can attest to that.

00:23:24.139 --> 00:23:25.930
HIRO SONE: Then ten
minutes later, oh shit.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.190
Excuse me.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:29.810
LISSA DOUMANI: No cussing.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.500
HIRO SONE: Please cut there.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.100
LISSA DOUMANI: You've got
to put a dollar in the bowl.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.440
HIRO SONE: Anyway, so
this is ponzu source.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.000
Also in our book.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.570
Basically, Japanese
soy citrus mix.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.280
LISSA DOUMANI: And, I'm assuming
that almost everyone knows

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:45.990
ponzu.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.211
But, ponzu is one of
the master sauces,

00:23:48.211 --> 00:23:49.960
you put it with a
little bit of olive oil,

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.070
you have the
greatest vinaigrette.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.200
You put it with
mayonnaise, and you'll

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.780
have the greatest other sauce.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.252
It just goes with everything.

00:23:57.252 --> 00:23:58.710
HIRO SONE: So I
put a little wasabi

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.340
on the top, wasabi
leaf on the top.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.790
So, this is one of the dishes
you're going to taste today.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:08.515
The next thing I'm going to
prepare, nigiri with the tuna.

00:24:08.515 --> 00:24:10.140
LISSA DOUMANI: Should
I steal your tuna

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.980
so it could get wrapped up?

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.230
You want to move over to here?

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.855
HIRO SONE: Yes.

00:24:13.855 --> 00:24:15.590
LISSA DOUMANI: I cleaned.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.136
Probably not well enough.

00:24:21.134 --> 00:24:22.050
You need all of those?

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.142
HIRO SONE: No.

00:24:23.142 --> 00:24:25.600
OLIVIA: So, you want to tell
us about the restaurant you're

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.117
going to open soon?

00:24:27.117 --> 00:24:27.950
LISSA DOUMANI: Soon.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:28.920
August 1st.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.060
I'm determined.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.310
I'm a very determined girl.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.310
We took over, I
think a lot of you

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.310
might know the old
original Slanted

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.140
Door on Valencia
between 16th and 17th.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.330
So we took that over.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.890
Charles is our
landlord and luckily

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:47.220
our friend, which is probably
a good bad thing, who knows.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.220
It's a great space.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.520
It's very narrow and long.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.440
And we're going to open
a modern bistro there,

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.670
and its name is
going to be Urchin.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.487
One, because I really can't
eat ever too much sea urchin.

00:25:01.487 --> 00:25:02.820
HIRO SONE: She loves sea urchin.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.000
LISSA DOUMANI: Yeah, it's
a little frightening.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.250
HIRO SONE: It's a funny story.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.550
After we got
married in Japan, we

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:11.809
went to visit Kyoto and we were
just walking around the hotel--

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:13.850
LISSA DOUMANI: We were
looking for cold medicine.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:14.970
HIRO SONE: That's right.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:19.220
And we found a
little fish market.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.590
And we went in there, they're
serving fish inside the market

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:24.090
too.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:29.165
So, we sit down and there's
an old, old gentleman.

00:25:29.165 --> 00:25:31.120
He's drinking sake.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.480
And something arrived
on the front of him.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.640
It was a whole tray
of uni, sea urchin.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.990
He was just eating
uni and drinking sake,

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.369
and eat uni and drinking sake.

00:25:42.369 --> 00:25:43.410
LISSA DOUMANI: Sumimasen.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.880
HIRO SONE: Lissa said,
can I have one of those.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.910
Yes, she finished
the whole tray too.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.826
LISSA DOUMANI: We just
did it again, actually.

00:25:51.826 --> 00:25:53.159
We went with some friends.

00:25:53.159 --> 00:25:55.450
We didn't take them, but we
kind of took them, to Japan

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:59.010
in November-- writers
and restaurateur friends.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.910
And we went to the fish
market their, Tsukiji.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.100
And you can buy stuff there.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.500
The people don't know that,
but they'll sell it to you.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.340
You don't have to
be a restaurant.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.920
They will growl at
you quite a bit,

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.586
and try and run you
down with the carts.

00:26:12.586 --> 00:26:13.610
That's another issue.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.340
But, I bought a whole
tray of uni again.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.840
And they always have some hashi,
some chopsticks, someplace.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.630
And so, we all sat
like in a little corner

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:24.645
eating our uni that had just
freshly come from Hokkaido.

00:26:24.645 --> 00:26:25.800
It was beautiful.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.740
HIRO SONE: So, I'm going to
show you how to make nigiri.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.944
First, we need to
grate the wasabi.

00:26:32.944 --> 00:26:34.360
LISSA DOUMANI:
Ooh, I can do that.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.526
HIRO SONE: Grater like this.

00:26:35.526 --> 00:26:40.139
So, circular movement like this.

00:26:40.139 --> 00:26:42.180
LISSA DOUMANI: And, you
can get fresh wasabi now.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.720
We'll see it in
Japanese markets.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.047
I don't see it in Western
markets, but in Asian markets

00:26:47.047 --> 00:26:47.630
you'll see it.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.310
It's a little pricey, but it
does keep for a little while.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.249
Yeah pretty much don't
have to do it now.

00:26:57.249 --> 00:26:57.708
HIRO SONE: What's that?

00:26:57.708 --> 00:26:59.544
LISSA DOUMANI: No, I
don't have to do it.

00:26:59.544 --> 00:27:01.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.500
HIRO SONE: And the next one
we need is a kind of water,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.980
because the rice is sticky.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:13.450
So, this prevents the rice
from sticking on your finger.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.421
Mix with water and vinegar.

00:27:16.421 --> 00:27:18.170
LISSA DOUMANI: Just a
tiny bit of vinegar.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.160
It's just so that
you're seasoned.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.110
HIRO SONE: And cutting fish.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:27.280
Basically, you like
to keep it-- the rice

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.960
ball is going to
be about this size.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.700
So, you want to drape over
so it's a little longer

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.310
than the rice ball.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:36.680
And the rice ball
will be this big.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.120
So, a little bit bigger
than the rice ball.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.391
So basically.

00:27:41.391 --> 00:27:43.140
LISSA DOUMANI: So, how
are you determining

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.970
which angle to cut at?

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.630
HIRO SONE: So,
that's another thing.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.900
If you cut this way, you
don't get enough length. , So,

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.420
depending on what
you've got here,

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.830
you need to change the
angle to get what you need.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:02.840
And this way changes
the width of the loin.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.590
LISSA DOUMANI: So, I
think you've probably

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.260
seen that in sushi bars.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.470
The chef will put down a
piece, especially of tuna,

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.150
but other fish.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.830
And he'll move it, turn it
over, go back and forth,

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.710
because he's looking for the
way he can get the size piece he

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.911
wants, and he's also
watching the grain

00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:18.160
that he's going to be cutting.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160
More important on these.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.710
HIRO SONE: And then, some chefs
make some really long fish.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.102
Some sushi bars make it tiny.

00:28:25.102 --> 00:28:27.060
LISSA DOUMANI: We don't
like to go to that one.

00:28:30.189 --> 00:28:31.730
But, on the other
hand, we don't like

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.635
the one that's an inch
over on either side, so

00:28:34.635 --> 00:28:35.510
something in between.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.990
Because this is a rule in
sushi, but I don't abide by it,

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:47.020
and have gotten
yelled at by Morimoto.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.430
I don't eat sushi in one bite.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.290
I don't care what you
do I'm not going to.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.300
I always want that second bite.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.300
But when they make
them really long,

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.925
it's hard because,
truthfully you're

00:28:55.925 --> 00:28:57.800
supposed to put it all
in your mouth at once.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.071
And the guys that make
these really long ones,

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:01.695
I don't really know
how you do that you

00:29:01.695 --> 00:29:03.440
look like a Chipmunk,
or something.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.430
Putting that much food,
little cheeks are bulging.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.030
But you are supposed
to eat it in one bite.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.590
HIRO SONE: Moisten your
hand with, we call it tezu.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.560
Te, means hand.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.960
Zu, tsu, is vinegar.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:27.190
And take sushi
rice, and I usually

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.690
get about 20 grams of rice.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.320
Which is like this size.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.170
So, in this hand you
make a ball already.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:42.520
In the same time, the sushi
chef takes a piece of fish

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.944
and uses this finger to get
some wasabi onto the fish.

00:29:46.944 --> 00:29:48.110
LISSA DOUMANI: That's a lot.

00:29:51.565 --> 00:29:53.190
HIRO SONE: That's a
lot of wasabi, yes.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.231
LISSA DOUMANI: Well, it
came with its own string.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.090
Because somebody
may eat that later.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:01.700
HIRO SONE: What's that?

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.740
LISSA DOUMANI: Somebody
may eat that later.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.730
We didn't want to
have the string.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.910
HIRO SONE: So, I'll make
a ball and put it on here.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:15.280
Then press with left hand thumb.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.400
And there's another
way to do it.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.840
Some chefs just
roll it this way.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:27.500
And some chefs take two
hands to put it back here.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.254
LISSA DOUMANI: Which is the
way that we describe it.

00:30:30.254 --> 00:30:31.420
HIRO SONE: There's two ways.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:36.030
Then you bend your finger
like this to make a cup,

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.280
and gently push.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.250
At the same time, this
thumb holds the other side.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:46.720
Push, and 180 degree
twist, and push again.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:53.595
And hold both sides gently,
and again, calm gently.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:00.770
Then nigiri.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:01.900
LISSA DOUMANI: Nice.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.858
HIRO SONE: Pretty good?

00:31:02.858 --> 00:31:03.910
LISSA DOUMANI: Yeah.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.660
See, it's important
to note he is not,

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.920
and I'm obviously
not, sushi chefs.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.032
That's not what we cook.

00:31:10.032 --> 00:31:11.990
And it was an important
part of doing the book,

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:16.460
because if you
really do this you're

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.590
going to write something
that's, you forget to add things

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.110
that people don't know.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.730
And so, this was really
intricately written.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.900
He'd describe something
and I'm saying

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.020
you can't say that because
it doesn't make sense.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.340
And so, we try to make it so
that it was understandable.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.330
HIRO SONE: Another way is
just make a ball in your hand,

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:36.970
and you put it on
the cutting board

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.410
and gently press down
to something like this.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.340
LISSA DOUMANI: It's not
as fussy as it seems.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.173
That's the best thing
you can learn from it.

00:31:45.173 --> 00:31:48.170
HIRO SONE: Then the same
idea with the wasabi,

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:54.770
and just drape over
in the form like this.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:58.120
This will be maybe
much, much easier.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.850
But at the sushi bar,
they don't do that.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.240
Doesn't look good,
the sushi chef

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.044
making everything like that.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.810
Some chefs move
their hand like this.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:15.220
It's not necessary, but it looks
like the fish is still alive.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.060
They do like this.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.520
Because, it's
almost like a show.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.330
LISSA DOUMANI: Hey,
let's do this one.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.040
HIRO SONE: In another way,
Lissa is going to show you,

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.456
is to put the fish
on the plastic.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.220
And put the wasabi here,
in the little bowl.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.400
LISSA DOUMANI: And
this has its own name.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.880
HIRO SONE: You can put shrimp.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.740
LISSA DOUMANI: No,
what's it called?

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.100
HIRO SONE: Oh, temari-zushi.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.502
It's almost like
making a rice ball.

00:32:43.502 --> 00:32:45.210
LISSA DOUMANI: You're
making beach balls.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.132
HIRO SONE: Let me get
the rice off of my hand.

00:32:51.132 --> 00:32:56.419
So, just gently fold
it and twist it.

00:32:56.419 --> 00:32:58.460
LISSA DOUMANI: So this
really couldn't be easier.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.690
HIRO SONE: Now, this is a
really easy way to do it,

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:02.279
and kind of cute.

00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:03.820
And you can make it
different colors,

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.800
and even put a little
caviar under there.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.300
And you can make it
ahead like this already,

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.560
and when everybody comes
just open up and plate it.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.440
It's very cute.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.273
LISSA DOUMANI: This we
don't talk about very

00:33:22.273 --> 00:33:24.830
much in the book, but
it is another style.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.580
OK, now you gotta roll baby.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.330
HIRO SONE: And,
I have a garnish.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:35.510
This is serrano chili,
marinated in soy sauce,

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.640
if you like it spicy.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.440
And this is the same
serrano chili but,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.250
using a torch to make
a charred flavor.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.634
LISSA DOUMANI: Or a broiler.

00:33:46.634 --> 00:33:47.800
HIRO SONE: That's also good.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.605
LISSA DOUMANI: And
a toaster oven.

00:33:48.605 --> 00:33:49.105
We

00:33:49.105 --> 00:33:51.060
HIRO SONE: And maybe
this needs this guy.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.140
And this is ginger.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.370
We call it gari, it's
pickled ginger, young ginger.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:02.740
It's a palate cleanser.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.742
So, between when you
eat different sushi.

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.325
LISSA DOUMANI: Yeah,
it's not a salad.

00:34:08.862 --> 00:34:12.570
It's a palate cleanser.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.370
We also have a whole thing
about sushi etiquette, which

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:16.935
there is etiquette to sushi.

00:34:16.935 --> 00:34:18.560
It doesn't mean you
have to live by it,

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.280
but I think it's nice
if everybody knows it.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.820
Which is, one, that's a palate
cleanser, it's not a salad.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.960
Another is that you dip
the sushi fish-side down

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.449
in the soy sauce,
not the other way.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:32.929
If the chef has seasoned it,
you don't need to do anything.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.380
And they'll usually tell you.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.130
I don't know that
we're always listening.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:37.671
Because sometimes
I even have to say,

00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:40.385
am I supposed to dip this one,
because I didn't pay attention.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:48.179
Then usually, the wasabi is
in there, how much you want.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:50.480
How much he wants, but
it's okay to add more.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.400
But you don't put
it in the soy sauce.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.290
HIRO SONE: So I'm
chopping, using

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:02.850
the back side of the knife
[CHOPPING] for hand roll.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:13.150
So, tuna like this, and
take some mayonnaise.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.859
Japanese people like mayonnaise.

00:35:14.859 --> 00:35:16.650
LISSA DOUMANI: They
like Kewpie Mayonnaise.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:19.170
HIRO SONE: They like it so much.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:23.200
Even they made their own brand
called Kewpie Mayonnaise.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.780
I've got tobiko in there, a
little bit of green onion,

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.100
sesame seeds, and
most important,

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.600
sriracha, if you like spicy.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.234
LISSA DOUMANI: At least he
gets to stay in California.

00:35:38.234 --> 00:35:39.400
HIRO SONE: And mix together.

00:35:55.507 --> 00:35:56.960
Like this.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.750
And they usually come in
this size, for the hand roll,

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:00.920
we need half.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.750
So Lissa is cutting.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:08.140
Just before you use nori, just
lightly toast on your burner.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.190
Turn if off, and just
go, this is the burner,

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:11.275
just go like this.

00:36:11.275 --> 00:36:13.184
Then it becomes much,
much more flavorful.

00:36:13.184 --> 00:36:14.850
And you can smell the
nori that way too.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.850
LISSA DOUMANI: It makes
it a little crisper too.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.980
You can also buy this,
it's kind of silly,

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.007
but you can buy it
this shape already.

00:36:22.007 --> 00:36:22.840
HIRO SONE: Oh, yeah?

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.673
LISSA DOUMANI: Yeah.

00:36:23.673 --> 00:36:25.400
HIRO SONE: Yeah, I guess.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.025
LISSA DOUMANI: He
doesn't grocery shop.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:34.180
HIRO SONE: So, this is a
little bigger, about this big.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.380
So put it in here.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:45.470
So you can use half the
nori space you have, spread.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:48.930
And make a little
dent in the middle,

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.500
for the place the fish is going.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.460
Oops.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.640
LISSA DOUMANI: Oops isn't good.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.940
HIRO SONE: So, here's the fish.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.300
Lissa, would you cut
me the daikon sprouts?

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.330
Was it here?

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:02.788
LISSA DOUMANI:
Yeah, I've got them.

00:37:04.209 --> 00:37:05.750
HIRO SONE: So, it
goes in the middle.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.510
So, you want to keep
everything, this

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:10.210
is going to be the
peak of the cone.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.590
So everything in this angle.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:13.650
So, we're going to roll.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.052
Just a little bit.

00:37:20.052 --> 00:37:26.241
So this we can put here.

00:37:26.241 --> 00:37:26.824
A little more.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:39.210
So start rolling from this end.

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:42.080
This is going to
meet in the middle,

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.000
like this, and keep rolling.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.225
Then you get the hand roll.

00:37:50.225 --> 00:37:51.600
LISSA DOUMANI:
So, a lot of times

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.058
when you're trying to do this
your mind plays tricks on you

00:37:54.058 --> 00:37:57.140
and you end up with,
actually, a roll this way.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.460
Because you just
kind of want to go

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.570
like that, instead of
keeping it in a v-shape.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:04.361
So, just be conscious
while you're rolling,

00:38:04.361 --> 00:38:06.800
because you just have to
pay attention, is all.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.420
It's not hard certainly.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.204
HIRO SONE: So, these
three dishes today.

00:38:13.204 --> 00:38:16.662
OLIVIA: Thank you so much.

00:38:16.662 --> 00:38:19.751
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:19.751 --> 00:38:20.501
OLIVIA: Thank you.

00:38:20.501 --> 00:38:21.910
It's delicious.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.260
And while our chefs are
preparing tastes for you,

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.220
are there questions
for Lissa and Hiro?

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.124
Yeah.

00:38:30.124 --> 00:38:31.582
AUDIENCE: Are there
knives that you

00:38:31.582 --> 00:38:34.610
would recommend
in terms of sushi?

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:38.550
OLIVIA: What knives
would you recommend?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.870
LISSA DOUMANI: There's a
huge price point difference.

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:43.760
And so, there are great Japanese
knives that are available here.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.060
I think that if you
want to buy something

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.620
that's reasonable
that's available.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.530
Mac is a good
company, Mac knives.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.800
Do you know which ones are,
she's asking about knives.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.570
And so, I know that I'll
use Mac quite a bit.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.360
It's a Japanese knife, and
they're a little heartier.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.540
HIRO SONE: I use a Japanese
knife called Masamoto.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.706
LISSA DOUMANI: Yes, which
you can't really get here.

00:39:05.706 --> 00:39:07.710
HIRO SONE: No, you can get it.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.150
LISSA DOUMANI: Soko Hardware.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.300
Thank gosh.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.050
So, I don't know that
they have that one.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.400
But the problem with
true Japanese knives

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.190
is the care of them,
and so, you have

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.790
to be ready to care
for them that way.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.456
They need a different
way of sharpening.

00:39:22.456 --> 00:39:24.490
HIRO SONE: As you
see, I cut the lemon,

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.130
and it started changing color.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:29.820
Because this is
steel, not stainless.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.400
This is stainless, looks
like a Japanese knife

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.589
but made with stainless.

00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:36.130
LISSA DOUMANI: And
who made that one?

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.904
HIRO SONE: This
one is Shun knife.

00:39:38.904 --> 00:39:39.820
I didn't buy this one.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:44.782
They gave it to me so, I
don't know how much it was.

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:46.240
LISSA DOUMANI:
You're just spoiled.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.989
OLIVIA: There are a
couple of other stores

00:39:47.989 --> 00:39:50.750
with Japanese knives
maybe not to your level.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.590
There's the Perfect
Edge in San Mateo.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:59.727
And Japan Woodworker is an
online store in Alameda.

00:39:59.727 --> 00:40:01.310
LISSA DOUMANI: There's
a couple knives

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:02.750
that you really
want to have too.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.800
You want something that's strong
enough to, like he was using,

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.900
that's a little heavier
and strong enough to cut.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:12.425
Depending on the fish, you want
a really good slicing knife.

00:40:12.425 --> 00:40:13.527
Either one of these.

00:40:13.527 --> 00:40:15.610
HIRO SONE: The basic
difference in a Western knife

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.340
and Japanese knife
is, you can see it.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:24.992
One side is flat, one side
is angled and goes this way.

00:40:24.992 --> 00:40:26.700
LISSA DOUMANI: They're
sharp on one side.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.370
HIRO SONE: Western style is
both coming together like this.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:33.460
It's easier to use it,
you have more control.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.300
This one, you have
to get used it,

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.655
because if you use
a Western knife

00:40:37.655 --> 00:40:43.175
it usually goes-- Because
of the angle of the blade.

00:40:43.175 --> 00:40:44.300
So, you have to be careful.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.760
You have to practice
a little bit.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:52.150
Almost straight cutting, but you
have a feeling over your hand.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.794
The force is this way,
eventually goes straight.

00:40:55.794 --> 00:40:57.210
So, that part is
really different.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.350
And sashimi, the
very important part

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:04.890
is that this angle makes
the fish not stick.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:06.680
Because the angle is different.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.650
So, that's a good
part of this knife.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.820
As you see, one side
is flat, one side--

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:15.620
So left hand and
right hand knife.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.682
This one, it's always the same.

00:41:17.682 --> 00:41:19.140
LISSA DOUMANI:
Sharp on both sides.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.514
HIRO SONE: This one, you need
to buy one for left-hander,

00:41:21.514 --> 00:41:24.190
one for the right-hander.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.770
OLIVIA: Any other questions?

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:26.760
Yeah.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.207
LISSA DOUMANI: How much
was the side of tuna?

00:41:29.207 --> 00:41:30.290
OLIVIA: How much was that?

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:31.492
10 pound?

00:41:31.492 --> 00:41:32.820
Price.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:37.190
HIRO SONE: Usually like $16
a pound at the restaurant,

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.200
we pay.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.560
$16 to anywhere about $45.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.130
LISSA DOUMANI: Some
sushi bars, of course,

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.130
they buy whole fish quite often.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.290
And really good ones
buy the fish and age it,

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:55.580
because there's a misnomer about
fresh fish being the best fish.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.160
Quite often, most
fish needs to be

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.930
aged a little bit
before you eat it.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.759
And they'll have tuna
vaults, the place

00:42:03.759 --> 00:42:06.300
that they keep them, they know
what day they were brought in,

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.610
they rotate, and
move them around.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.640
There are few places that do
that in the city, not a lot.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.871
Or they have a fish
purveyor do it for them.

00:42:15.871 --> 00:42:17.620
And then there's
different pricing depends

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:20.750
on the quality of the fish,
the fatiness in the fish.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.720
Watch something about
the fish market in Tokyo.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.745
It's just amazing
watching them do this.

00:42:24.745 --> 00:42:26.870
I've done this and I don't
know what they're doing.

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:29.570
We went to the one, both
in Japan and Hawaii,

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:31.780
and they take something
and they're doing this.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.440
And I'm like,
yeah, that's yucky.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.400
But, they know.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.120
HIRO SONE: Yeah, sometimes
the fish is too fresh

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.720
and the meat is, how
do you call that?

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.680
After it dies?

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.450
Rig--

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.030
LISSA DOUMANI: Rigor mortis.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.120
OLIVIA: Rigor mortis.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.345
HIRO SONE: So, the
meat is so tight.

00:42:48.345 --> 00:42:49.220
LISSA DOUMANI: Tense.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.803
HIRO SONE: And you slice it and
even when you put it in mouth,

00:42:51.803 --> 00:42:53.050
it's still kind of hard.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:56.920
So you need to wait a
period to make good sashimi.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.190
Also, protein breaks
down to amino acid.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:02.260
Gives you more umami too.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.680
OLIVIA: Any other questions?

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.652
Yes.

00:43:04.652 --> 00:43:07.082
AUDIENCE: Where
in the South Bay,

00:43:07.082 --> 00:43:10.010
can you get all this fresh fish?

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.970
OLIVIA: Where in the South
Bay to get fresh fish?

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:13.580
Yes.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.705
LISSA DOUMANI: There's a
couple of Japanese markets

00:43:15.705 --> 00:43:16.420
in San Jose.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.253
HIRO SONE: If you go
to the Japanese market,

00:43:18.253 --> 00:43:24.090
you already find the tuna made
into saku, like this already.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.550
Couple of different fish,
hamachi, or something.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.180
You can buy it
looking like this.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.860
LISSA DOUMANI: Yeah,
already block cut.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:35.150
We should have done our
research and looked that up,

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:38.010
but we do know that Nijiya
has a market down there.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:38.690
I know that.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.981
I think they have a market
somewhere near Mountain View

00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:42.252
too.

00:43:42.252 --> 00:43:43.710
OLIVIA: There's a
lot in San Mateo.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:47.235
LISSA DOUMANI: So, it's
just, it's not our hood.

00:43:47.235 --> 00:43:48.580
OLIVIA: Not their hood.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.099
LISSA DOUMANI: We've
got Napa and parts

00:43:51.099 --> 00:43:52.890
of San Francisco and
maybe Little East Bay,

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.510
but that's about it.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:58.520
But, because we know where
they're available to us,

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.960
even in Napa, there's
a couple places

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.435
you could buy good
fish for this.

00:44:02.435 --> 00:44:04.310
I'm sure you guys have
a lot, because there's

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:07.610
a larger community for it.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.060
HIRO SONE: And also,
our book features

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:14.710
a lot of different
vegetables, vegetarian sushi.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:18.900
I think that's a
new thing to me.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.060
Fish regulations are harder
and harder every year,

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:26.792
so even back there, you
have vegetables, make sushi.

00:44:26.792 --> 00:44:28.100
OLIVIA: Yeah, very nice.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:38.462
LISSA DOUMANI: So, this
one here, tuna, red pepper,

00:44:38.462 --> 00:44:40.920
cool, huh?

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.930
OLIVIA: It's beautiful.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:43.638
LISSA DOUMANI: The
other one is eggplant.

00:44:43.638 --> 00:44:46.460
Looks a little bit like anago.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:50.190
So, one looks like eel
and one looks like tuna.

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.150
We're not trying to
say it's not something

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:55.680
