00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.370
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.380
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.300
My name is Claudio.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.730
I'm an engineer on
the Google Drive

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.050
Developer Relations team.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.210
And this is Gus from
the Google+

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.290
Developer Relations team.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.102
Hi Gus.

00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:31.510
GUS CLASS: Hey, Claudio.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.390
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.770
And it's exciting to be hearing
all about the new

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440
Google+ and Drive integration.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.040
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Yeah, exactly.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.650
So today, we're going to talk
about a new feature we just

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.010
launched that integrates my
world, Google Drive, with

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.530
Gus's world, which is Google+.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.780
So you might have noticed, and
you might have read the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.000
announcement, that now when
you share a document on

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.980
Google+, what you see is a nicer
interactive widget that

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.310
shows more about the
document itself.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.670
Let me show you what it is like
so it's going to be easy

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.710
to talk about it when we
all know about this.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.980
So let's go to my screen.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.010
What I have in front of me is a
presentation that I created

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.170
on Google Drive on my account.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.790
It's actually a presentation
that I used to talk about

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.670
Google Drive at GDG DevFest.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.960
Maybe some of you were there.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.030
If I want to share this
presentation on Google+, I can

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.120
now simply copy the URL, go to
my Google+ page, so go to the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.480
stream, and share something.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.850
I can put the link as
I will put any other

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.060
types of link here.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.560
So I put the link there.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.470
What is going to happen is that
Google+ will check what's

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.310
at that page, what's behind
that link, and when that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.570
loads, we're going to see
that it gets some

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.730
information about the page.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.350
We're going to see
how that works.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.900
And that information is actually
shown in a nice

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.760
graphical way.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.789
So let me share this, and
then we'll talk a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.080
bit more about it.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.865
So my new presentation-- and
you can write whatever you

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:14.820
want here, of course.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.610
This is a message that goes
together with the document.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.600
And, well, let me share it to
an empty circle I have, just

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.780
not to fill my stream with
useless content.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.750
And then share it.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.750
Now you can see this
new presentation

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.100
is here in my stream.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.630
It has a nice play button.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.395
Remember, this is
a presentation.

00:02:37.395 --> 00:02:38.390
This is not a video.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.730
So what happens when I click
Play is that the presentation

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.940
itself gets loaded.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.680
And now, without leaving
the stream, I can

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.670
check all the slides.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.660
So I can go back and forth.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.930
I can see all of them.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.080
I can go full screen.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.360
I can jump to any slides,
and so on.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.165
And if I need to, I can just
click to the Google Docs link

00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:00.640
and go back to the Google Docs
page, where I can see this

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.250
presentation and maybe edit it,
and edit it as any other

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.770
presentation I have.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.900
So this is super easy.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.050
This is super smooth
for users.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.070
This is available to everyone.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.300
And what we're going to talk
about today is how this works.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.320
I think the best way to start
talking about it-- and

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.760
remember, we're all
developers.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.680
So we're going to look at the
source of the HTML page that's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.920
generated by this document.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.890
So let me go back to
the presentation.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.870
If I check the source
for this document by

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.790
viewing page source--

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.610
nothing special.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.230
This is something that
anyone can do.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.020
There's obviously
a lot of code.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.690
But if I search for some
specific keywords that

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.970
[INAUDIBLE], and now Gus is
going to talk about them.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.290
For instance, I'm going to
search for itemscope.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.550
Itemscope is a key word in the
schema.org world that we are

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.080
now going to explain.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.220
And what we see here is that
there is a number of

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.650
properties that we've marked
that are available in this

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.450
document that say that this is
our presentation object, which

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.300
is a type we defined to
represent the presentation.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.330
It has a title.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.370
It has an icon.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.450
It has a URL.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.300
And it has an embeddable URL.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.360
How does this work?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.630
GUS CLASS: So if you actually
look at the schema.org content

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.370
that's marked up across this
page, what happens is when

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.140
Google tries to calculate the
way that the activity will

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.680
look when it renders inside the
Google+ stream, it tries

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.360
to retrieve these properties
from the page first.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.370
And then it uses those as
signals, as hints to the way

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.970
that it should present
the content.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.650
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So
we've mentioned

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.780
schema.org many times.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.470
What's schema.org?

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.470
GUS CLASS: Schema.org is just
a way of annotating various

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.580
things on the internet and
giving all the structured data

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.420
on the web kind of that
presentation in a way that it

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.970
can be consumed easily through
search engines and through

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.760
other sites consuming
that content.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.050
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So this
is independent of Google.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.245
It's not a Google-specific
technology.

00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:12.090
It's not a Google-specific
standard or any kind of thing

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.890
that is just us.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.150
GUS CLASS: Yeah.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.530
It's not just Google.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.050
There's a lot of other people
out there on the web

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.900
that are doing it.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.850
And Google likes this format
because it's a very versatile

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.760
format for describing
things on the web.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.140
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And so with
this schema.org metadata, we

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.260
can mark up some specific
properties in the HTML.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.010
And these properties are not
specifically related to the

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.170
Google structure.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.870
So we're saying that that file,
that page represents a

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.890
presentation.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.030
Anyone else can do that.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.420
So we're not saying that is a
Google Docs presentation.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.650
We're saying that that is
a presentation, and that

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.770
presentation has a specific
title, and that presentation

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.670
has a specific embedded
URL, and so on.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.450
And then what happens is that
Google+ reads the HTML of the

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.550
page, finds those metadata,
realizes that that is a

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.180
presentation.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.700
And so it has a specific way to
represent those data, so to

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.450
render that data.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.670
I've shown you how you can
check these items.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.820
And the easy way is to
view the source.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.350
So as we did before, you can
just check the source of the

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.250
page and see there
are some data.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.470
Obviously, there are some other
tools that can make your

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.500
life easier.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.430
There is one which is part of
the Google Webmaster Tools.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.680
So that is at google.com/webma
sters/tools/richsnippets.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.560
And with this tool, you can
extract the schema.org

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.400
metadata for any given page.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.600
Let's try again.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.710
Let's see what happens if I open
this tool and put the URL

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.580
of my document.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.160
I can do preview.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.910
This tool is going to fetch
the page, extract all the

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.150
metadata that are there,
and show them to us.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.310
So we have a preview here that
shows some of those pieces.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.580
But we also have what we now
care most about-- is the

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.740
extracted structure data.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.440
What it says here is that--

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.560
well, what we already saw.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.880
This is a presentation object.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.170
It has a specific name.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.830
It has an icon.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.460
It has a URL.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.470
And it has an embed URL.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.200
So with this tool, it's much
easier for you to understand

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.530
what Google+ will find
about your page.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.180
Something that is interesting
here is that this is not

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.680
specific to Google+.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.000
So we encourage people to use
schema.org metadata, not only

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.150
because if your type is
supported, it will be shown on

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.720
Google+, but also because
we use those

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.090
information in search.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:56.680
So whenever you search for
something on google.com, we

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.960
crawl all the pages, we index
them, and we store the

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.995
metadata for them.

00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:04.270
So if, for instance, it is
hard for us to generate a

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.560
snippet, a text snippet that
summarizes your page, the

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.620
schema.org metadata in that page
will help us produce a

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.200
better snippet, and so on.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.690
And we have other kind
of information

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.600
there that we can use.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.400
GUS CLASS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.200
And putting that schema.org
microdata content is a great

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.590
best practice because it makes
all the information on your

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.950
web page discoverable to more
people than just Google.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.100
I mean, if anyone's programming
against kind of

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.309
parsing that data on the page,
that schema.org microdata is

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:37.450
just extremely useful in
understanding semantically

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.700
what the content means.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.380
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Let's
talk a bit about

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.360
security and privacy?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.610
GUS CLASS: Oh, yeah,
absolutely.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.810
This is kind of the first
question that I had when you

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.840
showed me this today.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.160
If I share something on Drive,
or share something on Google+

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.850
that is on Drive, and the
content that I'm sharing on

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.320
Drive, say it's a presentation
that's only accessible to me,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.240
what would be the experience
that the user would have when

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.990
they click on that share link?

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.060
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So the
basic rule here is that

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.310
sharing a document on Google+
will not expand the

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.660
permissions on that document.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.540
So if I share a document with
you on Google+, and you have

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.170
access to it, you will
be able to open it.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.430
If I share a document with you,
but a document is not

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.920
shared with you on Drive, you
will not be able to open it.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.710
Now why do we do that?

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.140
Well, the main [? use case, ?]
the main thing we want to

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.380
prevent is this.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.610
I share a private document
to a friend of mine.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.570
And that friend has
access to it.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.800
Fine.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.430
But then my friend re-shares
the post I shared with him

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.080
with someone else.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.170
I don't want that someone
else to be

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.330
able to read my document.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.060
So by not expanding the
[INAUDIBLE] or permissions, we

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.330
are preventing third parties
from sharing

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.690
your sensitive documents.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.710
So we really care about your
privacy on your documents.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:10.150
So we don't want that for some
reasons, any reasons, by

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:15.600
mistake or by malicious users,
your documents will be

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.310
readable or editable
by third parties.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.220
If the document we shared with
you on Google+ is not

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.690
accessible to you, what you
would see is the usual request

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.130
access page.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:34.550
So you will see that a document
is shared with you on

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.460
Google+, but you will not be
able to see any content.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.060
So if you want to be able to
access it, you will have to

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.380
request permission to
the original owner.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.800
And of course, if the original
owner grants you access, then

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.735
you will be able to
read the document.

00:10:47.735 --> 00:10:49.850
GUS CLASS: So you're kind of
highlighting something that's

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:50.970
real clear here.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.710
And it's that basically, what
you're doing is you're

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.070
sharing that link.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.230
And it's almost no different
as though you were sharing

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.060
that link on something
other than Google+.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.730
It's like you're sharing
it in email.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.640
But Google is rendering and
presenting that content based

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.060
on the schema.org microdata.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.220
And then it kind of just behaves
in a way that the user

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.720
would expect it to as though
it were working

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.980
directly from Drive.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.840
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.580
That's absolutely correct.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.220
Whenever we share a document
on Google+,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.170
we're sharing a link.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.620
That's exactly a link like any
other link, so just a link to

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.500
something that we know--

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.600
eventually, we know that that
something is a document.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.240
And then we know we have a
better way to present a

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.170
document to you.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.220
But the content that is
there is just not

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.120
known in the beginning.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.840
So we share link, it
can be a video.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.330
Then if you can see
the video, fine.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.550
If your link is behind, I don't
know, a firewall, you

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.720
will not be able to see it.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.410
Same here.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.330
If a link is to a document that
is not available to you,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.410
then you will not be
able to read it.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.090
GUS CLASS: Cool.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.870
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Perfect.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.560
OK, I think there's just one
extra step to discuss.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.550
And that is, how does this
work with the API?

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.660
GUS CLASS: And so
that's actually

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.170
a really good question.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.250
Because there's kind
of two parts to it.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.730
There's the part where there's
the Drive API, and then

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.370
there's the Google+ API.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.220
And so I did a little
investigation this morning,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.110
sharing something publicly,
which was

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.460
in everyone's stream.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.370
But what you can do is you can
still read the activity that

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.470
gets created on the stream.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.320
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: We
can show you that.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:35.250
So use the APIs Explorer to get
the information about a

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.190
specific activity, given
the activity ID.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.840
And that specific activity
had a document shared.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.100
And so this is a request.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.420
If you know the Google+ API,
this is very easy to

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:46.910
understand.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.910
We just do a get to
the specific end

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.240
point for the activity.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.130
And we get some metadata here.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.560
But what?

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.220
We don't see a reference
to the document itself.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.510
So do you want to just explain
a bit what we see here?

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:04.930
GUS CLASS: Sure.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.180
So some of the things that
you're seeing currently is the

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.410
format of these activities is
that there's the activity

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.280
itself, an actor associated with
the activity, and then

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.620
attachments that are appended
onto the end of that activity.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.520
And so the attachment of
interest is going to be the

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.330
actual share that happened
from that Drive post.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:33.310
And so if you look into the
object array that's specified

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:38.640
in the JSON at the end of this
content here, the first one

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.700
will actually be something that

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.650
represents the post itself.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.430
And currently, we're sending
back a self link so that if

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.480
you were using this inside of
a third party integration,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.850
where you're reading this
activity content, you could

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.410
link back to the post
really easily.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:01.060
What is interesting to me is
actually getting back to that

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.590
base URL from Drive.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.020
Because then once you can
do that, you can start

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.030
incorporating the Drive API to
get the one true metadata from

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.140
the actual object
itself in Drive.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.430
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: That's an
important point to highlight.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.050
So this integration
is totally new.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.390
So we are still working on
it and we appreciate your

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.420
feedback on it.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.560
And at the moment, the Google+
API doesn't expose any

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.520
information about the
shared document.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.910
But we think it might be
worth considering this

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:33.780
addition to the API.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.740
So we will bring this
up and see if we can

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.540
add it to the API.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.650
But assuming we get a reference
to the document in

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.560
the API, what we would expect
is to only get an ID or a

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.810
reference to the document,
but nothing else.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.830
Well, maybe the title or the
rest of the metadata that are

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.100
in the snippet.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.440
But that's it.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.550
Then we would expect developers
to use that ID

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.030
together with the Drive API to
perform activities, to perform

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.150
actions on the document
itself.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.890
So if we add information about
a document to the Plus API,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.560
that information should only
be used together with the

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.790
Drive API to perform

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.270
manipulation of the file content.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.730
So don't expect, let's say,
the content of the

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.690
presentation to be available
in the Plus API.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.970
There will be an overlap between
the Google+ API, the

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.490
Google Doc, and Google
Drive API.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.100
And also remember that the
Google+ API asks for some

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.350
specific permissions
that do not include

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.630
reading your document.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.160
So if an application can only
read your Google+ API, it

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.450
should not be allowed to
read your document.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.630
If you want to do both, you will
have to request for both

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.650
permissions, and the
user will have to

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.960
specifically approve both.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.590
Which makes sense.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.900
And it guarantees security and
privacy for your data.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:01.430
GUS CLASS: So yeah, like you
were saying, really having the

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.230
document within Drive and then
making changes to that

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.200
document also would then be
reflected in the content

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.450
that's referenced.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.800
We want people to make all
of their reads from Drive

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.340
documents as opposed
to directly

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.480
through the Google+ API.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.560
You avoid duplication of data.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.020
And also, you kind of have
that definitive privacy

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.200
control that happens
at the Drive side.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.450
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So we're
going to investigate this, and

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.620
we're going to investigate
how to add these

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.870
features to the API.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.340
And we might talk about this
in a future Google

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.260
Developers Lab event.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.350
GUS CLASS: Yes, absolutely.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.650
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.940
So stay tuned for this.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.560
We're going to announce
it on Google+.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.710
Before we wrap up, I just wanted
to mention that we

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.180
showed a presentation.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.510
But this integration works with
all types of documents on

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.430
Google Drive.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.020
So you can share a text
document, you can share a

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.520
spreadsheet, you can share a
presentation, and so on.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.570
So obviously, they will have
different renderings.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.650
So a presentation
looks like this.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:03.560
You can browse the slide.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.470
With a spreadsheet, it obviously
looks different.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.010
And each of them has
a specific UI.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.000
And the last thing I want to
mention is that we added this

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.380
new feature for Google
properties right now.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.849
So you can share Google
Docs into Google+.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:23.430
But as we said, all it takes
for us to understand what a

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.980
document is, is to add some
generic metadata coming from

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.060
schema.org.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:34.720
And no one prevents other
products to do the same.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.590
So for instance, many of you
will know SlideShare.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.560
SlideShare is a very popular
service for hosting slides.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.790
Nothing prevents them from
adding those metadata.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:51.790
And we do not render that yet,
but we are definitely thinking

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.990
about doing it for
other properties.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.790
So we need to balance between
avoiding spam

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.520
and things like that.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.140
We don't want anyone to add
random data there, and we then

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.960
have to be forced to capture
those data or do something to

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.280
prevent abuse.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.810
But for instance, for important
third parties like

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:17.410
SlideShare or others, we can
think about extending this new

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.620
feature to support all
presentations out there, all

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.760
documents out there,
and so on.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.140
GUS CLASS: Yep.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.910
Yeah, you highlighted
a really good point.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:30.340
With schema.org, when you have
your page marked up well,

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:36.360
Google can do a lot more with
that content when they have

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.930
those hints from within
your document as

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.870
to what is in there.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.780
And so Google always tries
to calculate the

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.240
right thing to render.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.275
And over time, these
things change.

00:18:46.275 --> 00:18:47.560
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.560
OK, I think that with that,
that's it for today for Google

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.830
Developers Live.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.760
I hope to see you soon.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.770
The Google Drive team goes
live again on Thursdays.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.050
And we might see
you again here.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.420
I might be joining you on the
Google+ events, right?

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:05.970
GUS CLASS: Absolutely.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.960
Yeah maybe we'll have you over
on the Google+ GDL here soon.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.010
It was a pleasure being here.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.330
And it's exciting to hear about
all the integrations

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.490
that are happening
with Google+.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.010
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.670
Thank you very much.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:17.970
GUS CLASS: Thanks.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.220
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: See you.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:51.033
