1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,543
[inaudible]

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,170
hey you people,

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm Tim asked me to make a
quick video of our home gym.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,260
Now there's a couple things about
the home gym that's crucial.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,170
If you are a busy working person,
this is driving me crazy.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,070
If you're a busy working person,
you absolutely have to have a home gym.

7
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,950
At the very least a
Kettlebell and a jump rope.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,530
You got to be able to train on your own.
And if you own a Shim,

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,970
you definitely have to
have a gym on those.

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,550
You're never going to train ever again.
So this is our home gym J.

11
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,890
Stars on the camera up my number
one trading partner of all time.

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,280
You'll see that there's a lot of bikes
in here. Um, we have a walk bike,

13
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,800
which we love lots of kettlebells.
Um,

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,740
we believe in the aerobic base.

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,330
This is probably largely in part to
a Brian Mckinsey's influence, um,

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,950
from an urge to an assault bike to the,
uh, to the concept to stand up skier,

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,480
um,
our bikes up there.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,950
Then we have a few kind of miscellaneous
mobilization pieces in here and then

19
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:58,980
skateboards and bikes. Anyway, but this
is where some of the other work happens.

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,530
Call the things that are on our house.
Um,

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,990
Juliette has all of her girlfriends
come over a couple times a week.

22
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:06,630
How many times we j three times a week,
four times a week, four times a week.

23
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,780
They train here. We have the
Cherryland to barbell club for men.

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,750
So I bring all the boys over.
We squat heavy.

25
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,540
Then we had this thing called kids squat
club and a once a week we're being all

26
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,330
the kids over. And this is
predicated on an idea that, uh,

27
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,490
that our friend Matt Vincent put
out, they said, hey, you know,

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,120
someone's in interviewing him, they
were like, how do you get strong?

29
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:25,320
And he's like, well, just squat
heavy once a week for 10 years.

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,750
Tell me what happened. So we started
out with them once. Your kids,

31
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:31,350
so we do a little squatting. Um,
so we have the rogue rig here,

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,580
which is nice tire flipping
my current favorite things.

33
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,820
Donny Thompson's fat
bells. This is my, uh,

34
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,500
it's really made a difference on my wrist.

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,950
It's a kettle bell with a handle on the
inside and you see over in the corner

36
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,520
the Onnit Mace, hey, tell
my feeling not athletic.

37
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,400
I swing this bad boy. I love it. I think
it's aesthetic and beautiful and uh, and,

38
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,330
and make goes sir forwards.

39
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,220
You can see all the other kit and then
come this way because the home gym up

40
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,550
slackline notice Lachlan got to have
it up all the time. And then um,

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,250
we decided that when we were finishing
out the house, come on back real quick.

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,310
We made some tweaks to our pool design so,

43
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,750
and this was directly influenced
from Laird Hamilton, uh,

44
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,480
all his work in the water,
which you know,

45
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,200
based on some interesting stuff
he was doing. And then Wim Hoff

46
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,680
course,
another Brian Mackenzie and performance.

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,010
But we went ahead and we
made our pool 11 feet deep.

48
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:38,400
So it's 11 feet, it's drop off,
celebrate kid friendly pool.

49
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,550
It drops straight down to box.
And then,

50
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,740
so we do a lot of interesting work around,
come on this way,

51
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:47,760
Jay would do a lot of interesting
work around carrying the heavy ball.

52
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,140
We have a hundred pound ball
there. We've got dumbbells. Um,

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,110
you can see all this stuff on XPT life.
That's a double layered. His finally,

54
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,410
you know, his, his vision, bringing
in with Brian and whim. But, uh,

55
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,240
this piece of it is a huge piece.

56
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,090
So it's just about downregulation
we're in the hot tub.

57
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,360
How many times a day you think,
Jay?

58
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,180
Probably two times a day at least
in the summer. Maybe more. But uh,

59
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,240
and then around the corner
here you can see where, uh,

60
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,980
we do normally have our boat
storage for outriggers, but, uh,

61
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:21,310
we have our little um, ice tank
there. That's our ice bucket.

62
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,360
Dumbbells for the pool, uh, a bin full of
a million, a million snorkels and masks.

63
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:29,320
And by the way,
this is our home setup and I think ideas,

64
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,360
you forget that we also have massive,

65
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,780
massive outdoors and we have never lost
track of the fact that you should be

66
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,920
training to get outside. Anyway, this
is the, uh, start at home health center,

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,953
Jay store on the film.
