00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.129
- [Voiceover] I want to talk about how to
avoid

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.270
some common mistakes when you're writing

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.960
a historical paper.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.960
This could apply to a term
paper, to a blue book essay,

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.839
even really to your Master's thesis if you
wanted to.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.619
I want to talk about three phrases

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.609
that you might be tempted
to use in a historical essay

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.570
that actually muddy what you're trying to
say

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.039
and undercut your point
more than it helps.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.490
So, these three phrases that
I want to talk about are:

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.950
"Throughout history,"

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.349
"It was inevitable,"

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:57.390
and "And that's why

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.270
[insert country here]

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.430
is so great today."

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.880
So, why are these phrases so problematic?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.290
Let's start with "Throughout history."

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.090
So, this is something that you frequently
see in writing,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.040
from historical essays
to pieces of journalism

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.970
and it often has the ring
of making something seem

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.970
really strong and adding the
weight of eons of history

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.170
behind a single sentence.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.150
History is a very long thing.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.680
I mean, for recorded
history we're going back

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.360
maybe five thousand, seven thousand years.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420
And think about the
many different cultures

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.670
and types of people and ideas that existed

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.340
throughout that time period.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.540
If you're sitting down to write
an essay about, let's say,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.649
The Cold War, and you
start: "Throughout history

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.388
people have feared nuclear attack,"

00:02:11.388 --> 00:02:13.950
well, the first thing your reader is going
to think is:

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.779
"Wait! The nuclear bomb
was only developed in 1945.

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.890
I mean, that's not throughout history,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.280
that's only throughout
the last seventy years."

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.609
Or what about: "Throughout
history people have gone

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.750
to war over religion."

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.359
Your reader might think:
"Well, what about when people

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.239
didn't live close enough to each other to
go to war

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.040
about different beliefs?"

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.879
And do we really want to send the message

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.180
that having different religions mean that
you necessarily

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.599
have to go to war?

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.510
One thing that "Throughout
history" does is

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.569
it makes an assumption
about human nature, right?,

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.569
that the way that people think now is the
way that people

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.269
have always thought throughout history,

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.670
or the way that people behave
now is the way that people

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.510
have always behaved throughout history.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.749
And if there's anything that is one of the
core beliefs

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.040
of the study of history is that people are
different

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.239
over time.

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.340
It's fun to study the past because people
in the past

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.829
weren't like us.

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.319
They had different
ideas, different beliefs,

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.349
different cultural values.

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.380
And so, if you want to be really strong

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.900
about how you start a historical essay,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.019
always start it in a really specific part

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.180
of time that you're talking about.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.180
So, if you're talking about
the period from 1945 to 1965,

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.709
say "In the post-war era"

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.509
or "In the late 19th century."

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.839
And you might also add
"In the United States."

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:02.829
Right?

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.680
This shows that you have a
strong grasp of both the time

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.010
and the place that you're writing about.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.819
And so, you can make an
argument that is specific

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.389
to that time period.

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.220
Okay, let's move on to
"It was inevitable."

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.070
I think we like to use the word inevitable
because it's long

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.190
and it sounds pretty cool.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.160
But think about what
inevitable really means.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.980
It means "It was unavoidable,"
there was no other thing

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.570
that could have happened.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.920
Now think of a version of
history where everything

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.250
is inevitable.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.530
Everything was just
going to happen no matter

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.340
whether anyone did anything or not.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.820
That shows an interpretation
of history that says

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.420
that people's choices don't matter.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.440
And if you want to emphasize
anything in history,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.900
it's how much choices matter.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.920
There are very few things that
are inevitable in history.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.420
Most of them, I would say,
are natural disasters, right?

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.200
There is going to eventually
be an earthquake in California

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.180
is inevitable because
there's a fault line.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.540
That's something that
humans can't control,

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.140
But for almost everything else in history,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.130
humans can control it.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.310
And they do decide how to
react to certain situations.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.130
For example, take the
sinking of the USS Maine

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.300
in Havana Harbor, right?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.840
This is the event that leads to the United
States going

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.150
to war with Spain over Cuba in 1898.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.920
And the reason that this happened was

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.230
because the USS Maine
exploded in Havana Harbor.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.120
Now, we know and the Spanish
suggested at the time

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.700
that the reason that the
USS Maine exploded was due

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.560
to a spontaneous combustion on-board.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.490
There was an equipment malfunction.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.550
The United States chose to
believe that this ship sinking

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.110
was the result of a Spanish
bomb and declared war.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.240
Now, you might have said:
"War was inevitable."

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.590
But it really wasn't.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.210
There were many ways
that the United States

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.010
could have chosen differently
in that moment, to say:

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.230
"Maybe we will believe the
Spanish and just leave it alone"

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.860
or "Maybe we'll send some
financial aid to Cuba

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.020
but we don't have to go to war."

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.140
When you get rid of inevitability
in history, you open up

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.800
new choices, new ways that
things could have gone.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.010
And that is really the heart of
history, it's the possibility for

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.240
things to be different than they were

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.360
and different than they are.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.500
Okay, let's finish up with "And that's why

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.700
[insert country here] is so great today."

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.680
You see this all the time
in historical papers.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.960
And I think writers are
very tempted to finish

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.660
a historical essay with some
expression of patriotism.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.910
And maybe in a few rare
cases this is true.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.620
You could say: "The United
States is a better place today

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.620
than it was in the 1950s
thanks to the Civil Rights Act

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.420
of 1964."

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.110
But it's something you
want to use very sparingly,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.640
because usually the scope of a historical
paper - and think

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.640
about our "Throughout
history" here - isn't so huge

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.270
as to merit the reaction to it being

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.500
"This is the heart of what
makes America great today."

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.400
I've read historical papers
about the Spanish Flu in 1919

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.390
that end with "And that's
why America is great today."

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.070
Ask yourself: is this relevant?

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.560
And even if it is, is it the most relevant
way

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.450
that you could end an essay?

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.970
For a historical essay you
want to keep your conclusions

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.240
very specific, the same
way that you want to keep

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.360
your period of time specific.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.080
So, if you're talking about
the post-war era, conclude

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.220
with something that you
can actually substantiate,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.100
that you have substantiated in your essay,

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.090
about the post-war era,
say, "The wealth generated

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.930
by industrialization after
World War II was the reason

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.110
that the Baby Boom happened."

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.010
Don't say "And that's why
America is great today."

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.980
What do you mean by great?

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.360
Do you mean economically great?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.730
Culturally Great?

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.440
Politically great?

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.289
It's a little too vague, and vagueness can
really undermine

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.989
your argument as opposed to supporting it.

00:08:36.989 --> 00:08:41.989
In a way these are all kind of appeals for
human nature,

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:47.779
appeals for the natural
progress of history,

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.850
and appeals to patriotism
that are less rooted

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.990
in the fact of what you want
to say than they are rooted

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.019
in ways of trying to get
your reader sympathy.

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:06.019
Instead what you can do is be specific in
your time

00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:08.020
and your place.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.249
Emphasize choices and points where things

00:09:12.249 --> 00:09:14.630
might have gone differently than they did.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.350
And end with a conclusion
that is very related

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.859
to the things that you
specifically addressed.

00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:27.759
Remember, you never want to
introduce new information

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:31.019
in your conclusion, and
saying "And that's why America

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:33.860
is great today" is new information,

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.699
because it might not
necessarily be related.

00:09:36.699 --> 00:09:40.699
Instead think about what it
was you proved in this paper

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:43.240
and key your conclusion directly to that.
