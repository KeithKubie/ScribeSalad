00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.166
Next up, my journey
600 feet into the crater

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:07.166
of a volatile inferno,
where scientists

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.233
are looking for
signs that could end

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.700
up saving thousands of lives.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.266
Masaya in Nicaragua is so feared
that religious crusaders once

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.834
tried to exorcise the
devil out of its heart.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.867
[music playing]

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:28.633
Lake Nicaragua, the largest
body of fresh water in Central

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.367
America, and home
to Jicaro Island,

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:34.967
a "National Geographic"
unique lodge.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:38.633
Nicaragua has 19
active volcanoes,

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.967
including Masaya, a
ticking time bomb that

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:43.834
could go off at any moment.

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:44.567
That's where I'm headed.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.967
Just look at the size
of this volcanic crater.

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:54.467
It's about seven miles across.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:58.000
And in the center of
it, another volcano

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.667
was born, Masaya, one of the
most volatile in the world,

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:08.834
that's erupted 13 times
in just the last 30 years.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:12.266
I'm making my way around
the crater of Masaya volcano

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:15.333
to some volcanologists
who risk their lives out

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.467
here on this deadly beast.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:22.266
Part of what makes
volcanoes so dangerous

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.767
is that they're unpredictable.

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:27.700
And no one really knows when
this one will erupt again.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.500
With a million people
living just 15 miles away,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.166
geologists have set up shop
in the heart of this ticking

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.934
time bomb to figure that out.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:39.800
Guys, nice to see you.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.233
Working on one of the sensors?

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:42.100
Yes, Phil.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.333
Yeah?

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.066
We are taking care
of the maintenance

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.967
of the gas instruments
that we use

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:50.166
to monitor the mouth of hell.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.667
(LAUGHING) The mouth of hell.

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:52.900
Yes.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.433
Yeah, where did that
name come from, by the way?

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:56.100
It's from the Spanish
conquistadors, you know?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.066
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah?

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.967
A few hundred years ago.

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:05.266
They thought that it was gold
and fire coming from hell.

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.700
So that's why it's named
after that, you know?

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.467
PHIL KEOGHAN:
Armando and his team

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:13.333
monitor a network of 80 sensors,
gauging Masaya's conditions

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.867
and surrounding
atmosphere so they can try

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:18.633
to predict the next eruption.

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:22.066
It seems to me that without
these warning systems,

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:25.200
the people would be
really vulnerable.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.300
This is the only means
of defense for them?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.867
As you say, when we detect
something that is dangerous,

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:35.600
we send information immediately
to the local authorities.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.900
PHIL KEOGHAN: In
the spring of 2018,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.667
earthquake sensors captured
vital data on Hawaii's Kilauea

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:47.266
volcano, which after it erupted,
reduced 600 homes to ashes.

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:50.467
That intel is crucial
to missions like this.

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:52.266
ARMANDO SABALLOS:
It's getting unstable.

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:53.567
You can see--

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.066
Yeah, this edge is
starting to break away.

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:56.367
Yeah, it's falling apart.

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:01.233
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh my!

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:02.400
ARMANDO SABALLOS: Yes,
that's the mouth of hell.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.233
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh, my god!

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:07.333
That is really scary-looking.

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:08.800
Where in the world
can you see this?

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.066
Very few places.

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:12.100
ARMANDO SABALLOS:
Yeah, very few places.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.900
PHIL KEOGHAN: The lava lakes
that form in active volcanoes

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.600
typically don't last long.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.633
But Masaya's has been churning
consistently for centuries,

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:24.667
making it one of the most active
members of the Ring of Fire.

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:35.333
I've used some volcanic rocks
to make a very rough map.

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:38.400
But I want to show you exactly
where the Ring of Fire is.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.233
It's 25,000 miles long, and
completely circumnavigates

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:43.500
the Pacific Ocean.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.100
It runs right
through New Zealand--

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.934
that's why there's a
lot of volcanoes there--

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:50.467
through Indonesia, Japan,
through the top of Russia,

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:53.000
all the way down the
west coast of America,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.567
and then down through Central
America, where Nicaragua is.

00:03:56.567 --> 00:04:00.266
And it continues right down
to the end of South America.

00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:02.467
Almost all of the volcanoes
in the Ring of Fire

00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:05.867
occur along the edges of
the Pacific tectonic plate.

00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:09.567
But Masaya was formed
between two smaller plates.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:13.333
About 20 million years ago,
the Cocos plate began sliding

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:15.300
under the Caribbean plate.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.934
The energy from this
subduction turns

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:21.667
solid rock into liquid magma.

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:25.066
And when that magma escaped
through the Earth's crust,

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:26.166
Masaya was born.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.066
That's a long way down.

00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:32.000
So--

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.266
So we're good?

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:40.667
It's a 60-story drop into
this cauldron of toxic gas.

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:43.367
This mask will
actually filter out

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:49.000
the sulfur dioxide that
we're expecting down below.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.734
You can also get the
gases in your eye.

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:56.433
Then this helmet,
for obvious reasons,

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:58.834
'cause at the rim of
the crater, there's

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:01.500
a lot of falling debris.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.600
I'm going in to meet up
with Rodolfo Alvarez,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.333
the engineer behind
this pulley system

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:11.767
built to get scientists in and
out of this massive crater.

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:17.467
And it is a lot further
down there than it looks.

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.200
Everything turned on properly?

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:27.834
This is the exciting part.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.533
Just the enormity of this
volcano is incredible, really.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.800
The roar from the volcano is
getting louder and louder.

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:51.400
Look at that.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.166
That is absolutely magnificent--

00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:57.734
the glow of the lava.

00:05:57.734 --> 00:06:01.333
And in the distance, I can see
the vent we're heading for.

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:03.400
Descending into this
hostile environment

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.133
of heat and toxic gas
is extremely dangerous.

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:08.533
But for Rodolfo
Alvarez, it's as if it's

00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:10.133
just another day at the office.

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:11.133
All right.

00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:12.266
Rodolfo, how are you doing?

00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:14.033
Well, welcome
to a gate of hell.

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:15.367
Oh, my goodness me.

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:19.533
That was like-- that was
just insane, Rodolfo.

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:20.500
Are you OK?

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.934
PHIL KEOGHAN:
Yeah, I'm all good.

00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:23.533
Wow, it got dark
so quick, right?

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:25.200
Why are you not
wearing your gas mask?

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.433
What's wrong with you?

00:06:26.433 --> 00:06:27.667
Oh, because I wear
it when I need it.

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:28.500
How do you know?

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.767
You watch the gases coming up?

00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:31.567
Well, right now you
don't need the mask.

00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:33.333
But if you want to keep
it, it's no problem.

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:36.367
PHIL KEOGHAN: There is an
overwhelming odor down here,

00:06:36.367 --> 00:06:38.800
like a match that's
just been lit.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.266
That's sulfur dioxide.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:43.967
And when that gas mixes with
the moisture in the air,

00:06:43.967 --> 00:06:46.033
it forms sulfuric acid.

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:49.400
It eats everything, from the
cables ferrying the team in

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.934
and out of Masaya, to
the sensors that raise

00:06:51.934 --> 00:06:53.400
the alarm when there's danger.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.367
This is a box that we got
in to protect the sensors,

00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:57.633
the sensor inside.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:06:58.567
Because of the--

00:06:58.567 --> 00:06:59.934
RODOLFO ALVAREZ:
The sulfuric acid.

00:06:59.934 --> 00:07:01.266
PHIL KEOGHAN: The sulfuric acid.

00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:03.500
There are little sensors
down the bottom here?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.233
RODOLFO ALVAREZ: Different
sensors for different gases.

00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:08.033
Those are the ones
that are damaged.

00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:10.166
The corrosion
is really bad, eh?

00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:12.266
Yes, actually it's
amazing, if you--

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:13.667
All around I see like--

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.133
You can look in here.

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:17.100
I mean, this is
actually a cable.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.066
And we can--

00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:20.667
PHIL KEOGHAN: Wow!

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:23.667
Look at these joints have
just completely eroded away.

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:25.433
RODOLFO ALVAREZ: I mean,
it's completely destroyed.

00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:27.734
PHIL KEOGHAN: And that's
from the sulfuric acid?

00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:28.867
RODOLFO ALVAREZ: Yes.

00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:30.767
You know, you have all
this cloud of sulfur,

00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:32.266
and you can feel your eyes.

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:34.266
Your eyes will start
itching like hell.

00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:35.700
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah,
so it's that strong.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.333
RODOLFO ALVAREZ: I mean,
it's not pure sulfuric acid,

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:38.834
but it's very high percentage.

00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:41.600
Man, I just want to
keep putting on the mask.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.467
And I look at you,
you got no mask on.

00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:44.266
Right.

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:45.834
I don't know how you do it.

00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:48.233
We can go that way and you
can actually get to the edge.

00:07:48.233 --> 00:07:50.433
We have ropes set up so
you can get to the edge.

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:55.200
We're going to go here.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.033
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh!

00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:00.233
RODOLFO ALVAREZ:
Now I need a mask.

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:02.934
I just got this
swirling of gases.

00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:05.867
Yeah, I can feel
the heat right here.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.967
Really see it there.

00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:16.033
RODOLFO ALVAREZ: Yes.

00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:16.867
PHIL KEOGHAN: We
got a good look.

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:24.100
I've never seen anything of
this magnitude and power.

00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:32.400
And you can feel the
power in the ground.

00:08:35.233 --> 00:08:37.700
What is it about the
lava that you love?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.300
People are afraid of
this, but this is what

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.633
really makes you feel alive.

00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:43.433
This is one of
those things amazing

00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:48.967
of nature or the universe that
you can actually see in person.

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:52.100
