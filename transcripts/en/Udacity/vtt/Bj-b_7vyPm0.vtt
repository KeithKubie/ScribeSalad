00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.380
So let's look at these features to see what would be

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.170
the perfect feature list for Debbie. Bill splitting. That would definitely be

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.820
one of them, because Debbie is very money conscious, so she'd

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.350
want to split the bill. delivery, definitely, because Debbie doesn't have a car.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.570
So definitely not pickup, because she doesn't have a car, so

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.980
there's no way she could go pick up a pizza. Coupons definitely,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.490
because she is very value conscious. I don't think name of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.440
the farmer, or photos of ingredients would be very useful for her,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.260
that might be too extra, to much extra for her. And also multiple payment

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.720
options would be consistent with the bill

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.350
splitting, because different people might have different

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.190
payment options. So I think this would be a really good feature list that

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.880
would make Debbie feel like we made a pizza app that's just for her.
