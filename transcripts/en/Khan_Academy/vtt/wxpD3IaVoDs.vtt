00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.400
- [Kim] Long before Rosa Parks refused

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.970
to move to the back of the bus,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.150
Homer Plessy boarded a
train car in New Orleans

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.990
to protest Jim Crow segregation laws.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.930
Plessy was arrested and
convicted in Louisiana

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.240
but his test case for
segregated public transportation

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.430
reached the Supreme Court in 1896.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.080
This is Kim from Khan Academy

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.200
and today we're learning
more about the landmark case

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.410
Plessy versus Ferguson which asked

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.716
whether separate but equal accommodations

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:33.180
for black and white Americans
violated the 14th Amendment

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.520
of the Constitution.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.340
To learn more about this case,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.970
I spoke with two experts.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.150
Jamal Green is the Dwight Professor of Law

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.600
and Columbia Law School.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.700
Earl Maltz a Distinguished
Professor of Law

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.300
at Rutgers Law School.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.110
So Professor Greene, could
you kinda set the stage

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.520
for us in this time period?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.780
After the Civil War, what was the legal

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.410
and social status of former slaves?

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.890
- [Jamal] Well of course
the Civil War ended in 1865

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.610
and it was fought in large
part over the institution

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.580
of chattel slavery, so slavery
of, generally speaking,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.950
black or African American slaves.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.440
And right at the end of the Civil War,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.040
the 13th Amendment was passed

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.910
and the 13 Amendment basically said that

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.896
there shouldn't be any slavery
or involuntary servitude

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:23.620
in the United States.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.130
So the institution of
slavery itself had ended,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.650
but the passage of the 13th Amendment

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.606
did not mean that former
slaves had equal rights.

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:35.970
A number of the former
states of the Confederacy,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.610
the generally speaking Southern States,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.165
passed a number of racially
discriminatory laws,

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:44.222
immediately after the end of slavery

00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:47.140
that prevented black Americans from

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.960
participating in civil society
on equal terms with whites.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.820
For example, laws restricting
the ability of blacks

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.022
to enter into and enforce contracts,

00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:59.250
restricting the ability
of blacks to own property,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280
to sit on juries, to vote,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.570
to testify in court, and so forth.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.620
So there were an number of
openly discriminatory laws.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.980
There were also laws that
required blacks to be employed

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.520
on pain of having their labor forced.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.460
So ways of essentially reinstituting

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.457
the institution of slavery.

00:02:19.457 --> 00:02:22.040
- [Kim] And these were
know as the Black Codes.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.160
- [Jamal] Those were known
as the Black Codes, exactly.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.180
- [Earl] In the Reconstruction
Period, between the,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.870
say the late-1860s and the mid-1870s

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.430
there was a concerted effort
by the federal government

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.260
to improve the social status

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.599
and political rights of African Americans.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.340
In 1876, as part of the settlement of the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.320
Presidential election of
1876, the federal government

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.110
drew back some, but most of the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.397
so-called the Redeemer Movement

00:02:57.397 --> 00:03:00.230
really took off in the 1890s.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.540
I think 1891 is when the
last real effort is made

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.780
by the federal government

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.930
to have a serious voting rights act

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.400
and after that, the South is pretty much

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.590
under control of the people who

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.420
sympathized with ex-Confederates.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.400
- [Jamal] In both Northern
and Southern States

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.777
there was wide spread racial segregation.

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:24.474
So there were laws that
were basically codifying

00:03:24.474 --> 00:03:28.726
long existing social practices
of segregated housing,

00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:32.540
segregated schools, and
segregated public conveyances

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.170
like steamships and rail cars.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.060
But much of that changed in the years

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.400
immediately following the Civil War.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.230
Congress passed a number of federal laws

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.740
that banned racial discrimination

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.340
particularly in
contracting and in housing.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.560
Quite significantly in addition to

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.310
the actual federal laws
that Congress passed,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.460
the country passed and
ratified the 14th Amendment.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.800
- [Kim] So I think one
thing that is very hard

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.260
for me to understand and
that I'd seen struggle with,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.520
is you have the passage
of the 14th Amendment

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.560
and the 15th Amendment in 1868 and 1870

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.130
and these are supposed to
guarantee equal protection

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.030
and citizenship and voting
rights for African Americans,

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.658
specifically men in the 15th Amendment

00:04:21.658 --> 00:04:25.040
and then you have Jim Crow.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.040
So how did we get from this
moment after the Civil War

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.170
where things really seem
like they're looking up

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.700
in terms of African American citizenship

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.400
to the system of Jim Crow
that's going to persist

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.430
into the 1960s and '70s?

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.520
- [Jamal] The Civil
War did not end racism,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.750
it simply ended slavery.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.760
And so you're still
living in a racist society

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.760
in which residential
and school segregation

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.730
remained both in Southern
States and in Northern States,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.820
now withstanding the
civil rights amendments.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.190
And in Southern States, Reconstruction,

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.995
was the process of trying
to bring former slaves

00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:08.180
fully into civil society
was enforced by the presence

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.480
of federal troops in Southern States

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.704
on the theory, the very
well founded theory,

00:05:14.704 --> 00:05:17.098
that states that had just go to war

00:05:17.098 --> 00:05:20.610
in order to perpetuate
the institution of slavery

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.530
were not going to willingly
adopt equal rights

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.130
for the former slaves that they

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.540
had just been holding in bondage.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.580
And so there was a federal
military occupation

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.240
of a number of former Confederate states

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.690
for a good decade plus
after the Civil War,

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.630
really ending in 1877.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.620
- [Earl] And at that point,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.183
again through the Redeemer Movement,

00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:49.330
people who were the white power structure,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.330
most of which had sympathized with

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.610
the secessionist movement,
the white power structure

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.095
and its successors took power back in the

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:07.020
beginning in the mid-1870s from the,

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.723
in the Southern States and
as part of their campaign,

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.087
they imposed the Jim Crow system.

00:06:15.087 --> 00:06:18.250
- [Jamal] And slavery
was not just about labor,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.380
it was really a system of racial hierarchy

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.610
and many in the United
States remained committed

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.260
to that system, even
after bondage itself ended

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.610
and if you don't have the
political will within the

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.823
Northern States, to enforce
the Reconstruction amendments

00:06:32.823 --> 00:06:37.632
you had really a retrenchment
of deep racial inequality

00:06:37.632 --> 00:06:40.010
within the Southern States,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.420
but not just within the Southern States,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.440
but also within a number
of Northern States as well.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.849
- [Kim] So let's kinda dial into the case

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.930
Plessy versus Ferguson.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.970
Who was Homer Plessy

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.700
and why did he take
issue with segregation?

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.810
- [Earl] Well the law that was at issue

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.970
required what was in
theory separate but equal

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.360
accommodation of African
Americans and whites

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.077
on public transportation.

00:07:12.077 --> 00:07:14.420
Homer Plessy objected to it,

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:19.420
because a, the facilities
weren't really equal

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.910
and he objected to it because he was

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.010
in part because he was
classified as black,

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.520
but also in general because

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.530
he thought that was demeaning.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.980
Obviously a majority of
members of the Supreme Court

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:40.700
believed that the
Southern States should be,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.700
should have at least some
leeway to establish their,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.280
the system of racial segregation.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.880
- [Jamal] And so Plessy was
in league with the railroad

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.830
and with the civil rights organization

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.650
that recruited him to set off a case.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.650
So he agreed with the railroad
to board the white area

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.130
of the railway car, on a
car going from New Orleans

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.620
to a town called Covington

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.140
and it was agreed that the
railway would ask him to leave,

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.520
he would refuse, and then
he would be arrested.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.210
And once he was arrested,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.580
that would enable him to challenge the law

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.960
under which he was arrested
under the Constitution.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.090
The railroads didn't like this law.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.420
They didn't like this law
because they didn't want

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.065
to be subject to fines or liability

00:08:35.065 --> 00:08:39.040
for not properly
maintaining separate cars.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.830
It was really up to the conductors

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.270
to make sure that separate
cars were maintained

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.451
and that the conductors
themselves could be fined

00:08:45.451 --> 00:08:48.480
by the state for not doing so,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.321
and it could also be fined by passengers

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:54.320
for mistakenly putting
someone in the wrong car.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.300
So the railroads didn't
really wanna be bothered

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.464
with this kind of law,

00:08:57.464 --> 00:09:00.600
and so this particular
railroad Eastern Railway,

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.730
was willing to agree
to set up the situation

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.040
to challenge the law.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.870
- [Kim] So Homer Plessy,
he gets on this train

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.800
and he challenges this statute.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.530
I believe he sat in a white's only car

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.660
and announced that he was African American

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.210
and then he was arrested.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.340
So what happened next?

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.720
- [Jamal] He's arrested and
then he is eventually charged

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.650
with a crime, with a
violation of the statute

00:09:27.402 --> 00:09:30.890
and there's a fine associated
with violating the state law.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.830
And his lawyers bring a claim

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.560
that the law violates
the federal Constitution.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.260
So initially it goes through
the state courts of Louisiana

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.900
and then eventually they
rule against Homer Plessy

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.490
and in favor of the law

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.610
and then his lawyers appeal the case

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.810
to the U.S. Supreme Court.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.200
- [Kim] So how did the court rule?

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.788
- [Jamal] In the years leading up to case,

00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:58.397
the lawyers for Homer Plessy

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:02.080
were quite concerned about
the composition of the Court

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.994
because they weren't
sure if they could count

00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:07.330
five votes in favor of black civil rights,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.960
because none of the justices on the Court

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.450
were considered to be particularly

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.337
friends of black Americans.

00:10:13.337 --> 00:10:17.280
- [Earl] And in the civil
rights cases in 1860,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.437
in 1883, excuse me,

00:10:19.437 --> 00:10:23.628
the court had already held
that Congress lacked authority

00:10:23.628 --> 00:10:28.620
to prohibit segregation
in public accommodations,

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.720
which meant that they
viewed public accommodations

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.530
as something purely private,

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.220
rather than a civil right,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.560
a place that had governmental
right or a quasi public right,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.320
and that's one of the big
distinction between the majority

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.390
and the dissent in both
the civil rights cases

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.220
and in Plessy versus Ferguson.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.830
The Court ruled, that in fact,

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.820
that so long as the state of Louisiana

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.320
maintained separate but equal
facilities they could do that.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.600
That that was not prohibited
by the 14th Amendment.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.480
- [Jamal] The Supreme Court
in 1896 rules seven to one

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.370
that the Separate Car
Act is constitutional,

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.860
so a state is allowed to
segregate it's public conveyances,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.830
including rail cars by race.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.230
The Court denies that the Separate Car Act

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.520
violates the 14th Amendment
to the Constitution.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.440
What the Court basically says,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.870
is look, the law says the
railway cars have to be equal,

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.140
even if they're separate.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.250
And all the 14th Amendment requires is

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.310
that basic equality in civil rights.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.270
- [Earl] John Marshall Harlan
of course dissented from that.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.920
I think that it's important to understand

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.210
what was the actual
nature of Harlan's dissent

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.620
rather than the way that
it is actually portrayed.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.620
Harlan is famous talking about
the colorblind Constitution,

00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:52.267
but he also in fact,

00:11:52.267 --> 00:11:55.530
what he says is with
respect to civil rights,

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.700
common rights common to all citizens,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.519
I don't have the exactly line before me,

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:05.260
but that the Constitution was
required to be colorblind.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.655
So one of the big distinctions between

00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:09.810
the majority and the dissent

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.510
is that Harlan does in fact believe

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.622
that the right to use
public transportation

00:12:15.622 --> 00:12:17.770
counted as a civil right,

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.990
which was and therefore was
protected against segregation

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.943
by section one of the 14th Amendment.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.000
I wanna make that point because,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.300
it's pretty clear that
Harlan believed, for example,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.120
that maintenance of segregated schools

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.844
would be constitutional and it's also true

00:12:36.844 --> 00:12:39.480
that Harlan voted for to say that

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.530
designation laws were constitutional.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.110
- [Jamal] The dissenting
judge, Justice Harlan,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.330
himself a former supporter of slavery

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.320
who changed his views and
eventually became known

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.900
as a champion of black civil rights.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.767
So Justice Harlan, the lone dissenter,

00:12:56.767 --> 00:12:59.996
one of the only Southern
judges on the court,

00:12:59.996 --> 00:13:02.135
but the others were basically Northern,

00:13:02.135 --> 00:13:04.130
both Republican and Democrat.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.293
They didn't have strong views about race.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.420
They didn't have unusually
strong views about race

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.836
for their time

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:17.880
and they maintained this distinction

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.140
between social and civil rights.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.660
It's important to understand
in trying to understand

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.130
the context of Plessy versus Ferguson

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.870
that the Supreme Court used to distinguish

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.559
between what it called civil rights

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.830
and what it called social rights.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.330
Civil rights were, basically
rights to participate

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.090
in civil society and included rights like

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.713
the right to enter into contracts,

00:13:41.713 --> 00:13:45.477
the right to buy property,
the right to testify in court.

00:13:45.477 --> 00:13:47.970
The Court understood social rights

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.150
as something very different from that,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.030
which is really the right
to do all of those things

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.880
in the company of people
of a different race.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.713
- [Kim] That's fascinating.

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:02.330
So what was the effect of this ruling

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.330
in Plessy versus Ferguson?

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.710
- [Earl] There are two ways
that you could look at it,

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:11.710
but until 1954, the effect
of the ruling was to allow,

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.490
was to say that the state governments

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.327
were allowed to segregate their citizenry

00:14:22.327 --> 00:14:24.000
on the basis of race.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.310
That's one way you can look at it.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.250
Now, one of the interesting questions is,

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.010
how much difference it would have made,

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.036
given the sort of culture
of the Southern States

00:14:33.036 --> 00:14:36.885
even if the Court had held
that it was unconstitutional

00:14:36.885 --> 00:14:39.030
for the state to formally require

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.030
segregation among the races?

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.642
That is that there were a
lot of informal pressures

00:14:44.642 --> 00:14:49.642
which would have pushed
towards segregation

00:14:49.821 --> 00:14:52.483
even if the Court had said that

00:14:52.483 --> 00:14:54.930
the statute was unconstitutional.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.230
But will never know that.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.986
So in other words, the question in Plessy

00:14:58.986 --> 00:15:03.986
is not whether the federal government

00:15:04.627 --> 00:15:08.560
was going to mandate segregation,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.920
but rather whether the federal government

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.010
was simply going to leave the states

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.109
and their citizenry to their own devices

00:15:16.109 --> 00:15:18.490
in determining whether to segregate

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.250
their public transportation
and some other thing.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.813
- [Kim] So this concept
of separate but equal,

00:15:25.813 --> 00:15:28.590
is I think the most important thing

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.120
that comes out of Plessy versus Ferguson

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.640
and then later will be at
issue in the 20th Century.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.390
So was separate ever equal
in theory or in practice?

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.960
- [Jamal] It was very clear at the time,

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.167
and Justice Harlan says so
in his dissenting opinion,

00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:52.063
in Plessy that the practice
of separating railway cars

00:15:52.063 --> 00:15:57.063
or any number of other public
accommodations by race,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.690
was not designed for the
comfort of black Americans.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.750
It was designed in order to maintain

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:11.280
their social inferiority
through legal institutions.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.650
So once you know longer have
the institution of slavery,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.770
there was a felt need
among many in the South

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.659
to maintain the system of social relations

00:16:21.659 --> 00:16:23.430
that slavery represented

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.000
and that's what Jim Crow was all about.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.790
And everyone knew that's
what Jim Crow was all about.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.970
So Jim Crow was really
kind of in its infancy

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.550
when Plessy versus Ferguson was decided.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.660
Laws that prevented blacks from voting

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.820
through a number of, through
the literacy requirements

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.380
and property requirements and
good character requirements

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.101
and so forth, those kinds of laws

00:16:48.101 --> 00:16:51.510
were very much in their infancy

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.999
at the time Plessy versus
Ferguson was decided

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:57.890
and so the whole system of segregation

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.800
is really revving up in the 1890s

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.200
and the Court just gives it carte blanche

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.009
to continue after that.

00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:11.110
And it's important to
remember that as of the 1890s

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.280
the Supreme Court had not admitted

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.550
to ever having reversed
one of its own decisions.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.740
The lawyers who brought the Plessy case

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.010
were quite clear about this.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.420
The assumption was that
once the Court ruled,

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.092
it was going to be an awfully long time

00:17:24.092 --> 00:17:27.210
before you could get the
Court to reverse itself,

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.670
and that's in fact what happened.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.770
So the Court does not reverse
Plessy versus Ferguson

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.677
until Brown versus Board
of Education in 1954.

00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:38.240
And so you had an almost 60 period

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.400
in which practices of
institutionalized segregation

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.670
had the blessing of the Supreme Court.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.100
- [Kim] So we've learned that
in Plessy versus Ferguson

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.870
the Supreme Court took a narrow view

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.900
of the equal protection clause,

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.740
ruling that separate
but equal accommodations

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.460
for white and black Americans

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.730
did not violate the 14th Amendment.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.340
Earl Maltz suggests that
it's difficult to tell

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.330
if a different outcome
in Plessy versus Ferguson

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.820
would have made much difference

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.230
in the actions of Southern
States, if there was no

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.960
political will to enforce
integration anyway.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.793
Jamal Greene, by contrast,

00:18:15.793 --> 00:18:19.070
reminds us that segregation
was just getting started

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.730
at the time of the Plessy case

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.860
and this ruling by the Court
legitimized Jim Crow laws

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.900
that would continue to
spread for nearly 60 years.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.170
