00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.570
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I am Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast. And,

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.790
<v 1>um, here's what I want to do today. You know,</v>

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.910
we just did the hour long show up at the Galapagos. Yeah.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.440
And in the middle of that show,

5
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:17.580
we hit on this idea that there are so many of us on the planet now doing so many

6
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.690
different things which affect the air and the water that the creatures on the

7
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:22.570
planet, um,

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.010
can no longer really be uninfluenced by our presence.

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.830
They can't be truly wild. And that made me

10
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.190
<v 0>wonder, well,</v>

11
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.630
if you want to give the other creatures on earth a little more room to be wild

12
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:41.110
and independent, and what do we have to give up? In fact,

13
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.350
how much are we willing to give up to make that happen?

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.250
<v 2>Uh, I don't know that these are, these are tough questions.</v>

15
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.930
Um, I mean, you know, I'm not good at the answer part. Right? You read them.

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.300
This is John Malala. Uh, I'm John McClellan.

17
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.330
I wrote a book called wild ones and I'm a writer with the New York Times

18
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.100
<v 0>magazine and being a writer, he told me a story. Oh,</v>

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.560
this is a story which shed some light on this question,

20
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.260
but I think you'd have to say it's a difficult light.

21
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.163
<v 2>So, um,</v>

22
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.490
there was a family of whooping cranes that had been part of it.

23
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.490
<v 0>The story revolves around a project to create a wild flock of whooping cranes.</v>

24
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.640
One of the most spectacular birds in the world, five foot tall is pitch white,

25
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:26.690
dealing with black wingtips gonna seven foot wingspan. Beautiful Flyer.

26
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.580
This is Joe Duff. I'm the CO founder of Operation Migration,

27
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.760
the current CEO.

28
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.130
Now we've done a story on operation migration before and Radiolab.

29
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.490
But here's the, here's the gist. At one point,

30
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:41.720
the whooping crane population in North America was down to like 15 birds,

31
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:42.920
just one flock.

32
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.640
So Joe and a bunch of other folks decided to to see if they could start a new

33
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.780
flock of cranes.

34
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.110
So they raised some cranes in Wisconsin and then they teach them a new migration

35
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:58.360
route to Florida by leading them there in an ultra light airplane. Yeah.

36
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.910
Joe, in addition to being founder and CEO is also the lead pilot.

37
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.740
And how long have you been, you've been doing this for awhile, right, man?

38
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.630
I started flying with birds in 93, 20 years.

39
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.220
And the key to this whole project, Joe says, is to eliminate all things human.

40
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.070
And these are wild creatures. You know,

41
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.950
when we do this whole thing in full costume, so the birds don't hear voices.

42
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:19.784
They don't, uh,

43
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.420
they don't see buildings or any other human paraphernalia in order in order to

44
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.980
maintain their wildness.

45
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.850
Jill even wears an all white cream like a costume when he's up there in the

46
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.550
ultra light

47
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.330
<v 2>leading the birds down to Florida. And when they get to Florida,</v>

48
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.620
and cranes are supposed to, you know, they're brought to this, um,

49
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.770
[inaudible] national wildlife refuge.

50
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.790
<v 0>It's a coastal wetland. It's all a salt marsh in the Tampa area.</v>

51
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.910
And the birds are put into a, it's called a release pad.

52
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.540
It is a 12 foot high fences protected by electric wire,

53
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.840
but the whole complex is not top netted. And so, um,

54
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.540
after a while the birds realized they can fly out,

55
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.160
<v 2>then they go seek out their own territory. It's</v>

56
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.070
<v 0>called a gentle release into the wild or they're not so well.</v>

57
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.460
And here's where the problem starts.

58
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.420
It's the winter of 2007 and we've got a particular bunch of cranes

59
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.760
<v 2>and his family, they were called the first family cause they were the first, um,</v>

60
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.930
cranes in the population to have a, have a chick that they led south,

61
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.940
<v 0>the first wild hatch migratory whooping crane in the u s since the last nest was</v>

62
00:03:19.341 --> 00:03:23.990
reported in 1878. And these cranes had wound up in, in this little subdivision,

63
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.960
a a wetland complex that was surrounded by houses.

64
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.400
<v 2>It was perfect crane habitat. It was,</v>

65
00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:32.160
it was basically a marsh just so happened that it was in this,

66
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.010
this woman's backyard. And so the, the birds,

67
00:03:37.011 --> 00:03:38.660
which had been the product of this, you know,

68
00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:40.430
very intensive effort and tons of money,

69
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.240
<v 0>here's a thousands of dollars an hour,</v>

70
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.370
<v 2>um, to be wild whooping cranes. We're now just in her backyard. And there was,</v>

71
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.740
there was free food there. She had all these bird feeders,

72
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:51.650
this whole array of different bird feeders, upright and yard.

73
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.870
<v 0>And that's not good sign. Why? Why is this a problem? Well,</v>

74
00:03:54.871 --> 00:03:57.810
the problem is we're worried that the birds are going to become acclimated to

75
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:02.100
people to be really safe. Joe says these birds should be afraid of people.

76
00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:06.510
Six of them have been shot by vandals. Six birds have been shot.

77
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:09.750
Six whooping grains had been shot in this project by vandals. Yeah.

78
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.290
So what do you do? We asked the people to stop feeding.

79
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:16.470
Would you have like a reverse phone directory or do you have a ups?

80
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.500
Don't we track? The birds are all tracked. And so they knew exactly where they,

81
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.190
where they were and they were able to figure out that the cranes were in the

82
00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:25.830
backyard of someone named music.

83
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.790
<v 2>Gibbs. Claris Clarice. Yes. Clarice Gibbs. And,</v>

84
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.090
uh, you know, they knocked on our door and explained, you know,

85
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:36.610
the whole ins and outs of the project and would you please take your bird

86
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:39.730
feeders down? And uh, she said, she said no,

87
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.740
<v 0>no. Yeah. Why would she say no?</v>

88
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.281
<v 2>Well,</v>

89
00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:46.160
John talked to the people who went to see her and know they didn't say crazy,

90
00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:48.710
but you got the sense that there was this, you know, crazy old bird lady.

91
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.350
You lived in this house who'd move, would not take her feeders down.

92
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.910
<v 0>They told John that she, they thought he was acting kind of erratic and uh,</v>

93
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:57.070
and things just kept getting worse and worse.

94
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.690
<v 2>And they had actually gone in and put a plastic fence around one of her feeders</v>

95
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:03.330
at one point. What was she, they had thought she had given permission,

96
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:06.630
but she had no memory of that. So it got, it got bitter pretty fast.

97
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:09.450
And so John decided, I'm going to go talk to this woman. Yeah. So I,

98
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.930
I was sort of girding myself for a, you know,

99
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.680
crazy old bird lady who lived in this house,

100
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.330
but I w but I went to go see her and, uh, you know, is it was a,

101
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.710
how do I even talk about it? And it was a really emotional day for me. Um,

102
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.950
we sat her at her dining room table and she was having a lot of trouble

103
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:30.330
remembering the exact chronology of what had happened when, um, she, uh,

104
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.500
you know, she said, excuse me,

105
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:34.950
I'm just hard for me to kind of piece things together around that,

106
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.910
around that time. And, uh, and basically this story emerged

107
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.660
<v 3>that time of, oh gosh,</v>

108
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.770
<v 0>when we heard that story, we decided we needed to talk to [inaudible] ourselves.</v>

109
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.520
So we called her up out of kind of the blue and asked her if we could record the

110
00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:51.950
conversation record. We would love to do it.

111
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.430
<v 3>Well, no, it wouldn't bother me at all. I wouldn't mind.</v>

112
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.440
<v 0>Okay. So you are about to Clarice. Tell us her. Uh, I got,</v>

113
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.820
I gotta say it's a sort of surprising version of this tale in just a second.

We're back and we, we've just called up Clarice Gibbs.

128
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.060
<v 3>It wouldn't bother me at all. I wouldn't mind.</v>

129
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.000
<v 0>Okay, so you were about to say that you're, first of all the description, you,</v>

130
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.810
how many bird feeders did you have in the backyard would you say? Roughly?

131
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.110
<v 3>Um, at that time, uh,</v>

132
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.880
I think I had two or three in an oak tree that's here in our backyard.

133
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.570
And where we live is, um, it's just, you know,

134
00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:21.720
it's a peaceful area in bird flight, things like that.

135
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.250
They don't like to be allowed around a lot of congestion and stuff. And, uh,

136
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.860
we enjoy them. Well, I say we hum. When my husband was alive, we, you know,

137
00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:34.540
we both enjoyed the birds and see them.

138
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.340
<v 0>This is where the story flipped for me because when those conservationists were</v>

139
00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:42.750
knocking at Clarissa's door, her husband of more than 15

140
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.430
<v 2>d years,</v>

141
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.700
he had Alzheimer's and they were sort of hunkered down at their house waiting

142
00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.430
for his Vern, his life to end. Okay.

143
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.260
<v 3>Yeah. This was, this was before, uh, you know,</v>

144
00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:55.360
the Alzheimer's cooking really bad.

145
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.050
<v 2>And what they were doing was spending a lot of time on their back porch looking</v>

146
00:07:59.051 --> 00:07:59.800
at the bird.

147
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.260
<v 3>And we wouldn't come out here and sit with our tea or lemonade. Um,</v>

148
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.200
he would, uh, he would just kind of watch

149
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.360
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

150
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.220
<v 3>our back porch, of course faces the lake. We have a beautiful yard,</v>

151
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:19.780
we have oak trees. And as I'm sitting here talking to you,

152
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:24.300
there's all kinds of birds around right now feeding. Um,

153
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.050
we even have sandhill cranes that have two babies with them.

154
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.860
<v 0>So Clarice and her husband would be there on the porch.</v>

155
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.590
And if you have had this disease in your family,

156
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.470
you know how painful it is because here's her husband and he is just

157
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.770
disappearing a little bit and little bit more.

158
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.410
And then he's mostly not there. But when a bird or a bunch of birds come by,

159
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.880
the bird feeders from wherever he was,

160
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.063
he's back.

161
00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.620
<v 3>As soon as he would spot something, he'd say, Babe, there is, there it is.</v>

162
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.670
There's the hummingbird.

163
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.750
<v 0>And when the whooping crane showed up big and white and wild,</v>

164
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.950
<v 3>that would really get his attention cause they are such big, beautiful birds.</v>

165
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.370
You know, I could see the, Oh gosh,

166
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.270
like I happiness in his eyes and he would smile.

167
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.680
Oh to me it was like, you know, he,

168
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.400
he came back to me for a little bit when, when he would see things like this,

169
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:30.930
it would just, it would make him so happy and it would make me happy too,

170
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:33.900
to see how it affected him.

171
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.420
I'm sorry, I just, I,

172
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.650
I get, uh, kind of choked up when I talk about him.

173
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.700
We were married for 56 years when that disease took him and it was hard.

174
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.853
ARD

175
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.450
<v 2>from her point of view,</v>

176
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:57.230
it was like a miracle to see a bird like that and the way that her husband

177
00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:58.950
responded to them and just the, you know, the way they,

178
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.940
that they took his breath away, um, when really, you know,

179
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:04.580
he wasn't responding to, uh, to a lot else in the world.

180
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.480
<v 3>It's a blessing, you know, when, when they seem to recognize things and,</v>

181
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.440
and then you lose them again, you know? Yeah.

182
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.630
<v 0>So that's why when the crane people showed up at her door and said,</v>

183
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:21.290
please take the boot feeder down. She said, no,

184
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.610
<v 2>you know, I left that house. Uh, just, you know, I just couldn't figure out, um,</v>

185
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.760
how to make sense of it all once I, once I had left.

186
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.900
<v 0>Have the people who visited her having read your account,</v>

187
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:37.911
have they changed their minds at all about her or what they do because it's a

188
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.450
toughie. This, this session.

189
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.110
<v 2>Yeah. I'm sure they would still believe that the birds shouldn't have been fed.</v>

190
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.840
But I don't know if they would be any more sympathetic to, or no

191
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.900
<v 0>desire to see her husband. And these birds, oddly enough, are the trigger.</v>

192
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.500
So I told Joe Clarissa's story. So now what do you say?

193
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.733
Well, you know,

194
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.060
my father died of Alzheimer's so I can respect to exactly what she's going

195
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:03.520
through and how difficult it is. However,

196
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.900
the cost of that is the demise of a bird that,

197
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.760
that either people have spent a huge amount of time in 24 hours a day,

198
00:11:12.761 --> 00:11:17.110
seven days a week for that entire bird's life until it was a year old putting in

199
00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:21.660
the wild to help save a species. But if you put yourself in her shoes,

200
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.320
she says, she, by the way, was very careful.

201
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.570
<v 3>I, I was very,</v>

202
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.600
very emphatic that we didn't mess with the birds because I knew they didn't want

203
00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:36.620
them being confronted with, with people, you know, they,

204
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.450
because they are a wild thing. And, and uh, it's,

205
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.610
it, to me, it, it, I don't know. I,

206
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.120
we've always loved nature and we've just always loved nature and,

207
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.820
and the wildlife.

208
00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.610
<v 0>So she stayed where, where she felt you'd want her to stay.</v>

209
00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.090
But it's a hard one to ask that she give up a glimpse at her husband for the

210
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:06.580
sake of the birds. I suppose

211
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.050
I'm a little more pragmatic than that unfortunately. Hmm. You would want,

212
00:12:13.051 --> 00:12:16.710
you would have him make an exception for her. Well,

213
00:12:16.711 --> 00:12:19.320
at the very least I would have him,

214
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.950
cause I understand that she's in a unique place that he's, no,

215
00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:26.400
I don't mean it's unique. Well, I, maybe she is in her particulars,

216
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.170
but that is precisely the problem he has to deal with it.

217
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.440
Are People like her. She means well, we all mean, well,

218
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.300
it's not a case of like people with guns shooting these birds.

219
00:12:38.301 --> 00:12:40.970
I mean that does happen, but I don't think that's the big problem. No,

220
00:12:40.971 --> 00:12:44.630
these are two people who both love the bird but can't agree on something. Right.

221
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:49.400
And he saying in order to love the bird, you have to negate, you have to just,

222
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.520
you'd have to disappear. And we can't, as human beings,

223
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.440
we don't seem to be able to do that.

224
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.410
We all have our own personal requirements and we put those over and above

225
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.670
anything else, including wildlife. And that's why wildlife is,

226
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.560
is in such peril.

227
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:08.750
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

228
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.750
<v 1>he's asking her to say goodbye to her husband for the sake of a bird species.</v>

229
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:21.110
I knew I ate. I just worry that if everybody in the world is like her,

230
00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:22.760
then those birds don't have a chance.

231
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.230
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

232
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.610
<v 0>I would love it if these birds could just exist on their own somewhere and</v>

233
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.720
[inaudible] in deep water marshes where they don't ever encounter people.

234
00:13:33.721 --> 00:13:36.240
But that's never going to happen. It's just not going to happen.

235
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:38.220
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

236
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.010
<v 2>and that's the struggle. It's never gonna go away. You know? No matter what,</v>

237
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.070
no matter what happens with any of these species conservation projects,

238
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.630
we're not going to strike some balance where we never have to think about the

239
00:13:48.631 --> 00:13:51.900
power that we're exerting in the world. This give and take it. That's,

240
00:13:51.901 --> 00:13:54.810
that's what it is. That's the end game. It's, it's that forever.

241
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.820
<v 6>[inaudible] uh,</v>

242
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.620
<v 1>special thanks to Simon Adler who, uh, who,</v>

243
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.840
whom ferried us through this whole project and also to John McClellan book.

244
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.380
The wild ones is, uh, the source of the story.

245
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.190
I am Robert Krulwich, Janet. Boom. Ron, we'll be back next time.
