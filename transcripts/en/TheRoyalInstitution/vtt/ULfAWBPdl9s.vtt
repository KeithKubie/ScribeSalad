00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.900
Energy!

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.420
What is it?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.520
If something’s gonna cause an object to
move,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.060
Whether tiny as a photon or as big as the
moon,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.300
We can calculate how much movement that could
be,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.020
And that number is a thing that we call energy.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.170
(Energy, energy)

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.020
And it’s measured in Joules.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.120
I don’t mean like precious jewels,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.900
I mean like James Joule

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.020
It can be stored in stretched elastic or the
movement of a ball,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.480
The repulsion of two magnets or the bonds
in chemicals,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.700
Between the apple and the earth, if an apple
wants to fall,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.710
The nuclei of atoms, mass of anything at all.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.010
But whenever there’s a change we shifted
energy,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.050
By pushing, heating, lighting or electricity.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.850
It will go to a new store, that’s what we
observe,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.470
‘Cos there’s a fundamental law that says
that energy’s conserved.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.860
It can’t be made or destroyed!

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.860
(Energy, energy)

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.520
There’s many ways it is stored!

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.980
Change means it’s shifted to new stores.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.540
And the energy after is the same as before.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.660
So let’s think about the energy of gases
in a tin,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.780
The particles are moving fast and bouncing
within,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.880
The faster that they move, the hotter that
they are,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
And a measure of their average speed is temperature.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.000
And since particles attract that will store
energy too,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.140
And means that it will take more work to make
the particles move,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.340
So every substance has its own specific heat
capacity,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.460
And different latent heat to change the state
it can be.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.960
It can’t be made or destroyed!

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.380
(Energy, energy)

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.420
There’s many ways it is stored!

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.200
Change means it’s shifted to new stores.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.640
And the energy after is the same as before.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.420
So what’s power?

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.470
Power is how fast you can move the energy,

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.550
how many Joules every second, or Watts.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.390
So if somebody asks you ‘Watts the unit
of power?’

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.620
You say ‘Yes it is!’

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.280
But in the real world, we find that energy
escapes,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.500
Like when your coffee gets cold, that’s
why we insulate,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.080
And air resistance and friction make cars
decelerate,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.810
So they are aerodynamic and then we lubricate.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.660
It can’t be made or destroyed!

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.600
(Energy, energy)

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.680
There’s many ways it is stored!

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.500
Change means it’s shifted to new stores.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.210
And the energy after is the same as before.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.870
It can’t be made or destroyed!

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.870
(Energy, energy)

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.500
There’s many ways it is stored!

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.940
Change means it’s shifted to new stores.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.800
And the energy after is the same as before.
