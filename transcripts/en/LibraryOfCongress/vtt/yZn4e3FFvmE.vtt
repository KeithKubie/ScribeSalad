&gt;&gt; My name is Mike [inaudible].

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.590 position:56%
I work with Kathy in the Education
Outreach at the Library of Congress.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.980 position:69%
We are thrilled to welcome you to the second
annual online conference for educators.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.370 position:58%
Our session today, Beyond the Bubble,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.630 position:70%
a New Generation of Historical Thinking
Assessments, will be recorded, as Kathy said.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.810
Without further adieu, I'd like
to introduce our presenter.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.310 position:72%
Joel Breakstone co-directs the Teaching with
Primary Sources program at Stanford University

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.350
and directs the Stanford
History Education Group.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.840
Along with Mark Smith and Sam
Wineburg, he led the development

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.670
of the group's assessment
website, Beyond the Bubble.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.740
He received his PhD from Stanford
Graduate School of Education.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.540 position:56%
Before coming to Stanford, he taught
high school history in Vermont.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.050
Welcome, Joel, and take it away.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.750 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Michael, I really appreciate it.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.870
Good evening, everybody.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.860
It's a pleasure to be joining
you here virtually.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.530
I'm looking forward to the session.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.020 position:72%
And what we hope to do, I hope to do, during
the course of this session is to introduce you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.390
to the materials that we've made
available on Beyond the Bubble,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.330
and also to talk about how you
might use them in your classrooms.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.590
My background is I was a
high school history teacher

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.550 position:61%
in the per block before I begin work is
different because the history teacher

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.040
in Bradford, Vermont, before
I began work at Stanford.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.010 position:69%
And when I was a history teacher in Vermont,
I had a lot of questions about how best

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.150
to have my students engage
in historical inquiry.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.200 position:72%
How could I have them understand that history
wasn't a single narrative, but it was a series

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.470 position:73%
of competing accounts, and that students needed
to wrestle with different pieces of evidence

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.760
and try and make sense of
what happened in the past.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.040
But I often found that that
was really hard to do.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.680
My students weren't always
ready to read historical text.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.410 position:59%
And it was often challenging for me as
a teacher to locate those materials.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.670 position:75%
And those questions were ultimately what led me
to go to graduate school at Stanford and to work

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.200
with people at the Stanford
History Education Group.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.630
And when I was arriving at the
Stanford History Education Group,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.760 position:73%
the group had just released a new curriculum,
called the Reading Like a Historian Curriculum.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.110
This is a screen capture of our
old sheg.Stanford.edu website.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.510
In the bottom right-hand corner
you can see the link to curriculum.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.200 position:63%
And so in the fall of 2009, we released
the Reading Like a Historian curriculum,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.820
which at that time was composed of
75 US history lessons which focused

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.180 position:75%
on having students engage in historical inquiry.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.820 position:58%
To ask them to read like a historian.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.310
To use the same historical
thinking skills that historians use

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.040 position:59%
when they engage with historical text.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.230
To have students consider
the source of the documents.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.170 position:72%
Who wrote it, when, why, and for what purpose?

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.480
And to think about the context
in which documents were created.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.570
And to corroborate across
multiple documents and to look

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.450 position:66%
for points of similarity and disagreement.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.700 position:64%
And to read closely to look at, what were
the words that the author chose to use,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.270
what words were left out, and
what content was left out.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.980
And the curriculum proved to be
popular and we got a lot of emails.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.980 position:69%
The most frequent request was -- or question
was, where is the world's history materials?

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.830
Since then, we have worked
to address that shortcoming

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.060 position:70%
and now have world history materials as well.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.860 position:58%
But the second most frequent question
was, where are the assessments?

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.550 position:67%
If I'm going to emphasize these
historical thinking skills in my classroom,

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.810 position:64%
if I'm going to ask my students to source
documents and to corroborate documents

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.690 position:70%
and to place them into context, how do I know
whether or not they can actually do that?

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.940
And we didn't have a really
good answer for those emailers.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.930
And at the same time, there was
a much broader conversation going

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.280 position:70%
on about a need for new types of assessments.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.740 position:58%
In 2009, President Barack Obama said,
I'm calling on our nation's governors

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.390
and state education chiefs to
develop standards and assessments

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.570 position:63%
that don't simply measure whether
students can fill in a bubble on a test,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.840 position:69%
but whether they possess 21st-century skills
like problem-solving and critical thinking.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.540
And he said that and we said,
yes, we absolutely agree.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.980 position:61%
Where are those assessments, especially
if you are a social studies teacher?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.170 position:67%
Where do you find the types of assessments?

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.380
And we didn't have a clear answer.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.580
What we were interested in doing
though was to create new types

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.300 position:61%
of forms of assessments, in particular.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.170 position:72%
We thought that there was a need for new types

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.760 position:69%
of assessments moving beyond multiple-choice
questions and also types of assessments

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.950
that teachers could use for
formative assessments.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.660
And what I'd like to do is just
take a moment to talk briefly

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.160
about what your thoughts are
about formative assessment.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.230 position:56%
So when you hear the term "formative
assessment," what comes to mind?

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.680 position:66%
So seeing some of these initial responses.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.410 position:70%
So the notion of having quick informal checks

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.780 position:58%
on student understanding is certainly
a big piece of formative assessment.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.310 position:58%
End process assessment, so trying to
gauge student learning along the way.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.020 position:64%
During the course of instruction or unit,
the types of assessments you want to do

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.830 position:66%
in preparation for a summative assessment.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.110
And I think that that comment
is also really important.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.480 position:70%
About that ultimately formative assessment is
used to inform our instruction as teachers.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.320
That we can gather data from
formative assessments

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.440 position:58%
to shape what we do next as teachers.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.320 position:58%
And to inform students about what
they need to do, to do better, right.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.630 position:73%
If we have a clear goal set out, how do we help
the students to understand what they need to do

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.730
to ensure that they can meet
that end-product goal?

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.410
And there is an enormous amount
of material out there teaching --

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.660 position:56%
talking about formative assessments.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.740 position:66%
If you go on to Amazon, you can find no
shortage of books and instructional guides

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.680
about making assessment happen
in your classrooms.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.540 position:63%
But if you're a history social studies
teacher, there aren't a lot of materials

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.670
that are providing actual
assessments to use formatively.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.970
And that's what struck us.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.870
When we -- and we weren't the only
ones who were struck by the lack

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.450 position:64%
of strong formative assessment materials.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.030 position:61%
Former Secretary of Education, Arne
Duncan, wrote, not enough is being done

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.840
to use high-quality formative
assessments to inform instruction

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.740
in the classroom on a daily basis.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.740 position:58%
Too often teachers have been on their
own to pull these tools together.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.240 position:69%
And we've seen in the data, the quality of
formative tools has been all over the place.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.880 position:70%
So we were interested in creating assessments
that focused on historical thinking skills

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.800 position:64%
and could be used for formative purposes.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.500
So we were wanting to make
historical thinking assessments.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.640
And we wanted to make materials
that could be used formatively.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.170 position:66%
At the same time, we joined the Library of
Congress's Teaching with Primary Sources.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.660 position:73%
We knew that we wanted the materials that would
be the basis for these assessments be drawn

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.480
from the world's largest
library, the Library of Congress.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.540 position:56%
But what we wanted to do was to have
an idea of what were the assessments

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.570
that were already available to
history social studies teachers.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.790
And we really saw them as existing
on a continuum of complexity.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.920
At one end of the spectrum
are multiple-choice questions.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:23.750 position:64%
Which are easy to give and easy to score,
but they're not the best tool necessarily

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.680 position:73%
for measuring all the types of ways of thinking
we'd want our students to be able to do.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.170
So at the other end of the spectrum
are document-based questions.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.480 position:72%
Which are really rich tasks that asks
students to read a series of primary documents

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:45.360 position:70%
and to use them to construct an analytic
essay in the course of usually about an hour.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.890
Their complexity though can also
make them slightly imprecise.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:54.080 position:56%
Sometimes it can be hard to know why
a student who struggled on a DBQ.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.710 position:72%
In addition, they're not the best tool for
formative assessment because they take a while

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.840
for students to complete and even
more time for teachers to score.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.420 position:59%
Similarly, multiple-choice questions
are not always the best formative tool

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:12.540
because they don't give us a lot
of feedback about student thinking.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.240 position:72%
And so we wanted to try to fill this middle
range of trying to make something more complex

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.660
than a multiple-choice question
but less time-consuming than a DBQ.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:28.940 position:64%
Something that could be used more readily
in a history classroom on a daily basis

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.750 position:73%
to give teachers feedback, as we've describe,
that could inform instruction and could be used

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.650
as a gauge of learning in process.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.010 position:59%
And so rather than describing those in
more detail, I'd like to show you one

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.290 position:58%
of the assessments that we have made.

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:49.660 position:61%
This is an assessment that focuses very
specifically on the skill of sourcing,

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:55.250 position:70%
and particularly whether or not students will
pay attention to the date of the document.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.230
So this image, present students
with this painting,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.080
which the title of it is "The
First Thanksgiving, 1621."

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.310
It is from 1932.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:09.210
And the author is -- or rather
the artist is JLG Ferris.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.110 position:63%
And the question is, this painting helps
historians understand the relationship

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.540
between the Wampanoag and
the Pilgrim settlers in 1621.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.890
Do you agree or disagree?

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.530
Briefly support your answer.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:25.470 position:72%
What do you think would be some common student
mistakes if they were given this assessment?

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:33.240 position:69%
What would be common students mistakes you
think your students might make in responding

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.490 position:56%
to this assessment that focuses on
the date of the document and whether

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.040 position:64%
or not students will attend to the dates?

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.450 position:70%
Yeah, so these responses are right on target.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:48.570 position:66%
Point out what are some of the most common
types of responses that we would see.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:56.080 position:73%
A lot of students will repeat back content that
they have learned previously and really focus,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:05.110 position:73%
more than anything, on the content of the
document, rather than noticing the date at all.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.240
And so this is the most common
student response we've seen.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.770
We have now piloted this with
thousands of students and this type

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.800
of response is the most frequent.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.010 position:67%
A student wrote "true," because you can see
how they're interacting with each other.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.220
Without any picture, you couldn't
really see how Wampanoag Indians

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.320 position:59%
and the Puritans interacted with each.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.510 position:67%
Essentially, a picture is worth 1000 words.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.330 position:66%
If you didn't have this picture, how could
you know anything about what happened

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:34.510 position:61%
between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag?

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:42.130 position:58%
In addition, we see students who have
a very different type of response.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.060 position:63%
This student wrote, as soon as the
settlers arrived, there's mass curiosity

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.600 position:59%
which turned into violence and hatred.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.320
There is ever such a party
between the two peoples.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.700 position:64%
They couldn't even understand each other.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.470 position:67%
So clearly this student has a more critical
vision of American history and has a notion

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:04.600
that there was conflict between
the Native Americans and Europeans.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.460
But really there are in many ways,
the two responses are very similar.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.650
Because in both cases the student
has ignored a crucial detail,

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:18.520 position:73%
which is the date of the document, and has not
acknowledged some of the limitations that exist

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:27.090 position:75%
with using a document that was created more than
three centuries after the event that it depicts.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.690 position:70%
At this point, sometimes people ask, well,
why not just make a multiple-choice question?

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:36.290
What is the value-added of having
students write short responses

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.410
as they complete one of these task?

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.800 position:59%
And what we think is that the short
responses, even a couple of sentences,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:49.180 position:72%
provide really useful information for us as
teachers to inform our next steps in teaching,

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.980 position:69%
and gives us really good detail --
detailed information about student thinking.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.310
So, for instance, this student,
they rejected the sources.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.060 position:66%
So if this was a multiple-choice question,
this student would've gotten full credit,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.420
because they have said it
was not a useful source.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.280 position:67%
But there are some issues in the reasoning.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.820
So the student wrote, painted
by a white person from Europe,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.230 position:73%
of course they would be extremely biased in
order to bring to light a highly-positive image

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.850
of the Europeans as to excite
more foreign expeditions,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:23.660 position:73%
because Indians looks so friendly and thankful.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.490
So on the one hand, the student
has made some assumptions.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:33.590
Assuming that JLG Ferris must
be a white person from Europe.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:41.470 position:72%
And also appears not to have paid attention to
the date of the document, given that they seem

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:47.010 position:63%
to think that in 1932, there are efforts
to "excite more foreign expeditions."

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.150
And so that's problematic.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.120 position:61%
However, on the other hand, the
student has done something really good,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.520 position:67%
because they at least are paying attention
to the fact that the author of the document

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.880 position:61%
or the artist of this document
influences the content of the document.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.360 position:72%
So if this is my student, I can say, I'm
really glad that you're thinking about the way

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.930
in which the author influences the
content of the document, however,

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:20.140 position:72%
we also need to think carefully about when the
document was created and we want to make sure

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.880 position:72%
that we don't jump to conclusions about
authors of documents without more information.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.050
And so that way, it really could
serve a more formative purpose.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.180 position:67%
We also see some really polished responses.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.270
This was a response actually
written by an eighth grader.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:45.020 position:64%
And she wrote, this painting was drawn
311 years after the actual even happened.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.370 position:67%
There's no evidence of historical accuracy,

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.670
as we do not know if the artist
did research before painting this,

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:58.110 position:66%
or if he just drew what is a
stereotypical Pilgrim and Indian painting.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:04.360 position:61%
This is a really nice response, because
the student has done two things.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.800 position:63%
Both identified the limitation of the --

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:14.300 position:63%
of using a document that's created three
centuries later, but has also noted

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.160 position:61%
that if we knew more about what the
artist had done in preparing for the --

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.330 position:75%
to create this document, we might be better able

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:26.580
to evaluate its usefulness
as a historical source.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.710 position:72%
What's striking is that it is written by an
eighth grader and it's something we found over

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.990 position:75%
and over again is that there is not a clear
developmental trajectory for a student's ability

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.850
to engage in historical thinking.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.710 position:66%
What we found, perhaps not surprisingly,
is students who have been taught to engage

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.880
in historical thinking are able
to do so, and those who haven't,

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.630 position:70%
don't engage in historical thinking as often.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:57.700 position:66%
We've seen fifth graders who've
constructed similar responses as this one,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.740 position:69%
not quite as polished in terms of the prose,

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:06.010
but accurately identifies the
issue associated with the date.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.430 position:67%
In contrast, we've also worked with twelfth
graders who have taken AP US History

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.700 position:63%
who have not done quite as well, in part

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.050
because that wasn't the focus
of the class they were taking.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.610
But what students see is
that -- what this shows is

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.960
that students need this type
of direct instruction.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.830 position:73%
This particular assessment focuses on sourcing,
other assessments focus on content knowledge.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.990 position:70%
We have an assessment that is about the Civil
Rights Movement and it asks students to look

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.580
at two different documents and
to reason about which came first.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.480
Others focus on contextualization.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.890
And others focus on corroboration.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:51.140
The assessments are all available
on BeyondtheBubble.Stanford.edu.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:58.280 position:75%
In order to download PDFs of the assessments,
you need to create a free login for the website.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.430
The same login works for Beyond the
Bubble and also our other website,

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.970 position:59%
the Stanford History Education Group's
main website, sheg.Stanford.edu,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:10.230
to download Reading Like
a Historian lesson plans.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:14.290
And you can do that on the
lower half of the page.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.150 position:63%
The assessments themselves are available
on the tab that says "assessments."

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.670
And when you click on that,
you'll be taken to this page.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.010 position:59%
The assessments are organized by type.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.650 position:75%
So we have multiple versions of each assessment.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:32.250 position:69%
So we have additional versions of this same
Thanksgiving assessment where there is a gap

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.220
in time between the document
and the event that it depicts.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:42.290 position:70%
And if you click on to the assessment,
you're taken into the assessment page itself,

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:49.930 position:73%
where there is a description of the assessment,
there is a link to Common Core standards

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:56.640 position:56%
that are addressed by the particular
assessment for the social studies.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.430
And on the right-hand side
there is a navigation bar.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:04.630 position:73%
There's also a link to the PDF of the document,
and also a link to where the document lives

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.500
in the digital archives of
the Library of Congress.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.260
For each of the assessments, there
is a short three-level rubric.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.810 position:58%
Three is proficient, students have
absolutely gotten the answer correct.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.000 position:72%
Two or emergent, is students have done
something good but it's not all the way there.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.100 position:75%
Or, one, basically they have missed the boat and
have engaged in a variety of common mistakes.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.150
And for each of those we have
links to sample student responses,

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:40.090 position:70%
the types of responses we see most frequently
when we have piloted those materials.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:45.990 position:61%
And for those sample student responses,
there are these little blue thumbtacks,

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:53.500 position:75%
and if you roll over those thumbtacks, there are
short annotations about what we think is going

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.870
on with that particular response.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:04.300 position:69%
There is also a short streaming video that
goes along with each of the main assessments

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.400 position:59%
that talk about what we think is going

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:14.540 position:64%
on with this particular assessment and/or
how you might use it in your classrooms.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:20.740 position:63%
Which -- and then finally, there is also
a section where you can leave comments

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:28.660 position:63%
and you can also see what other teachers
have said about these particular tasks.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.900
The question though is about a
classroom implementation, or,

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.750 position:75%
what do I do with these things, these new tests.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.680 position:75%
How might I go about using them in my classroom?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.100
And so it's an excellent
question and it's something

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.150 position:61%
that we have spent time thinking about.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:51.620
Because there are a variety of
ways in which it can be difficult

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.420
to implement new types of
assessments in classrooms.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:02.410 position:66%
One issue that we've seen come up is that,
as teachers, we often rush to rubrics.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.410 position:67%
When we give an assessment to our students,
we think that we need to give a grade to it

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.040 position:73%
and we need to put a score into our grade book.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.050 position:58%
And students often feel that as well.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:18.070 position:61%
We spent a lot of time with teachers in
San Francisco Unified School District,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.850 position:61%
that they began to use these materials.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.210 position:56%
And students would ask if they
didn't get a grade back, they'd say,

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.410 position:58%
well, what about that quiz yesterday?

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.960
What was my grade on the quiz?

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.930 position:72%
And sometimes that gets in the way of what the
tasks actually tell us about student thinking

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:38.090
or the information we could use to
inform our next steps as teachers.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.940
Similarly, they don't always line
up with the curriculum demands

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.850
of -- that we are working under.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.240
And these types of assessments that
focus on more than just content,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.730
also historical thinking skills,
aren't always perfectly aligned.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:20:00.610 position:67%
And even if they are shorter than a DB2, if
you have 150 students in your course load,

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:08.620 position:72%
it still takes a substantial amount of time to
grade one or two sentences from 150 students.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:15.900 position:61%
And so we're looking for ways to use
these materials in a range of contexts.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.060 position:56%
And so there are a few things that
we saw as we've worked with teachers

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:26.710 position:72%
where teachers have integrated these materials
in ways that we found particularly productive.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.590 position:67%
So one is to introduce historical thinking.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.700 position:56%
One teacher that we worked with gave
students the Thanksgiving assessment

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.700 position:64%
at the very beginning of the school year.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:42.170 position:75%
And she was pretty confident that students would
ignore the date, and then she could use this

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.500 position:67%
as an introduction to the idea of sourcing.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.870 position:59%
And so she gave this task in the first
week of school, and as she expected,

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.330 position:66%
almost everybody missed the date entirely.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:58.150 position:67%
Instead of collecting those assessments and
grading them, she just had students hold

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.410
onto them and asked students,
how many of you noticed the date?

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.990
Very few students had.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.630
And she then said, look,
in this class, this year,

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.130 position:56%
we are going to really pay
attention to the dates of documents.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.750
We're going to pay attention to
source information of documents.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.460
And that's why it's important.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.010 position:58%
Because if you don't, you might think

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.800
that a document created 300 years
later was a really useful source.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.420
And that was an introduction
to the idea of sourcing

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.020 position:75%
with those students, not a grade in any fashion.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.560 position:73%
But it also gave her some immediate information

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.140
about what her students were
actually able to do.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:44.160 position:58%
There was an immediate feedback about
their abilities to source documents.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.980 position:56%
There's also the possibility that we
can monitor student understanding.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.220 position:75%
That we can get feedback on how well students
are using these -- understanding these concepts.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.840 position:75%
So, for instance, the same teacher who used that
Thanksgiving assessment during the first week

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.990
of school, followed it up with this
assessment a couple of weeks later.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:10.530 position:66%
And it is the same assessment, but it
uses this alternative image of the signing

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:16.980 position:63%
of the Mayflower Compact from 1859, more
than 230 years after the actual event.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.840
And it asks the same question.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:25.170 position:67%
In this case, given that she had introduced
the idea and had gone over the response

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.600 position:63%
with students at the beginning of the
year, she then graded students responses

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.470
on this particular task,
because she felt confident

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.240
that at this point students should
have gained that understanding.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:46.400 position:66%
And so it was a way to monitor that their
understanding of this topic going forward.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.970 position:63%
And you are not limited by the
assessments that we have on our website.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.390 position:64%
Our hope is that the teachers will create
their own versions of these assessments

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:02.330 position:66%
and that really they are shells that you
can fill in with other types of documents.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.450 position:64%
The Thanksgiving assessment just requires
a document where there is a gap in time

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:11.270 position:58%
between the events -- or the document
and the event that it depicts.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.790
Some of our favorite Library
of Congress websites

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:20.790
to locate materials are the
Library's homepage, LOC.gov.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:27.530 position:58%
The teachers' page, it has really an
incredible array of materials as well

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:32.950 position:70%
that have been carefully curated for
teachers, really document sets, lesson plans.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.700 position:70%
Some of the best materials that are available

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:42.460
on the Library's site have been
put together on the teachers' page.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:48.880 position:73%
And one of my favorite sites is
chroniclingAmerica.LOC.gov, which had thousands

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:56.240 position:75%
of historic newspapers that are fully searchable
by keyword and by date and by location.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:02.630
And so you can then download
full PDFs of the newspaper page

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.990 position:58%
from that includes your search terms.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:11.780 position:64%
A really fantastic resource to be able to
show students a whole range of documents

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.000
from all across the United States.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.480 position:70%
For world history teachers, the World Digital
Library, it's an incredible resource that is

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:25.860 position:72%
in partnership with cultural institutions all
around the world with the Library of Congress.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.720
And so and it continues to
expand rather rapidly.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.440 position:56%
So really great resources from all
across the world, and you can search

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.900 position:70%
for both time period and geographic location.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.940
And then a more recent addition
is Americanarchive.org,

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.740 position:67%
which is a partnership with WGBH in Boston.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:54.140 position:58%
And it is an archive of public radio
and television materials, broadcasts.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:59.470
So really some outstanding
resources to locate there as well.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:06.210 position:64%
And our hope is that teachers will be
able to use the assessments we've created

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:13.270 position:69%
as a jumping off place and create new
versions of these same types of assessments.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:20.490 position:61%
And then the final way that we envision
these materials being used is as a way

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:25.040 position:59%
to approach broader historical topics.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:33.610 position:73%
And we saw teachers do that with another one
of our assessments which focuses on this image.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:38.230 position:70%
How many people are familiar with this image?

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:42.390 position:56%
And/or how many of you have a poster
of this image in your classroom?

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.950
Lots of people, right.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:52.230 position:56%
A really iconic image from the Great
Depression and from the Dust Bowl,

00:25:52.230 --> 00:26:01.010
this image Migrant Mother taken
by Dorothea Lange in 1936.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:08.680 position:64%
And we wanted students to think about the
context in which the image was created.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.860 position:58%
Because often we forget that there
is a photographer behind photographs.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:20.890 position:67%
Often it becomes simply students see
photographs as windows into the past rather

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.870 position:64%
than as a product of a particular person.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:29.200 position:73%
And Dorothea Lange was employed by the federal
government to build support for their programs.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.090
And we wanted students to think
about this image in that context.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:39.200
And so we presented students with
this image, the source information,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.770 position:72%
the title Migrant Mother, 1936, by Lange, and
she took the photograph in Nipomo, California.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:49.680 position:73%
And then we told students that the Resettlement
Administration was one of FDR's agencies

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.350 position:59%
that helped people from the Dust Bowl.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.390
The agency hired photographer
Dorothea Lange to take pictures

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.420 position:66%
that would build support for its programs.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.940
This photograph was one of
several that Lange took

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.590 position:63%
of migrant farm worker Florence
Thompson and some of her seven children.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.130 position:70%
Then we asked students a series of questions.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.480
First, why might the background
information above lead you

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.920 position:64%
to question the photograph's reliability?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.100 position:67%
Two, what is one feature of the photo that
might lead you to question its reliability?

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.390
Explain your reasoning.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:21.460 position:61%
And three, what is one thing that
you'd want to know about Dorothea Lange

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.210
or how she took this photo to
better determine its reliability?

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.780
This would help me determine the
reliability of the photo because:

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.330 position:73%
we provide students with this sentence starter.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:37.070 position:70%
And so when we worked with teachers in San
Francisco, they found some immediate patterns

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.540
in terms of feedback from
students based on their responses.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:46.100
Some student responses showed
some fundamental misunderstandings

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.770
in terms of historical knowledge.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.600 position:56%
This student said that the Dust Bowl
did not take place in California.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.630 position:59%
The Dust Bowl was a Midwestern crisis
that destroyed countless acres of land

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.820
and did not understand clearly
that many migrants ended

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.060 position:72%
up in California as a result of the Dust Bowl.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.780
Other students put together
more sophisticated responses.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.340 position:61%
This student wrote, the photo was taken
in order to gain support for agencies

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.690 position:56%
that helped people in the Dust Bowl.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:17.210 position:73%
This could mean that the photo is fake and only
made so that you feel sorry and want to help.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.160
This is like propaganda.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.010
A really nice response.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.800
Both indicating that there is a
possibility that the author's --

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.350 position:64%
that the photographer's motivation
influenced the content of the photograph,

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:35.970 position:73%
but also tempering the response so as not to
claim too much based on the evidence available.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.360 position:59%
With the second question, we again see
some slightly problematic responses.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.070 position:58%
This student wrote, Florence Thompson
shows her emotion in the photograph.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.810
She should have been happy about
moving away from the Dust Bowl.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.820 position:56%
Again, a little problematic in
terms of misunderstanding the plight

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.910
that faced many migrants once
they arrived in California.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:01.830 position:75%
Other students had more sophisticated responses.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.600 position:58%
One feature of the photo that lead me

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.550
to question its reliability is the
way her hand is posed on her face

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.830
and the way her children
are both hiding their faces.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.000
It looks posed and artificial.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.530
The photo doesn't look candid
like a candid honest shot.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:23.570
Again, raising the possibility
that there might have been a way

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:27.090 position:63%
in which Lange had posed the photograph.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:31.920
What was striking though in using
the assessment in the classroom was

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.720 position:64%
that the teacher found many students were
ready to simply reject the assessment.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.140
They did not want to consider
possible limitations.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.980 position:64%
They simply wanted to reject it entirely.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:50.600 position:75%
Which the teacher found slightly troubling and
wanted students to think a little more carefully

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:58.650 position:67%
about the way in which, even if Lange might
have been paid to take this photograph,

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.980 position:61%
that it still provides useful evidence.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.230
And she complicated their
vision of the photograph

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:11.350 position:69%
by providing outtakes from the same session.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.890 position:56%
So these are the additional images
that Lange took of Florence Thompson

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:20.900 position:58%
and her family in Nipomo, California.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:27.460 position:75%
And asks them whether or not given this
additional information, that would shift the way

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.400 position:61%
that students thought about the images.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:37.330 position:63%
A couple of students were willing to say
that this shifted their understanding.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.910 position:64%
They were a little more willing to think
of the Migrant Mother as a useful source.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:46.540 position:63%
But many students stuck to their guns
and said, nope, I think it's all staged.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.100
Which the teacher was troubled by.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:54.150 position:58%
And asked the students, how many of
you have ever posed for a photograph?

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.300 position:58%
And when they were reluctant to raise
their hand, she said, well, you know,

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.660 position:61%
all of you took school photographs, so
clearly you have posed for photographs.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:06.490 position:75%
Is that not a useful piece of evidence about you

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:11.570
at a particular time and
place, even if it is posed?

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:17.710 position:70%
And as the conversation went on, the students
and the teacher had engaged in a conversation

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:24.150 position:64%
about what makes a piece of evidence
useful and what makes a photograph useful

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.570 position:61%
or not in terms of historical evidence.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:33.050 position:66%
And although I'm not sure that the teacher
was aware, but in the process, the teacher

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:37.980 position:64%
and the students had entered into a
conversation that is a historical debate.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.750
A historian, James Curtis, has
written about this image of Lange,

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:49.570
and he has argued that Lange had
indeed staged this photograph.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:56.010 position:66%
In contrast, Errol Morris, the documentary
filmmaker, has argued against it,

00:31:56.010 --> 00:32:02.910 position:63%
and has challenged this notion that
indeed Lange had staged the photographs.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:07.450 position:61%
And Errol Morris wrote, is the argument
that Lange should not have intended

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:13.510 position:73%
to produce any effect, none whatsoever, isn't
the issue a deeper, far more problematic issue?

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.810
Mainly, did the photographer
intent to deceive the viewer?

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.930
Was he or she using photography
as sleight-of-hand?

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.800
Is the problem intentions?

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.250
But if so, how could one do
away with them altogether?

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:29.530
We read correctly or incorrectly
a photographer's intentions

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.650
into every photograph we see.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.570
We also imagine the intentions
of the people in a photograph.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:39.920
We see intentions everywhere.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.930
A very deep historical question
being raised here.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:48.570 position:69%
And in the process of this short assessment,
the teacher had brought his students

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:58.250 position:64%
into this much larger frame of wondering
about how to use photographs as evidence.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.990
So a different way of thinking
about these assessments.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:10.650 position:63%
They could also be used on a unit test,
or as a exit ticket at the end of class.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:15.960 position:69%
Our hope is that they are flexible and that
they could be used in a variety of contexts.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.860 position:72%
And that as new types of assessments, students
are going to be practiced in using them

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:26.510 position:72%
and opportunities to understand what are these
types of questions and what do they look like

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:31.720 position:61%
and what our expectations are for the
way that they are going to answer them.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.340
Please note down our contact,
my contact information.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:42.410 position:64%
We spend a great deal of our time sending
materials out into the wilds of the web,

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.880
and we'd love to hear how
teachers are using these materials.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:51.670 position:73%
And if you have any questions or comments about
them, please feel free to reach out to us.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:57.140 position:72%
If you're interested to know when new
materials are going live on Beyond the Bubble,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:02.590
the best place to find out is on
our Twitter or our Facebook pages.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.220 position:59%
Sorry the @ symbol is blocked off
there on the sheg underscore Stanford.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.390
We don't send out emails, but we
do post on Twitter and Facebook

00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:12.670 position:58%
when we have new assessments go live.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:17.030 position:64%
We have quite a few assessments that will
be going online in the coming months,

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.190
so if you want to know when those
go on, check out those posts.
