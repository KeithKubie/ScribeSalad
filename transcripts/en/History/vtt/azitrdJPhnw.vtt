00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.330
- Hi, my name is Levi Kring.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.500
and we're at my shop
Hick Forge.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.540
Built it all by hand.
Let me show you around.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.210
So this is my Shopsmith.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.580
I got it
from my wife's grandfather.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.830
It was his pride and joy,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.290
and now it's my pride and joy.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.790
So this is the motor.
It has a bunch

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.330
of different attachments to it.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.500
The way it's set up right now,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.830
it's set up for a lathe,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.790
and if you slide the motor
on this side,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.420
it connects to the band saw.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.120
It's got other attachments
for a table saw

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.880
for a miter,
for a horizontal drill press.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.040
It's pretty much a multi-tool,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.710
all-in-one kind of a deal.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.250
- Hey, I'm Ashe Cravenock,
and this is my home forge.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.290
It's my propane forge.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.620
It's what
I've been using lately

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.380
for just making smaller knives,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.620
hunters,
and every day carry stuff.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.120
This right here is
my first charcoal forge.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.830
Me and my dad built that
when I was about ten years old,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.540
and that's what I learned
to forge in.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.120
I recently built
this sword forge.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.380
Charcoal once again.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.830
I got some orders
for some swords

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.920
and have no way
of heat treating them.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.420
- I run a coal forge.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.040
I don't use propane
or anything like that.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.830
I like coal
because you can pretty much

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.460
do anything you need to in it.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.120
My forge is ran off
a hair-dryer for now

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.080
until I get a bellows built.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.120
And so it pumps air
in underneath here

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.750
into the air chamber,
and air just blows up top here.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.540
And then it just heats up
the coal and simple.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.790
Just keep the fire going.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.880
Here's my grinder.
I built this.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.790
Got some plans
off the internet.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.380
The wheels are
skateboard wheels.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.290
It's running off of
a five-horsepower motor

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.710
which is way over kill,
but it's what I had.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.580
So it works good.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.620
That's pretty much it
for the tour of my shop,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.080
and, uh, thank you
for watching.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.750
And welcome to Hick Forge.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.750
- This is my anvil.
It was given to me

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.500
by a old blacksmith
in Truth or Consequences,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.120
the town near here.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.960
I've tied sisal

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.000
and leather
around some parts of it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to kind of dampen
the noise a little bit

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.670
'cause it gets loud in here
and I don't like

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.460
having to wear big earphones

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.040
in the summer.
It gets hot.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.290
This is my belt grinder.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.960
I just recently
got it actually.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.620
It's my first piece
of real equipment,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.290
and, man, it's a game changer.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.120
I was using files,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.170
and, like, this little thing
that sometimes spun around.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.250
So now I can actually move
some material.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.210
Thanks for visiting the forge,
and it's time for me

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.380
to get back to work.
See you guys all later.
