Speaker 1:          00:00          We now begin chapter two which asks the question, what does a patient, it's a very interesting question. We're going to look for answers from a number of different angles. The first of which is the ancient history of patients. We've all evolved events that happened long ago continue to have consequences for medicine. Here are a few of them. Asymmetric division is something that happened in bacterial cells more than 3 billion years ago and that created the condition for the evolution of aging and probably also for the maintenance of the germline.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:39          stem cells are a great idea. They evolve to repair a multicellular organisms when multicellularity originated sometime between one and 2 billion years ago. However, they are pre adapted to become cancer cells. They contain some of our vulnerability to cancer. Retro viruses inserted into a protal immunoglobulin gene about half a billion years ago, 500 million years ago, and that started the evolution of the Vertebra adaptive immune system. Highly invasive placentas evolved in the shared ancestor of Orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans about 15 million years ago. They are associated with Preeclampsia, which is dangerously high maternal blood pressure during pregnancy and with the risk of metastatic cancer. So you can see that events occurring between 3 billion years ago and 15 million years ago continue to have implications for medicine. So let's begin to unpack these. We're going to return to these events in more detail. When we discuss aging cancer, adaptive immunity and parent offspring conflicts over parental investment. So first asymmetric division. This is the condition for the evolution of aging. The idea is that if in division one cell can be given the newer parts and the other cell of the older parts, the cell lineage with the older parts will die out and the cell lineage with the newer parts will persist. This mechanism has been confirmed in a bacterium eco lie that appears to divide symmetrically. It turns out it does not and it can explain the survival of the germ lines is the origin of life.

Speaker 2:          02:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:32          If division we're perfectly symmetrical, then it would be impossible for selection to distinguish between the mother and the daughter cell. They would both look identical. Both would be equally intact or equally damaged and the reproductive payoff from improving the maintenance of both would be equal. However, as soon as the reproductive payoff of maintenance becomes smaller in the mother cell than in the daughter, the mother reproduced, the daughter has not yet reproduced. The mother has the older parts of the daughter has the newer parts than aging will evolve as a cost of reproductive performance, so selection will improve the cell that has more payoff in terms of future reproduction.

Speaker 2:          03:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Let's take a look at this in eco lie. Here you can see the old poles on the cell are in red. The new polls are in blue as it goes through cell division. This becomes an old pole sell. This becomes a new poll sell. This sequence here leads to a new poll sell for at least two divisions. This one has been an old pool sell for at least two divisions, and if we follow this through, you can see a sequence of divisions over here. These are how long those lineages survived. You can see there's variation building up on the x axis. Here we have the consecutive number of old or new poll cell divisions. On the y axis we have the normalized growth rate and you can see that the ones with the new polls are growing faster than the ones with the old poles and their advantage is getting larger and larger. The ones with the old Poles are diverging and dying off faster. The more old poles accumulate. The second ancient vulnerability in patients is stem cells. Stem cells originated with multicellularity there a great innovation, but they have characteristics that predispose them to cancer. They retain the potential to differentiate and move that adapts them, pre adapts them to a cancerous lifestyle.

Speaker 2:          04:47          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:48          there are stem cells that are all over the body that are positioned to replace cells that were out in our discarded it, particularly in bone marrow, lungs, intestine and skin. Those are the tissues in which malignant cancer is most frequent.

Speaker 1:          05:07          The next ancient innovation that continues to have medical consequences is the evolution of the immune system. Adaptive immunity was acquired about 500 million years ago. Here is a portion of the tree of life showing the vertebrates up here. And this is the transition between Cephalic chordates and ag Nathans. So these would be lampreys and hagfish and stuff. Little coordinates are lancets and fee oxys, things like that. And at this point, a virus inserted itself into a protocol immunoglobulin gene and it brought with it transpose on machinery and that is what allows lymphocytes to generate diverse antigen receptors to recognize and to repel antigens. So that didn't come fully formed. It required subsequent evolution. But it's interesting that we got part of our ability to resist viruses from essentially a virus and transpose them.

Speaker 2:          06:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:13          So the adaptive immune system evolved at that point with the invasion of a transposable genetic element. This is the transposable genetic element. This is the immunoglobulin gene here, the transpose ace gene inserted into the middle of that immunoglobulin gene. It can be recognized by the fact that we can see this particular sequence in the receptor gene and the transpose ace jeans are now on separate chromosomes. So they're called rag one and rag two subsequent evolution has moved them to a separate chromosome. So that event built into the gene, the machinery that's needed to carry out the somatic recombination that generates antibody diversity. We will be going into that in some detail when we come to our discussion of defenses.

Speaker 2:          07:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:04          The next ancient event about 15 million years ago occurred when highly invasive placentas evolved. In the great apes here you can see a phylogenetic tree focusing just on the home and humidity and it shows that we are most closely related to chimpanzees and gorillas and then next to orangutans and the givens. And we know that in the givens out here they have shallow invasion of the endometrium. So when the fetal cells are forming the placenta, they do not go as deep into the endometrium and givens as they do in the other great apes and there's minimal remodeling of the spiral arteries and givens and there's extensive spiral artery remodeling in the rest of the great apes. So this deep extra villous trophoblast invasion and the extensive spiral artery remodeling that evolved there gives much greater control over the maternal blood supply by the fetus. You can see here fetal tissue invading into the endometrium. There is a spiral arteries are coming in here and they are being remodeled by stem cells from the fetus that can actually go in and control part of the diameter of the spiral artery.

Speaker 2:          08:29          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:30          so when a field stem cell is invading the intermediary and inserting itself into a maternal spiral artery, it is taking partial control of the pipe. Who's diameter determines the amount of food that the fetus gets?

Speaker 2:          08:45          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:46          that's a morphological example. With parados spring conflict, it gives the fetus and advantage early in life that it pays for with increased risk of metastatic cancer later in life.

Speaker 2:          08:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:01          Here is the age of some of the major features of human biology. In the purpose of this slide is to show you the different parts of our body evolved at very different points in time. We are a mosaic of features of very different ages, so metabolism is almost 4 billion years old. Multicellularity about a billion or vertebrate adaptive immune system, about half a billion. The placenta is about 190 million years old by Pete Elysium is about 7 million years old and are hairless skin are dark skin color, and our abundance sweat glands are two to 3 million years old. So the take home from this is that we are a mosaic of parts with very different ages.

Speaker 1:          09:50          Our own history contains quite a bit of complexity since we split off from the chimpanzees. The early hominids included Sahel anthropics probably already by peatal 7 million years ago. Australopithecines they flourished between about four and a half and two and a half million years ago whereby peatal they had smaller brains, they probably were frugivorous ate fruit, at least four species are known Australopithecus gave rise to and then overlapped with pair Anthropicene. That was about, oh, from three to 1 million years ago, roughly several species of per anthropics in homo coexisted. So there were times in our recent history when there were several hominids living at the same time and interacting with each other on the planet. Homo habilis use tools two and a half to one and a half million years ago, and homo erectus migrated out of Africa. So there was a hominid species that migrated out of Africa before homo sapiens. It colonized Asia and Europe. It used fire, it cooked it haunted and scavenged. It was also cannibalistic hand axes from homo erectus have been found in Spain from about 800,000 years ago. Homo sapiens evolved in Africa, emerged from Africa about a hundred thousand years ago, paused in the Middle East for 30 to 50,000 years and then spread out into Asia. And Europe will go into this in more detail

Speaker 1:          11:23          in Europe and Asia. We hybridized with neanderthals and Denisovans and we may have hybridized with unknown hominids in Africa within the last hundred thousand years. So we can trace that in our genomes and we can see that people who have been in Europe have neanderthal genes and people who remained in Africa do not.

Speaker 2:          11:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:47          So to summarize, every organism and tree has a history. Treats have different ages of origin. Organisms are mosaics of parts that have existed for different amounts of time. That has implications for their evolution. The older the trade, the harder it probably is to change it. That's not an absolute, but it is a tendency, a trend, things that can only evolve slowly, do constrain things that can evolve more rapidly. So the old thing set up a framework that constrains the further evolution of the more recent, uh, parts of the body. Some traits of medical significance are millions or billions of years old. And every part of the organism and its history is interacting with many of the other parts. So you have to see us as a dynamic organism existing with a framework of constraints, some of which are very ancient.
