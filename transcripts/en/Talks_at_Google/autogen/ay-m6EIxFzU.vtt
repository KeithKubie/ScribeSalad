00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.490
SETH: Welcome to
Talks at Google.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.107
So today, we have a special
guest with us, Zaria Forman.

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:16.440
My wife grew up with her, so
I've known her for a while.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.600
But I always remember a few
years ago a photo of her

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.840
in front of-- working on one
of her large-scale drawings

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.940
showed up on the
front page of Reddit

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.080
and created quite a buzz.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.980
I think seeing the
artist in front

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.360
of this giant work of
art, a big iceberg,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.460
was just really
visually striking.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.210
And I feel like the momentum
from that is still going,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.570
and she's fresh off
another sold-out show.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.350
Congratulations.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.850
So yeah.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.880
Here is Zaria Forman to
talk about her new work,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.820
and welcome.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.100
ZARIA FORMAN: Thank you.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.630
Thank you for that intro.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.590
Yes, my mic is on.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.200
OK.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.519
I'm really honored and
excited to be here today.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.010
Thank you, Phil,
for inviting me.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.593
Where are you?

00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:08.292
There you are.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.710
And Seth.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.780
And thank you all for coming.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.660
This is just, yeah, I'm
really thankful to be here.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.970
So I consider it
my life's mission

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.280
to convey the urgency of
climate change through my work.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.780
And to that end, I've
traveled to the polar regions

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.710
to capture this unfolding
story of ice melts

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.030
and also to the equator to
document the rising seas that

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.490
are a result of the ice melts.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.290
My drawings explore
these moments

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.670
of transition and
turbulence, but also

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.050
tranquility in the landscape,
allowing viewers like you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.550
to connect emotionally with
places that you might never

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.860
have the chance
to actually visit.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.220
And I choose to convey
the beauty of these very

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.570
remote regions as opposed to
the devastation in the hopes

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.979
that it will inspire
people to want to help

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.210
protect and preserve them.

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:16.280
To start out, I want to play
you something that I recorded

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.280
on the Antarctic Peninsula.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.370
It's a sound piece that just
premiered in my solo show

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.500
in Seattle, Washington.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.350
And I recorded it
in 2015, the winter

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.580
on the Antarctic Peninsula.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.340
And it's a really
subtle sound, so I

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.100
invite you to close
your eyes or just

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.830
relax in whatever way
feels comfortable for you.

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.816
[DRIPPING]

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:26.940
So this sound is fondly
referred to as ice crispies,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.110
as you might be able
to see if you squint.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.620
I've also heard it called bergy
seltzer and ice sizzle, which

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.130
I've adopted as my DJ name.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.690
But what it is is the sound of
ancient air meeting new air.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.320
It's the sound of
glacial ice melting

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.850
and these tiny
little air bubbles

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.044
that are trapped inside
of it breaking free.

00:03:51.044 --> 00:03:52.460
And also, there's
a whirring sound

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.251
which you may have
heard in the background,

00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.790
and those are gentoo penguins.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.420
So each of these tiny
bubbles popping open

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.460
contains a treasure trove of
information for scientists.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.020
And I recently met
with one of them

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.960
named John Higgins, who is
a professor of geosciences

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.820
at Princeton University.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.810
And Higgins and his
colleagues can basically

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.140
obtain the age of the ice
by studying these bubbles.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.890
And what they do is use very
careful chemical measurements

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.660
to reconstruct both the local
temperature and the ancient

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.930
atmosphere-- so basically, how
much carbon dioxide and methane

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.710
were there--

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.710
from the time when the ice
bubbles were locked inside

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.520
of the ice sheet.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.950
So the records
from these archives

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.050
show, basically, how our
climate has changed in the past

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.060
and what that might
portend for our future.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.270
So it's important information
that we need to know.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.350
And these ice bubbles
are hundreds of thousands

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.670
of years old.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.650
In this picture, I'm
holding a piece of ice

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.272
that's a million
years old actually,

00:04:58.272 --> 00:04:59.980
and he told me it was
a million years old

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.021
after he handed it to me.

00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:04.060
And I was just like, oh my god,
don't know melt in my hands.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.170
But actually, the results from
John's latest trip suggest he

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.550
collected ice that's 2 to
2 1/2 million years old.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.280
And it's no news
to any of us that

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.300
these massive ancient
cooling systems that we

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.530
have at our poles that can
take millions of years to grow

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.740
are rapidly melting
and that that could

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.952
have devastating consequences.

00:05:29.952 --> 00:05:31.660
And we know it actually
already is having

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.916
devastating consequences.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.320
There's all kinds
of horrible news

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.090
out there about climate change.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.920
There is the fact
that the past three

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.910
years have been the
hottest on record,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.940
or that the polar bear
population in the Arctic

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.032
is in rapid decline.

00:05:46.032 --> 00:05:48.490
And now we're faced with an
administration that is choosing

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.600
to ignore these problems.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.480
I mean, even just these last
two weeks felt like apocalyptic

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.206
to me.

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:55.330
I mean, I'm sure you've
heard about the earthquakes

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.761
and the hurricanes.

00:05:57.761 --> 00:05:59.260
And I was just in
Seattle last week,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.660
and there was literally
ash falling from the sky

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.340
from the forest
fires in Washington.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.320
And so yeah, bad
news, but I want

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.810
to switch gears and tell
you about an interview

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.650
that I read recently where Al
Gore is talking about how we're

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.070
doing in this battle against
climate change 10 years

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.580
after "An Inconvenient
Truth," his first documentary.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.809
And what he said actually
surprised me, which

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:25.100
is why I want to talk about it.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.570
He said even though we're
behind on the scoreboard

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.660
when it comes to climate change,
that the momentum has shifted

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.290
and that we're starting to win.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.820
And I think he's right.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.150
I think he's onto something
because we do actually

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.550
have a lot to celebrate.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.010
First, of course,
there's the Paris Accord,

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.860
which, even though the
US has pulled out of,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.930
I actually think that's
a good thing because what

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.910
it did was galvanize the
whole rest of the world,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.780
including most major
US corporations,

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.990
to reaffirm their
commitment to it.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.390
Obama managed to permanently
ban offshore drilling

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.240
in most of the Arctic
Ocean and important parts

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.610
of the Atlantic,
which is a huge win.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.090
Iceland and Costa Rica run
on 100% renewable energy.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.300
Solar power in Chile is selling
for half the price of coal.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.750
Even just in the
beginning of this year,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.410
the World Economic Forum let
us know that solar and wind is

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.420
either the same
price or even cheaper

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.170
than fossil fuels in
at least 30 countries.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.330
Nationwide, there's
a long backlog order

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.310
for electric cars.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.130
There are real
solutions that exist,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.050
and we're already starting
to see benefits of them.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.590
And I think it's a
pretty effective tactic

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.890
to emphasize the positive.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.390
A bombardment of terrifying
news which I just threw at you

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.800
is paralyzing, but focusing
on the positive I think

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.660
is empowering.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.930
So that's what I try
to do with my work--

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:04.420
to celebrate what is still
here and to give you,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.850
give viewers, the
sense that it is still

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.580
possible to do
something to protect

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.540
this earth that sustains us.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.170
So with that mission
in mind, my process

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.660
always begins by
traveling to these places

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.220
at the forefront
of climate change.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.840
And while I'm on site, I take
thousands of photographs.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.790
And then, back in
the studio, I work

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.490
from both my memory
of the experience

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.490
as well as the
photographs to create

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.130
very large-scale compositions,
sometimes 12-feet

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.190
wide like the one in this video.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.520
Occasionally, I'll reinvent
the water or the sky

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.080
or maybe change the
shape of the ice

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.510
just a little bit to create
a balanced composition,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.370
but I'd say 90% of the time
I'm depicting the exact scene

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.070
that I witnessed
because I want to stay

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.710
true to the landscape that
actually existed at that point

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.452
in time, which-- just something
to take note of-- is often very

00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:04.910
different by the
time I've finished

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.620
the drawing several
months later.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.040
So I begin with a really
simple pencil sketch

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.160
just so I have a few
major lines to follow,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.400
maybe the outline of the
iceberg and the horizon line.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.550
And then I typically jump in
pretty quickly with the color,

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.740
layering pigments
onto the paper.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.945
And I smudge everything
with my fingers and palms.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.284
I tend to break the pastel
into these sharp shards.

00:09:31.284 --> 00:09:32.450
Oh, I work with soft pastel.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.866
I should have told
you that first.

00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:36.390
It's basically like
charcoal but colors.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.400
So I'll break it into
these little sharp shards

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.190
that I can use to
render the finer

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.950
details on top of the
base layer of pigment

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.180
that I've already put down.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.050
And typical paper
used for soft pastel

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.030
has a lot of tooth, meaning
a very textured surface

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.380
so that it's able to absorb
as much pigment as possible.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.140
I actually prefer to work on a
much smoother paper than what

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.290
most pastel artists would
want because it allows

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.990
me to get those finer
details without the texture

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.932
of the paper getting in the way.

00:10:08.932 --> 00:10:10.390
The challenge with
this, though, is

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.830
that there isn't a lot of
room for error or reworking

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.400
since the paper can't
absorb so much pigment.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.580
But I honestly
enjoy this challenge

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.550
because I get so lost
in the tiny details

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.260
that I would just
never know when

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.660
to stop if the
pigment and the paper

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.510
didn't provide those kinds
of limitations for me.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.580
So I am aware that
most people can't

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.940
access many of these really
remote places that I draw.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.030
And so, in a lot of ways,
the environmental issues

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:48.050
there might seem remote and
disconnected from their lives.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.770
So that's one
reason why I choose

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.930
to work on such a large scale--

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.790
to recreate the wonder
of witnessing an iceberg

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.500
or a glacier up close.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.730
And I rely on other
specialists like scientists

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.060
to make rational,
data-driven arguments

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.000
for why we must take action
to protect our ecosystems.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.470
But through my work, I'm
trying to make an appeal

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.740
on a more elemental level.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.040
According to behavioral
psychologists,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.010
much of our decision-making
comes from our emotions.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.240
And I think art has
a special ability

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.640
to tap into those emotions.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.230
And it's not just
something I think.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.600
It's like scientifically
proven that it does.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.790
So when I make
these drawings, I'm

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.610
trying to create
immense images that

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.320
are just overflowing with
detail that draw you in

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.090
and transport you.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.420
An author named Elaine Scarry--
she's a Harvard English

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.620
professor-- wrote a book called
"On Beauty and Being Just."

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.580
And in it, she talks about how--

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.440
she suggests, I
should say-- that when

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.320
we witness something
really beautiful,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:11.190
be it a wave or a face
or a poem or a glacier,

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.570
that it causes in us what she
calls a radical decentering.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.140
And she says, quote, "When
we see a beautiful thing,

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.600
our own importance
is diminished.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.510
It is not that we cease to stand
at the center of the world,

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.220
for we never stood there.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.990
It is that we
cease to stand even

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.390
at the center of our own world.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.120
We willingly cede the
ground to the thing

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.810
that stands before us."

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.810
That is the exact
experience that I

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:43.460
hope to evoke through my work.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.260
So this last school year,
I gave a series of lectures

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.910
at Harvard University.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.980
And in my preparation
for my talks,

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.220
I was scrolling through their
environmental center's website

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.130
and looking at their
Climate Week from 2015.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.417
There were a bunch
of videos from it.

00:12:59.417 --> 00:13:01.750
And there was one that was
particularly compelling to me

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.430
that it featured
a father and son

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.760
duo, Bob Keohane
on the right, who's

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.410
the professor of International
Affairs at Princeton

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.230
University, and his son
Nat on the left, who

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.010
works on climate issues at the
Environmental Defense Fund.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.600
And one thing that stood out
to me that they both emphasized

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.240
was this notion of momentum--

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.520
the same momentum
that I think Al Gore

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.270
was talking about-- that for
there to be effective climate

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:33.580
policies, we need people and
parties from different arenas

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.510
to work together
in an ongoing way.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.720
So that's how I
see my work fitting

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.830
into the bigger picture.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.620
I just want to be part
of that conversation,

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.030
helping to generate momentum
and unity of purpose

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.690
across boundaries of
discipline and geography

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.550
and political affiliation.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.800
So I guess by sharing
these moments of stillness,

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.870
paradoxically I'm hoping
to help generate momentum.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.030
In their talk, I
also found it really

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.850
touching to see how
one Keohane had passed

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.870
the torch onto the other because
I think it taps into something

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.580
essential about climate change
work, which is its purview is

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.520
intergenerational.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.990
The work is about
passing the torch

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.750
and thinking ahead
several generations.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.130
And I think, perhaps,
I might be particularly

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.320
attuned to that dynamic
because of the debt

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.080
that I owe to my mother,
Rena Bass Forman.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.360
She was a fine art
landscape photographer.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.360
And in the last 10
years of her life,

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.690
her work focused on the Arctic,
and she passed that torch

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.940
on to me.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.510
My mother's love
of photography just

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.330
propelled her to
the most remote,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.170
far-flung places on the planet
that she could possibly find.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.110
And my family and I were
fortunate to join and support

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.840
her on those adventures
from riding camels

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.610
through Northern Africa to
mushing near the North Pole.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.585
She always said that she was
a polar bear in a past life,

00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:11.740
and I never doubted
that to be true.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.960
She could just
stay out for hours

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.320
on end with frozen eyelashes
and a giant smile on her face,

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.400
and the rest of my family was
like, I'm hungry and cold.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.530
But she just loved it.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:28.060
So in August of 2010
and '11, she and I

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.400
were planning an arctic
expedition together

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.610
to Greenland called
"Chasing the Light."

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.750
It was to be the second-ever
arctic expedition

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.790
with a mission of
creating art inspired

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.490
by the dramatic geography there.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:47.320
And the first was lead in
1869 by an American painter

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.180
named William Bradford.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.860
And what was unique
about that trip

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.500
was that its main purpose
was art as opposed

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.300
to science or
exploration, which is

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.980
what was happening in that day.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.720
So my mom thought,
well, wouldn't it

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.420
be fascinating to mirror
Bradford's journey

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.730
and travel up the northwest
coast of Greenland

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.200
to seek inspiration
from the same landscape

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.680
nearly 150 years
after Bradford had?

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.470
So she and I were in
the very early stages

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.660
of planning this
trip when she was

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.590
diagnosed with brain cancer.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.010
And the cancer
pretty quickly took

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.560
over her body and her
mind, and she passed away

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.300
six months later.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.660
But during those six
months, during those months

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:33.490
of her illness, her
dedication to the expedition

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.320
never wavered.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.900
And so it felt
like a duty to me,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.240
like I felt responsible
to carry out

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.620
this mission in her honor,
which I did in August of 2012,

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.960
leading a group of
artists and scholars

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.760
on a four-week expedition.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.240
My mother's affection
for the landscape

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.350
really echoed throughout my
own experience in Greenland,

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.400
and I felt both
the power but also

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.609
the fragility of the landscape.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:09.750
I mean, the sheer size of
the icebergs is humbling.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.050
And the ice fields, they
vibrate with movement

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.616
and sound in a way
that I never expected.

00:17:15.616 --> 00:17:17.490
That's what prompted me
to bring my recording

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.910
equipment on my
more recent trips

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.490
so I could bring
that back to you.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.420
And it's also why I decided to
expand the scale of my work--

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:32.200
to give viewers that same sense
of awe that I had experienced.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.570
The melting glaciers
in Greenland

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.850
are one of the largest
contributing factors

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.580
to rising sea levels,
which have already

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:44.230
begun to drown some of our
world's lowest-lying islands.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.390
One year after my
trip to Greenland,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.910
I decided to fly to
the Maldives, which

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.780
is the lowest and flattest
country in the entire world.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.730
And while I was
there, I collected

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:58.870
images and inspiration
for a new body of work--

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.290
drawings of waves
lapping along the coast

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.050
of a nation, a whole nation
that could be entirely

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.055
underwater within this century.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.560
While I was there
with my collaborators,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.270
we shared the concept
of our project

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.940
with children at the
Iskandhar Elementary School

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.180
at the nation's
capital called Male.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.250
And we basically
just invited them

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.540
to document their
landscape as it transforms

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.910
throughout their lifetime.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.820
And hopefully that can
help to bring awareness

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.520
to their island, which is
actually still very much

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.850
needed, surprisingly enough,
and also just help them

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.940
kind of inwardly,
emotionally process what

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.920
is happening around them.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.710
Last winter, I had
the honor of serving

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.230
as the artist-in-residence
aboard the National Geographic

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.180
Explorer in Antarctica.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.710
I have traveled to
many stunning places,

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:01.180
but Antarctica is just
in a category of its own.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.020
The ice just like
radiated sapphire blue,

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.082
as you can see in this
video, and it just

00:19:07.082 --> 00:19:08.320
took my breath away.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.720
It's what inspired
a whole body of work

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.110
that I just completed that
I worked on for the last 18

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.750
months.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:21.640
And I'll just show you a time
lapse of one of those pieces.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.830
It's called "Whale Bay."

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.750
It was inspired by a place
called Whale Bay that's

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.040
on the Antarctic Peninsula.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.220
And the bay is situated
near a glacier that's

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.160
calving icebergs into the sea
as all glaciers eventually do.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.690
But the wind and water
currents carry the icebergs

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.510
directly into the bay because
of where it's situated.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.850
And since the bay
is kind of shallow,

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.520
the icebergs will scrape
against the sea floor

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.640
and become what's called the
grounded, which basically means

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.010
they remain there until
they've melted completely,

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.210
which is a process that can
take years if the icebergs are

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:59.070
large enough like this one.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.210
And bays that enclose
icebergs like these

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.575
are called iceberg
graveyards, which to me just

00:20:05.575 --> 00:20:07.450
seems like a metaphor
for the bigger picture.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.540
I had the opportunity
to ride around

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.670
this bay for two hours
in a small zodiac boat.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.410
This is a video I took there.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.980
A zodiac is a little
rubberized like 12-foot boat.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.967
And you'll actually
start to see the iceberg

00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:24.550
on the right-hand
side come into view.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.008
That's the iceberg
from the drawing

00:20:26.008 --> 00:20:27.680
that you just saw me making.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.840
It's from a slightly
different angle.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.560
So if you don't recognize
it, it's not my fault.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.940
But yeah, we got to ride around
for two hours just weaving

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.430
around the most
intricately-sculpted,

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.580
glowing blue icebergs
I have ever seen.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.800
I mean, the longer
that they stay there,

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.880
the more the water and the wind
sculpts these blocks of ice

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.450
into just otherworldly shapes.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.670
And I shot like
thousands of photographs.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.520
At times, I had to just
force my camera into my lap

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.490
so I could simply be present and
take in the overwhelming beauty

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.760
of it all.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.420
And so I hope that my
drawings, as much as you

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.350
can see on these screens, can
offer you a similar experience.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.810
So this past October,
I had the opportunity

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.660
to see Antarctica from a
whole different perspective.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.830
NASA invited me to join them
on Operation Ice Bridge, which

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:31.000
is the largest airborne
survey of Earth's polar ice.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.580
We flew 12 hours
every single day

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.650
that the weather permitted
on the DC-8, which

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.180
has the most comprehensive
suite of instruments ever flown

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.110
on long-range flights,
including laser, radar,

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.500
an infrared sensor, digital
photography, and something

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.150
called a gravimeter that
houses Einstein's brain.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.400
It measures gravity somehow.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.384
I don't know.

00:21:57.927 --> 00:21:59.260
It was an incredible experience.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.240
It was humbling to
witness the science team

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.200
and aircrew's dedication
to their seriously

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.510
hard and grueling work.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.480
And the data collected
provides crucial information

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.830
about ice loss--

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.930
basically, what the
melting of ice sheets

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.070
could mean for sea level rise
and what the melting of sea ice

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:22.110
could mean for the entire
global climate system.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.480
This year, the
Antarctic sea ice loss

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.850
has been particularly swift.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.100
We even had to make some
last-minute modifications

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.250
to one of our flight plans to
account for the significantly

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.380
diminished sea ice.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.860
When NASA measured its
extent for this time of year,

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.900
it was at the lowest
level ever recorded

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.110
in reliable satellite history,
which dates all the way back

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.910
to 1979.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.690
And since that year,
since 1979, the planet

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.920
has been shedding massive
amounts of sea ice annually

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:59.170
that equal an area larger
than the state of Maryland.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:05.410
The scale of this loss is
difficult to comprehend.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.600
And similarly, my
sense of perspective

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.144
was completely warped
as we flew over the ice.

00:23:10.144 --> 00:23:11.810
And just to give you
an example of that,

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.760
this is a photo from one of our
flights over a glacier called

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.540
Land Glacier, and it covers
the equivalent of 54 football

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.470
fields in that photo.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.970
It's just, I mean,
it's crazy to me.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.450
It looks like a little crumble
of ice on the sidewalk.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:29.080
But that little blue crack
is probably 100 feet wide.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.930
So this past April,
I was actually

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.530
able to join NASA's Ice
Bridge team again on some

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.320
of their arctic
missions, and we flew

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.100
over ice sheets, sea
ice, and glaciers

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.770
in arctic Canada and Greenland.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:51.910
And it was just totally
thrilling to fly--

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.940
once again, only 1,500
feet above the ice.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.220
The instruments need
to be 1,500 feet,

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.849
so it's actually
pretty low for a plane,

00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:01.390
and you really get
to see the detail.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.730
And it was just
so exciting for me

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.300
to compare the ice to
its southern counterpart

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.020
but also just reconnect with the
science team and the aircrew,

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.590
and kind of chilling to
learn of some of their more

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:18.610
recent discoveries such
as a giant crack that

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.010
is forming in the
Petermann Glacier, which

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.850
could in the future--

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.940
this is a picture of the crack.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.050
So it could, if it
splits off the shelf,

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.690
mean a new ice island--

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.340
basically, a giant iceberg--

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.690
that's twice the
size of Manhattan.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:38.460
Findings from this close to
a decade now long project

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.960
are numerous and some of
them mind-blowing to me.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.020
For instance, they
found a canyon larger

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.747
than the Grand Canyon under
Greenland's ice sheet.

00:24:48.747 --> 00:24:50.580
Just like, we had no
idea that it was there.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.204
It was just hiding
under the ice sheet,

00:24:52.204 --> 00:24:54.510
bigger than the Grand Canyon.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:58.020
But the most significant
data from the project

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:03.930
have shown that the entire West
Antarctic Ice Sheet has likely

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.390
entered an unstable
state and might now

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.780
be in irreversible decline.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.650
And although the timing of
that retreat is unknown,

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.770
it's still a powerful
reminder that we've

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.881
entered a new era with
significant changes

00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:20.505
on the horizon.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.240
Our president has already
begun to defund NASA's climate

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.470
research.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.520
And the lead scientist at Ice
Bridge, named Nathan Kurtz,

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.820
recently emailed the
team and I to say, quote,

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.550
"In these uncertain times,
it is vitally important

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.500
that we reach the hearts
and minds of people

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.620
around the world to communicate
the importance of the work

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.490
that we are doing."

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.390
So I just want to
thank you for having

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.240
this opportunity to share not
only their really important

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.180
mission, but also my own work.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.090
And I hope that you'll
spread it as much as you can.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.090
And it's just an
honor to speak to such

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.180
an influential audience.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:09.090
So when I was in Greenland
back in 2012, that first trip,

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:13.560
I scattered my mother's
ashes amidst the melting ice.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.340
And now, she remains a
part of the landscape

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.890
that she loved so much even
as it, too, passes and takes

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.910
on new forms.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.550
Among the many gifts
that my mom gave

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:32.170
me was the ability to focus on
the positive rather than dwell

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.520
in the negative.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.520
And honestly, that
lesson has rarely

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.720
felt more necessary than now.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.280
And yes, it's become far more
challenging to stay positive,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.930
since January especially,
but I'm doing my best.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.580
And I encourage
others to do the same.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.470
And former Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.440
said at the most recent climate
change conference in Morocco

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.090
that action on climate change
has become unstoppable,

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:04.030
and he's absolutely right, and
those are the words that I just

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.620
keep reminding myself of.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.940
On our family travels, every
time that we came across

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.847
a really spectacular view,
my mom would do this thing--

00:27:17.847 --> 00:27:20.180
and I apologize in advance
because I'm going have to get

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:20.840
loud--

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.620
she would go, oh my god!

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:30.650
And that was a taste because
I sound exactly like her.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.630
But it was special.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.240
She saved it for only
the best of the best.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.700
And so it would
happen once, usually,

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.690
maybe twice if we were lucky,
on a four-to-six-week trip,

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.310
on each four-to-six-week trip.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.170
And so, every single time we
approached a really beautiful

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.010
view, my dad and my
sister and I would

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.215
glance at her wondering if it
passed the "oh my god" test.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:28:01.600
I try to uphold her reverence,
her legacy of drawing attention

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.320
to the beauty of
these remote places,

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.166
and I try to embody her
resolve and intrepidness

00:28:09.166 --> 00:28:14.560
I am so utterly grateful for
the time that I had with her

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.030
and also for the
time that we all

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.760
have to appreciate
what is around us

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.370
and to take action
to protect it.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:22.252
Thank you.

00:28:22.252 --> 00:28:26.108
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.290
So we were going to
do a Q&amp;A, but I also

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:39.070
have a video piece that is
also premiering currently

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.300
in my solo show in Seattle.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.580
And it's kind of subtle.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.100
I recorded it on the Antarctic
Peninsula, the same place

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.979
where I did that drawing that
I showed you the time lapse of.

00:28:47.979 --> 00:28:50.020
And so I'm going to let
it play in the background

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.990
while you guys ask me questions.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.650
And here it is.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.169
There we go.

00:28:59.169 --> 00:29:02.662
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.440
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about technology

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.440
and how it's been used
to amplify your message.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.130
Seth talked about Reddit.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.580
I know with the campaign,
that you raised money

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:26.070
for the trip to Greenland
and then now with YouTube.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.850
Can you talk a little more
about how technology is helping

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.610
with the momentum as you say?

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:34.630
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.779
A few years ago,
as Seth mentioned,

00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:39.570
my work kind of went
viral on the internet.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.550
And I still to this day don't
really know how it happened,

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.920
but I'm grateful for it.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.000
And the momentum
that that started

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.030
hasn't really ever stopped.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.190
I mean, I think I had
done enough work in the 10

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.740
years previous to
kind of back that up.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.682
It was like a ripe
time for it to happen.

00:29:58.682 --> 00:30:00.390
But I'm certainly
really grateful that it

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.280
did because it just helped.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.100
I mean, it's so easy to
spread these kinds of messages

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.980
really far across the
planet and across the globe.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.170
And so I really used especially
Instagram, social media

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:17.420
as a tool to share the
missions I went on with NASA

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:22.150
and also just the
work that I'm doing.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.986
Did I answer
everything you asked?

00:30:23.986 --> 00:30:24.486
OK.

00:30:24.486 --> 00:30:26.478
Cool.

00:30:26.478 --> 00:30:26.980
Oh.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.490
Also, I should say that like
Instagram itself has really

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.184
become I think like the
best way, for artists

00:30:32.184 --> 00:30:34.100
especially, to promote
their work because it's

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.150
such a visual platform.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.640
So yeah, I mean, I've sold
a lot of work on Instagram,

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.990
which that never would
have happened 10 years ago.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.749
It's just interesting
how things have changed.

00:30:46.749 --> 00:30:47.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.180
ZARIA FORMAN: Hi.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.554
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you

00:30:49.554 --> 00:30:53.490
for your very beautiful work and
your positive energy on a topic

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.940
that I think is pretty
tough and scary.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.720
My main question is, with your
work, what is your main goal?

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.490
Is to document and
share, or to inspire,

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:08.320
or are you urging people to
take action, just people like us

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.879
or organizations or politics?

00:31:10.879 --> 00:31:11.670
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.110
Good question.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:18.240
My main purpose is to
share, to give viewers

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.902
a place, a time, and a moment
to feel like they're there,

00:31:21.902 --> 00:31:24.360
like they're transported to
these places that are otherwise

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.390
like so not connected
to our everyday lives,

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:32.310
and to ideally stir up
an emotional connection.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.580
Because, like I said, when you
have an emotional connection

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.470
with something, when
you love something,

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.920
you want to protect it.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.940
And so that's the idea is that
I spur that emotional connection

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.540
and then they go on
you to take action.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.130
I'll offer things.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:48.600
I'll give websites.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.960
I donate a percent of
my sales to 350.org,

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.610
but I have a whole
page on my website

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.255
that's like, here's how you can
cut down your carbon footprint.

00:31:56.255 --> 00:31:59.160
But I feel like there is a
lot of that out there, which

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.380
is awesome, and that's
not like my main purpose

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.520
even though, yeah,
of course I want

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.900
to direct people
in the right way

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.760
so that they can take action.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.590
But I'm trying to
translate the data.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.610
The data is out.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.200
Like, we know the science.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.380
But somehow, still,
almost half of our planet

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.780
doesn't believe it or just
doesn't want to see it.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.970
And so clearly, that hard
science isn't enough.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:27.000
So I'm trying to just offer the
best way that I can communicate

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.700
the importance of that
and the scientific stuff

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.590
that might not be as
easy to digest and have

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.207
an emotional connection with.

00:32:33.207 --> 00:32:34.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.831
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.440
AUDIENCE: That's very bright.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.135
ZARIA FORMAN: I
know, on me, too.

00:32:40.135 --> 00:32:40.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.510
Thank you as well.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:44.680
It's really inspiring not only
to see some of the context

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.380
behind what you're doing,
but also how you do it.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.840
So I like that you touched
on both pieces of actually

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:54.170
how you work with the pastels
and what the reasoning behind

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:54.760
is.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.600
And to touch on your last
point of kind of accessibility

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.500
of the message--

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.889
so I think the
data is out there,

00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:01.930
the science is out there.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.410
That's very difficult for
a lot of us to understand

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:06.910
and many more to understand.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.580
And so I think sometimes
these decisions

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.740
are emotionally
driven rather than

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.100
driven by the data and
the science backing it up.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.510
And I'm just curious.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.330
I think the way that you're
going about it, to kind of try

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:22.810
to create an emotional reaction,
is probably making this

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.990
a more accessible message
than maybe NASA's message

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.615
or something to a
much bigger audience.

00:33:27.615 --> 00:33:29.156
And I was wondering
if you could just

00:33:29.156 --> 00:33:31.210
touch upon that, if
you've seen that you're

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.960
able to make that
message more accessible,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.840
or maybe any lesson learned
you have from making

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.569
that a more accessible message?

00:33:39.569 --> 00:33:40.360
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.219
Absolutely.

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:43.510
And that's exactly what I'm
trying to do, so thank you.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:48.250
I'm glad that you
think it's doing that.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:52.300
A big part of that, too, is
the realistic way that I draw.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.030
The way that I'm drawing all
the details, it's not abstract.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.390
It's accessible
not only to people

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:02.140
who aren't interested in
science, but also people

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.650
outside the art world's bubble.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.500
A lot of people who
have purchased my work

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.600
and who want to are
first-time art buyers.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.880
They just want to be able to
see that image in their home.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.790
I think there's a lot of art out
there that's not so accessible.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.190
And this is just like,
you look at an image

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:23.004
and you know what
it's about, and you

00:34:23.004 --> 00:34:24.670
can have a connection
to it because it's

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:25.949
part of our planet.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:27.440
We all live here.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.719
So yeah, in every
facet I try to make

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.409
it as accessible as possible.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:37.719
And I do think that it's
succeeding in that way,

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:39.670
hopefully.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.159
Of course, people only tell
me that they love my work.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:45.730
They don't tell me
if they hate it.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:48.550
But yeah, I have had a bunch
of people come up to me

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.860
and just say like, thank
you, like I had no idea,

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.500
or now I've changed
these actions in my life

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.030
because of what you said.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:59.776
So that's the most gratifying
things that I can hear.

00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:00.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.541
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:35:03.948 --> 00:35:04.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.060
ZARIA FORMAN: Hi.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.130
AUDIENCE: You said you
take thousands of images

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.200
and you have access to videos.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.276
So how do you choose which
images to actually draw?

00:35:14.276 --> 00:35:16.150
ZARIA FORMAN: Oh, good question.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:20.590
It's probably the hardest
part of my job, I think.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:25.390
It takes hours and hours of just
scrolling through and editing.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:29.560
At this point, I have
lifetimes over enough material

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.370
to continue making
work for many lives.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.970
And I still want to
go back and continue

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:41.070
to be inspired by
these places selfishly.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:44.470
It's hard to describe because
I think a lot of the time it's

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.115
just like a feeling.

00:35:46.115 --> 00:35:47.490
I'll be scrolling
through images,

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.906
and then all of a
sudden something

00:35:48.906 --> 00:35:50.850
will really stand out to me.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.290
And so that's often
how it happens.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.110
It's just like the
composition just feels right.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:00.815
It's not about math or like art
theory about the horizon line

00:36:00.815 --> 00:36:02.440
has to be one third
up from the bottom.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.320
It's just like, oh, there's
something about that just like

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.160
has the right feeling.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.000
And it can be hard
because I have

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.020
an endless amount
of photos and video,

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.650
but then I can also
crop them endlessly

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.630
and zoom in endlessly.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.510
So yeah, it's definitely
the hardest part.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.619
I spend a lot of time
scrolling through

00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:23.410
and staring at the
computer screen and lots

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:24.715
of icy pictures.

00:36:28.774 --> 00:36:30.190
AUDIENCE: I'm
wondering what comes

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.530
next after the icebergs
and the disappearing

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.000
islands in the Maldives?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.060
Will you sort of stay on theme
with environmental changes

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.809
or maybe do something
else entirely?

00:36:39.809 --> 00:36:40.600
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.120
I mean, I can't tell
the future, but I

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.890
do think that I could continue
with ice and sea level rise

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.390
for the rest of my life.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.990
Until it stops inspiring me,
I'm going to continue with it.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.960
And I don't see that
end anywhere in sight

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.120
just because there's so
much more that I still

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.060
have to learn about rendering
its different textures

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:04.900
and surfaces.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.000
And that's what excites
me, just to learn

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.320
something new with every piece.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.970
And so immediately what's
next is, from all these trips

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:17.080
I did with NASA, I gathered
a bunch of aerial footage

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.230
and photography, and I'll
be making a series that's

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.350
from that perspective.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:24.016
So some of those photos you saw,
it will kind of look like that.

00:37:24.016 --> 00:37:26.860
It's a little bit
more abstract looking.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:27.370
It's real.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.328
It won't look abstract.

00:37:28.328 --> 00:37:32.515
But I'm curious to see
how that will unfold,

00:37:32.515 --> 00:37:33.620
and it's exciting for me.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:38.837
But that will be my next exhibit
in New York in October of 2018.

00:37:38.837 --> 00:37:40.420
But yeah, like I
said, there's just so

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.990
many textures and surfaces
and ways that it's melting.

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:47.060
I mean, water has so
many different forms,

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.770
and I just don't see
an end in sight where

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:51.930
it will stop inspiring me.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:56.590
And I also think climate
change is arguably the largest

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.640
crisis we face as
a global community,

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.830
and I don't see that
going away anytime soon.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.890
And so it's important
to me to connect

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:06.880
whatever I'm doing to something
meaningful for the rest

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.520
of the world.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.087
So I see myself
doing that forever.

00:38:11.087 --> 00:38:11.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.711
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:38:12.711 --> 00:38:15.185
Thank you.

00:38:15.185 --> 00:38:17.530
Anyone else?

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.086
AUDIENCE: So when
you are drawing,

00:38:19.086 --> 00:38:20.460
are you making a
conscious effort

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.170
to stop yourself from
exploring and transforming

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.840
the image, the photograph,
or how you do trade off

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.200
between maintaining the
accuracy of the photograph

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.970
and going full on into
an abstract thing?

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:35.700
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.260
I mean, I want to portray
the exact landscape

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.230
that I witness because I'm
trying to stay true to it.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.060
I just want to be
honest about what I saw

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.580
and try to give people
that same experience.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:53.450
So the only time I ever
elaborate or change it,

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:55.200
it's a very small
percent of the time,

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.480
but it's really
just like if I have

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.180
this beautiful image that
I feel like is really more

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.200
powerful than anything
else that I've been looking

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.770
through but there is like,
oh, the corner of the iceberg

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.292
goes off the corner of the
image and I want it to stay

00:39:10.292 --> 00:39:12.750
contained inside with a little
bit of background behind it.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.420
It's just that, just
to artistically create

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.390
a balanced composition so
that it gives you as much

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:22.725
of a wonderful, comfortable,
loving feeling as possible.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.050
AUDIENCE: Could
you talk a bit more

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.490
about the
collaboration with NASA

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.470
in that how did that come
about for you as an artist?

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.320
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.756
So one day, I got an email--

00:39:38.756 --> 00:39:40.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:44.860
--from NASA's-- he
was a navigator.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.690
He's basically
their lead navigator

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:50.710
for airborne
terrestrial exploration,

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.270
not extraterrestrial--

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:56.860
so basically flying,
exploring earth in flight.

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.960
And he just reached out.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.467
He came from a
family of artists.

00:39:59.467 --> 00:40:01.050
He didn't say that
in his first email,

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.970
but he was just like,
hey, I found your work.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.387
I saw your TED Talk on
Apple TV in my preparations

00:40:07.387 --> 00:40:09.220
and research for my
next trip to Antarctica.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.140
And I thought you
should come with us.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.390
And so here's my phone number.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.910
Call me.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.460
I remember very
clearly this day.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:21.330
I had a friend coworking with
me in my studio, and I was like,

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:22.090
what?

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:22.965
I read him the email.

00:40:22.965 --> 00:40:24.160
He's like, oh my god.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.618
And I was like, I think I'm
going to call them immediately,

00:40:26.618 --> 00:40:29.080
but I kind of think
this is a hoax.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.870
And I called him and he
had this like radio voice,

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.450
and I was like,
this can't be real.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:37.150
And after several conversations
and several months and lots

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:38.590
of planning, I
still didn't think

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:41.452
it was real on the plane flying
down to Punta Arenas, Chile,

00:40:41.452 --> 00:40:42.910
where I was going
to meet the team.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:46.510
And it really wasn't until
like that evening when

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.480
I walked into the
first science meeting

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.790
that they had every night
at 6:00 PM where I was like,

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.255
oh, I'm not being kidnapped.

00:40:54.255 --> 00:40:56.380
[? There ?] [? on a ?]
[? plane, ?] a bunch of NASA

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.000
scientists here.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.950
So yeah, I'm so grateful
for this opportunity

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:05.260
to collaborate with such
an incredible project.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:10.270
And I was so intimidated,
too, at first.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.057
I'm an artist.

00:41:11.057 --> 00:41:12.140
I'm a weird quirky artist.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.760
To go meet a bunch
of NASA scientists

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.490
was like really scary.

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:19.360
But they were so warm and
welcoming, and a bunch of them

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.380
had even known my
work before and were

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.900
really excited to meet me.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:28.630
And way more than I
expected, they really

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:32.710
understood the value in
communicating their message

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:35.390
in a different way that they
haven't been able to do.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.870
So I think all of them are
really grateful that I was

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.100
there and doing what I'm doing.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.670
So it's been a really
incredible experience.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.886
I'm actually going
there tonight.

00:41:44.886 --> 00:41:47.010
Right after I leave here,
I'm getting onto a train,

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:50.500
and I'm going to be speaking
at NASA's Goddard tomorrow, so

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.147
excited to see all of them.

00:41:53.147 --> 00:41:53.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:56.929 --> 00:41:57.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.970
Thank you.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:02.250
There's definitely an
element of scale in your work

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:09.300
and I think also in how you are
really amplifying the message

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.715
and know this change.

00:42:12.715 --> 00:42:15.870
I think you had an image up
there that was some cracks.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:19.080
Like, that crack right there
could be 100 feet across.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.360
I'm curious about how
you think about scale.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.380
Like, did your work
start at a smaller scale?

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.959
Yeah, just more on that.

00:42:26.959 --> 00:42:27.750
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:34.830
I guess my professional work
began my last year in college,

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.610
and I was working
pretty big actually.

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:42.470
I made a couple of 6-by-8-foot
pieces for my senior show.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.870
And I was drawing
really big skies--

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:51.632
storms, hurricanes from
weather photography.

00:42:51.632 --> 00:42:53.340
So scale has always
been important to me.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.130
But especially after I got
back from that first trip

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.620
to Antarctica in
the winter of 2015,

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.800
I was just like, how
can I do this landscape

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:08.520
justice without going as hugely
massive as possible, as much

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.780
as I can afford and
can do in my studio?

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.090
Because it's just so epic.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:18.390
And it's like, you can use
all these grandiose words,

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:20.700
and it's like nothing
really describes it.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.550
And that's why I am trying
to draw them because I don't

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.670
know how to put it into words.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.780
So yeah, I feel like the
scale is really important

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:32.550
to make you feel like you're
standing in front of a glacier.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:33.750
You need that scale.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:34.590
It's so important.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.170
And so I do work--

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:39.616
I make smaller pieces as
kind of more like studies,

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:41.490
but also just because
they are so much easier

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:45.270
to transport and sell.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:48.677
But the larger ones are
really where my heart is.

00:43:48.677 --> 00:43:50.760
I love to spend a whole
year working on one piece,

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.450
making it as large
as I possibly can.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:55.033
So if you know anyone that wants
to pay for that, let me know.

00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:57.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.590
One thing that people
tend to comment on

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:05.034
so I'll just say something about
it is a lot of the drawings

00:44:05.034 --> 00:44:07.200
or most of them, there isn't
really a sense of scale

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.030
because I'm not putting
a little penguin

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.260
in there or little boat.

00:44:13.839 --> 00:44:15.630
Part of me wishes that
there were something

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.970
I could put in there
that didn't seem cheesy,

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:21.640
like a penguin, that would
offer that sense of scale.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.800
But, on the flip side, I think
it's kind of nice sometimes

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.080
because there are
drawings that I showed you

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.950
in this presentation
where an iceberg was maybe

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.730
as big as the drawing itself.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.920
But when people ask me, how
big is that because it looks

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.304
like a mountain range to me?

00:44:39.304 --> 00:44:40.470
I'm like, ooh, that's great.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.190
It was this big.

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:46.190
And I actually like when they
think it's larger than life.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:49.980
But I love especially
drawing at like a 1:1 ratio

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.370
as much as possible,
meaning the scale of the ice

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:56.160
was actually as big
as I'm drawing it,

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.930
because it just allows
me to really get

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.850
into all the nitty
gritty details

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:03.780
and just show you, show
viewers, exactly what the ice

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.659
texture looks like up close.

00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:06.492
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:10.954 --> 00:45:12.370
AUDIENCE: So first,
I think Google

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:16.910
should pay for that
gigantic drawing somehow.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:19.720
ZARIA FORMAN: We'll email after.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.490
AUDIENCE: So I really liked how
you shared the sound with us.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:28.120
And it seems like
it's definitely

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:33.100
an attribute that will help
people get more immersed.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.960
So I'm curious if you're
collaborating also

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.800
with people that can
create VR experiences

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.400
or interactive experiences
and sort of like scale

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.780
it in a different way.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:47.090
You know the topic
and everything,

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:51.899
but you can probably share it
in different mediums as well.

00:45:51.899 --> 00:45:52.690
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:57.760
It is definitely a direction
that I see myself going in.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.300
This exhibit that's up
right now is the first one.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.550
That sound piece I played
you is my first sound piece.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.383
The video piece I was
playing during the Q&amp;A

00:46:05.383 --> 00:46:06.330
is my first video.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.990
And the exhibit in
Seattle right now,

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:12.670
I was really trying to create
that immersive experience

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.980
like you mentioned
because it just

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.230
allows you to feel like
you're there that much more.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:20.870
And VR is almost, at this
point, the ultimate of that.

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:26.260
And so, yes, I would really
love to venture into that arena.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.970
And I've been just starting
conversations with people

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.920
and thinking about
projects in the works,

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.260
but nothing is planned yet.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.360
But yeah, definitely a
direction I want to go in.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.171
I feel like everyone
here asked a question.

00:46:44.171 --> 00:46:47.599
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:48.099 --> 00:46:50.063
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:50.063 --> 00:46:51.045
Thank you.

00:46:56.937 --> 00:46:57.919
Thank you.

00:46:57.919 --> 00:47:00.360
AUDIENCE: I'll ask one
closing question really fast,

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.700
and I feel a little bad
asking after you've explained

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.710
why the scale is so important.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:10.147
But can we purchase
prints anywhere and where?

00:47:10.147 --> 00:47:10.980
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.310
ZARIA FORMAN: No,
that's a great--

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:12.560
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.590
ZARIA FORMAN: Yeah.

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:15.240
Thank you.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:20.060
So ArtStar.com sells my
prints, used to be exclusively.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.640
Now, we also have a new
print that just came out

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.264
of that first slide--

00:47:24.264 --> 00:47:26.180
I don't know if they
want to pull it up there,

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.760
but the one that I
first showed you of me,

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.060
I'm small on the corner
drawing it, and it's one big--

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.654
oh, the time lapse drawing--

00:47:32.654 --> 00:47:34.070
that one is a new
print now that's

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.110
offered through Winston
Wachter in Seattle.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:38.830
So you just have to
call the gallery.

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:42.100
And we're launching
a new print soon,

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.510
and there will be new
drawings available

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:47.060
as I start making
this next series.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:47.560
Thank you.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.910
[APPLAUSE]
