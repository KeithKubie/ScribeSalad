1
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.790
You're two too. You're listening to radiolab.

2
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.980
<v 1>I thought I'd see if I can get the sound of baby sleeping.</v>

3
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.533
<v 2>Yep.</v>

4
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.100
<v 3>This is Radiolab. Today's program is about sleep.</v>

5
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.870
I don't have to tell you how good sleep is.

6
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.950
You do it yourself every night.

7
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.800
Will you try and how wonderful when it actually works.

8
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:45.801
When you can close your eyes and forget the day and just drift off into oblivion

9
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.790
like a little baby.

10
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.670
<v 1>Well, let's suppose that you are a little baby,</v>

11
00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:54.160
this little baby and you grew up to become a scientist,

12
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.730
like one of the scientists we'll hear from in this program and you decide to ask

13
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.010
<v 3>what should be the dumbest question ever.</v>

14
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.860
Why do we sleep?

15
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.850
<v 0>Not just us. Pretty much everything sleeps as far as we know. All mammals do it.</v>

16
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.430
All birds fees, locusts, cockroaches, crayfish, reptiles in sex, scorpions,

17
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.910
everything that's been studied has something that looks like sleep.

18
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.220
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

19
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.053
<v 4>it's a mystery,</v>

20
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.250
but most things we sort of know what they are for and also how they work.

21
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.910
But sleep is really in your face. I mean, everybody does it.

22
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.250
You do it from the cradle,

23
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.120
<v 0>the grave. You can't help doing it because if you try to stay awake,</v>

24
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.240
you know at some point it's a repressible and we don't know why.

25
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.610
That's a shameful state of affairs.

26
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.360
How can you be a scientist at the 21st century and I know the answer to that.

27
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.820
There you go. Okay.

28
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.260
That's a pretty good way to begin. Now with shame. Yeah. Yeah.

29
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.130
Today on Radiolab, we're going to try to correct this,

30
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:59.280
a shameful state in the fingers when it comes to the subject of sleep.

31
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:03.240
We'll talk with people who can help us understand what it's for, why we do it,

32
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.100
and what happens when we don't. I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm Jetta. Boom. Ron,

33
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.420
stay with us.

34
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.420
<v 2>Go</v>

35
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.750
[inaudible].

36
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.950
<v 1>For centuries people thought that sleep was kind of the opposite of being awake,</v>

37
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.310
which reasonable? One more thing. Sure. Because you know,

38
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.150
during the day you're doing all these things,

39
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:32.010
you're having all these thoughts and feelings at night. You just lie there very,

40
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:36.300
very still that like sometimes a bomb could go off and you wouldn't wake up.

41
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.630
I can hardly wake up even in a fire.

42
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.280
<v 0>No, I'm a really Haley sleeper. Amy, very, very heavy sleeper.</v>

43
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.743
<v 1>When is it,</v>

44
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.850
if all you've got are your eyes to go on sleep can seem like being well,

45
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:57.720
like being off? Yeah, like off. Yes, right or worse. Well,

46
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.910
both Shakespeare Servant is referred to sleep as death.

47
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.850
That's Dr Carlos Schenck.

48
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.930
He wrote a great book about sleep called Paradox last we go to,

49
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.570
we go to bed every night. We die every night and then we wake up in the morning,

50
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.530
we're alive again.

51
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.430
And that was the prevailing theory for centuries for Dr Shank,

52
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:20.431
the awakening to just how wrong Shakespeare and Cervantes were about sleep came

53
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.020
one day while he was sitting in a class for med school.

54
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:24.550
My first year of medical school,

55
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.660
this was back in 1972 we had an emeritus professor who actually was a Nobel

56
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:33.250
prize winner. Dr uh, Eccles, John or John Kuru Eccles from,

57
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.470
here's what happened. This esteemed lecturer walks into class,

58
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.990
pops the cassette into the tape deck, hits play and outcomes. This sound,

59
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.180
well, the sound was

60
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.140
or 32nd, let me get it right. Oh, here we go.

61
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.990
And multiply this by a hundred.

62
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.850
<v 5>This is the professor announced is the sound of a cat's brain while asleep.</v>

63
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.300
My God shake almost fell out of the seat.

64
00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:13.070
This is the brain during sleep making these really rapid,

65
00:04:13.071 --> 00:04:15.950
high pitch multiple sounds. That just blew us away.

66
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.550
It wasn't just clearly while that cat was curled up on this little kitty basket,

67
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.330
it's brain

68
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.060
<v 1>was very, very alive, much more than anyone expected, and it's,</v>

69
00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:27.390
this is still a little weird revelation. Like, take my cat Sammy. All right.

70
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.820
This is the sound like cat Sam. He sleepy.

71
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.383
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.430
<v 1>To think that while Sam is sitting on my lap, totally out,</v>

73
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.740
there's a circus happening in his brain. What's going on in there?

74
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.650
If you can imagine back in the seventies this was a paradigm shift.

75
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:50.960
People were suddenly like, oh my God,

76
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.110
we're going to figure out anything about sleep. Right? All right,

77
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.190
we have to ask the brain, and this is the room where we do all of our surgeries,

78
00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.113
and luckily

79
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.370
that's easily done if you're willing to get your hands dirty. Okay?

80
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:09.360
So the first step is you have to make an incision on top of the animal's head.

81
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.000
When you've done that, we drill holes,

82
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.750
<v 5>do the animal skeleton</v>

83
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.000
<v 1>and uh, and then you insert your electrode,</v>

84
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.780
your standing knees and that's simply it. A little window into their brain.

85
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:24.680
You could see right there on the, on the screen, you can see that mainly wait,

86
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.280
are you out of your mind and you just,

87
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.390
did you just put a hole into a kittens head? No, this wasn't my cat. Come on.

88
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:32.750
So what was it we were doing there? Well you just heard was a,

89
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.030
a mock surgery to an iguana actually. And then we won. I mean it's,

90
00:05:38.031 --> 00:05:40.330
it's not a nice look. Look, look, look the animal. Yeah.

91
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.100
Not Harmed within 20 minutes of coming out of the anesthetic,

92
00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:46.130
the animal is moving around, it's eating, it's climbing and it's, its basking.

93
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.290
It might seem like a rather invasive procedure, but in actuality it's, it's,

94
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.540
it's not too bad at all. Yeah. And that by the way is John Les skew.

95
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.900
He's a graduate student at the a ecology department at Indiana state,

96
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.423
which is where we are.

97
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.010
John gave our reporter Kara older testing a tour of the lab are big boys get

98
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.710
here and they all have nice hats chit or the Iguanas.

99
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.640
These kids are a little frightening to me. They're pretty huge.

100
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.820
They're like four feet long, head to tail. Oh, I didn't know that. I mean,

101
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:14.970
they look like baby alligators.

102
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.020
Pick that one up and John measures their brain waves at night to see what

103
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:20.420
happens. It's in their head as they sleep. In a way,

104
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:24.050
it's a continuation of that cat experiment that Dr Shank just told us about

105
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.380
except what they're looking for is much more peculiar than could ever happen in

106
00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:34.360
a cat or enough. What does that, let me put it to you as a puzzle. Okay,

107
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.070
and forget Iguanas. Dolphins. Dolphins. Yep.

108
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.470
How is it that a dolphin in the ocean or even see the dolphins that you might

109
00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:47.310
find at six flags in New Jersey? They have to.

110
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.820
Cody is our 10 year old Atlantic bottlenose dolphins.

111
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.740
Buddy Avalon is 12 years old and that's their trainer. Megan to terror of year.

112
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.880
Mitra is holding the mic. Anyhow, here's the puzzle. We asked Megan about this,

113
00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:02.040
how is it it her two dolphins,

114
00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:05.040
Cody and Avalon can successfully sleep.

115
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.690
Given the inherent challenges of being a dolphin? I don't. I don't.

116
00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:11.670
What do you motor the challenges of a dolphin? Well,

117
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.180
they have significant challenges. My friend first, they've got to breathe.

118
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.450
They're not, they're conscious breathers are not unconscious breathers, so they,

119
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.560
they have to think about breathing. Making matters worse. Dolphins are not fish,

120
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.270
so they have to breathe air,

121
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.410
which means they have to constantly consciously come up to the surface to

122
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.700
breathe air every few minutes.

123
00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:33.480
So you can imagine what would happen if they decided to go unconscious for

124
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.570
awhile. Ala Drown. Right.

125
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.630
And yet they do manage to sleep a lot. Oh, how long?

126
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.090
Eight hours a day. Like Aileen. Yeah, eight hours. But how, that's the puzzle.

127
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.120
What happens is they do what we call logging. Yeah.

128
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.360
It's when they rest on the surface of the water, you know,

129
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:54.430
in a log floats down a river. It just floats.

130
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.360
[inaudible] that's exactly what they look like. And they rest half their brain.

131
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.420
Yeah. [inaudible] their brain is half their brain is asleep.

132
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:08.421
At a time that is nature solution to cut the dolphin brain in half.

133
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.620
I mean literally, literally in half,

134
00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:14.760
so that one half can snooze while the other half keeps the dolphin swimming and

135
00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.640
surfacing just enough to breathe from the outside.

136
00:08:17.641 --> 00:08:19.470
You can't really tell what's happening.

137
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.920
It just looks like the Dolphin is sort of a wig, but a little out of it.

138
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.830
It's almost like the state of when you're falling asleep,

139
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.900
but if something happened, you'd wake right up.

140
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.790
So they're in that state all the time. It can be characterized as groggy.

141
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.850
That's Steve Lima. He runs the one of the labs back in Indiana.

142
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.610
There's sort of a wig and you're sort of asleep,

143
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.910
but it's just a way of of staying awake enough and again, it's easy to miss,

144
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:44.430
but if you look inside that groggy dolphins brain,

145
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.060
what the brainwaves are doing [inaudible] exquisitely obvious.

146
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.300
It's clear as that six year old can figure it out when half of the brain has

147
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:55.900
these beautiful slow ways I can sign for no.

148
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.690
<v 3>And the other one's just jacking all over the place.</v>

149
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.470
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

150
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.010
<v 3>beautiful. Wow. That is amazing. Yeah,</v>

151
00:09:10.011 --> 00:09:11.960
it's called the uni hemispheric sleep.

152
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.890
That's what the guys at Indiana state are really interested in because,

153
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.580
and here's the next surprise. It seems to go way beyond dolphins.

154
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.570
They're aquatic mammals like whales, seals and sea lions.

155
00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:26.480
John says at all the marine mammals that have been studied seem to do it too

156
00:09:26.481 --> 00:09:30.530
recently. Walruses they're all found to engage in uni hemispheric sleep as well.

157
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.870
And now the Indiana team led by an okay by this guy,

158
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.340
I'm Charles m lanner, chair of the Department of Ecology and organismal biology.

159
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.210
They have found this weird split brain behavior and creatures of the air.

160
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.920
Let me, let me just back up a little bit and describe, uh, the, this experiment.

161
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.020
Charlie and a student had been at the park one day and they noticed something.

162
00:09:53.021 --> 00:09:54.680
We observed that duck stocks,

163
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.440
sometimes we'll get together into groups like on a log for ducks.

164
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.780
We'll get together and snooze in a neat little line.

165
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:07.810
And the birds that were sitting in the middle of that line tended to be sleeping

166
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:09.590
with both eyes closed.

167
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.830
The birds that were sitting on the outside of that row tended to look a little

168
00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:19.160
bit more wary. The inevitable question,

169
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.830
what's going on here led to a very simple experiment.

170
00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:26.360
We put four birds in a row for Mallard ducks this time in the lab and they

171
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:27.050
watched them sleep.

172
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.500
The two birds in the center of this row slept with both eyes,

173
00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:34.310
closed the birds on the outlet, outer edges both left and right,

174
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.720
slept with one eye closed and one I opened one more time,

175
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.610
slept with one eye closed and one eye opened. It's just like in that song

176
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:47.590
<v 5>[inaudible] you know</v>

177
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.140
<v 3>that Metallica Song I, I missed it.</v>

178
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.710
I missed a good one and I knew they were all bought in. This is true, you know,

179
00:10:53.711 --> 00:10:54.491
no one knows this,

180
00:10:54.491 --> 00:10:59.000
but that song is really about adaptive sleeping behavior and dogs.

181
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.660
The outer eye, the eye that was faced away from the group,

182
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.780
the eye that was facing towards where potential predators might come from that

183
00:11:09.971 --> 00:11:11.710
stayed open. At this point,

184
00:11:11.711 --> 00:11:15.520
Charlie had a pretty good idea of what was going on because he knew that inside

185
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:19.600
bird brains, each eye is attached to the opposite hemisphere.

186
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.660
The left eye is attached to the right hemisphere.

187
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.210
The right eye is attached to the left hemisphere,

188
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.140
so his team and planted some electrodes to measure what the duck brains were

189
00:11:29.141 --> 00:11:33.850
doing and blah, blah. Like the dolphins,

190
00:11:33.851 --> 00:11:37.300
the ducks two were sleeping one half of their brain at a time.

191
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.920
The bird could simultaneously sleep and be awake.

192
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.100
Not only that, here's the cool part. After a few hours,

193
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.640
what happened was is that the birds that were on the outer edge then would

194
00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:49.960
rotate, stand up,

195
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.280
turn around 180 degrees and then sit back and the other I

196
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 1>would then get some sleep and consequently the opposite hemisphere would get</v>

197
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:02.450
some sleep. When we saw that and we said, oh yeah, it's just that good,

198
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.350
good because right there in the docs was a perfect illustration of what these

199
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:11.950
guys think. It's all about you've got to sleep for whatever reason, right,

200
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.120
but sleep is danger, danger, danger, danger.

201
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.020
That's the headline for dolphins. The main dangerous drown danger. Danger,

202
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:25.000
you know? Yeah. For ducks getting eaten, pager ducks have to sleep major,

203
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.300
but how can they nature when lurking in the darkness or foxes and wolves and a

204
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:33.520
hundred other eaters of ducks. Do you like snakes?

205
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.730
I don't know. Not really. I don't dislike snakes.

206
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.910
He's good man. Good man. In another nifty experiment,

207
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:47.580
John took the resident's snake Monte. Yes is, yeah,

208
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.230
ga. Hey big snake. He is.

209
00:12:50.231 --> 00:12:54.550
What about a four foot long python and at night you're so cute.

210
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.110
John Brought Monte the python into the room where his iguanas sleep and he

211
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.390
terrifies that really well.

212
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.250
I mean Monte was in a cage so he couldn't really hurt the Iguanas.

213
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.810
But as soon as that snake appeared, all the lizards popped one eye open.

214
00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:12.400
I vapid and, and the train that open eye right on Monte,

215
00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:12.851
the snake,

216
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:16.360
but a big snake in the room and they'll watch it with one eye all night.

217
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.000
That Steve Lima again, they don't like these next, that's for sure.

218
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.270
I never removed the snake from the room the next day and they're still looking

219
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:25.020
for the next night or two. So they keep one eye, you know,

220
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.280
trained on that door for a few more. About two or three days,

221
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.350
they go back to a regular sleep.

222
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.713
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

223
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.230
<v 1>so what does this all mean? Well, think about this. Okay. All the sea mammals,</v>

224
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.810
they do it right. We'll list the ones I've been studying.

225
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:53.070
All the flying creatures, they do it. The reptiles seem to do it too.

226
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.400
Who does that leave? You mean? Who's left?

227
00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:59.370
Not Sleeping with a half a brain on and the other half a brain off. Yeah.

228
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.733
<v 2>Cool.</v>

229
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.670
<v 1>Um, us, we may be the strange ones. Well,</v>

230
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:09.970
it is sort of strange in that terrestrial mammals can't do it for Estriol.

231
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:12.820
Mammals just for some reason have lost the ability to do this at all.

232
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:17.020
Mammals says John de terrestrial mammals, the ones that live on land.

233
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.830
And here's this theory. Sometime long ago,

234
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.140
our scaly ancestor wandered up on the land and thought, I think I'll dig a hole.

235
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.180
Yeah, I'm going to take a hole.

236
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.780
The hole is dark and it was safe. And for the first time,

237
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:36.730
millions of years of evolution,

238
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:40.690
that little creature closed both eyes.

239
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.223
Ah,

240
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:46.830
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

241
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.130
<v 1>and so we lost it. Totally speculative theory of course,</v>

242
00:14:50.131 --> 00:14:53.270
but the basic idea is if you are protected and safe,

243
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:57.440
you can afford to close both eyes, conk out completely.

244
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.310
And that simple idea of safety that explains while these guys think almost

245
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:05.450
everything where you sleep, how you sleep, how long you sleep,

246
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.220
it all boils down to two words. Predation, risk, predation,

247
00:15:10.221 --> 00:15:13.400
risk per dation risk, which is really just a fancy way of saying,

248
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:17.120
generally speaking, just your risk of being killed, the risk of being eaten. Now

249
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.120
<v 3>what does this have to do with us?</v>

250
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.700
<v 1>Here we are, top of the food chain in our warm beds, nice warm bed, locked door,</v>

251
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:31.940
a locked door covers maybe a nice neighborhood,

252
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.700
a good police force looking after you at nighttime

253
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:39.370
<v 0>and you live in a country that has a very secure living in</v>

254
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.233
<v 1>environment.</v>

255
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.710
You would think that this whole predation risk idea has nothing to do with us.

256
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.110
<v 0>Wow. Well,</v>

257
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.710
there's a few studies that have looked at a c sleep patterns where people are

258
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:54.800
sleeping in novel environments. What's a novel environment?

259
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.250
Did you mean like a hotel? Oh, that first night at a hotel.

260
00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:01.100
Why is it no one could sleep? Well, that first night at a hotel,

261
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.710
on your first night of sleeping in a hotel room,

262
00:16:03.711 --> 00:16:08.630
you generally have less rem sleep and less and deep slow wave sleep relative to

263
00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:12.020
sleeping in your house. I suffer from that myself.

264
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:13.280
I don't sleep well in hotel rooms,

265
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.340
especially if you're just one night per place or something.

266
00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:17.330
I might sleep this terrible.

267
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:22.390
There are some folks that actually hypothesized or at certain Predator relays in

268
00:16:22.821 --> 00:16:24.860
the brain, danger, danger, danger,

269
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.920
and that these circuits remain active at all times.

270
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.710
<v 3>No, what does that's true that, yeah,</v>

271
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.070
we all have buried deep in our reptile brain,

272
00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:42.670
a sort of Predator alert system perhaps in some of us.

273
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.150
It's a little too sensitive. Okay.

274
00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:50.050
We're in the sleep lab at the Minnesota Regional Sleep disorders center.

275
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.340
Mission control, we call it. Yeah.

276
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:57.370
We're viewing the typical sleep terror episode. This little girl who is, uh,

277
00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:02.270
five years old waiting be aging these sleep terror episodes every single night.

278
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.670
That's Dr Carlos Shank, who we heard from before.

279
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:08.450
We're in Minnesota now at the Hennepin county sleep center here in a sleep lab

280
00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:10.340
where he works. We're standing in front of him,

281
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:15.460
grainy black and white video of a little girl in her PJ's screaming time.

282
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:17.241
Aiden Dr.

283
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:21.260
Shank discovered an odd category of sleep disorders called Parasomnias,

284
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.490
which is why we came to talk to them.

285
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:27.320
Para means around Somnio means sleep around sleep.

286
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:29.420
This might be the human analog to the ducks.

287
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.310
People whose brains never quite shut off completely during sleep. Well,

288
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:37.940
this guy's interesting. He has seizures. No, no, no. He doesn't. Wait a second.

289
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.580
He showed us tape after tape. We're viewing a man.

290
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.780
We are very affectionately called Santa Claus on the screen.

291
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.500
Large guys thrashing back and forth. His legs are moving.

292
00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:52.500
He's going back and forth for the sides of his back and then suddenly he starts

293
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:53.334
to

294
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.233
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

295
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.350
<v 9>Oh,</v>

296
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.853
<v 8>oh,</v>

297
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:04.680
<v 9>oh.</v>

298
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.220
<v 3>Is this real? Yeah. This guy is in and out of sleep.</v>

299
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:09.360
He has no idea what he's doing.

300
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:13.830
One of the interesting things Dr Shank noticed when you first began to diagnose

301
00:18:13.831 --> 00:18:17.070
parasomnias in the early eighties is that while they were in that kind of

302
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:19.140
liminal space around sleep,

303
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.460
a huge percentage of the patients would have these visceral dreams of being

304
00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:23.941
attacked.

305
00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:28.650
The common theme is a menace is posed from nowhere coming out of nowhere.

306
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.820
It's an immediate threat that you, you just can't ignore. Let's put it that way.

307
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.190
You have to either fight it or run away from it.

308
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.690
Your dreams can be very violent. This is Martin Sabelle,

309
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:41.910
h 88 he's another if Dr shanks patient,

310
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.270
I don't remember someone coming up the stairway.

311
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.630
In Martin's case, the attackers never had a face.

312
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.440
Sometimes it was a bear and I was going to fight William.

313
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.210
Hey [inaudible] here. That's Martin's wife, Gertrude Graham.

314
00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.840
It was always trying to protect me. Yeah.

315
00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.860
I would have black and blue bruises on my arms and hands because I was hitting

316
00:19:06.831 --> 00:19:08.710
the headboard frequently.

317
00:19:08.711 --> 00:19:12.550
The man is dreaming in bed with his wife that he is fighting to defend her.

318
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.300
If I'm an attacker,

319
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:18.280
when in fact he's beating the one night I was sleeping and all of a sudden he's

320
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:23.020
got his hands tightly around my straw. I am petrified.

321
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:27.940
Quit mark, you're dreaming. You're hurting me. Martin, you're dreaming.

322
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.210
Gertrude and Martin. Isabel are still married, believe it or not,

323
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.380
after 57 years though, she did force him to sell his guns.

324
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.430
He has never been happy about that. Well, they were quite valuable.

325
00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.940
So you're suggesting then that all these people and the Iguanas and the ducks

326
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.980
and the dolphins all have a portion of their brain which is weary in the night.

327
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.380
That's what I'm hinting at. I don't want to go any stronger than hint at,

328
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:58.410
but there seems to be a something in us that's always watching out.

329
00:19:58.871 --> 00:20:00.210
Always wary.

330
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:05.250
Bottom line here though is that sleep for all creatures is a dangerous thing in

331
00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:09.820
a few unfortunate people are still awake to that fact. That's right.

332
00:20:09.821 --> 00:20:10.571
Before we go to break.

333
00:20:10.571 --> 00:20:14.200
I just want to thank Anne Habermann for her excellent reporting in Minnesota and

334
00:20:14.201 --> 00:20:17.550
also before her Cara Oehler and to remind you to stay with us because we're

335
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.970
going to turn our attention shortly from danger to deprivation.

336
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.160
Radiolab. We'll continue in a moment.

337
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.540

344
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.090
I'm Rod. And today our topic on radio lab is sleep. Yup.

345
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.300
It is something that all of us do. We can't help but do it.

346
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:02.290
It's dangerous to do. It's so good and it's universal. I think about it.

347
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:02.441
You know,

348
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:06.190
sleep is dangerous and if sleep could have been circumvented in some way,

349
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.680
natural selection probably would have found a way to do it.

350
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.040
Let's Steve Lima again from Indiana State University. Yeah, it because it would,

351
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.240
it just, it'd be such a great idea to not sleep. Don't I know it,

352
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.360
but there are times when you just can't sleep. Right.

353
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:24.340
Maybe you're one of the 35 million Americans I am. Who has chronic insomnia.

354
00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:27.940
Yeah. You just can't sleep. You don't know why it just doesn't happen.

355
00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:32.170
Or maybe you do it to yourself and you pull all nighters for school or you have

356
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:34.720
to drive long distances or,

357
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.460
and here's what we want to turn our attention to next. Maybe it is done to you.

358
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.520
Hmm. That's the case with producer Hannah Palin.

359
00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:46.210
She kept this audio diary of her own experiment with sleep deprivation.

360
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.440
She has an 18 month old son,

361
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.870
two 54 for the record.

362
00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.993
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

363
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.570
<v 5>today's my first day back at work,</v>

364
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.690
we were discussing budgets. I just,

365
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:15.831
I just,

366
00:22:15.831 --> 00:22:20.831
I couldn't even articulate what it was that I was seeing on the computer screen

367
00:22:22.221 --> 00:22:25.520
and try to communicate that to the curator that I worked for.

368
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.710
The words didn't come, my dad, my dad on me.

369
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.280
Instead of saying, well, Nicolette,

370
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:38.720
I believe that that choice was made because no, no. All that came out was like,

371
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:45.020
um, honey buckets. I mean, nothing,

372
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.230
nothing would come out. There's just no brain cells.

373
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.750
Really Brown was my sleeve. So anyway,

374
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.540
that was my first day back at work.

375
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:02.083
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

376
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.143
<v 5>47</v>

377
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.133
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

378
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:09.180
<v 5>Dominick, well not sleep. Don't know.</v>

379
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.220
I'm trying to get him to sleep and kind of met my Watson.

380
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:20.330
This just sucks. It totally sucks.

381
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.470
<v 9>Here's the funny thing, everybody has a theory,</v>

382
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.540
and I was talking to my sister-in-law tonight and her theory is that he's not

383
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:31.630
getting enough milk because milk has some

384
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.990
agent in it that would help him sleep and he doesn't like milk. It's true.

385
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.560
Other people say, Oh, if he just would exercise him,

386
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:45.980
if he just gets fresh air and exercise, he'll sleep all night. If he

387
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.000
<v 5>just let him cry,</v>

388
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:52.001
he would sleep all night if you just would do whatever it is we're not doing,

389
00:23:52.221 --> 00:23:54.500
he would sleep all night.

390
00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.653
<v 2>Okay.</v>

391
00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.810
<v 5>And there's this feeling like, okay,</v>

392
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:09.510
there's a feeling like I am doing it all wrong and that I'm a failure as a

393
00:24:10.211 --> 00:24:13.450
parent and I don't know how to do this.

394
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:16.623
<v 2>Come here sweetie.</v>

395
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.383
<v 5>So anyway,</v>

396
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.770
I needed to record just one thing really quickly and that is that yesterday and

397
00:24:28.771 --> 00:24:30.060
today I've been struck by,

398
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.760
I'm in struck by these waves of

399
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.260
satisfaction and delight with being alive in this amazing landscape with

400
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:49.550
the funny kid, mountains and,

401
00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.080
and water and I don't know,

402
00:24:52.081 --> 00:24:56.340
maybe it's just getting a little more sleep in the last couple of days when I

403
00:24:56.341 --> 00:24:59.730
suddenly feel like, wow, I'm so lucky.

404
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.910
Okay, I've got to take my kid to play now. Here we go.

405
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.460
Do you know the Muffin man? The muffin man.

406
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.100
Okay. That whole, I'm loving life. Yeah,

407
00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:19.390
that's all gone now.

408
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.170
It's pretty much because Dominic won't take a nap.

409
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.360
We came home from the beach,

410
00:25:25.361 --> 00:25:30.361
which I thought would wear him out and we sat down and read some stories,

411
00:25:30.701 --> 00:25:31.510
which for some reason,

412
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:35.170
and I realized that an element to the sleep deprivation and an element to this

413
00:25:35.171 --> 00:25:40.171
whole thing is that I get angry from having my own needs subverted to the needs

414
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.940
of this little tiny person,

415
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.590
which when you're not sleep deprived is not a big deal.

416
00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.730
Oh, tired. I tired cry.

417
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:08.590
<v 9>I don't want to wish a minute of Dominic's childhood away because it's so</v>

418
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:11.030
precious to me.

419
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.040
I was looking forward to, uh,

420
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.200
that moment when, um, we be able to say, honey,

421
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.210
I have to go to sleep and he does it

422
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.670
<v 5>die? Harrington? No, not dying</v>

423
00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.310
soon. Huh?

424
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Who Does Your Eyes Buck? Hi.

425
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.880
<v 9>Here's my personal take on what it's like to be sleepy. Okay.</v>

426
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.980
And to crave sleep as much as

427
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.920
<v 12>you crave water or breath.</v>

428
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.620
I crave it.

429
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.970
Thanks to Hannah Balin and her son Dominic and her husband Steve. Oh,

430
00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.510
I know. Poor Hannah. But there is a science question looking in the background,

431
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.900
which is when you know, when Hannah was so tired,

432
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.360
why does she feel that way? You know what? W what?

433
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:13.410
Because she's, she hasn't been sleeping well. Yeah, but, but what makes her,

434
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.000
you know, what is the essence of tiredness? Lack of sleep. Hello?

435
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.770
Chemically, I'm asking you chemically what is happening to her.

436
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.330
If you were way down in herself, could you see something tired like going on?

437
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.890
That's what I, that's a good question actually.

438
00:27:28.891 --> 00:27:32.020
I'm glad you think so because I know a guy who has a theory about this.

439
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.390
Did you see Tiger yesterday? Now? Tiger [inaudible].

440
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.240
He'd the best round of antibody. I mean the guy who's on the believable.

441
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:43.440
This is doctor gallon pack and in addition to being a rabid golf fan,

442
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:46.920
he's also a rabid, but can you be a rabid biologist? Sure.

443
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.600
At the University of Pennsylvania,

444
00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:52.500
he's been looking at sleep down at the cellular level and one thing that he's

445
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:56.340
found over and over and over, and that's been shown in Moses has been shown in,

446
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.050
has been shown in fruit fly,

447
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.410
is that inside certain cells in all those different animals,

448
00:28:01.411 --> 00:28:02.820
when they're sleep deprived,

449
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.030
essentially what happens is you don't get proteins properly for,

450
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.103
excuse me,

451
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:14.210
proteins properly folded a phenomenon called the unfolded protein response.

452
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.970
What on Earth does that mean? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

453
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.910
You're asking? Why do you need proteins to properly fold? Yeah,

454
00:28:19.911 --> 00:28:22.130
I guess that's what I'm asking. Well, your made of proteins.

455
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.840
Proteins are the essence of you. So if your proteins are misshapen,

456
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.980
if they're not folded properly, don't fold the proteins properly.

457
00:28:30.981 --> 00:28:34.100
They don't have the right three dimensional structure. And as a result,

458
00:28:34.101 --> 00:28:38.120
they start accumulating inside the south and then these different unfolded

459
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.720
proteins can aggregate together in front of [inaudible]

460
00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:44.043
<v 6>clumps</v>

461
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.960
<v 12>inside the cell and essentially clog it up.</v>

462
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.310
And it's really quite toxic to cells. Clumpiness equals tiredness.

463
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:59.220
It would be his formula. Remember when Hannah was so exhausted? Yeah.

464
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.730
God, this just sucks. Well,

465
00:29:00.731 --> 00:29:04.390
because she hasn't slept much really sad inside herself.

466
00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.470
Lots of these valuable little proteins have not folded properly that he thinks

467
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.840
is the consequence of not having enough sleep.

468
00:29:10.841 --> 00:29:15.070
So maybe what's going on is the cells can't do their business quite as well and

469
00:29:15.071 --> 00:29:19.480
things start to break down and that adds up across the whole of your body to a

470
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.460
few fueling. But when she gets to sleep,

471
00:29:24.461 --> 00:29:27.430
remember when she's so happy? Yeah. Suddenly feel like, wow,

472
00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.500
because of the sleep, I am so lucky.

473
00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:31.840
A group of cleaner reppers have gone through herself,

474
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:36.640
removed the toxic and misshapen proteins so that it affects sleep as the best

475
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:41.580
housemaid you've ever had in the hotel. Have you [inaudible]

476
00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.310
and this idea, the,

477
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:49.670
the idea of sleep as a cleaner upper might even explain one of the most basic

478
00:29:49.671 --> 00:29:50.870
things about us as humans,

479
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.130
<v 3>how we learn.</v>

480
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.390
That's the notion of doctor Giulio Tononi testing, testing, testing.

481
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.010
My producer Ellen Horn and I went to visit him at his offices in Madison,

482
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:06.190
Wisconsin. What are we expecting? What does he look like?

483
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.420
We don't know what he was like a football play,

484
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:16.070
but like a quarter backer. Titans. Not like a little like a going back here.

485
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.930
So big, but not overwhelming. Yes. Yeah. How do you even know that?

486
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:25.100
Yeah. Website C

487
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.970
<v 12>I was totally wrong. Now to be fair,</v>

488
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:33.230
he is a very attractive guy who has sandy blonde hair and glasses.

489
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.800
So you actually, the more the sensitive guy intellectual than a linebacker.

490
00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:38.870
Yeah. Introduce yourself. Um, Giulio Tononi.

491
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.200
I am a professional psychiatry here at University of Wisconsin Madison.

492
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.230
But when it comes to the subject of sleep, which is his specialty,

493
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.820
he takes sleep very seriously. Like what got you is in sleep.

494
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.850
Just sleep is the annihilation of consciousness.

495
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.150
So it's a terrible time in which everything disappears.

496
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.920
The universe and yourself with it.

497
00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.850
I think if people didn't sleep and didn't have the unconscious leap,

498
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.680
they possibly wouldn't even realize that continence is an enormous gift.

499
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:11.210
So being awake then is wonderful, but it's what happens when you're asleep.

500
00:31:11.211 --> 00:31:15.620
He says that's what allows you to make very important connections in your life.

501
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.570
And he noticed this first when he was connecting with the,

502
00:31:18.571 --> 00:31:21.560
I believe it was a guitar, just playing music. I used to play, for instance,

503
00:31:21.561 --> 00:31:22.640
I played classical guitar.

504
00:31:22.641 --> 00:31:27.641
I'm sure many people who play musical instruments know that you may train and

505
00:31:27.951 --> 00:31:32.420
train and train on a piece during the day and you get better for sure,

506
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.720
but you're never perfect. Oh,

507
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:41.780
and then you sleep over it the next day you wake up, you play it again,

508
00:31:41.781 --> 00:31:44.210
and now it's smooth and you know it flows beautiful.

509
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.700
That happened to you? It happened to me. It happens to lots of people

510
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.250
<v 4>that happened to me all the time.</v>

511
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:57.630
I discovered that sometimes if I worked on a piece and put it away and went to

512
00:31:57.731 --> 00:31:59.140
bed and cut some rust,

513
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.500
I had it better learned than if I stayed up all night cramming.

514
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.700
<v 1>Yeah, definitely.</v>

515
00:32:03.701 --> 00:32:07.660
There's one story and I hadn't thought about this for a long time, but,

516
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.630
well first of all Robin, I like play in a band together.

517
00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.960
The band is called the sisterhood of convoluted thinkers and we switch

518
00:32:13.961 --> 00:32:16.390
instruments like a lot. She's usually the bass player.

519
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.370
I was going to play drums and I had to learn how to play drums,

520
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:19.780
so we rented a cabin,

521
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.560
we went somewhere to rehearse and at night she was really just kind of

522
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.080
practicing and practicing and trying to get this written one particular be like,

523
00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.720
I worked on it like a lot.

524
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.780
I just keep going and going and playing that one thing again and again and

525
00:32:31.781 --> 00:32:32.614
again.

526
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:39.110
And I finally just gave up and went to sleep and the next morning I got up and

527
00:32:39.111 --> 00:32:43.880
went like straight to the kid and I just played it like immediately.

528
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.600
The bucket, the stool, she was [inaudible] book.

529
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.963
You could just do it.

530
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.890
I thought it was magic or you could just learn stuff in your sleep.

531
00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:56.491
<v 12>So wait,</v>

532
00:32:56.491 --> 00:32:59.970
they were showing the middle of the night somehow the things that your fingers

533
00:32:59.971 --> 00:33:04.050
did repeatedly and the notes that you were using to propel your fingers.

534
00:33:04.051 --> 00:33:06.570
All those things somehow got into, got more,

535
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:11.370
got better learned. So you learned overnight or you,

536
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.690
I mean what does have to do with it or you remember better in the morning? No.

537
00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.300
What happens is that the next day you're a bit better off what happens during

538
00:33:18.301 --> 00:33:21.030
the night to make you better off. This is up for contention.

539
00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:26.670
[inaudible] contention is that sleep helps you remember by forgetting a,

540
00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.390
and I don't know what that means. Let me explain to you what he's,

541
00:33:30.391 --> 00:33:35.010
what he's saying. He says there's a limited amount of space in your brain.

542
00:33:35.011 --> 00:33:36.620
The real estate in the brain speed, limited,

543
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:39.300
limited amount and make sense as a small little guy up there. Yep.

544
00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.140
And yet every experience you have during the day is going to take away some

545
00:33:43.141 --> 00:33:46.200
spaces up a little of what you got when you are awake.

546
00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.860
Inevitably you learn whether you want it or not.

547
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:53.250
You are going around and talking to me. Just having breakfast,

548
00:33:53.251 --> 00:33:55.110
have a medium coffee, going to work.

549
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:59.710
<v 13>Then you get on the phone with the you, with your friends, talking to your mom.</v>

550
00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.050
Very different from to the friends. Then going home,

551
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.120
<v 12>taking a bath. I picked the bath. Yeah, I get it. Again,</v>

552
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.900
everything you do during the day, every thought you think, no matter how small,

553
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.330
it all causes your brain to form new connections.

554
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:16.600
This conversation as we're having it is reshaping my brain. Yeah.

555
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.880
A little pathways are forming that weren't there before I sat down.

556
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:23.690
Whether we recognize it or not. Lots of things.

557
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:26.090
I go to change your brain by the end of the Waking Day.

558
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.720
So if in the middle of the afternoon you sit down with your guitar and you

559
00:34:29.721 --> 00:34:33.380
practice the guitar intently, those two hours,

560
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:37.070
you're also making connections and because you're concentrating,

561
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:41.540
maybe you're making more connections than you usually use or guitar connections

562
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.930
and all those synaptic connections made during the day. Wow.

563
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.903
I'll just have a meeting. Yeah,

564
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.400
<v 13>on the other other,</v>

565
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.950
<v 6>by the time you really, for sleep</v>

566
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.650
up in your head. Hello,

567
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.630
Miss [inaudible]

568
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:08.260
<v 12>and that is where we think sleep kicks in. Well, I'm going to guess here,</v>

569
00:35:08.261 --> 00:35:12.130
but I think you think that sleep is a garbage detail that comes into this. Okay.

570
00:35:12.131 --> 00:35:15.310
You're done. You're done. You're done. It's actually even simpler than that.

571
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.630
According to Noni, there's not really a janitor who comes in and decides, okay,

572
00:35:19.631 --> 00:35:23.110
you have to leave. You get to stay. Nothing like that. Instead he says,

573
00:35:23.111 --> 00:35:23.771
what happens?

574
00:35:23.771 --> 00:35:28.771
We think that during sleep waves of electrical activity,

575
00:35:28.781 --> 00:35:32.590
kind of like a late evening bath wash over your head,

576
00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.850
they start at the back of your head.

577
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:38.070
<v 1>Let me move to the front. These waves are called slow or summation,</v>

578
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.550
<v 12>and over the course of the night, 1000 times at night,</v>

579
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.420
those waves wash through all the experiences of your day,

580
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.800
all the little synaptic connections that you made all day long and every one of

581
00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:53.880
those connections, all of that gets just a little bit softer.

582
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.600
They get weaker progressively, gracefully. They get me even.

583
00:35:57.601 --> 00:36:02.100
He says the things you want to hold onto like the guitar. Wait a second.

584
00:36:02.101 --> 00:36:03.300
Wait a second.

585
00:36:03.301 --> 00:36:05.970
You were the one who said you learned how to play the instrument in the

586
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:09.780
afternoon. You went to sleep and you play the instrument better in the morning.

587
00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.810
Yeah. Why would you wake up the next morning playing better?

588
00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:17.811
You should play more weekly with less confidence and less memory because after

589
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:21.770
all, you've just given the whole place a bath. It's all relative, sir.

590
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.670
What he means by relative is this,

591
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.470
that that mess of new connections in your head. Yeah.

592
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.550
Some of those connections are softer. Some of those connections were louder.

593
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:34.620
The random things you ordered for lunch, they're softer. Okay. But the guitar,

594
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:37.440
because you spent so much time thinking about guitar technique,

595
00:36:37.441 --> 00:36:39.480
you spend so much energy on it. That's louder.

596
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.670
So we just measuring connections here.

597
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.630
Now imagine that sleep is a big volume knob.

598
00:36:45.631 --> 00:36:49.650
So listening to what happens when you lower the volume on the whole day

599
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.440
and lower. Yeah.

600
00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.810
You hear how the softer stuff just falls away. You can't hear it anymore. Yeah,

601
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.260
bad. The Guitar, while it's getting softer too,

602
00:37:04.261 --> 00:37:08.310
because it was so loud to begin with, now it stands out a bit more clearly now.

603
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:12.060
Yeah. The signal is sent up to the half survive reasonably well,

604
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.400
are heard better because the background has become more silent.

605
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.020
So your ability to play the guitar better the next morning is not because you've

606
00:37:19.021 --> 00:37:22.920
learned these skills overnight that you didn't have before is because all the

607
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:23.880
other stuff taken up.

608
00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:28.881
Your brain has gone down in volume and you're left with relatively speaking,

609
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:30.900
a better guitar

610
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:34.510
<v 0>fingering technique. You put your finger on it.</v>

611
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.700
So Mr Schenone feels that sleep is a little bit like we didn't like the process

612
00:37:42.581 --> 00:37:46.330
of erosion at the end of the day or rather at the beginning of the morning,

613
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.750
the things left standing are the things you need to know.

614
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.440
<v 12>We should, uh, we should go to break. Okay.</v>

615
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:11.390
So coming up next for those of us who can get the sleep next I change to dream.

616
00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.200

624
00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.200
Today's program is about sleep as in the kind of sleep where you pretend to

625
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:51.190
dream. Exactly. You. Do you know that story about the um, the benzine molecule?

626
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.280
No. Speaking of dreams. Hmm. Well,

627
00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:59.930
here in Kenzin 1865 German chemist is trying to figure out the shape of this

628
00:39:00.641 --> 00:39:01.510
molecule. Benzine.

629
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:03.940
He knows that has a certain amount of one kind of Adam and a certain amount of

630
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:07.390
another, but he can't figure out how they all link up. Right.

631
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:10.090
And he's tortured by this problem. Ghosts sleep. Yeah.

632
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.560
Has a dream of a snake biting it's tail, wakes up,

633
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.730
bolts right up and says it's a rain. It's a will.

634
00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.960
Do you believe that? I want to. Well, yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong.

635
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.300
I hate it when people tell me that dreams hate it.

636
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:29.220
I want to stab my eye with a fork. And frankly, when people tell me that just,

637
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.320
I don't know why I'm never going to tell you about my dreams again. I'm good.

638
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:36.790
But you know you're not alone because for a long time scientists have or have

639
00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:38.250
avoided studying dreams cause they,

640
00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:42.760
they think they're so random and meaningless and unstuck. Vulnerable, right?

641
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:47.560
But we did meet a guy, I'm Bob Stick Gold, S. T. I. C. K. G. O. L. D.

642
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:51.940
I'm an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who found an

643
00:39:51.941 --> 00:39:53.770
interesting way to ask the question,

644
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:57.750
<v 15>why do we dream? Simple question. Very hard answer.</v>

645
00:39:59.120 --> 00:39:59.720
<v 1>Robert.</v>

646
00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.400
Stick gold was one of the first modern scientists to take dreams seriously and

647
00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:07.080
for him it'd be actually began kind of by accident. I had,

648
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.200
<v 15>Vermont is my family. We had gone and climbed camel's Hump,</v>

649
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.590
one of the higher easy to climb mountains in Vermont.

650
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.810
We'd gone at eight in the morning. We were back at two in the afternoon

651
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.450
<v 1>and for that whole day he'd been up climbing on the rocks,</v>

652
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.920
gripping them with his hands, really climbing. Later that night, I lie down,

653
00:40:25.921 --> 00:40:26.880
I close my eyes

654
00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:29.763
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

655
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.440
<v 15>I can feel the rocks under my hands</v>

656
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:39.620
and I started startle up and I said, well, that's really bizarre.

657
00:40:39.621 --> 00:40:43.820
It wasn't like I was thinking about it. I was there. I could feel the rock.

658
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:50.630
I've been off the mountain for eight hours, nothing like that had happened.

659
00:40:50.631 --> 00:40:54.290
I lie down in bed for three minutes, starting to go to sleep and boom,

660
00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:58.460
it's there and I tried again and I fell asleep. Two hours later I wake up,

661
00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.920
I have to go to the bathroom and go to the bathroom. I come back and I say,

662
00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.160
that was way cool. I have to try that again

663
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.300
and I can not get it back.

664
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:12.160
What happened in those two hours to those memories that they won't intrude

665
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:16.630
anymore. And then I started talking to friends and they say, oh,

666
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.920
trike try canoeing or someone else says try, Huh?

667
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.650
Try Whitewater rafting if you want to get that and someone else's, oh hello,

668
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:28.651
take organic chemistry and you go to bed at night and all you see are these

669
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:32.890
bloody molecules rotating in front of your eyes. Those daytime

670
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.710
<v 3>are affecting your dreams. And that got him thinking,</v>

671
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:42.110
what exactly is the connection between what you do doing today and what you

672
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:45.140
dream at night? What are the rules of that? He figured, all right,

673
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.960
well this replay is kind of interesting. Maybe I'll test it,

674
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:51.590
but how if I get some subjects together,

675
00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:56.591
what could I have them do during the day that would reliably end up in their

676
00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:56.990
dreams?

677
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.080
But you can't have them all go for a hike and I'm probably not going to get

678
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:03.470
permission to take them Whitewater rafting. Too expensive. So what could he do?

679
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.750
Sort of set fallow for a year.

680
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.190
And I was moaning because some of my students about how I can't think of how to

681
00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:11.600
do this, and someone says

682
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:16.820
<v 15>Tetris, somebody else says, absolutely</v>

683
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:23.570
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

684
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:27.830
<v 15>and I'm saying, what? What? They said, well, don't you play Tetris? And I say,</v>

685
00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:29.450
yes, but when you start playing Tetris,

686
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:31.920
<v 16>sure.</v>

687
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.450
<v 1>Is that when you start playing touches</v>

688
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:35.860
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

689
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.700
<v 15>go to bed at night,</v>

690
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:41.110
you lie down in bed and you see tetris pieces falling down in front of your

691
00:42:41.111 --> 00:42:45.790
eyes. Sure, absolutely. Your eyeballs, you guys both know that?

692
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.983
Oh yeah.

693
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:53.190
I got a cover of Science magazine for the first published paper and dreaming in

694
00:42:53.501 --> 00:42:58.130
40 years because I discovered that and everybody already knew it.

695
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:01.930
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

696
00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.870
<v 15>it was that simple. He got a bunch of people, put them in a room,</v>

697
00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:05.830
had him play tetris.

698
00:43:05.831 --> 00:43:10.831
Later that night they woke up and 60% of them were dreaming of Tetris.

699
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.330
60% do you know that? I mean, just from their reports.

700
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:16.080
As they're falling asleep,

701
00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:20.290
we're monitoring them electric physiologically and as they start to drift off to

702
00:43:20.291 --> 00:43:22.480
sleep. These report. Now

703
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:26.270
<v 1>we have filming today.</v>

704
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.620
This tetris observation was a pretty good start in terms of getting at that

705
00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:33.650
question, why do we dream? Why we dream? How does it work?

706
00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:38.330
What if as a next step, instead of having the people report their own dreams,

707
00:43:38.331 --> 00:43:41.690
waking them up and doing that whole thing, what if instead you could cut the

708
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:45.250
<v 3>person out of the equation entirely and go right to the source,</v>

709
00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.000
to the dream directly certain that Wilson A,

710
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.660
I'm a researcher here at MIT and I'm a neuroscientist studying,

711
00:43:52.661 --> 00:43:54.850
learning and memory. That's what Matt Wilson

712
00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.600
<v 1>does. It takes us to the dream lab. When we first come in,</v>

713
00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:04.010
what we see is this bank of monitors, 13 monitors all in a row,

714
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.940
each monitor displaying ongoing activity in the brain, little panels,

715
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.070
each panel, uh, showing the [inaudible].

716
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.800
<v 3>It's like the Kennedy Space Center.</v>

717
00:44:11.801 --> 00:44:15.160
Really all the monitors have data just flashing all over them.

718
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.950
Graphs and squiggly lines and numbers.

719
00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.470
It's not immediately clear where all this information is coming from,

720
00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.210
but if you peek around the back,

721
00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.000
you'll see that all the computer wires go to one box,

722
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.740
which then connects to a cable,

723
00:44:26.741 --> 00:44:31.740
which then goes up to the ceiling over to a wall and down into the head to the

724
00:44:31.741 --> 00:44:32.010
head

725
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.550
<v 1>generated of one sitting tiny red areas. Yes.</v>

726
00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.240
It was just kind of hanging out in his own little basket. So even just resting,

727
00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.480
is that the little guy himself? Yeah,

728
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.380
he looks pretty normal except for this cable coming out of his skull and the

729
00:44:46.381 --> 00:44:49.050
cable is basically a microphone or a bunch of them,

730
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:52.980
which Matt uses to ease drop on the brain cells inside the rat's head.

731
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:55.950
As they chitchat and this is what that sounds like.

732
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.493
<v 5>Okay.</v>

733
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.920
<v 17>You can hear this kind of snap crackle, pop sound.</v>

734
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:06.880
These are individual cells that are firing like a [inaudible].

735
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.753
<v 5>Sure.</v>

736
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.950
<v 17>There one of those kind of whooshing sound,</v>

737
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.790
I can tell this animal is sitting resting quietly.

738
00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.330
<v 1>Amazingly. He says as well, he has his back to the animal.</v>

739
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:24.260
He is so fluent with the Morris Code language of the rat's brain sales.

740
00:45:24.261 --> 00:45:27.500
He doesn't even have to actually look at the animal to know what it's doing.

741
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:30.410
You can just instantly decode all of that snapping,

742
00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.670
kind of like that guy in the matrix. The ball guy, I don't even see the code.

743
00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.930
All I see is bond Brunette redhead just by listening.

744
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.170
Matt knows when the animal is sitting, he knows when it is sleeping.

745
00:45:42.171 --> 00:45:46.070
He knows when it's running around and amaze even can tell which direction it's

746
00:45:46.071 --> 00:45:46.860
running. Just happened

747
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.520
<v 17>that as we were studying these patterns, while the animal ran around,</v>

748
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.370
after the experiments, the animals would, they would get tired.

749
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:56.670
They would go to sleep. I would be firing there in the room,

750
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.830
but I would continue to listen to the activity.

751
00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.360
You notice how it's gotten silent? Yeah.

752
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.390
I began to notice that the animals were asleep.

753
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:08.220
The brain cells weren't just firing randomly in animals.

754
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.240
We're going to rem sleep.

755
00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:10.300
<v 5>Okay,</v>

756
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:14.800
<v 17>now he is in bed going into rem right now. The pattern of activity here,</v>

757
00:46:14.801 --> 00:46:15.550
notice that it's not,

758
00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:19.810
these rushes anymore sounded very much like the pattern that the animal had just

759
00:46:19.811 --> 00:46:23.500
been running through. In fact, if you weren't watching the animal,

760
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:26.560
you would think, oh, animals gotten up and it's running around again.

761
00:46:26.561 --> 00:46:29.290
But then you turn and you look and you see the animal is asleep.

762
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:33.200
<v 1>He checked the data and it wasn't simply that the rat was running around in its</v>

763
00:46:33.201 --> 00:46:36.860
mind while its body was asleep. It seemed to be running a specific route.

764
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.910
The same route in fact that it had run earlier in the day. Same sequence,

765
00:46:40.911 --> 00:46:45.320
same order, same everything. Yes, it was rerunning it's maze,

766
00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.730
step for step. So then he asked the next question,

767
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.700
<v 17>are they seeing the things that they saw while they were awake?</v>

768
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.920
We can actually look into these questions as a rat fan. So the answers,

769
00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:57.860
the answers,

770
00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:01.310
we see evidence of replay and basically all of the parts of the brain that we

771
00:47:01.311 --> 00:47:02.144
have looked in,

772
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.180
<v 1>they see the maze that they ran through the very same maze. Yes,</v>

773
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.690
that is streaming in a sense they are, how do we define dreaming?

774
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:12.770
So sounds like dreaming to me, but the question remains,

775
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.980
why would the rat or any creature do this?

776
00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:19.400
And so Matt came up with a simple next experiment.

777
00:47:19.401 --> 00:47:21.800
He decided to give the rat to mazes.

778
00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:24.620
What would that do to extremes at the night or whatever you want to call them

779
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:29.850
<v 17>if they run on maze number one and then on as number two we see them running</v>

780
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.690
maze one in maze two together in a way that they did not experience when they

781
00:47:34.691 --> 00:47:35.524
were awake.

782
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:40.460
<v 12>Oh, so it's like a remix new pattern that includes part of maize one and part of</v>

783
00:47:40.461 --> 00:47:43.670
phase two. It turns out that when the Rad had more than one maze and its memory,

784
00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:47.210
it began to invent completely new mazes,

785
00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:52.300
<v 17>gives us the thought that sleep is this unique opportunity to basically run</v>

786
00:47:52.671 --> 00:47:53.990
through events,

787
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:58.550
to put them together in ways that may not have occurred

788
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.890
<v 0>while the animals were awake and that's what learning really is.</v>

789
00:48:03.891 --> 00:48:05.360
Learning is about synthesis,

790
00:48:05.361 --> 00:48:09.440
about taking things that were apparently unrelated and figuring out the

791
00:48:09.441 --> 00:48:12.800
connection as figuring out the rules, the hidden rules,

792
00:48:12.801 --> 00:48:17.270
the undiscovered rules that will allow us to create something new.

793
00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:22.330
I think dreaming is a time when we try out possibilities that in waking we might

794
00:48:24.651 --> 00:48:28.660
not feel were worth trying and when it really works, it's,

795
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.780
it can be profoundly important. If Robert's dead gold is right,

796
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.280
then how does this solving the problem thing? How does it work?

797
00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.590
How does the brain decide what to put

798
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.380
<v 12>into a dream and what to leave out of a dream?</v>

799
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:45.440
One of the interesting things about dreams is that people don't have dreams

800
00:48:45.441 --> 00:48:49.370
where their word processing, where they're surfing the net,

801
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.810
these things that they spent huge amounts of their day doing don't get into

802
00:48:53.811 --> 00:48:57.620
their dreams, but somehow tetris gets in there every time we die.

803
00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.080
And why would that be? Well, he has a hunch,

804
00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.780
which he's actually exploring with it completely different video games.

805
00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:07.310
We've moved to a game called Alpine racer, which we bought out of a arcade.

806
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:12.290
She showed us, took us down the hall to uh, to the game room. Here we are,

807
00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:17.240
and there in the corner it stood mockingly oh wow.

808
00:49:17.241 --> 00:49:20.750
It's a full body game. Please step up. I step up to the right.

809
00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:21.860
It's trying to lock itself.

810
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:27.730
It's still warming up and then I set off down a virtual mountain.

811
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.630
<v 7>Alright, I'm going down the hill. I am also a girl.</v>

812
00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.720
I'm also avoiding the ski for what I'm doing. Take a nice little turn there.

813
00:49:35.721 --> 00:49:40.670
Be careful of the little wall straight down the head and down we go. Oh No, no,

814
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.650
the tree [inaudible] we're not going to go through the tunnel.

815
00:49:45.651 --> 00:49:49.760
This is a [inaudible]. Oh, that hurt. As you can hear,

816
00:49:49.761 --> 00:49:53.480
this game was really stressful, I would say, which is by design.

817
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:57.320
Robert stickle has the theory that as you go through your day,

818
00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:00.950
your brain is constantly keeping track of emotion. That's the thing.

819
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.910
<v 12>Emotional content, like when you run into a virtual tree for example,</v>

820
00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.990
your brain is going to flag that stuff. It's going to flag that as important.

821
00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.440
It says, Ooh, I need to remember this so I can work on it later.

822
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.030
I'm going to put a sticky on this one.

823
00:50:14.031 --> 00:50:17.030
So if it puts a sticky on everything that's hard during the day,

824
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.900
then all the brain has to do when it's creating a dream is go and grab it.

825
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.960
<v 7>Sticky. Aw, I did. I died but I died. Nice.</v>

826
00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.040
<v 12>Just for record, you've got further</v>

827
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.660
<v 3>than jet on your first try. Oh Wow. Wow. It's like,</v>

828
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.710
eh. That's okay. Could you say that again?

829
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:41.180
So you have people play at Alpine racer for 45 minute bursts throughout the day.

830
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.170
What happens next?

831
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:45.890
You wake them up to monitor their brain activity and just as they're falling

832
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:48.890
asleep within the first two minutes after they fall asleep,

833
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.593
<v 15>we'll wake them up.</v>

834
00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:56.870
There's some microphone right next to them in their bed and they just report

835
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:58.550
what was going through their minds.

836
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:04.120
I was just thinking about scanning and we get on the first night up to 40% of

837
00:51:06.711 --> 00:51:11.560
all the reports being about skiing, the game that I've been playing.

838
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.950
Okay. Ski Racer, again, 40% almost half of them,

839
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.510
and that's right up there.

840
00:51:17.511 --> 00:51:21.470
What I would expect to see after trauma where something has been labeled so

841
00:51:21.471 --> 00:51:24.440
intensely that the brain says, okay, it's obvious

842
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.980
<v 3>what's on the agenda for tonight. Stickle things.</v>

843
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:30.920
He's seeing the outline of the dream making process here.

844
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:33.710
It starts really simply the very beginning of sleep,

845
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.500
like right after you fall asleep with the replay.

846
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:41.060
This he suspects as just the brain emptying out at sticky things that really

847
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:44.180
intrigued me during the day that they felt during the day. Yeah,

848
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:47.960
but what happens if we let the people go to sleep?

849
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.490
Sleep two hours like I did that very first time after climbing the mountain,

850
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:57.080
wakes them up after two hours of sleep because remember he couldn't get back the

851
00:51:57.081 --> 00:52:00.620
memory of the rocks after he'd spent two hours of sleep. That's right,

852
00:52:00.621 --> 00:52:04.040
and what he's found is that if you fast forward two hours into the dream,

853
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:06.320
get almost no reports of skiing at all,

854
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.400
the replay seems to dissolve into a remix.

855
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.810
You start getting reports like,

856
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:17.410
<v 15>oh, I jumped. I was sliding down a hill going down hill,</v>

857
00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.760
just rolling down a hill.

858
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.520
I was about to say it downhill. Banana.

859
00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:27.520
I was thinking about skateboarding.

860
00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:31.860
I was thinking about about a bunch of bananas. He slope.

861
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.063
Someone else

862
00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.640
<v 3>had a dream that they were rushing through a forest with their body,</v>

863
00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:40.880
incredibly stiff and their legs not moving at all.

864
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.150
As if they were on a conveyor belt. It's like as the dream goes on,

865
00:52:44.151 --> 00:52:46.400
the brain is starting to free associate.

866
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.240
What do I have in my past that has anything to do with mountains,

867
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:54.380
anything to do with crashing or skiing, anything at all that can help me.

868
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.720
What do I have in all my memories,

869
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:02.200
my case from the last 60 years that fits associatively thematically and the

870
00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:07.670
result, well might seem random. It is, but every so often he says,

871
00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.080
you come up with the right answer.

872
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:13.580
So now we get to your dreams of people discovering the structure of benzene.

873
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:19.160
Cuco was his name. [inaudible] excellent August calculus.

874
00:53:19.161 --> 00:53:23.090
He was a German guy I talked about earlier who had a dream of a snake eating its

875
00:53:23.091 --> 00:53:26.100
tail and realized from that dream that the shape

876
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.000
<v 1>of the benzene molecule is a ring. I don't know if that dream is true,</v>

877
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.210
but maybe that is in fact the point of dreaming.

878
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.870
It's this time when you shut off the outside, turn inside,

879
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:40.470
take the problems that you've got and start to really work on them,

880
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:41.310
pull them apart,

881
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.540
make connections that you wouldn't normally make during the day.

882
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:46.943
<v 15>Oh, however,</v>

883
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:51.490
have you ever wondered why would it be necessary when solving problems like this

884
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.740
to dream so vividly?

885
00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:57.610
Are you at all puzzled by the super duper technicolor,

886
00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:01.090
extraordinarily cinematic quality of some of these things?

887
00:54:01.091 --> 00:54:05.860
Because if it were just an every day brain function to sort of make sense of the

888
00:54:05.861 --> 00:54:07.510
world and allow you to make new connections,

889
00:54:07.511 --> 00:54:12.200
you really wouldn't need quite the the movie quality.

890
00:54:12.201 --> 00:54:14.890
So when we talk about dreams,

891
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.710
what seems to come into dreams are memories, concepts, relationships,

892
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.880
associations that have a strong emotional flavor and I'm guessing from the data

893
00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:32.470
need a full blown orchestration to be properly processed.

894
00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:36.550
And it is, it's technical or the colors are are overwhelming almost.

895
00:54:36.551 --> 00:54:38.940
So if I hear you right, what you're saying in Robert's question about why is it

896
00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:43.230
<v 1>dreams? So a vivid is that, I don't know,</v>

897
00:54:43.231 --> 00:54:45.210
but maybe the vividness

898
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.650
<v 15>helps that whole long answers. What a Harvard professor says. Instead of saying,</v>

899
00:54:49.651 --> 00:54:50.484
I don't know.

900
00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:55.803
<v 1>I guess we should wrap up.</v>

901
00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.570
