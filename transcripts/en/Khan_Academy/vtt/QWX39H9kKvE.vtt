00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.860
- [Instructor] Use one rotation
to map quadrilateral ABCD

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.260
to the other quadrilateral.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.580
So to map this one to
this one right over here.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.070
Use a number between zero
and 360 degrees to describe

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.903
the angle.

00:00:11.903 --> 00:00:13.720
Counter-clockwise is positive.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.820
So we're going to want to
move is counter-clockwise

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.750
to try and get it to map there.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.830
And the only option they
give us 'cause they want us

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.220
to do it with one rotation
is the rotation tool.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.450
And so we have to think about
what do you we want to rotate

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.330
around what point and if
we put it right over here,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.390
it looks like this point point
A does correspond to this

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.172
point right over here.

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:36.570
So if we were to rotate this
around, if we were to rotate

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.280
this around not 90 but
it looks like 180 degrees

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.410
around this point, point
A would show up over here,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.410
it feels like point let's see
is that right is that right

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.940
or let's actually just try it out.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.930
Point A would show up over,
no no no that's not right,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600
that doesn't seem to...

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.950
Let's try it out.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.650
'Cause if we rotated 180
degrees, oh actually I was right

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.401
it did match up, that's why
this is interesting, it tests

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:11.400
your visualization skills.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.060
So it did actually match
up and what I did is I put

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.180
that point of rotation
exactly between those points

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.092
but because it looked like
180 degrees around this point,

00:01:19.092 --> 00:01:23.610
so rotation by 180 degrees
about negative one negative one

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.450
so the center of rotation is
negative one negative one,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.380
the angle of rotation is 180 degrees.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.380
Point A maps to this point
right over here, so point A

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.680
maps to the point one negative
one, one negative one.

00:01:42.952 --> 00:01:47.320
And point C point C which is
diagonally opposite point A

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.370
maps to this point right
over here, which is six

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.370
negative six, six negative
six, six negative six

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.003
and we got it right.
