(upbeat electro music)

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.856 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well, the Mississippi,
we refer to as

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.958
the nation's sewer
system around here.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.726
The quality of the
water is atrocious,

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.429 line:0%
and would I jet ski
on the Mississippi?

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.330 line:0%
Ain't no way in hell.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.399 line:0%
(laughs)

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:37.570 align:start position:0%
- What else do you do when your
chase boat runs out of gas?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.605
Nothin.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.206
You just chill out.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.277
Five miles in our chase
boat runs out of gas,

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.379
which is amazing because
we have two chase boats,

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.415
and one is captained
by a man named Bill,

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.451 align:start size:97% position:3%
he just loves wearing
shorts, hates wearing shirts,

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.819
and hates sunscreen.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.888
(audience laughs)

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.956
So I call him tomato shorts,

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.858 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he just takes off,
so we have no idea

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.261
where he is, and then
our second captain,

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.630 line:0%
his name is Darrell,
he's a very nice man,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.399 line:0%
he's a professional
massage therapist,

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.635
and then also a boat captain,

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.236
(audience laughs)

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.604
but maybe not the best one

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.573 align:start size:81% position:19%
since he's run out
of fucking gas.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.576
(suspenseful music)

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.481
- [Man In Red Hat] There's
truly a guy on the barge

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.918 align:start size:88% position:13%
just watching us slowly
at ramming speed.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.255 align:start size:84% position:16%
So should we be
shooting off flairs?

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.058
Anchor.

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.694
- Yeah it's dropped,
we've been dragging it.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:37.664 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- And we're just slowly
drifting directly into it.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.165
We're toast.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:43.336 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just hope that Kurt is safe,
that's all my real hope is.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.704
- This is insane.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I'm going at
two miles per hour,

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.976
so I don't run out of gas, so
that we can just go and see

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:52.212
if there's a gas
station up ahead.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.947
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.249
I don't even know.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.518
- [Guy In Red Hat] Hold on,
they got the anchors goin'.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.287
Watch your heads,
watch your eyes.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.358 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Pull down the
antennae if you can.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.094
(dramatic music)

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.075
- There's our rescuers.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.277
What a warm and fuzzy feeling.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.880
- [Kurt] So finally,
Captain Bill shows up,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.115 align:start size:84% position:16%
back from his beach
ball audition,

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:30.116
or wherever the fuck he was,

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:31.284
(audience laughs)

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.720 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it's tomato
shorts to the rescue!

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.654
- [Guy In Red Hat] How
many miles we gotta go

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.156
to get to the gas station?

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.457 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- John's gonna be bringing
us gas to the next grid

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.925 line:0%
- Oh, they're bringing us gas.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.460 line:0%
- They're bringing us
gas to the next grid.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.995 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You gotta just take
life by the horns

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.696
and just run out of gas,

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.432 align:start size:97% position:3%
and get towed by a shirtless
guy you met two days ago.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:49.269 align:start size:97% position:3%
Really, never did a criminal
check on him at all.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.237
This is Roustabout style, man.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.372
Way cool.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.974
(mellow music)

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.283
Is it black Dave or white Dave?

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.484
- [Billy] White Dave.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.919
- Oh, white Dave?

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:10.223
I kinda wish it was black Dave.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.559
We're gonna make it guys.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.727 align:start size:84% position:16%
We shouldn't have
eaten Catherine, that
was a huge mistake.

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.362
That was my bad.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:19.465
Wait, Dave, it's me, little
minnow, I come for your gas!

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:23.136
We haven't seen Kurt
in probably four hours.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:32.445
This could be our dudes too.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.881 align:start size:81% position:19%
Man, this could
be a full reunion.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.183
- What a fine day on the river!

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:38.318
- Good first day!

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.986
- It's an exciting first day!

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.754 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're in an
industrial wasteland.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.389
Chase boat ran out of gas.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.958
I'm running on fumes,

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:49.229 align:start position:0%
and if we touch the water right
now, we'll get electrified.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.297 align:start size:97% position:3%
While this is all happening,
we're above a place

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.666
which is called a Fish Barrier,

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.501
so there's an invasive species

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.537 align:start size:88% position:13%
that's coming up the
Mississippi river called

00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:01.007 align:start size:97% position:3%
Asian Carp, and if they
make it, to the great lakes,

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.009
they'll destroy the ecosystem.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.978
This is why I love humans.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.913
Humans have come
up with the idea,

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.182 align:start size:94% position:6%
with this man made
problem they're gonna fix,

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.852
by just electrifying
the water in the river.

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.053
(audience laughs)

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.555
That's the plan!

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:20.293 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's called a fish barrier,
and the water is electrocuted,

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.428 align:start size:84% position:16%
so anything that
goes through it dies,

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.464
that's where we decide to stop

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:26.165
to fill up our boats with gas.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.569
(audience laughs)

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:30.670
Where are we?

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.472
We're in hell!

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.706
We are in hell!

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:42.615
So that gas fiasco took
hours out of our day,

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.183
and I had a show
to do that night,

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:46.719
so we needed to get the
boats out of the water,

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.920
and meet the road crew so they

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.789
could take me to the gig by car

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.491
We literally can't find
a place to get the boat

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.327
out of the water,
so we have to stop

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.996
at an abandoned grain silo,

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:58.231
which I don't know if you guys

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:00.266
have seen an abandoned
grain silo recently,

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:02.035
looks like a fucking
nightmare factory.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.269
(audience laughs)

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:05.571
So let's just take
a tour a little bit,

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:08.207
of where we've landed.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.109
(eerie music)

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:13.146 align:start size:94% position:6%
Bad thoughts and feelings
are loaded up here,

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:18.017 align:start size:97% position:3%
anything like childhood
trauma, bats, spiders, rats,

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:19.752
they all get loaded on here,

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.020 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they're brought
up and they're

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.389
ground into a very fine dust,

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.160
then they're stored here for
whenever children go to sleep.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.329
(screams)

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.436
Alright, I need a snack bar.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:42.342
The road crew finally finds us
down an unlabeled dirt road.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.545
Never been so happy to see
a Ford F-150 in my life.

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:47.513
And when the trailer gets
there to get the boats

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.615
out of the water, the
only trailer we brought

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:51.050
has broken an axel?

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.884
(audience laughs)

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.119 line:0%
- It just sheared off.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.953 line:0%
- It just sheared off.

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:54.787 line:0%
Of course it did.

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:55.621 line:0%
(laughs)

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:56.556
- Holy crap.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.257
- That's, I'm not surprised.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.359
Just so you're clear.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.660
This is day one.

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:03.996
This is 12 hours in.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.033
Well, we've got three
wheels on our trailer,

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.234
that's not enough?

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.169
I guess it's gonna
have to be, isn't it?

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.373 align:start size:97% position:3%
We've gone like 23 miles
total, and we haven't raised

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.409 align:start size:84% position:16%
a single dollar since
we left Chicago!

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.045 align:start size:97% position:3%
But, at least we crash
landed someplace beautiful,

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:22.281 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I learned how
nightmares get made.

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:24.050
Yeah, we did it guys.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.518
We really did it.

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:26.486
Roustabout.

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:27.320
Day one.

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:31.224
(slow music)

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:40.500
(metal music)

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:55.114
I've been to the
nightmare factory!

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:57.150 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now it's time for
you to do your part.

bit better, come on!

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:04.357
Click it, click it!

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:05.958
Or just watch some
more Roustabout.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.226
Either or!

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:08.227
Your choice.
