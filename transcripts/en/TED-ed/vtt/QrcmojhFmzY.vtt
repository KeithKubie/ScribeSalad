00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:10.995
His reign marked the beginning 
of one of history’s greatest empires

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:13.926
and the end of one of its first republics.

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:15.475
Was Rome’s first emperor

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:19.764
a visionary leader who guaranteed 
his civilization’s place in history

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:22.931
or a tyrant who destroyed its core values?

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:26.460
Find out in History versus Augustus.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.978
Order, order.

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:31.762
The defendant today is Gaius Octavius?

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:33.858
Gaius Julius Caesar/Augustus...

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:35.339
Do we have the wrong guy?

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:36.339
No, your Honor.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.145
Gaius Octavius, born in 63 BCE, 
was the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:44.066
He became Gaius Julius Caesar

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.791
upon being named his great-uncle’s 
adoptive son and heir.

00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:51.417
And he gained the title Augustus in 27 BCE

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:54.008
when the Senate granted 
him additional honors.

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:58.594
You mean when he established 
sole authority and became emperor of Rome.

00:00:58.594 --> 00:00:59.424
Is that bad?

00:00:59.424 --> 00:01:02.374
Didn’t every place have some king 
or emperor back then?

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:03.434
Actually, your Honor,

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:06.994
the Roman people had overthrown 
their kings centuries before

00:01:06.994 --> 00:01:08.884
to establish a republic,

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:13.595
a government meant to serve the people,
not the privilege of a ruling family.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:16.535
And it was Octavius 
who destroyed this tradition.

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.018
Octavius was a model public servant.

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:22.130
At 16, he was elected 
to the College of Pontiffs

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.019
that supervised religious worship.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:27.742
He fought for Rome in Hispania 
alongside his great-uncle Caesar

00:01:27.742 --> 00:01:31.405
and took up the responsibility 
of avenging Caesar’s death

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:35.807
when the corrupt oligarchs in the Senate
betrayed and murdered him.

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:39.370
Caesar had been a power-hungry tyrant 
who tried to make himself a king

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.787
while consorting with 
his Egyptian queen Cleopatra.

00:01:42.787 --> 00:01:43.950
After his death,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.186
Octavius joined his general Mark Antony

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:49.186
in starting a civil war 
that tore Rome apart,

00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:53.537
then stabbed his ally in the back 
to increase his own power.

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:54.936
Antony was a fool.

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:57.320
He waged a disastrous campaign in Parthia

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.504
and plotted to turn Roman territories

00:01:59.504 --> 00:02:03.218
into personal kingdoms 
for himself and Cleopatra.

00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:05.519
Isn’t that what Caesar 
had been accused of?

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:06.253
Well...

00:02:06.253 --> 00:02:08.951
So Octavius destroyed Antony 
for trying to become a king

00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:10.758
and then became one himself?

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:11.563
That’s right.

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:16.514
You can see the megalomania even in 
his adopted title – "The Illustrious One."

00:02:16.514 --> 00:02:18.572
That was a religious honorific.

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:21.288
And Augustus didn’t seek power 
for his own sake.

00:02:21.288 --> 00:02:24.689
As winner of the civil war 
and commander of the most troops,

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.789
it was his duty to restore 
law and order to Rome

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:30.367
so that other factions 
didn’t continue fighting.

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:33.715
He didn’t restore the law -
he made it subordinate to him!

00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:34.640
Not true.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.290
Augustus worked to restore 
the Senate’s prestige,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.807
improved food security 
for the lower classes,

00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:44.224
and relinquished control of 
the army when he resigned his consul post.

00:02:44.224 --> 00:02:45.771
Mere optics.

00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:48.291
He used his military influence 
and personal wealth

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:50.745
to stack the Senate in his favor,

00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:52.941
while retaining the powers of a tribune

00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.957
and the right to celebrate 
military triumphs.

00:02:55.957 --> 00:02:59.168
He kept control of provinces 
with the most legions.

00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:00.425
And if that wasn’t enough,

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:05.142
he assumed the consul position 
twice more to promote his grandchildren.

00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:07.925
He was clearly trying 
to establish a dynasty.

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:09.841
But what did he do with all that power?

00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:11.552
Glad you asked, your Honor.

00:03:11.552 --> 00:03:14.823
Augustus’s accomplishments 
were almost too many to name.

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:18.004
He established consistent 
taxation for all provinces,

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:21.309
ending private exploitation 
by local tax officials.

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:25.394
He personally financed a network of roads
and employed couriers

00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:29.243
so news and troops could travel
easily throughout the realm.

00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:30.727
And it was under Augustus

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:34.514
that many of Rome’s famous 
public buildings were constructed.

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:38.255
The writers of the time were nearly 
unanimous in praising his rule.

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:40.491
Did the writers have any other choice?

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:44.026
Augustus exiled plenty of people 
on vague charges,

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:47.177
including Ovid, 
one of Rome’s greatest poets.

00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:51.596
And you forgot to mention the intrusive 
laws regarding citizens’ personal lives –

00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:53.030
punishing adultery,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.479
restricting marriage 
between social classes,

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.162
even penalties for remaining unmarried.

00:03:58.162 --> 00:04:01.813
He was trying to improve the citizenry
and instill discipline.

00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:03.189
And he succeeded.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.080
His legacy speaks for itself:

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.163
40 years of internal stability,

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:11.530
a professional army that expanded 
Rome’s frontiers in all directions,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.399
and a government still remembered 
as a model of civic virtue.

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.330
His legacy was an empire

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.876
that would go on to wage endless 
conquest until it collapsed,

00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:23.976
and a tradition of military autocracy.

00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:27.131
Any time a dictator in a general’s uniform
commits atrocities

00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:29.865
while claiming to act on behalf 
of "the people,"

00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:32.713
we have Augustus Caesar to thank.

00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:35.132
So you’re saying Augustus 
was a good emperor,

00:04:35.132 --> 00:04:38.136
and you’re saying there’s no such thing?

00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:40.732
We’re used to celebrating 
historical leaders

00:04:40.732 --> 00:04:42.830
for their achievements and victories.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.449
But to ask whether an individual should 
have such power in the first place

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.295
is to put history itself on trial.
