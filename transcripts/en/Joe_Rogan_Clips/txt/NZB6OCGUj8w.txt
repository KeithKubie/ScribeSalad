Speaker 1:          00:00          When you put together these drills and you put together these programs, do you, do you just sit down and map it all out in your head? Do you think like, okay, how am I going to emulate the kind of stress in a like a life or death gunfight? Your, your heart rate jacked. You might have to physically do something meant to run from someone or climb over something. Is that how you do? How do you create yeah, you're talking about like the youtube stuff where I do the yeah, like physical thing with the shoe. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28          The first thing I do is I, I put it on my calendar just so I know that I'm going to make one and then I'll start thinking about or what haven't I done? Cause I have to think also, uh, I have to think about the audience, the audience that follows me on youtube. A lot of more gun guys. So they want, they want to know about the gun that I'm using to have to think about that. And then I have to think, all right, what challenge can cause I want guys to replicate it. I want them to like put those little notes on the Uta. I did this and my time was a minute and 30, or whatever it was. So I want him to be able to replicate them as well. And um, Juan make them, uh, rear with some real world application in mind, you know, so front loading a sandbag or uh, getting in, pulling something in and out of a call and doing that with the [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:27          Have you punched your reputations? You know, when you're doing dead weight in and out of a car, you know, 150 pounds pulling it in, pushing it out, pulling it back in and pushing it out. That'll smoke every freaking ounce of your being and it'll crush your spirits. I know. It's crazy, right? A full grown woman, you will be able to pick her up and put it in a car. Easy. No hard tried getting her out. Right. Especially if there's no, you know, you gotta think deadweight yeah, what did this person is incapacitated. They ain't helping you. Those arms just, you know, those limbs are moving everywhere and it is a pain in the Dick. Yeah, you're way better off with 150 pound barbell. Oh yeah. That way. Yeah. It's like, all right. That's just that, just your shoulder pull it out and, yeah. So, but I kept to keep those things.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Yeah. Mine. Uh, the other thing I want to do is I want to make them kind of wanting to make a pardon of. So not everybody could do it, uh, because I want to do something that mind, like industry competitors are not doing. And I've, I've turned this, I've, I've, uh, started a kind of a fad I bought 10 years ago were more guys are doing this now they're putting like shoots up on inner webs, you know, with some physical activity prior to or during a witch. Yeah. Good. But, uh, and I'm pretty sure I, uh, you know, I, uh, I made it cool. Well, the more people doing it, the better. Right? The more competition, the better. Yup. Yeah. It's, it's just such a smart thing to think of if you're, if you really want to train the way you train and really want to think about, you know, like tactical situations and real world application.

Speaker 1:          03:14          I mean, such a great way to go about doing it. And if it looks exciting and fun. I me, I haven't done it, but I'm sure it's fun. It's good. I talk a lot during my court now during my courses. I don't do this stuff, you know, I'm not cause I have, I'll have 60 year old women in it. I'll have guys with Parkinson's, even man come to my course. I have guys in real chairs. Yeah, I have a guys. How do you, how do you stabilize a guy when they have Parkinson's? That's good. That's what I showed this guy a trick. What was his name? See if I could remember his name. It doesn't matter, but he was 77 years old and uh, he said, well, I could either come to your course and train or lay on my couch and die. I was like something, you know, it was to that effect because he likes to shoot.

Speaker 1:          03:56          I cipro anytime, but I have to modify the course to him now because he can't even be prone to zero. So I would sit him on um, on a cooler. And then I used a, you know, furring strips are, they hold up a target. They're just two, one by twos, you know, about five foot long. I had him, Kris Cross those and hold them and then V to v Notch and it put his rifle and that Vena watch cause he could sit up pretty good with, he couldn't get into prone, you can't stand shoot but sitting pretty good. And you know when, uh, when guys like that are concentrating more, you see that shake go away too. Hey, that's something we do at my gym too. We train Parkinson's a tata box Parkinson patients. Really? It's a, it's a, it's a national program called rock steady boxing.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Huh? They come in twice, three times a week. Where's your gym? North Carolina. What's it called? So people could go there? Spar tech spar a s p a r like smaller. And then TC, is it open to yeah, it's all, yeah, it's open. Um, it, uh, it's, it's very fight centric. It's an MMA gym. So everything we do is very like fight centric with the, with the physical work and lifting and all of that. Uh, and then we have, uh, programs like there's, we've got, we've got some really good fighters, man, dude, coach there. I mean, they're like legit. Um, so we got really good fighters, uh, who do a one on one coaching, um, everything from Greco to Bjj to, uh, tie bogs to kickboxing to stand boxing. Uh, it's, it's an, it's a neat place. It's, it's small. It's warehouse. It's very spartan, you know, it's not sexy at all.

Speaker 1:          05:56          Perfect. Yeah, it's my favorite kind of jam. Freaking. It's Badass. And so what do you do with these Parkinson's people? So the rock steady boxing, uh, folks, they have a program, they come in a couple of times a week and they put them through a series of exercises. You know, a lot of it's just walking a straight line, uh, holding this in Wa, you know, loading one side. And then once they're all warmed up, um, they all kit up, man, you see these guys are wrapping and everything. You know, they're so excited to get there and they put the wraps on and uh, and then they have, they work a series of a bag, drills, you know, uh, one, two lateral move to next bag is, uh, hooks, you know, left and right hooks and there's an upper cut bag and there's a, you know, the double end bag.

Speaker 1:          06:45          And granted, they're not moving you, they're not moving much, but they're moving and they get there and they love coming there. Uh, and uh, some of them work up a sweat. You know, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty amazing seeing them get off their asses and get to the gym. And I look, I remember you put something out and I pinged you like a year ago, it was a on a podcast and you were, uh, you were getting pretty emotional about somebody not loaning to a out. And I pinged you and I said, I think I've mentioned that we got fucking Parkinson's people coming to my gym. You know, it's just when people make those excuses, that just drives me crazy because I've seen examples where I've been very fortunate that I have good health, but I've seen many examples and I've also been very fortunate that I never got out of shape.

Speaker 1:          07:33          I just kept working on my whole life. But I've seen people that are fat as fuck, 350 pounds just barely can get, get a w all round and then they decide I'm going to take control my fucking health. And then they just just do it. They just do it. And even if you just got to walk around the block, he didn't for walk up flights of stairs. Even if you just do up, push up, even if you do us it up, just do something man. Do some body weight squats, do something. It can be done. Yup. It, you know, the journey of a thousand miles starts with that single step. And, and I'll have guys in my community who are saying, who will say, yeah, man, I thought your stuff, I'm sure out of shape and I don't have the time to snatch, which is another excuse. Those types of things. I don't have the time. Get up an hour early. Right. You have all the time in the world. You got an hour of workout. I'll fuck you up in an hour. You come work out with me for one hour. I will have you crying by the end of an hour. That's plenty of time from warm up to cool down one hour done. Yep. That's 100% yeah. If you're, if you're a man and man, this is my friend and my own need more than that.
