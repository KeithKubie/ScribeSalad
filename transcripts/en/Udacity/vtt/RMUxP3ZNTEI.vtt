00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.819
We've got our canvas and

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.240
now we need to start thinking about how we're going to draw on it.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.610
To draw on the canvas, we're going to need to use coordinates.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.210
Otherwise, how will the computer know where we

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.110
want our awesome drawings to end up?

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.830
In geometry class we use the cartesian coordinates system,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.990
which looks like this.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.070
The cartesian system has the X axis going from left to right, and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.120
the Y axis going from bottom to top.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.610
0, 0's right in the middle and any numbers below 0,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.940
0 are negative on the Y axis.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.090
And any numbers to the left of 0, 0 are negative on the X axis.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.710
The canvas's coordinate system is a little bit different.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.350
Here 0, 0 is in the top left, and our x numbers just get bigger as you

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.360
go to the right and our y numbers get bigger as you go down.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.750
This is different than geometry class where number got more positive

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.780
as you go up.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.770
So, they're opposites in a way.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.600
Keep that in mind.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.800
Let's take a look at a couple examples.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.420
On this grid,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.430
I'm counting ten lines as one, because these lines are too close together.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.900
We've gone over ten lines, which we're counting as one, so we have x1.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.060
And, we haven't gone down at all so y is still 0.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.870
Looking at this one, we haven't gone anywhere on the x axis, so x is still 0.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.270
But we've gone down ten lines or one line in this example.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.340
So the y is 1.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.080
For this last point, we've gone over ten lines.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.050
So our x is 1.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.920
And we've also gone down ten lines.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.620
So our y is 1.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.110
It's important that you get used to the canvas coordinate system,

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.090
because you're going to be using it quite a bit.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.530
To get you started I've marked off three points.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.730
A, B, and C.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.100
See if you can figure out their coordinates.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.070
I've also gone ahead and marked off the next whole numbers on the y axis and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.990
the next whole numbers on the x axis to make your life a little bit easier.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.930
