the quick and easy way to send money to anyone in the world from anywhere in the

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:13.350
world.

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.350

8
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.030
<v 1>Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

9
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.420
This is radio lab or our topic today is what is our topic today?

10
00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:39.421
Robert today is making life that isn't there before you arrived in the room.

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.200
Okay. A life not as we know it yet, but as we might invent it or make it.

12
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.360
Well let's talk about life. You and I. Okay.

13
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.900
So when you look around in the world that living things and I say, Look Dad,

14
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:55.840
there's a cat next to that is a dog and that's a tree.

15
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.440
And you noticed that those things of course are different. Yes.

16
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:03.970
And later when we go to school we learn about phylums and categories like

17
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:04.960
kingdoms and stuff.

18
00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:07.900
So you think about the nature of those differences and then you're taught about

19
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:12.430
struggle and competition. Darwin species. Yes.

20
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.830
There is a new theory that's being talked about that turns all of that on its

21
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:21.280
head. I heard it first from this guy. I'm Steve Strogatz.

22
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.820
I'm an applied mathematician at Cornell and the story he told me,

23
00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:28.630
which is based on analysis of DNA and very tiny organisms, microbes,

24
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.410
is that once upon a time he says, life began with a very primitive,

25
00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:35.160
very simple collection of cells and these cells said,

26
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.790
<v 2>[inaudible] these cells like to shoot. It appears that legend,</v>

27
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.960
when you go back far enough, there is a kind of rampant sharing of molecules.

28
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.960
That's a kind of orgy in which there are no well-defined species or organisms

29
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.550
and I can give you my genes and you can pass. We're a calm unit.

30
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.540
It was a commune.

31
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.090
<v 1>What does that mean? He's like, it was a commune. What do you mean?</v>

32
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:04.210
What does it mean me? I know what it means in the 60s screen. Love sense,

33
00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:07.960
but what does it really mean? What? Oh, what cells are exchanging is chemicals,

34
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.320
chemicals that give them talents and traits. Genes. Here's what happens.

35
00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:12.154
I did this with [inaudible]

36
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.080
<v 3>in that our, in our ancient puddle,</v>

37
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.900
when Darwin thought the life might've begun in a warm puddle,

38
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.720
let's say that you and I are both cells. Okay?

39
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.810
So once upon a time there was you and the puddle and I'm in the same level as

40
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:27.890
you and it gets a little colder in the puddle. So we should all get sick,

41
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:31.610
but you don't get sick. You have some kind of accidental talent.

42
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:34.340
You can handle cold water. I'm shivering.

43
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.250
Describe again what happens in it at this point in the glorious old days. Well,

44
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.510
my membrane that is, I am a cell. I've got a membrane, I've got my outer layer,

45
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.550
maybe a little bit porous and maybe, whoops, I'm on my jeans just leaked out.

46
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.741
Okay,

47
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:56.741
we're not talking sophisticated organisms and maybe your poorest too and oh wow.

48
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.280
You just absorbed some of those genes. So now we both have this.

49
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:01.350
We both got you both.

50
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.960
And if I've got this gene now I can survive cold water cause it's pine to meet.

51
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.060
And if I bump into you now it's part of you.

52
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.670
So now the Steve Gene has become a Robert King,

53
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.420
which has then become a Jag gene and we're doing this over and over and over and

54
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:18.550
we're getting really, um, come here.

55
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.240
<v 4>Sounds so friendly. No,</v>

56
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.940
actually I don't think of sales like people shout out

57
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.710
<v 1>all these exchanges. This gene swapping was not intentional.</v>

58
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.040
It's not purposeful sharing. That's Nigel Goldenfeld.

59
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.890
I'm a theoretical physicist at the University of Illinois and he and his

60
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.850
colleague Carl woes did the science that led to some of these kind of goofy

61
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:44.860
ideas. It's not me sort of saying, hey,

62
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:46.730
I'm going to just help out my buddy over there.

63
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.090
Here's a couple of jeans and I think you'll find handy.

64
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.120
It's not something like that. You can still,

65
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.560
if we're swamping genes so much and you know,

66
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:55.270
you're giving me yours and I'm going to be nine. Yeah.

67
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.930
What does it actually mean to be me? Yeah.

68
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.440
So much of me is sped around. Well, it would be very weird.

69
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:06.070
Imagine a world in which for a while I have your nose, God forbid,

70
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.210
and then I get my nose back. You have Steve's hair.

71
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.330
Then I Steve would get my ear. Then he would get your nose on two stall,

72
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:17.950
having a lot of exchange. I'll take your chin. Okay. And you can have my,

73
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.860
um, allergies. And then you start even asking what does it mean, um,

74
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.710
to be a species. You can have my love affair with doubt.

75
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.630
You may not even be able to talk about individuals. Yeah.

76
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.840
If the mixing is good enough, we're all kind of indistinguishable.

77
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.930
So identity would be very strange in this ancient world.

78
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.020
All of the concepts that we take for granted,

79
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.570
<v 3>biology become more and more nebulous as you get further and further back to the</v>

80
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.390
roots of the origin of life. Take for instance, Charles Darwin.

81
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:55.190
What Nigel was really saying is that for the first billion years of life with

82
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:57.500
the being good to be everything that Darwin teaches,

83
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.430
all that stuff hasn't happened to no borders, no individuals.

84
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.840
There's no species. That is Darwinism evolution as we now understand it.

85
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.300
That's an interlude

86
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.580
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

87
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.090
<v 3>and the real story of life, it's only what's happening now.</v>

88
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.120
What you got back at the very beginning was a whole bunch of cells swapping

89
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.700
genes, swapping advantages, swapping disadvantages,

90
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.470
and this kind of go wild time.

91
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.190
What tremendous explosion of diversity in a way that life has not seen since

92
00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:24.024
then.

93
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.190
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

94
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.023
<v 1>until</v>

95
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.970
one dark and terrible day 3 billion years ago as interpreted by Freeman Dyson,

96
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.080
sweetening famous physicist and delivered here. Now our friend,

97
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.580
the mathematician, Steve's drug as here is d one evil day,

98
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.230
a bacterium anticipating Bill Gates by 3 billion years,

99
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.540
<v 4>refuse to share,</v>

100
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.510
<v 1>refuse to share who the first bad guy is.</v>

101
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:06.590
This Cellular Bill K Two who decides that I've got an innovation that I don't

102
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:11.300
feel like sharing or possibly by found a way to keep my membrane from leaking.

103
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.220
That is, I'm not going to be a sharing soul anymore. And why?

104
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.920
I mean what made that one little cell decide to stop sharing?

105
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.990
That's a good question. We don't really know,

106
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.550
but what we do know this is was maybe the most dramatic moment in the history of

107
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:26.384
life on earth.

108
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.550
<v 4>Uh Huh.</v>

109
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.400
<v 1>This transition from the age of, well,</v>

110
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.610
if you want to call it the age of sharing to the age of selfishness.

111
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.860
And gradually once one creatures stopped sharing,

112
00:06:37.861 --> 00:06:40.800
pretty soon the others followed. And then more and more did the same thing.

113
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.030
And now for the first time in the history of life, finally we get Darwin.

114
00:06:45.031 --> 00:06:48.940
Now we get species. Now we see differences. Yes,

115
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:53.400
it's the age of identity of individualism. It's also the age of Stacy.

116
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.970
Things change, but they change much more slowly at any great thing. You know,

117
00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:01.720
like you are a bat and you figured out sonar. I don't have sonar,

118
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.500
I can't get sonar. I mean I used to have sonar.

119
00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:08.680
Like you're in a little electric fish that lives in the muddy waters of the

120
00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:11.170
Amazon. You don't care. It's totally dark. You can see,

121
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:14.980
because you can see with electricity, I can't see with electricity.

122
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.930
If I'm in the dark, I'm bumping my head.

123
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.080
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

124
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.450
<v 1>okay, so here's go.</v>

125
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:27.830
We end up chapter one one a green orgy of gene swapping. Chapter two,

126
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.980
your g as we pass genes. Now, not to other guys,

127
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:35.480
not randomly but just to our own children. And finally here comes

128
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.120
chip that's proposed by Freeman Dyson, the physicist Freeman Dyson.

129
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.310
After 3 billion years of life,

130
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:47.480
slowly evolving through random mutations who bumps in the night,

131
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.700
one species, Jad human beings, you and me,

132
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.050
we have become so smart,

133
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.320
so well some of us so technologically advanced that we can swap genes.

134
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:04.421
We now decide who gets what genes and thanks to us evolution as Darwin described

135
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:10.661
it is beginning to end and now we welcome evolution as described by Freeman

136
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.960
Dyson to the graduating class University of Michigan.

137
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:20.100
<v 6>I see a bright future for the biotech industry becoming small and domesticated</v>

138
00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:22.090
rather than big and centralized.

139
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.320
<v 1>Freeman thinks that in the future everybody means everybody.</v>

140
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.390
They will all be creating new life forms and why? Because they can.

141
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:30.990
<v 6>That will be do it yourself.</v>

142
00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:35.280
Kits for gardeners who will use genetic engineering to breed new varieties of

143
00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:40.281
roses and dog kids kips for lovers of pigeons and parrots and lizards and snakes

144
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.540
to breed new varieties of pets, genetic engineering.

145
00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:50.250
Once it gets into the hands of housewives and children will give us an explosion

146
00:08:50.251 --> 00:08:52.320
of diversity of new living creatures.

147
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.743
[inaudible]

148
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.550
the final step in the domestication of biotechnology will be biotech games

149
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.170
designed like computer games for children down to kindergarten age,

150
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.540
but played with real eggs and seeds.

151
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:13.710
Rather than with images on the screen playing such games,

152
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.880
kids will acquire an intimate feeling for the organisms that they're growing.

153
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.120
The winner could be the kid who seed grows,

154
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:26.121
the picklist cactus or the kid whose egg hatches the cutest dinosaur.

155
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.793
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

156
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.670
<v 1>so there's your future. I'd like to make it your future for the moment, right.</v>

157
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.200
My little foot doesn't sound that bad. I mean, maybe a little Saifai well,

158
00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:51.860
actually,

159
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.670
here's the interesting thing is that what he's describing has already begun.

160
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.460
There are kids doing this right now or something very close to it.

161
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.320
How old were you when you did this? I guess I was 20 and 21 right now.

162
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.300
Okay. Who are you, what's your name and what do you do? Uh, I'm Steven Payne.

163
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.150
I'm a senior in biological engineering at MIT. Oh,

164
00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:12.500
here's the thing about Steven.

165
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:17.420
He like most kids who are in the sciences in college had to spend hours and

166
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.010
hours and hours in the lab waiting for eco lie slowly grow in a petri dish.

167
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.090
Eco Line, like the stuff that gives you food poisoning. Well, yeah, it's,

168
00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:28.610
it's the stuff that you, it's common bacteria that lives naturally in your gut.

169
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:30.590
And it's, by the way, a big laboratory favorite.

170
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.010
And the problem is as freshman Seth, he was a Grad student at MIT.

171
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.840
Is he calling in the Ra?

172
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.620
<v 2>Actually, I smelled really bad. What does it smell like?</v>

173
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.310
I actually kind of smell, I guess maybe like now

174
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.270
what do you think? It smells like

175
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.970
<v 1>feces. Anyway,</v>

176
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.020
Steven and his friends got into their heads that they could make Nike Colada

177
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:54.000
smell nicer, nicer,

178
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.510
suddenly like cinnamon or cherry or like minty fresh.

179
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.180
We ended up deciding on Wintergreen, wintergreen. Oh,

180
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.130
you got something against wintergreen. Let me know.

181
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.270
In the real world who has winter green? Ah, it's the Petunia plant.

182
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.760
Petunias have wintergreen. I have no idea.

183
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.180
<v 2>Yeah. A lot of folks study why plants make nice smells.</v>

184
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:15.050
So why do roses smell nice? Why do Petunia Smell Nice?

185
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.550
So what we did was we requested from one of these folks and Natalia Duda River

186
00:11:19.551 --> 00:11:20.810
from Purdue university.

187
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.660
We asked her to send us a sample of one of the genes she had studied that

188
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.200
produces this winter green smell. She mailed it through the mail.

189
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.400
We opened it up, they took it.

190
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.740
<v 1>What were you taking out? A little bit of gunk. It's actually living cells.</v>

191
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.090
Living dried cells. Yeah.

192
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.740
<v 2>We pulled out the DNA, put it into a new cell</v>

193
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.070
<v 1>and once the new DNA had done its thing, Steven called everybody into the lab</v>

194
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.220
<v 2>and we all came over and were like, Whoa, these,</v>

195
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.340
you know the Ceco like culture actually does smell like mint.

196
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.360
<v 1>And we were like, Yay. That's crazy. Yeah.</v>

197
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.730
So instead of smelling pool all day, they get to smell a wintergreen. Well,

198
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.980
actually there was more than that because after their winter green success,

199
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.680
Steven and Rashman decided, you know, why should we stay in the,

200
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.790
in the lab all day,

201
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:04.480
even though it smells nicer now because we have to sit there and watch these

202
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.380
equal, I grow and grow and grow until they are ready to be experimented on.

203
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.040
We could be outside playing Frisbee.

204
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.960
So they decided to put a little trigger inside the Ecoli.

205
00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:13.450
So when it's done growing,

206
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.710
it switches from winter green to banana, banana,

207
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.740
banana. So banana.

208
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.490
<v 2>It smells like a banana milkshake.</v>

209
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.830
I mean it smells more like a banana than a banana does.

210
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.770
<v 1>Okay, so winter green means it's still growing and banana means we're done. Yup.</v>

211
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.050
Wow. That's kind of awesome. [inaudible] awesome is a word I want to discuss.

212
00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:34.910
The awesome question here. Okay.

213
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.530
Were you at all intrigued by the idea that, as far as I know,

214
00:12:39.531 --> 00:12:40.970
and I'm maybe as far as you know,

215
00:12:40.971 --> 00:12:44.780
maybe as far as anybody know in the history of the eco-line creature,

216
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:49.810
there has never been an eco lie that smelled like winter green.

217
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.930
Yup. You made it yourself.

218
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.890
Well, we need to help them. My team members. Yes.

219
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.810
Did you feel a little spooked by the fact that you just created a life form new

220
00:13:02.811 --> 00:13:05.780
to new to creation? Um,

221
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.440
I mean at least we're doing something that's, you know,

222
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.300
smells pleasant but you didn't feel like a doctor.

223
00:13:14.301 --> 00:13:18.020
Frankenstein or a god or a not at all. What do you,

224
00:13:18.021 --> 00:13:20.760
what does it feel like to make something that's never existed before?

225
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.640
This feels like basic engine.

226
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.510
<v 2>Yeah. Or engineers. I would say we're engineers. We're building stuff,</v>

227
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.520
building stuff. Stop building

228
00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.740
stuff on living stuff.

229
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.853
<v 7>So</v>

230
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.760
[inaudible] stand clean cause your away and Jen

231
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.340
will fix the problems of today by building stuff with the licensing genes where

232
00:13:48.741 --> 00:13:52.040
the building creatures being extra useful features.

233
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:56.350
No more wasting daughter Winston slopping jeans as is small.

234
00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.220
<v 2>So building stuff</v>

235
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:10.180
<v 7>[inaudible] goes whereby Yo [inaudible] slobbing gene.</v>

236
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.620
Yes man kinds. Only fighting chance designer genes. Not Denny Bites.

237
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.700
We'll stop disease and greenhouse gases eat when seeing nucleic acids crack the

238
00:14:19.701 --> 00:14:21.660
code. We've seen the light where the

239
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.340
road is bright and clear.

240
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.600
[inaudible]

241
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.433
<v 1>building stuff.</v>

242
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.510
Thanks to Josh [inaudible] and Shane Winter for that music radio lab.

243
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.830
We'll continue in a moment.
