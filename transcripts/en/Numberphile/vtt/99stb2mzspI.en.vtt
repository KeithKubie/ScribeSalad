00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.420
So I'll be talking my favorite number at the moment, which is the number 2025.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.860
It's, just, it's 45 squared.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.980
So it's a square number.
Don't get me wrong,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.840
big fan, love square numbers, but there are loads of square numbers and none of them become

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.310
my favorite number.
This one,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.420
because of a very personal reason and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.519
the reason I absolutely love it is that
in the year

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.800
2025 I will turn

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.600
45.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.620
And so for a brief moment I will turn

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.129
the exact square root of the
then-current year.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.460
What a birthday party that's going to be.
It's gotta go off and

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.850
it's very rare. So very few people get
this. It happens to me because I was born in

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.239
the year 1980.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.149
And so if you were born in 1980 and you

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.390
age 45 years, that's going to occur in the year

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.850
2025, which is 45 squared.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.210
And so I get to be the age n

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.900
in year n squared and that is absolutely brilliant.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.680
And if you look around the room,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.560
or as you go about your life, look at all the masses of people out there,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.330
none of them will get to experience this

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.390
undiluted mathematical birthday joy.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.270
Unless, like me, they were born in 1980. It's just me and my fellow nineteen-eighters

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.009
to get to enjoy this because if you were
born any other year,

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.380
people who are currently alive, what, okay, people born in 1979

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.140
are all, like, oh but we will still be 45
at the beginning of the year and then will turn 46.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.040
No. What are you celebrating? The end of it working? Right?

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.729
You want the birthday in the year. So all the people this previously happened to,

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.590
it's happened before,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.930
they're all dead.
So back in 1892,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.390
people who then aged 44 years

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.080
in the year... What's that going to be... I mean,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.220
be sure I get this right,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.370
1936.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.090
That 1936 equals

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.790
44, yeah that's right, squared.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.220
And so 1936 is quite the year, but no one is still around from the year 1892.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.860
And it's not going to happen again until the year 2070.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.250
As of 2070 those people when they turn 46,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.390
which will occur in the year 2116, which is 46 squared.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.030
[off camera] You thought about what you gonna do in your birthday?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.849
Oh my goodness I don't know.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.069
I've still got a few year, I got a decade of planning to go.

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.340
And it will be square themed.
All the food will be square shaped.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.280
And not cubes, not cuboids.
People are thinking square cake. No.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.310
It is the infinitely thin slices of square cake.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.260
Although there are a few other people, who,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.840
not alive at the moment, this is the only one,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.200
who will get to be, in the future, at the very least, a root.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.519
A nice whole root of the then-current year.
And it's, no, I mean, no one alive now,

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.209
you don't get,

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.649
no one else will be the cube root or any other power,

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.680
but there are a few coming up in the near future.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.100
So if you wanna time when you're going to reproduce,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.460
so that your future generations have the best chance,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.500
if you carry on with the squaring one,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.960
you get another year in 2162,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.900
which is the next one,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.580
that's when 47 gives you 2209, which is 47 squared.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.540
But frankly that is a, I mean, that's a bit of a wait.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.220
Before then, in the year 2046,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.980
which is not too bad, we're talking your children's children, so, your grandkids.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.980
You'll be around to see this one.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.650
When they turn 2, that will be the year 2048,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.169
which is 2 to the power of 11.

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.709
And so they will very briefly be the 11th root.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.220
And as a bigger point though,
powers of 2, amazing numbers,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.470
we haven't had a power of 2 since the 1024.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.600
 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.580
It's been over a millennia since the last...
ever millennium?

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.480
Eh, it's been over one of them.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.900
Since the last time time we'll have a power of 2,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.640
the next one is not for another two thousand years, have we?

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.060
4096 is the next time we get one of these.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.660
So, just as a year, what a time to be alive.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.120
Oh, my goodness.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.760
Forget Halley's Commit.
Forget, you know, transit of Venus.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.000
This you gotta wait thousands of years for when it happens.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.520
So, come on, 2048 is gonna go off.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.560
I messed around with all the other
possible powers to various years when that happens,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.920
and they're all so infrequent.
They're so few,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.110
but then I stumbled across the year,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.130
and, this, I don't know that this is
as amazing as I think it is,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.870
the year 2184.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.910
And let's be honest, it's a way off.
I mean, we've got a lot to go in between here and there.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.340
And we're talking how many generations?
I mean, that's, distant relatives will be around.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.820
We'll be a long forgotten thing.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.620
Maybe YouTube will still be around as some kind of archive or reference.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.480
Maybe you'll watch this in a history class right now in the year 2184.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.140
[off camera] How do you feel about people watching...

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.900
Oh, hello from the past!
And this this is how we use to live.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.800
Here, I mean, these are, we used to use dead trees to store information.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.900
Although, maybe, all of anything digital will be destroyed,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.340
and they'll have no idea about YouTube but they'll still have these books.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.920
We don't know.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.720
But anyway, in the year 2184.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.080
I'm talking directly to those of you in 2184 now,what a year.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.300
But anyone being born in your year,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.980
or if you were born in 2184,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.560
you will at two different occasions in your lifetime be the exactly root of the then-current year.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.640
And this just blew my mind when I  notice this.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.940
So if you were born in 2184,

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.910
and you wait a little while, and you age at, we'll do 3 first,

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.410
if you age three years, so you're still very young,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.540
you're probably unaware of what's going on around you,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.940
that will then be the year 2187,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.640
and 2187 equals 3 to the power of 7.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.820
And so you will be, when you're 3,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.900
you will be the seventh root of the then-current year.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.320
But then, born in exactly the same year,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.800
later on in your life when you turn 13,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.100
so at least you're forming permanent memories,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.680
that will be the year 2197,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.850
and that equals thirteen cubed.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.940
And so you will then be the cube root of the then-current year.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.860
At the very least, it's been great talking to people from the distant 22nd century.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.380
Hope you're having a great time in the future.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.490
So here is the thing I'm talking about over here and, oh, here we have a clock.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.550
We used to use this to tell the time when we physically rotated objects

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.480
to point at a kinda Runes that we had arranged in a circle.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.290
And  these are cables.
We used to send information down these using electrons.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.780
So we would send very specific electron along.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.940
And, oh, this is a switch.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:27.940
We have to physically hit things to change our environment and so we had to push the...

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.500
Oh this was an early...
We use this as sustenance.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:38.030
So this is a basic food that you can both use and attach things to vertical surfaces.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.030
