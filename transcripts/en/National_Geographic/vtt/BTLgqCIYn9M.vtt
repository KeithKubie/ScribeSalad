NARRATOR: Ken Sims
doesn't do 9 to 5.

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:06.767
[music playing]

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.700
This is his idea of a
good day at the office.

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:23.467
For over 20 years, he's
ventured into active volcanoes

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:27.166
across the globe to collect
samples of molten lava.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.967
Studying this stuff is
one of the best ways

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:36.300
to understand what's happening
in the center of the Earth

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.600
and the process that
protects us from the sun.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.233
Pretty much that
whole bottom terrace

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:48.800
now is completely covered
in brand-new lava flows.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.767
With the new lava flow coming
around against the wall there,

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:52.600
we'll have to watch out.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.567
The lava's intensely hot,
roughly 2,000 degrees.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.333
It will burn pretty much
anything on contact.

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:12.734
ALDO KANE: OK, heading over.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.767
I'm going over just
towards the edge here.

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:26.533
We'll have a look.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.433
Whoa.

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:56.367
Holy-- it's just opened up
on that site, hasn't it?

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.667
KEN SIMS: Yeah, totally.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:01:59.900
Whoa.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.333
Nah, Ken, I'm pretty certain
that there is absolutely

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.633
no way we are going down there.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:07.700
That is without doubt
mission impossible.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:16.266
KEN SIMS: OK, well, we're
canceling this mission.

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:18.367
Just anybody with half a
brain wouldn't go down there.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.800
NARRATOR: The new
vent means Ken can't

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.700
take samples from the lake,
but he doesn't need to.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.400
The vent is firing
fresh lava right at him.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.100
KEN SIMS: There's a lot
of lava bombs around here.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.233
It's just covered with bombs.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:53.166
Wow, I can see the
vent from here.

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.266
It's really rocking and rolling.
