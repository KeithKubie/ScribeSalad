00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
(Destin) So what do you do to hold a bird?
(Daughter) Hold on tight and don't be scared.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.180
(Destin) That's right. OK so today on today's deep dive here at Smarter Every Day

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.190
we're gonna learn about bird flight. When I went to Peru and shot high speed video,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.210
I learned a whole lot about how wings work. So I got some birds and we're gonna study

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.240
via playlist how bird wings work. So I'm gonna put a link in the description

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.290
you can click it any time and start this playlist. I'm gonna show you videos from all over YouTube

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.320
that explain how bird wings work. OK you ready to let yours go?
- Yeah

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.350
(Destin) Alright 1..2..3.. go. Very good.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.360
So the cool thing about this playlist is that you can pass it on to friends and they can learn exactly

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.380
how these things work. For instance, these feathers interlock in a very specific

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.390
way, so when the bird down-strokes, he's capturing

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.430
all the air, but on the up-stroke his wings actually unlock.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.460
Also, I'll tell you why this top feather is shorter than the others. It's pretty cool. Are you ready?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.470
Alright, here you go. Hold on tight and don't what?

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.540
(Son) Be scared.
(Destin) Alright, let him go.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.570
[laughs]
(Destin) Go chase him. Let it go fly.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.580
Alright, so today take the deep dive with us.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.590
Click on the link in the top of the video description. Start this playlist. If you're not in a good position

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.610
to take the deep dive right now, then just chill out and wait till you get home, wait till there's a better time.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.650
(Son) Getting back in the deep dive.
(Destin) Yeah. You're gonna get back in? Go ahead.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.670
You can take the deep dive. So what I have done today is I have brought all kinds of reports along

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.690
with me on the boat. And my son here is gonna.. You gonna pull me?

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.710
(Son) Yup.
(Destin) Yeah you just pull the boat for me OK? You just swim..

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.730
that direction. Where do they click? To take the deep dive?
(Son) Up there.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.760
(Destin) Up where?
(Son) Up up in the sky.
(Destin) Where? Point to it.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.800
(Son) [yells] In the SKY I said!
(Destin) [laughs] In the sky right here. Right here?

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.840
Right here?
(Son) No.
- Up here

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.880
(Destin) OK that's where you click to go start the deep dive.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.950
(Son) Can I get back in?
(Destin) Yes you can get back in.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.020
(Son) I'm sinking!
(Destin) You can do it! You're doing great.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.060
(Daughter) I'm just sticking my feet in.
(Destin) Why don't you hop in too?

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.080
(Daughter) That'd be too cold.
(Destin) Just everybody just jump in.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.677
