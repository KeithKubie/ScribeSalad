00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.210
[music playing]

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.210
NARRATOR: Osaka, Japan.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.040
In the middle of this modern
metropolis like the Daisen,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.500
Kofun, a tomb for one of Japan's
long line of divine emperors.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.250
Covering over 400,000 square
meters, the Daisen Kofun

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.380
is considered the largest
tomb by area in the world.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.420
There are more
than 160,000 kofun

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.920
dotting the Japanese
archipelago, all of which

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.000
contain the remains of emperors
or their royal families.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.420
DOMINIC STEAVU (VOICEOVER):
There are burial

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.670
mounds throughout the world.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.420
However, there is
one specific shape

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.080
that exists only in Japan.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.920
And this is the keyhole kofun.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.830
Most of these can only
be seen from the sky.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.420
This raises the question as to
why emperors would be buried

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.250
in such a way that they're
actually being memorialized

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.250
and being seen from the sky.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.790
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): The Japanese

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.290
believe that the royal family
was descended from gods

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.380
that came from the sky.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.420
So we have to wonder, is this
a way for the extraterrestrials

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.120
to identify the tombs
of their ancestors?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.790
NARRATOR: Could the
thousands of Kofun dotting

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.210
the Japanese islands
contain the bodies

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.790
of extraterrestrial beings?

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.120
Curiously, in 2016 researchers
studying high resolution photos

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.000
of the surface of
Mars spotted an eerily

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.080
similar keyhole shaped mound.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.790
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
Is this possibly a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.670
Kofun found on Mars bearing
some last extraterrestrial god?

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.830
If so, we can see that
there's definitely

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.000
a connection between what we're
seeing on Mars as some type

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.420
of Kofun burial site
and over 160,000

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.830
of these found all over Japan.
