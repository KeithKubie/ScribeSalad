00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:01.665
- [Voiceover] So we have
an equation right here

00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:04.741
that says negative two-y
times the expression

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.585
y-squared plus c-y minus three

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:12.585
is equal to d-y to the third
plus 12-y-squared plus f-y.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.748
And what I'd like you to do
is pause the video and see

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:19.748
if you can figure out what
the variables c, d, and f are.

00:00:21.423 --> 00:00:23.032
Alright, so now let's work through it.

00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:24.483
So at first this could
look kind of intimidating.

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.468
We just have an equation,
you're trying to figure out

00:00:26.468 --> 00:00:29.986
what these three variables
are, how do you do it?

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:32.772
And one reasonable approach
would be let's just try

00:00:32.772 --> 00:00:35.546
to simplify what we have
here on the left hand side.

00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:37.984
And to simplify that
we can just distribute

00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:41.255
the negative two-y onto this polynomial,

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.041
onto the y-squared plus c-y minus three.

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.376
And then we could set it equal to what

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:46.653
we have here on the right and let's see

00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:48.673
if we can match up coefficients.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.112
So let's distribute it.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:51.394
So first we could think about what

00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:54.853
negative two-y times
y-squared is going to be.

00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:57.814
Negative two-y times y-squared,

00:00:57.814 --> 00:01:02.814
well that's going to be negative
two-y to the third power.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.484
Cause y to the first times
y-squared is y to the third power

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:12.484
Alright, now let's multiply
the negative two-y times c-y.

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:17.189
Well that's gonna be negative two times c.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.109
So negative two-c and then
you're gonna have y times y.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.348
So negative two-c-y-squared.

00:01:25.348 --> 00:01:29.724
And then we would multiply
the negative two-y times,

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:31.710
and we gotta keep in mind this is a,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.103
we're subtracting three here,

00:01:33.103 --> 00:01:34.507
so we could view that as a negative three.

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:37.363
Negative two-y times negative three,

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:41.264
negative two times negative
three is positive six,

00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:43.319
and we still have that y over there.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.188
So there you have it we have simplified

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:48.403
the left hand side of this equation.

00:01:48.403 --> 00:01:50.981
And now let's see if, let
me actually just write

00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:52.757
the right hand side in different colors

00:01:52.757 --> 00:01:55.102
and then things might jump out at us.

00:01:55.102 --> 00:01:58.248
So over her I wrote this,
the third degree term,

00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:00.279
the y to the third term,
I wrote that in blue,

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:03.240
so let me write the y to the
third term here in blue as well

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.945
So d-y to the third.

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:08.719
And then I wrote the
y-squared term in magenta

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.041
so let me write the y-squared
term in magenta here.

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:13.966
So plus 12-y-squared.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:18.204
And then last but not least I
wrote the first degree term,

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:21.257
this y term in green, so let
me write the first degree term

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:25.355
in green right over here, so plus f-y.

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.502
And when you see it like
that you see which terms

00:02:27.502 --> 00:02:29.743
match up with (stutters).

00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:33.504
With which terms match
up to which other terms.

00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:34.979
So we could see that, look,

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.581
I have the third degree term here.

00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:39.123
That has to match up to this
third degree term there.

00:02:39.123 --> 00:02:44.123
So d, d needs to be equal to negative two.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.393
So let's write that down,

00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:48.344
d is equal to negative two.

00:02:48.344 --> 00:02:50.114
We could see the second degree term.

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:51.554
This second degree term matches up

00:02:51.554 --> 00:02:54.108
to this second degree
term right over there.

00:02:54.108 --> 00:02:57.695
So that tells us that
this coefficient, the 12,

00:02:57.695 --> 00:03:01.073
must be equal to the negative two-c.

00:03:01.073 --> 00:03:05.578
So let's write that down,
negative two-c is equal to 12.

00:03:05.578 --> 00:03:09.954
To solve for c we can divide
both sides by negative two.

00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:12.694
And we get c is equal to 12 divided

00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:15.654
by negative two is negative six.

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:17.709
And that makes sense,
if c is negative six,

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.369
negative two times negative six,

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.795
or subtracting two times negative six,

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:23.908
is subtracting negative 12,

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:26.613
which would be the same
thing as adding 12.

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:28.749
So then we get the exact same coefficient

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:30.932
for the second degree term.

00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:32.870
I think you see where this is going.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.215
Over here we have a six-y
on the first degree term.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.491
Here we have an f-y on
the first degree term.

00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:39.673
This f must be the same thing,

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:42.007
must be equal to the coefficient here.

00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:45.791
So f must be equal to six.

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.929
And we're done.

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:49.785
And the key realization
here is you match up

00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:51.851
the corresponding degree terms.

00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:53.325
There's no way that,

00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:56.866
well I don't want to get too complex here,

00:03:56.866 --> 00:03:58.909
but the simplest way to address this,

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.569
is to realize, "Okay, I have
a third degree term here,

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.253
"I have a third degree term here.

00:04:02.253 --> 00:04:04.830
"Well if I look at it very
simply the way I'm gonna

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.223
"get this third degree term here

00:04:06.223 --> 00:04:07.825
"is using this third degree term."

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:09.265
And I just look at the
coefficients and say,

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:11.923
"Okay, they must have
the same coefficient."

00:04:11.923 --> 00:04:14.721
And then we say, "D is
equal to negative two",

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.555
and then we keep doing that.
