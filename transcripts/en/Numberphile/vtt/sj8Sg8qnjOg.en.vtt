00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
I want to tell you about a very famous number that you've heard about before.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.020
I want to tell you why it is what it is, and it's the golden ratio.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.800
A lot of people think the golden ratio is this mystical thing.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.380
And it is, but not for the reasons they think.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.680
But I want to do that, and I want to tell you why it's interesting.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.760
And I want to do that through a mechanism of flowers,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.600
and you may have heard a connection with Golden Ratio and Flowers before,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.240
but I want to show you why that connection is there.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.380
For the sake of this little video, I'll be the scribe

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.680
But I'd like you to imagine, Brady,
 that you are a flower.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.440
Your job as a flower is to deal with your seeds,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.800
which is kind of the job of everything living.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.680
You're gonna grow some seeds,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720
and we're gonna model this flower in a mathematical way.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.060
This is not how flowers actually grow,
but there are connections.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.080
This is the centre.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.860
When you grow a seed, I'm gonna represent that by putting a little blob.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.840
Now that's a seed you've grown from the centre of your flower,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.300
and one option you could have is you've got to decide where to put your seeds.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.780
And I'm going to give you the option of only

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.260
how much do you turn around before
 you grow your next seed?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.400
So you put a seed down,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.060
and you can turn a bit,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.740
and put another seed down.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.720
Kind of growing it.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.820
If you don't turn at all,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.440
you're going to grow seeds out like this.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.140
The first seed goes there.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.680
If you don't turn, the next seed goes next to it,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.580
and the next one goes next to it,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.780
and you grow the seeds out there,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.900
and you're going to push seeds out.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.080
Actually, I'm adding them on the end,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.900
but it would grow from there

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.280
and push the seeds out in a line.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.460
This is a really bad arrangement for a flower,

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.240
I hope you agree,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.480
and I hope you weren't imagining this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.620
when you were thinking of a flower.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.900
[Brady] 'cos it's a waste of space.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.460
Yeah.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.800
There's a whole bunch of circle unused.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.020
So the obvious thing if I'm going to do this model,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.820
of like, if a flower could grow by putting a seed and turning a bit.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.280
What would happen if you turn an amount of a turn.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.900
So I'm going to talk about fractions of turns.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.180
This is a fraction of a turn of zero.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.880
If you do a new one here,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.860
and you turn half a turn each time,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.340
then if the first seed goes here,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.900
then I think if you turn half a turn,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.860
the next ones going to go there.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.540
If you turn half a turn again;

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.300
keep going in the same direction,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.900
it's going to go there,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.600
and there,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.740
and this is also not exciting,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.820
but you can kind of see why the decision

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.920
of turning a half has made two lines.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.260
And maybe I'm going to call these spokes,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.640
because, just to get you in the mood, 
lets do a third.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.960
You can probably predict it pretty easily.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.520
Seed.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.340
Turn a third of a turn, 
roughly there.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.480
Third of a turn,  
roughly there,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.100
and you're going to see these three

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.480
spokes sticking out pretty easily.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.320
Are you happy enough with this?

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.980
I mean, none of these are good flower designs,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.280
but the consequences of choosing a number 
has given you some patterns.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.100
So if I jumped, say,
 to a tenth of a turn,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.640
would you care to predict 
what you would see?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.780
[Brady] Ten spokes?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.280
Yeah.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.520
And so I don't think the the
spoke behaviour is very surprising.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.960
It looks like the denominator

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.440
of this fraction of the turn

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.400
is controlling everything.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.200
Now I think it's much less obvious

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.480
if I told you what would happen with 3/10.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.580
So with 3/10, if you start here,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.940
you turn 3/10 of a turn,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.860
you'd skip a couple of the branches,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.380
and another 3/10,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.740
you skip a couple, you get here,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.640
3/10 you'd skip a couple,
 and go here,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.660
and if you keep going round,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.560
you'll end up not repeating yourself for a bit

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.980
until all 10 are done.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.240
You also get 10 spokes.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.240
So there's this really nice thing in Mathematics called a conjecture.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.280
We pretty much have one here.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.160
Looks like it's the denominator of the fraction

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.600
that's controlling the number of spokes.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.040
So here's a quick computer model

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.320
of what we've been talking about.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.780
And we can check that with other tests;

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.780
4/11.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.400
You may want to  predict what happens.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.000
[Brady] 11 spokes.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.180
You're correct, there are 11 spokes.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.400
If you type in some other numbers there are some surprises.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.300
If I do 11 out of 23,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.560
you do get 23 spokes,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.080
but there's some interesting behaviour

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.920
happening in the middle.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.860
And that's actually, looks like theres kinda two spokes

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.660
but they're kinda twisted,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.060
and that's because this number is quite close to 1 over 2.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.920
And it looks like what numbers you're close to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.080
also affect what happens.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.320
One surprise that you should watch out for,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.140
I mean, if I do 7/10,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.080
you know about tenths, you get ten of them.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.560
But then occasionally you catch yourself out,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.360
you do 4/10,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.260
and you think "oh, 10 spokes",

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.460
but there aren't;

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.480
it's 2/5ths.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.960
And flowers can cancel fractions.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.900
Or they can't actually,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.340
and what's happening is that 4/10

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.220
is better described by 2/5.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.440
So, you've seen lots of bad flowers.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.280
This is pretty, but it's not what flowers do.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.780
What's interesting is if you change this number

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.340
very, very slowly;

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.800
and you realise that a tiny change

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.340
gives you very different behaviour.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.380
So this number is changing ridiculously slowly,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.940
but even a small jump is giving us spirally shapes,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.540
and very quickly they stop looking like spokes.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.100
[Music]

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.480
[Brady] What are you changing? Just the top number?

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.040
The number is the fraction of the turn

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.260
before I grow each seed.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.340
So this number that's here is 0.401 of a turn,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.100
and I grow a new seed,

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.140
then that's already enough to stop it going in lines.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.880
And they're starting to bunch together, and this is is already looking a better, prettier thing; for a flower.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.340
It's also nicely hypnotic, if you need to hypnotise people.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.720
You start seeing things kind of turning one way,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.320
but also maybe turning the other way.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.300
You see spokes arriving and disappearing.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.540
And this is already a better flower.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.040
[Brady] You're using more of the space.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.900
I'm using it much more efficiently.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.880
Now, I'm not saying flowers are thinking about this,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.580
but somehow they do this efficiently,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.340
and we've got now an obvious question is:

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.200
Is there a fraction of a turn that is an efficient one.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.260
What's really lovely about this is

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.440
that you can see rational numbers arriving.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.840
You can see that I'm not at a third,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.440
but already, the number 3
 is dominating everything.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.660
It's like hunting for big game,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.360
you can hear these animals 
coming in the undergrowth.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.140
You can see it. This third is about to arrive.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.220
We're .329 now, and as soon as we hit exactly a third,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.420
we're going to get those 3 spokes.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.880
And it's really nice to see it arrive,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.700
and then disappear.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.680
So it's about to get there.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.820
As soon as we hit .3333,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.180
through as long as it carries on forever,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.920
you will see our three spokes.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.460
[SNAP]

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.320
[Music]

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.140
And then it's gone,
and we're into other numbers.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.960
If you put a number in for a fraction of a turn,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.040
and it is a fraction.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.500
i.e. has a denominator,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.440
it's going to give you spokes.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.940
And so maybe we're into familiar territory

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.940
from many other discussions about numbers.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.260
Maybe you can suggest a number Brady

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.280
that you could type in that 
wouldn't give me spokes.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.740
[Brady] An Irrational number

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.580
[Brady] Square root of 2

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.560
The square root of 2?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.000
What do you think you are going to see?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.200
[Brady] Kind of spirally, spiral-ness.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.760
[Brady] Oh

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.980
It looks less like it's got spokes,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.720
but you can kind of count them.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.560
And it turns out that this is

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.620
definitely an irrational number.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.520
I'm approximating an

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.360
irrational number on a computer.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.980
But, this arrangement looks much better.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.200
So it sounds like you've hit upon the idea

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.480
that maybe flowers need to turn an

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.740
irrational amount of a turn.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.500
But there are other irrational numbers.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.020
I'm gonna type in 1/Pi,

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.460
because Pi is a lot of peoples favourite

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.320
irrational number.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.280
This surprised me.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.180
Think about what you might see.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.214
We know it can't produce spokes because

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.100
Pi is irrational.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.300
Now they're not quite spokes,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.440
but they're slightly curved spokes,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.300
and there are in fact 22 of them,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.280
just so save you counting.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.280
I don't know if 22 rings a bell

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.160
to do with Pi?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.440
But the older generation used to get taught that

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.940
Pi was pretty much exactly the ratio 22/7.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.140
It's not quite, but it's unreasonably good,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.600
and you can see in this diagram

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.720
that it's unreasonably good
 because this is irrational,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.880
but it's really well approximated by something

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.860
to do with the number 22.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.500
In fact, what I love about this diagram is you

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.180
can see another approximation for Pi

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.200
buried in the middle.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.640
There aren't 22 spokes in the middle,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.420
there are 3.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.420
3 is a very well known
 approximation for Pi.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.720
In fact, if I carried this diagram on really big,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.580
you'd see lots of

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.920
rational approximations for Pi

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.800
in the arrangements of 
seeds in the flower.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.860
Or a mathematical flower.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.240
But what it also tells you is that Pi

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.440
is not very irrational.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.560
It looks like root 2 is more irrational.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.980
So, actually, to obvious question which has turned up in lots of situations,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.520
and maybe in other videos from me,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.460
is that "is there one that's the most irrational".

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.980
And there is.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.020
And I'll show it to you,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.000
and I'll show you why.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.860
So, here it is.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.800
If I jump to the square root of 5, minus 1, over 2,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.680
you get this.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.340
This is the golden ratio of the turn,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.240
and what's lovely about it

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240
is you can see spokes,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.660
but you can see them going in both directions.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.060
They're kind of crossing over both ways.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.220
And you can try and count them,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.820
and if you do, you get fibbonaci numbers.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.540
And if you go and look in the real world,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.040
this is the bit that a lot of people claim

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.700
that this is what sunflowers do.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.180
So if I hide the seeds there,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.380
that's the arrangement of seeds

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.420
in the head of a sunflower.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.740
That's not generated by a computer.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.720
This is a flower doing something to be efficient.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.960
And if I put the seeds back and hide it,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.240
the correlation between those placements

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.580
is almost frightening.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.560
And what's lovely about it is that

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.440
no other number works.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.960
So if I start this animating again,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.220
"ah, the spokes are obvious"

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.320
And this kind of unravels

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.260
and already you can see the spokes unravelling,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.260
and they're obvious spokes.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.340
You could count the spokes and figure

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.700
out what rational number it's near.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.740
So the golden ration looks like it's the best one,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.960
but I want to show you on paper

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.120
why it's the best one.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.580
And I'm going to do that by starting with Pi,

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.000
because, eh,
it's a good place to start.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.940
But Pi is an irrational number

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.700
that is apparently not very,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.680
irrational.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.980
And we kind of already know

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.060
that it's approximated well

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.420
by a rational number.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.940
But let me show you how you can
sort of quantify that.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.320
So I'm going to say that Pi is

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.340
3 plus "a bit".

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.620
I don't think that's controversial.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.500
But what I'm interested in is

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.540
writing this number Pi,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.480
which I can never really write down in full,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.920
which is why we have this symbol for it.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.120
Can I write it in a way which

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.440
looks more like a fraction,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.380
instead of like a decimal.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.900
And so 3 plus "a bit" isn't very helpful,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.760
but I could say,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.540
since this bit is less than 1,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.320
(other wise it would be 4 plus "a bit", right.)

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.260
Then I can say this is

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.420
3 plus 1 over "something".

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.280
And I can find out what that

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.600
something is on a calculator.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.980
I could take away the 3,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.020
and I get the "something".

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.120
And then I can do 1 over that,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.420
or x to the -1,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.260
to find out what it is.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.860
And it actually is 7 point something.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.580
So I'm gonna write this,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.220
1 over 7 plus "a bit".

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.660
The words "a bit" are not sort of

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.180
mathematically recognised terminology,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.840
but you get the idea.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.520
So I could carry on,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.980
I know this is 3 plus 1 over seven

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.860
plus "a bit".

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.000
And I could write that as 1 over something.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.020
And that's on my screen now,

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.400
so I could take away the 7

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.300
and get the bit, 
and do 1 over that.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.600
And I get 15 and "a bit".

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.500
I can start writing 15 plus "a bit",

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.460
and instead of doing the "a bit" now,

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.480
I'm just going to go straight in with

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.300
1 over something.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.720
Take away 15,

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.820
get "the bit".

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.240
x to the -1.
Do one over it,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.320
and I get 1,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.500
and a bit.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.360
Take away 1, do the bit

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.880
It's a very small bit this time.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.740
I'm going to get 292.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.740
And you can see that if

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.220
this number is truly irrational,

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.240
I can just keep going.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.400
And actually, this thing here is called

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.260
the "Continued Fraction", for Pi.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.540
And something very obvious happens

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.720
with Pi is that you get a

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.640
very small number here,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.140
and then you get a 
very large number here.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.180
In the trade, 
they call it truncating,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.920
but if you chop the continued fraction

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.540
at a certain point,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.840
you'll get an approximation.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.360
So 3 and a seventh is 22/7,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.780
is a good approximation for Pi.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.560
If you chop there,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.740
you get an approximation.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.340
If you chop there,

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.900
if you chop it there.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.320
But because this number is massive,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.160
and it's 1 over that number,

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.720
this additional bit is tiny.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.220
[Brady] Becoming more and more trivial.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.040
Well, actually, after that it
 goes back to being some ones

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.900
in the continued fraction.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.440
But that particular point means

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.200
that you don't add very much accuracy

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.580
at those two levels of truncation

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.960
which means it was really accurate before,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.160
which means the step before that

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.600
was ridiculously good.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.460
Which means Pi is

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.000
well approximated quite early on

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.200
by a rational number.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200
Which is why I'm going to claim

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:24.880
that it's not very irrational,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.420
and why when you saw the diagram of it,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.500
it looks like it had spokes.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.820
So, looking at the continued fraction,

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.740
the question is,

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.600
"What would the most irrational number look like"?

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.100
It would be the one with the continued fraction

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.840
that doesn't have any large numbers in it.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.320
So I'm going to claim that this is a pretty good candidate.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.880
Call it x,

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.360
but the continued fraction would be, well,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.260
let's just start with 1,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.320
but then the continued fraction

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.680
would go 1 over the smallest whole number.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:44.840
One.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.660
Then we'd have a one here,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.880
and a one here,

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.080
and a one here,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.200
and this is something that a lot of people do recognise.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.520
It's an odd thing to ask what it is,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.680
but whatever it is,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.220
it will be badly approximated

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.200
any time you truncate it,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200
because these numbers are small.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.540
Now, just as a little heads up,

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.580
I'm going to tell you that root 2

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.000
has a continued fraction as well.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.660
1 plus 1 over 2,

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.820
plus 1 over 2,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.920
plus 1 over 2,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.280
plus 1 over 2,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.220
and carries on like that.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.300
Which is incidentally why

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.100
root 2 looked pretty good on our diagram.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.760
Because although these are not the smallest numbers,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.640
they're consistent, and they stay small.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.980
Where I want to get to with this video,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:15.840
you might know the answer,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.720
but I want to prove it, is:

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.300
What is this number?

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.380
I'm going to solve this.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.640
This is an infinite thing,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.000
but we can solve this surprisingly easy

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.420
because it carries on forever.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.620
Let me point out something

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.500
which I think is obvious

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.980
when someone points it out,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.040
which is that this thing,

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.500
is the same as the whole thing.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.220
It is x.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.960
Which means I can sort of grab that thing

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.540
and call it x

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.480
and I can rewrite this equation as

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.180
x equals 1 plus 1 over x.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.600
And that looks much less scary.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.920
In fact it's a quadratic equation,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.100
which I'm gonna solve.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.840
I'm sure people watching this video

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.200
would have their favourite way
of solving quadratics.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.620
I'm going to do maybe

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.260
not quite the quadratic formula.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.440
I've seen a friend of mine,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.140
called Matt Parker,

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.500
try this with a quadratic formula.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.460
There's a better way,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.960
I'm multiplying by x.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.440
To get x squared equals x plus 1.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.160
I'm going to rearrange it onto one side.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.320
I've got x squared minus x minus 1 equals 0.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.620
At this point a lot of people reach

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.640
for the quadratic formula.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.620
That minus B plus or minus 
the square root...

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.120
I'm going to complete the square,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.920
which is where the formula comes from.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.660
So I'm going to realise that if I write

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.220
x minus a half, 
squared,

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.200
that would square to
 give me the x squared,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.520
it would also give me
the minus x I need.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.980
Try it if you don't believe it.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.220
But it will create a quarter,

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:19.960
which I don't want,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.040
from the half squared.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.920
And I've still got a minus 1 here.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.560
I'm just going to carry on,

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.500
putting this stuff on the other side.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.360
I get x minus a half, 
squared, 
equals;

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.700
combining these,

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.360
I'm gonna get 5 over 4.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.900
And now I can square root it.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.280
This is the whole point of 
completing the square.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.720
x minus a half equals

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.300
plus or minus the square root of five

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.760
because I square rooted the five)

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.140
over 2

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.420
because that's the square root of 4

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.820
And I'm gonna do one more step,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.080
and this needs a box because,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.360
x equals

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.800
Put this half on the other side,

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.400
[Writing sounds]

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.380
That's the same thing,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.300
and this is equal to Phi.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.780
Which is the Golden Ratio.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.080
And it is the most irrational number

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.440
because of the way it builds

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.300
as a continued fraction.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.320
Which is why it looks so nice

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.180
when you stack it round a sunflower.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.040
And why it carves a path

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.900
through an infinite orchard

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.340
if anyone ever talked to you about that.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.000
That's furthest away from all the other points.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.300
And that's why Phi is a cool number,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.200
It's not because the Greeks

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.460
designed the Parthenon to look like it,

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.640
Because that was not true.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.080
Brady: There's a plus or minus there,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.420
Brady: I feel like you haven't done the job!

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.040
Brady: I feel like we're still sitting on a fence!

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:24.840
So which one is it?

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.800
Let me show you on the calculator,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.760
if you tap this in,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.560
obviously this is going to give

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.560
us an approximation.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.100
But if I do 1 plus the square root of 5,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.760
and divide it by 2,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.320
I'll get a familiar number.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.240
Which is 1.6180339,
and so on.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.200
Now, that is a familiar number,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.100
the Golden Ratio, 
but if I did 1 minus it.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.940
1 minus the square root of 5,

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.060
which is the other option I had,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.020
and divide it by 2,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.840
I get -0.6180339, dot dot dot.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.640
And I actually get the same decimal expansion,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.740
it just happens to be negative.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.900
And this is all because of the

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.320
property of the Golden Ratio,

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.780
that if you take away 1 from it,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.460
you get 1 over itself.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.280
And that's actually built into this equation.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.220
And if you make it negative,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.800
you can get reciprocals of itself.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.380
So either of those numbers

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.160
lay a claim to be the Golden Ratio,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.840
and when I did it on the sunflower earlier,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.060
I actually used 0.6180339,

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.420
because that give me a fraction

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.420
between 0 and 1.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.040
but they're kind of all Golden Ratio,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.140
or directly evolved from it.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:14:02.560
[Music]

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.180
How about we check on on Brilliant's

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.380
problem of the week?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.740
So the basic level.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.340
A vertex of one square is

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.360
pegged to the centre of an identical square.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.360
The overlapping area is blue.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.600
One of the squares is then

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.120
rotated about the vertex,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.440
and the resulting overlap is red.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.400
Which area is greater?

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.260
What do you reckon?

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.660
Fancy your chances?

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.260
Over on intermediate,

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.100
well we've got a Chess problem there

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.540
about promoting a pawn.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.960
Or the advanced problem,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.260
if you're feeling a little bit dangerous.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.600
The centres of three identical coins,

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.700
form the angle that's coloured green.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.800
What angle maximises the area

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.980
of the blue, convex hull?

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.620
And you've got a whole range of options.
