they're trying to remake the film but
 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.880

there's a tone in it that's a little bit

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
there's a tone in it that's a little bit
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.370
there's a tone in it that's a little bit
off it's a little more fun and silly

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900
so this film sometimes comes off that
 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.240

way it comes off a little cheesy
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.920
way it comes off a little cheesy
sometimes but they're still trying to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
sometimes but they're still trying to
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.840
sometimes but they're still trying to
depict the same intense thing to the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

think that the filmmakers were intending

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
think that the filmmakers were intending
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.390
think that the filmmakers were intending
for that to happen

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400
for that to happen
 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.920

the real problem of this movie is the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040
the real problem of this movie is the
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.740
the real problem of this movie is the
tone I think that it's trying to depict

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
tone I think that it's trying to depict
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.920
tone I think that it's trying to depict
really intense serious events that would

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930
really intense serious events that would
 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.230
really intense serious events that would
traumatize your average person but the

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240
traumatize your average person but the
 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.830
traumatize your average person but the
tone of the film is kind of fun like and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
tone of the film is kind of fun like and
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.420
tone of the film is kind of fun like and
so it doesn't really it doesn't really

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
so it doesn't really it doesn't really
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.190
so it doesn't really it doesn't really
mesh well and so when these really bad

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200
mesh well and so when these really bad
 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.900
mesh well and so when these really bad
things are happening sometimes the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
things are happening sometimes the
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.310
things are happening sometimes the
audience was actually laughing a little

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320
audience was actually laughing a little
 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.570
audience was actually laughing a little
bit and I think it's because the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580
bit and I think it's because the
 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.520
