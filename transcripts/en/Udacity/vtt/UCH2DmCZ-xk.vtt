00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.490
So Rich mentioned personas and use cases as a

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.750
way to understand our users attributes and their behaviors.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and remember we asked you to come up with a, three features for pizza

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.390
application for entry. And we have a situation

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.720
where you came up with a feature list, and.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.450
&gt;&gt; And we each came up with a different one,.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.680
And we had gone over two options, which is to combine

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.560
the features or just pick one of our feature sets.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.520
But those are actually both not the right thing to do.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.760
&gt;&gt; The way

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.550
we really should have started was, to start with personas and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.760
use cases. Because we could have debated and talked about features

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.770
all day. Everybody had really great ideas of features, but if

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.440
we had started with personas and use cases, we would have

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.630
come up with very different feature lists. A persona is a

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.050
proxy for a group of actual users of a product, for

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.610
whom the UX is going to be optimized. A use case

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.840
is the scenario of how, when, and where a persona will

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.590
use your product to accomplish a task.
