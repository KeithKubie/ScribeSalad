the term deep learning refers to

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
the term deep learning refers to
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.490
the term deep learning refers to
training neural network sometimes very

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500
training neural network sometimes very
 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.920
training neural network sometimes very
large neural networks so what exactly is

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930
large neural networks so what exactly is
 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.500
large neural networks so what exactly is
in your network in this video let's try

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510
in your network in this video let's try
 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.919
in your network in this video let's try
to give you some of the basic intuitions

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929
to give you some of the basic intuitions
 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.240
to give you some of the basic intuitions
let's start with a housing price

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
let's start with a housing price
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.090
let's start with a housing price
prediction example let's say you have a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
prediction example let's say you have a
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.700
prediction example let's say you have a
data set with six houses so you know the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710
data set with six houses so you know the
 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.099
data set with six houses so you know the
size of holders in square feet or square

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
size of holders in square feet or square
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.900
size of holders in square feet or square
meters and you know the price of the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
meters and you know the price of the
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.660
meters and you know the price of the
house and you want to fit a function to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670
house and you want to fit a function to
 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.189
house and you want to fit a function to
predict the price of house as a function

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
predict the price of house as a function
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.009
predict the price of house as a function
of the size so if you're familiar with

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
of the size so if you're familiar with
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990
of the size so if you're familiar with
linear regression you might say well

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
linear regression you might say well
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.209
linear regression you might say well
let's fit a straight line to the data so

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219
let's fit a straight line to the data so
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.540
let's fit a straight line to the data so
you get a straight line like that but to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
you get a straight line like that but to
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.670
you get a straight line like that but to
be the fancier you might say well we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
be the fancier you might say well we
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.920
be the fancier you might say well we
know that prices can never be negative

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
know that prices can never be negative
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830
know that prices can never be negative
right so instead of a straight line fit

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
right so instead of a straight line fit
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080
right so instead of a straight line fit
will eventually become negative let's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
will eventually become negative let's
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.020
will eventually become negative let's
bend the curve here so just ends up zero

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
bend the curve here so just ends up zero
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420
bend the curve here so just ends up zero
here so this thick blue line ends up

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
here so this thick blue line ends up
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.720
here so this thick blue line ends up
being you know your function for

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
being you know your function for
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.340
being you know your function for
predicting the price of a house as a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
predicting the price of a house as a
 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920
predicting the price of a house as a
function of the size with zero here and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
function of the size with zero here and
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959
function of the size with zero here and
then is a straight line fit so there

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
then is a straight line fit so there
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.960
then is a straight line fit so there
right so you can think of this function

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
right so you can think of this function
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.179
right so you can think of this function
that you've just fit to housing prices

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
that you've just fit to housing prices
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.840
that you've just fit to housing prices
as a very simple neural network there's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850

which one we call X it goes into this

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659
which one we call X it goes into this
 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.469
which one we call X it goes into this
node this little circle and then it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
node this little circle and then it
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.510
node this little circle and then it
outputs the price when we call y so this

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
outputs the price when we call y so this
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.530
outputs the price when we call y so this

in on your network implements this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
in on your network implements this
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.490
in on your network implements this
function that we drew on the left and

all that the neuron does is it inputs

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
all that the neuron does is it inputs
 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.039
all that the neuron does is it inputs
the size computers linear function takes

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
the size computers linear function takes
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.990
the size computers linear function takes
a max of 0 and then outputs the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
a max of 0 and then outputs the
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.440
a max of 0 and then outputs the
estimated price and by the way in the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
estimated price and by the way in the
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.870
estimated price and by the way in the
neural network literature you see this

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
neural network literature you see this
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.270
neural network literature you see this
function a lot this function which goes

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
function a lot this function which goes
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.120
function a lot this function which goes
as 0 at some time and it takes off as a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
as 0 at some time and it takes off as a
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.139

straight line this function is called a

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149
straight line this function is called a
 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.360
straight line this function is called a
rare loop function which stands for

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370
rare loop function which stands for
 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.200
rare loop function which stands for
rectified

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210
rectified
 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.820
rectified
Linnea so RDL you then rectify just

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830
Linnea so RDL you then rectify just
 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.710
Linnea so RDL you then rectify just
means taking a max of 0 which is why you

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720
means taking a max of 0 which is why you
 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.740
means taking a max of 0 which is why you
get a function shape like this you don't

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750
get a function shape like this you don't
 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.480
get a function shape like this you don't
need to worry about regular units for

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490
need to worry about regular units for
 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.430
need to worry about regular units for
now but it's just something you see a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440
now but it's just something you see a
 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.880
now but it's just something you see a
game later in this course so if this is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890
game later in this course so if this is
 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.640
game later in this course so if this is
a single neuron neural network

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
a single neuron neural network
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.810
a single neuron neural network
really a tiny little neural network a

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820
really a tiny little neural network a
 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.850
really a tiny little neural network a
larger neural network is then formed by

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860
larger neural network is then formed by
 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.210
larger neural network is then formed by
taking many of these single neurons and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220
taking many of these single neurons and
 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.250
taking many of these single neurons and
stacking them together so if you think

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260
stacking them together so if you think
 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.010
stacking them together so if you think
of this neuron as being you know like a

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020
of this neuron as being you know like a
 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.100
of this neuron as being you know like a
single Lego break you then get a bigger

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
single Lego break you then get a bigger
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.140
single Lego break you then get a bigger
neural network by stacking together

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150
neural network by stacking together
 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.570
neural network by stacking together
many of these Lego bricks let's see an

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580
many of these Lego bricks let's see an
 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.660
many of these Lego bricks let's see an
example let's say that instead of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
example let's say that instead of
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.300
example let's say that instead of
predicting the price of the house just

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310
predicting the price of the house just
 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.120
predicting the price of the house just
from the size you now have other

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130
from the size you now have other
 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.890
from the size you now have other
features you know other things about the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900
features you know other things about the
 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.770
features you know other things about the
house such as the number of bedrooms

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780
house such as the number of bedrooms
 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.540
house such as the number of bedrooms
which only write as count bedrooms and

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550
which only write as count bedrooms and
 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.180
which only write as count bedrooms and
you might think that you know one of the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190
you might think that you know one of the
 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.670
you might think that you know one of the
things that really affects the price of

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680
things that really affects the price of
 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.000
things that really affects the price of
a house is family size so you know can

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010
a house is family size so you know can
 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.190
a house is family size so you know can
just house such a family of three or

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200
just house such a family of three or
 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.530
just house such a family of three or
family four family of five and it's

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540
family four family of five and it's
 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.690
family four family of five and it's
really based on the size and square feet

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700
really based on the size and square feet
 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.040
really based on the size and square feet
of square meters and the number of

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050
of square meters and the number of
 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.720
of square meters and the number of
bedrooms that determines whether or not

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730
bedrooms that determines whether or not
 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.510
bedrooms that determines whether or not
a house can fit your family's family

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520
a house can fit your family's family
 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.110
a house can fit your family's family
size and then maybe you know the zip

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120
size and then maybe you know the zip
 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.930
size and then maybe you know the zip
code in different countries is called

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940
code in different countries is called
 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.130
code in different countries is called
the postal code right at the house um

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140
the postal code right at the house um
 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.430
the postal code right at the house um
and the zip code maybe is a feature that

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440
and the zip code maybe is a feature that
 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.150
and the zip code maybe is a feature that
tells you you know walkability so is

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160
tells you you know walkability so is
 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.910
tells you you know walkability so is
this neighborhood highly walkable you

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920
this neighborhood highly walkable you
 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.410
this neighborhood highly walkable you
know being just watch the grocery store

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420
know being just watch the grocery store
 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.030
know being just watch the grocery store
walk to school or do you need to drive

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040
walk to school or do you need to drive
 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.650
walk to school or do you need to drive
so some people prefer highly walkable

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660
so some people prefer highly walkable
 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.490
so some people prefer highly walkable
neighborhoods and then the zip code as

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500
neighborhoods and then the zip code as
 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.690
neighborhoods and then the zip code as
well as you know the wealth may be um

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700
well as you know the wealth may be um
 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.000
well as you know the wealth may be um
tells you right certainly in the United

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010
tells you right certainly in the United
 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.650
