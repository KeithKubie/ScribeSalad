00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.840
It's this third option that
captures the necessary steps.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.800
In the first line we dequeue the cell.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.080
This requires a cast because the method
returns an object of type any object.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.030
In the second line we use the
indexPath.row value as an index into our

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.360
array in order to get the string that
corresponds to the row in question.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.800
Then we use that string to set
the text of the label in the cell.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.590
And finally, we return the cell.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.350
And notice that we've
written this method so

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.940
that it will work with any
value of indexPath.row.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.640
Next up, you'll get a chance to practice
your tableView skills with a new project

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.695
named doremi.
