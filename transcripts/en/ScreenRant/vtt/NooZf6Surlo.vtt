00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.280
Sex scenes can be very awkward and not just
for actors, but for the audience too.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.580
These pivotal moments can make or break a
movie.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.150
And because the subject matter is so personal,
it’s hard to know how the scene will be

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.360
received.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.640
But, we can all agree that there are some
scenes you just don’t want to watch in the

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.640
company of family.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.480
Here are 10 Movie Scenes You Never Want To
Watch With Your Parents.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.230
American Pie
Talking about the birds and the bees is a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.010
rite of passage, but when your dad is Eugene
Levy, it can be a downright disaster.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.489
American Pie is a teen comedy specifically
about sex, right down to its title.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.000
After being told by a friend that doing the
deed is just like “warm apple pie” Jason

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.030
Biggs’ character takes the description literally.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.440
If you’re mortified by the idea of talking
to your parents about sex, imagine one of

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.659
them walking in on you humping a pie.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.410
With too many cringe-worthy moments to count,
it’s safe to say that American Pie is best

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.730
viewed in the company of friends instead of
relatives.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.090
The 40 Year Old Virgin
From his role as Michael Scott on t.v’s

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.230
The Office, to big-screen features, Steve
Carrell is the master of awkward interactions.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.970
So masterful, in fact, that it feels like
The 40 Year Old Virgin was the role he was

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.340
born to play.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.890
After some friends find out that he’s never
had sex, he kicks things into high gear and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.000
starts looking for some lady love.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.410
Director Judd Apatow and Carell co-wrote the
story, so it should go without saying that

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.250
The 40 Year Old Virgin isn’t traditional
family fare.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.360
The slew of innuendo alone is enough to send
most parents running for the hills.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.070
8 Mile
The Curtis Hanson-directed 8 Mile follows

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.610
the story of a budding rapper trying to break
in to the Detroit scene.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.780
The film’s protagonist Jimmy, played by
Eminem, struggles through an unenjoyable day

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.750
job, only to come home to an abusive and chaotic
family.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.770
Along the way, Jimmy meets Alex (Brittany
Murphy) and his luck starts to turn around,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.640
and the two have a romantic rendezvous.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.640
The performance might not have been 100% fake
either, as the actors were involved with each

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.240
other behind the scenes.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.090
Coupled with Hanson’s shaky-cam, this display
is guaranteed to make any audience member

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.500
feel like a fly on the wall.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.470
The Notebook
Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are the pride

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.440
of Canada, and in 2004 the rest of the world
got to understand why.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.519
The Notebook is a love story for the ages,
and tells of Allie and Noah: two kids from

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.780
opposite sides of the tracks.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.579
It’s hard to believe the two actors didn’t
get along at first, considering their natural

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:30.739
energy on-screen.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.450
After settling their differences, Gosling
and McAdams pulled off one of the most iconic

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.099
and romantic sex scenes of all time.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.090
Too bad it was cut short.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.629
Apparently censors thought the original cut
of the scene was too graphic, and threatened

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.680
to pull the movie’s PG-13 rating.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.160
Requiem for a Dream
Easily one of the most intense movies ever

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.599
made, 2000’s Requiem for a Dream isn’t
exactly the kind of movie you watch on family

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.769
fun night.

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.439
The Darren Aronofsky-directed film takes a
no holds barred look at the perils of drug

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.439
use.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.269
As the story unfolds, the characters fall
deeper into their addictions and take drastic

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.189
measures to secure their next fix.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:11.549
Based on the 1978 Hubert Selby Jr. book of
the same name, Aronofsky leaves nothing to

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.549
the imagination.

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.200
And while the movie is very highly rated,
it’s probably best to watch this one on

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.599
your own.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.470
Black Swan
Ballet is serious business, and in 2010, Black

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.709
Swan director Darren Aronofsky showed audiences
the darker side of dance.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.469
Natalie Portman took home an Oscar for her
portrayal of Nina- a ballerina in distress.

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.200
Throughout the movie, Portman wrestles to
keep her grasp on reality as she descends

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.200
into madness.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.010
Her dark-side counterpart, Lily- played by
Mila Kunis- takes Nina out on the town to

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.420
dance their demons away.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.200
And their night ends with some fervidity.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.790
Or does it?

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.200
Audiences are split on wether or not the passionate
affair was reality, or a construct of Nina’s

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.800
escalating delusions.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.900
Blue Valentine
Part of what makes 2010’s Blue Valentine

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.340
resonate so strongly with audiences is it’s
raw depiction of the depths of love.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.019
It’s one of those movies that you’re happy
you watched, but never want to sit through

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.019
again.

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.980
Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are perfectly
paired as a married couple whose relationship

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.750
slowly erodes over time.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.859
The film has a few risqué scenes, each showing
a different stage in their relationship.

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.239
One scene from the beginning of their relationship
depicts oral sex, and was apparently too real

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.489
for some critics.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.810
Nobody looks perfect during the act, and Hollywood
has a habit of glossing over a lot of aspects

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.810
of sex.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.400
But Blue Valentine avoids all clichés, and
reminds viewers that you don’t have to be

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.940
Ryan Gosling to have sex like Ryan Gosling.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.759
Fifty Shades of Grey
We’re not arguing that Fifty Shades of Grey

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.030
is a good movie, but we can’t deny that
it’s a steamy one.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.550
The film takes a look at a young woman’s
raunchy journey into the private world of

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.240
billionaire Christian Grey.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.810
Based on the book of the same name, the movie
was controversial.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.830
Director Sam Taylor Johnson and author E.L.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.870
James’ depiction of BDSM has sparked conversation
around the culture of sexual consent.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.419
And has some people asking where artistic
liberty ends, and real-life consequences begin.

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.490
With a whole story revolving around sex, it’s
not a surprise that 50 Shades was met with

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.940
such mixed enthusiasm.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.139
Sure, your mom may have this book on her bookshelf,
but that doesn’t mean you want to bond over

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.800
it.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.830
Superbad
Superbad follows the story of virgins Seth

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.960
(Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) as they
attempt to navigate high school.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.419
Parties, booze, and sex are all on the menu…
sort of.

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.980
At one point, Evan has the opportunity to
get down with his crush Becca (Martha MacIsaac)

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.650
at a party, but their drunkenness gets in
the way.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.590
The two are on completely different wavelengths,
neither one listening to the other.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.560
The on screen clumsiness is nothing compared
to what you’ll feel as it unfolds.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.699
The only thing that could make it more painful?

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:44.699
Watching it with your parents.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.639
Ahh young love.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.920
The Wolf of Wall Street
Margot Robbie’s star has been rising steadily

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.520
over the past few years, and fans can’t
wait to see her take on Harley Quinn in the

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.259
upcoming Suicide Squad.

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.939
Audience members might remember her as Naomi
Lapaglia in 2013’s The Wolf of Wall Street.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:06.389
The Martin Scorsese film chronicles the life
of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), a stock

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.729
broker with the world at his fingertips.

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.879
One thing he can’t always have though, is
Naomi.

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.390
Who knows how to manipulate him.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.389
The actress was fully committed to the role,
and insisted on staying true to the character.

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.520
Even after being covered in paper cuts thanks
to a scene where the two get down on top of

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.430
a pile of money.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.690
Ouch.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.009
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.199
