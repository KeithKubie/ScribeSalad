00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.360
PROFESSOR: So today
was the lecture

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.650
on scripting and hosting.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.770
It's the end of day three.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.120
This is probably the lecture
that I was the most prepared

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.210
for in terms of practice ahead
of time, ahead of this class.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.350
Because it's kind of
what George and I do

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.630
for most of the
production process

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.240
that happens for
Science Out Loud.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.100
So whenever we work
with our students

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.770
in the individual
seasons, this is basically

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.800
what we do with them, just
a little bit more formalized

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.810
and for a longer period of time.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.210
It is so hard to
teach good hosting

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.060
because it's one of those
things that you can sit and read

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.140
about.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.310
And you can watch a
bunch of case studies.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.260
And it just doesn't matter until
you try to adopt it yourself.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.350
I had planned all this material
where it would be like,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.050
there were all these
videos of various hosts.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.040
And it's going to be sort of
a similar exercise to day one,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.490
to all those YouTube videos
where it would go through

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.130
and they would write some of
the qualities that they liked

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.200
and try to see what they wanted
to take on for themselves.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.590
But we just totally scrapped it.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.045
And I think, honestly, it
was much better that we did.

00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:27.540
The hosting thing is hard in
helping the students really

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.990
be comfortable with their own
voice and their own persona

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.284
on screen.

00:01:32.284 --> 00:01:33.200
It's really important.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.100
So I don't want to
distract from that at all.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.260
One of the students wanted
to minimize her presence

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.000
on screen.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.041
I don't want the students
here to sell themselves

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:45.400
short on the power that they
have as a practitioner of some

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.816
of the science and engineering
to default to a type of video

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:53.710
that a lot of other
people can make.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.480
These students are
not the best hosts.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.650
Finding like a Neil
deGrasse Tyson at MIT,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.010
you can't bank on that.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.740
And I don't mean
that in a mean way.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.150
Perhaps I should rephrase this.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.960
Maybe they can cut this out.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.180
It is an imprudent
thing to assume

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.580
that we're going to find
the next Bill Nye at MIT.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.660
We can't expect the students
to become like Hank Green

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.390
and to make the next SciShow.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.640
That's an unfair
expectation to have.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.682
But the value proposition
that they offer here,

00:02:22.682 --> 00:02:24.140
which I think is
so powerful, which

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.880
I think is the most
important thing,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.050
that someone like Michael
Stevens on Vsauce can't do,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.290
and SciShow can't do, is
that they are the scientists.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.920
They are the people who
worked in the industry.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.200
They are the actual
Naval engineers.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.640
That is something,
for me, personally

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.400
is so important to highlight.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.190
So to make themselves evident,
I think, is really important.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.710
To make themselves the hosts,
to make themselves visible,

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.950
to make their persona and
their actual personal stories

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.110
part of the video, I
think, is important.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.240
Whether you're in front of the
camera, or you're on a stage,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.660
or you're on a
podium giving a talk,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.590
the habit of falling back
into this monotonous robotic

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.770
or perceived persona that
you think you have to take on

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.460
totally happens all the time.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.080
So I think it's
a relevant lesson

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.920
that people can take with
them after this class is over.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.770
I'm definitely
rambling at this point.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.550
Maybe it's because George did
most of the talking today.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.380
But I think it went OK.
