&gt;&gt;Heathrow: Good afternoon. My name is Heathrow
and I'm a volunteer with the Santa Monica

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.029
Authors@Google team. If you'd like to get
involved or have people and authors you'd

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.160
like to recommend, please don't be shy. We're
always open to ideas.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.680
Today we're here to learn a little bit about
something that's just spitting distance away

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.530
from the office -- the Santa Monica Pier.
And today we've got someone who probably knows

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.390
more about the Pier than at least anyone that
I've met. His name's James Harris, or Jim

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.320
Harris, and he's the Pier historian for the
Santa Monica Pier Restoration Corporation.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.570
He's been a fixture on the Pier since 1989,
and his first job on the Pier was tending

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.059
bar at a little dive called The Boathouse
Restaurant, which is where Bubba Gump is today,

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.710
and so the Pier has, has a long, long history
of various locations. He's the historian for

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.899
the Pier, but he's also a writer, a playwright
and his writing credits include the stage

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.890
plays, An Illegal Start and That Little Ding.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.601
He also does a couple of online newsletters
for various area experiences such as the newsletter

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:13.720
for the website venicebeach.com, and he does
the newsletter for the Pier called, Beyond

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.880
Pier Sign. Jim Harris.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.880
[applause]

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.380
&gt;&gt;Jim: Thank you, Heath, and thank you to
all of you who are attending today and all

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.720
of Google. I, when I toured the offices here
in Santa Monica a couple of months ago, I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.750
ran back to my office at the Pier and I said,
"I found the best place in Santa Monica to

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.130
work." And they laughed at me as they were
looking out the window because we do have

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.670
enviable offices ourselves.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.210
[laughs]

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.970
Anyway, the Santa Monica Pier just celebrated
its one-hundredth birthday, and when we learned

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.140
that nobody was writing a book to commemorate
the Pier's one- hundredth birthday, our office

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.860
took on the task of doing so. And I was assigned
the task because I'd had some writing experience,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.130
and because I've been on the Pier for 20 years.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.719
The Pier, today, hosts four million visitors.
And it's four, four million annual visitors

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.749
and that's far more than it ever has in its
history. It actually began as something much

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:20.409
more modest and has grown. Sometimes it has
had its ups and downs, like anything else,

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.870
but today, we are at the peak of the Pier's
popularity.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.489
And it's really been a pleasure to be a part
of this centennial celebration and to be able

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.980
to share the history with people in, in this
book, Santa Monica Pier: A Century on the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.629
Last Great Pleasure Pier. Like I said then,
and like Heath said, I began as a bartender

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:44.279
at The Boathouse, and when you're a bartender
you learn early on that the best skill that

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:50.430
you have to make yourself money is your listening
skills. And so, I became a very good listener

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.980
and I found an extra benebit-, benefit.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.239
I got to learn about the history and the character
of the Pier. And the more I heard, the more

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.180
interested I became. And so, I would, I would
gather these stories in my head so that someday

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.209
I could tell them, tell other people, tell
other customers, since I was a bartender about

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:17.760
what the Pier was like. When this wri-, when
this book project came up, I was probably

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.449
the most excited person in the office to get-to
get the actual book out until I began the

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:24.449
research.

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.249
And the reason I say that is the research
that I wanted to do was from the beginning

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:32.019
to the end; finding everything out that I
could in old newspapers and such, and that

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.040
included the Santa Monica paper, The Evening
Outlook. The Evening Outlook in the library

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.109
is not indexed. So I had to read through every
single headline and catch every single, little

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.329
bit using what knowledge that I did have and
a lot of hope to try and get as much information

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.839
as I could, and that's what went into this
book.

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:55.389
Also what went into this book was interviews
with people -- local people, people who had

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.689
some sort of relationship with the Pier. And
some of those really gave the book a lot of

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.909
personality. You'll notice it's not just a
history book, it's not just a picture book,

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.999
but there's a lot of color in the stories
and the people that I, I share in the book.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:13.710
Among those, and I, I've gathered quotes from
people about, what they felt about the Pier

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.659
and one-, among those was the, the late mayor,
late Santa Monica mayor, Herb Katz, who, unfortunately

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.670
never got to see the book in its published
form, but was generous enough to give me this

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.770
quote, which is right at the front of book.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.370
And it's, "The Pier is sacred. It is part
of Santa Monica, it is part of our life. Without

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.540
it, Santa Monica would not be Santa Monica."
And if you think about it for a minute, when

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.570
you, when you hear "Santa Monica" just about
everyone pictures the Ferris wheel or the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.491
Pier sign -- certainly something to do with
the Pier. Otherwise, it's just another beach

00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:50.550
community that, that would mix in with others.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.800
Now, the Pier, as I said, four million ann-,
four million visitors annually now. The Pier

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.370
was not built to be the great tourist attraction
that it's become. Rather, it was built as

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.040
a public utility. In 1909, actually in 1907,
the city of Santa Monica was dealing with

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.780
a lot of growth and a lot of waste and by
waste, I mean sewage -- the accumulation of

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.710
sewage. So, the city leaders brainstormed
for ideas of what they were gonna do with

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.159
their sewage and ultimately came up with the
plan to run a 1600 foot pipe out over the

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.680
ocean, underneath a pier and dropped treated
sewage into the ocean.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.199
And the reason it ran out 1600 feet was so
that they would not have the sewage washed

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:38.340
back onto their already popular beaches. So,
it would wash out to sea. Not exactly a glamorous

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:48.491
beginning. However, it was no, it was no,
it was notable that the Pier was the first

00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:53.500
ever concrete pier to be built on, built on
the West Coast of the United States.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.520
Other piers had been made of wood and had
been, not lasted long against the elements

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.889
and against the natural, the teredo worms
which were eating up the pilot-, the pilings

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.060
on the piers. So, the city of Santa Monica
decided to build a concrete pier. That technology

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.669
was pretty new and the concrete piles that
were built to last forever, lasted about ten

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:19.000
years before giving away and ultimately, the
Pier became, they replaced the concrete pilings

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.090
with wooden pilings and the concrete deck
with a wooden deck and you have the Pier like

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.750
you see today, with the wooden deck that you
can walk upon.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:34.090
Today, it's a mixture of concrete and wooden
pilings. But it didn't, the most popular thing

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.810
about the Pier was, of course, not the sewage
and not the ability to walk over the ocean,

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.721
but the fisherman immediately became attracted
to the Pier. In fact, a week before the Pier

00:06:42.721 --> 00:06:47.800
opened, a fisherman named John McCreary, snuck
out to the end of the Pier and caught a yellowtail

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.680
and declared the Santa Monica Municipal Pier
as the best fishing spot in all of Santa Monica

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.680
Bay.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.509
Quickly, of course, fisherman were lining
up and down the Pier. There was a man who

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:05.020
sweared he would fish on the Pier until the
day he died. He did. And back in those days,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.949
the fish were much more abundant and much
larger. What you see in this picture is a

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.520
giant black sea bass. These were common. They
were caught off barges and off the Pier.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.840
Now, if you can imagine, this fish could weigh
as much as 500 pounds, be 8 feet long, if

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:26.569
you can imagine trying to haul, hoist that
up onto a pier, it was quite a task. These

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:31.099
fish could last to be, could live to be 60
years old. They were fished out so quickly

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:35.380
that it, that it became, they couldn't replace
themselves and they've become an endangered

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.949
species. We've begun seeing more black sea
bass around the Pier and it's very exciting

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:44.979
when, whenever a diver sees one or they have
hooked one off of the Pier -- gotten it, caught

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:46.139
it and released it.

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:52.779
It's just very exciting to have them back
in our-the Pier community. Now, it didn't

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:57.309
take long for people to think they could do
more with the Pier than just walk on it and

00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:03.789
fish on it. Charles Looff, who was a very
famous carousel carver in the early 1900s,

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:07.409
wanted to build an amusement pier somewhere
in the area and he chose next to the Santa

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:09.900
Monica Municipal Pier as his ideal destination.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.099
Now Charles, he was famous, like I said, a
famous carousel carver, he carved the very

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:21.099
first carousel horses for Coney Island and
then he began expanding his enterprise all

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:26.569
over the United States. He had a shop in Long
Beach, and he still chose Santa Monica over

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:31.599
Long Beach. And the reason he chose the Santa
Monica Pier was three things. He chose it

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:38.000
for the people; he liked the community. He
chose it for the, the beaches, the beautiful

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.970
beaches that Santa Monica had, but most of
all he chose it for the accessibility.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.060
Already, there was an electric tram that ran
up and down Santa Monica Beach, and some of

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.080
you may have seen pictures of this tram. Apparently,
as a side note, apparently nobody paid for

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.209
this tram. I keep hearing stories of, "I used
to ride that tram. I used to hide on the back."

00:08:55.209 --> 00:09:00.990
Nobody paid a nickel or so. Anyway, there
was a tram that ran up and down the beach.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:07.410
Also, the Santa Monica Municipal Pier was
a, an ending point for the, the Red Car trains

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.710
that used to, to travel all over Los Angeles.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.130
So, immediately, you had a place that a lot
of people were going to be dropped off. Also,

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.360
with the new boulevard systems that were being
developed, Santa Monica was going to become

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.310
a very popular place, particularly near the
Pier for the automobile to, to drive. So,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:30.000
people, the beaches, but mostly for the transportation.
He wanted everybody who came to Santa Monica

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.190
to come right to his access point first. This
is what the Santa Monica Pier looked like

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.829
when -- this is what Charles Louff's version
of Santa Monica Pier looked like.

00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:50.160
This is a photo from 1917. Some of you may
recognize the building in the foreground as

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.410
the, the building that houses the carousel.
It's called the Looff Hippodrome and it was

00:09:54.410 --> 00:10:00.709
built in 1916. It included one of Looff's
carousels, of course, his own hand-carved

00:10:00.709 --> 00:10:05.160
carousel and above it were apartments. And
he and his son, Arthur, lived in the apartments

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.920
while they were building this, the Santa Monica
Looff Pier. Also in this picture are the Piers

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.529
first roller coaster, the wooden Blue Streak
Racer and the, the Aeroscope, which is a big,

00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:23.420
a giant swing, which I don't think would probably
be legal in any amusement park today. If you've

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:30.279
ever seen pictures close up of it, it would
be a very frightening ride, but a lot of fun.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:37.200
Unfortunately, in 1918, Charles Looff passed
away. And Arthur, his son, tried to continue

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.000
running operations, but he was also involved
in the Santa Cruz Pier, or the Santa Cruz

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.561
Beach Boardwalk, rather. And the Santa Cruz
Beach Boardwalk still has his roller coaster.

00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:50.695
That old wooden roller coaster at Santa Cruz
-- that's Arthur Looff's, the son of Charles

00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:58.839
Looff, the man who created the Looff Pier
in Santa Monica. In 1923, Arthur Looff sold

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:05.550
the amusement pier operations to a Santa Monica
amusement company, a group of Santa Monica

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:12.709
businessmen who wanted to build up the Santa
Monica Pier as the people's playground.

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:16.260
A, the first thing they did was replace the
roller coaster. The roller coaster that the

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:22.210
Looff's had put on was not fastest, not the
scariest, really not a feature type roller

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.880
coaster, especially when you compare it to
other amusement piers in Santa Monica Bay.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.519
And at the time, there were five other amusement
piers in Santa Monica Bay, two of which had

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:35.860
many roller coasters. So, they, they built
a roller coaster to compete with those other

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:43.390
piers, but the, the diamond in their crown
was the La Monica Ballroom. This was the largest

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:49.980
ballroom in the world. It had a dance floor
that could hold five thousand people at one

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:57.070
time. On the opening day of, of the La Monica
Ballroom, there were over 50 thousand people

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.769
that showed up. This caused the first ever
traffic jam in Santa Monica.

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:06.161
If you can imagine 50 thousand people coming
to the Santa Monica Pier at once, just to

00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:11.420
go to a ballroom, that's quite a spectacle
of people waiting outside a building that

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:19.250
can only fit 10 thousand people in it. The
La Monica Ballroom was unfortunately a victim

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.889
of the financial difficulties that came just
a few years later and never really saw the

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:28.959
success that, that they had dreamed of it
as a ballroom. But it did, eventually, become

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:32.459
things like a roller rink, the city's convention
center.

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:39.190
It was briefly used as the city jail. There
were apartments in it. There was an aquarium

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:44.190
in it, the lifeguard headquarters. They found
many uses for this ballroom up until in 1962,

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.741
the walls were beginning to buckle and the
roof was caving in and they had to tear it

00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:53.100
down. And it's really a tragic loss that we
really, that we only have this ballroom in

00:12:53.100 --> 00:13:02.209
photos anymore. They say it looked like a
palace floating over the ocean. It was, it

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:06.579
was where Pacific, excuse me, where Pacific
Park is now, where the Ferris wheel and the

00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:13.589
roller coaster are -- right in that area.

00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:15.550
[pause]

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:23.710
Yes, the Spade Cooley Show. Spade Cooley was
a swing western musician who was very popular

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:30.959
at the time, and he had a weekly show in the
Santa Monica Ballroom, the La Monica Ballroom,

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:38.589
later called the Santa Monica Ballroom. And
in 1947, KTLA broadcast from, broadcast his

00:13:38.589 --> 00:13:43.290
show from the La Monica Ballroom for the first-ever
live broadcast of a variety TV show and then

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:50.990
it became a weekly, a weekly broadcast. Ultimately,
Spade Cooley moved into a studio for KTLA

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:56.260
to continue shooting. They did again at Santa
Monica Pier.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.399
Now also, when they first built the municipal
pier in 1909, many people were talking about

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:07.540
creating a yacht harbor. Santa Monica seemed
like the ideal town to have a yacht harbor,

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.529
it just, it was something the community was
well behind for many years. Unfortunately,

00:14:11.529 --> 00:14:18.110
it just never quite happened for the first
couple of decades. A lot of bureaucracy, even

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:23.750
William Randolph Hearst got involved for awhile
to keep the, the harbor from being built because

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.860
he was going to build his own nearby.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:32.730
Ultimately, in 1933, the City of Santa Monica
passed an initiative where they could fund

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.730
a breakwater, and they did decide to build
it. They were going to build it out of concrete

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:43.430
cribs, which I guess is a little bit questionable
when you've already failed with concrete once.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.870
Why would you try again? And they did learn
the same lesson again, they, they placed the

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:55.000
first concrete crib out off at the end of
the Pier and it cracked. And all this money

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.879
that the people had put into it, all of a
sudden, seemed as if it was going to go to

00:14:58.879 --> 00:14:59.879
waste.

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:04.350
The US Army Corps of Engineers stepped in
and said, "Scrap the idea of the concrete

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.589
cribs and just build a rock mound." And so
they did. They built the breakwater out of

00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:14.300
rock-big rock mound like what you see at,
at Long Beach or Marina Del Ray today and

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:20.190
Santa Monica had its own breakwater and its
own official yacht harbor. It opened in 1934

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:25.389
just in time for the first annual Santa Monica
yacht regatta.

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:31.990
It's, there, there was actually a little bit
of stress about whether or not they were gonna

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:37.160
get it open in time, and they did in August
of 1934. The breakwater, unfortunately, was

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.481
not, still not very well built. The top rock
was too heavy and it kept falling off. Sand

00:15:42.481 --> 00:15:49.850
would accumulate behind the breakwater to
the point where they had to keep dredging

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.160
it, so the, the breakwater and the yacht harbor
became a very big financial burden on the

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:02.720
city, and by the late 1970s it was sparsely
populated, and in 1983, storms did away with

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.100
the breakwater altogether. Now, I mention
the accumulation of sand because originally,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:13.180
the beach at Santa Monica was not the broad
beach that it's famous for now.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:18.230
The, the beach actually began that, the, the
waterline came all the way to the carousel

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.680
building, which if you've been to the Santa
Monica Pier you know it's pretty close, it's

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.820
pretty close to, to the city of Santa Monica
and the cliffs. The breakwater caused all

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.560
of that sand to build up, and it created the
broad sandy beaches that Santa Monica is famous

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.560
for today.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:42.410
And the Piers sign. What I love about this
sign and I have to go back to a time when

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:47.410
I was speaking, about a year ago, in front
of a group of people and a young man who had

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.550
just moved here from Africa said that his
friends told him that he had to go to the

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:56.000
Santa Monica Pier. So, he went driving by
in front of this sign several times, looking

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.260
for a sign that said, "Santa Monica Pier."
Now, we all know this is the Santa Monica

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.029
Pier sign, but nowhere on it does it say "The
Santa Monica Pier." It actually says, "Santa

00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:04.029
Monica Yacht Harbor."

00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:08.760
That, of course, is because of the yacht harbor
that existed at the time. This sign was put

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:15.550
up in 1941, and the reason that they put this,
this large arched sign at the top of the cliff

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:23.580
was because of the highway interchange that
goes underneath where this sign is. Now, driving

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.970
under this sign today, you're driving over
a bridge and underneath is a very complex

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.460
little system of roads and highways.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.660
When they built that system of roads and highways
and built this bridge, you could no longer

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.470
see the Pier from above the cliff. So people
were confused as to where they would actually

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.140
turn to go down to the Pier. So, the Santa
Monica Pier Businessmen's Association gathered,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:48.770
pooled up their money and they had this sign
erected in 1941. And it's turned out to be

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:54.690
the, one of the greatest icons of Santa Monica.
The people in the photo are a mixture of,

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:02.850
of pier businessmen and city commissioners
and two actresses -- Marian Driscoll and Susan

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:11.440
Hayward. And the man in the fedora -- an interesting
story about this photo -- the man in the fedora

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.010
with the striped tie--

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.770
[pause]

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:25.430
that man that I just pointed to, his name
is, is Dick Hernage. He was the President

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:30.080
of the, the Santa Monica Pier Businessmen's
Association at the time. He ran boating operations

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:36.010
out off at the end of the Pier ever since
the 1920s. Very much a fixture on the Pier,

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:43.200
he, he passed away in 1951, and I never thought
I'd be able to come across any of his relatives,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:49.560
but I did happen to meet, just by chance,
his son through a series of phone calls. And

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.290
his son sent me this photo and the reason
I mentioned it is this photo is a first generation

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.770
of, of the photo of the Pier's sign.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.680
For years, we've been looking, our office,
has been looking at Pier, photos of this particular

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:07.061
sign that were faded. They didn't have near
the detail that this one does. So, you'll

00:19:07.061 --> 00:19:11.390
see the tear in the corner and you saw a tear
in an earlier picture, also supplied by, by

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:17.300
Jim Hernage. I will take that tear in the
corner and keep the clarity of the photo any

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.300
day.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.830
It's just, it's one of our favorite photos
that we have in the office right now. Or the

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:34.540
fact that it is an actual first generation
photo that nobody else seems to have. In 1943,

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:40.160
the, the amusement part of the Pier, it had
the roller coasters, was not so much of an

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.500
amusement park anymore. In fact, by 1930,
the roller coaster and all the thrill rides

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:51.460
were gone and the only real ride left on the
Pier was the carousel. In 1943, Walter Newcomb,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:57.880
who was a banker from Venice, stepped in and
purchased the franchise to the amusement pier.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:04.800
He had hoped to, to rebuild it as the thrill,
thrill ride filled amusement park that had

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:12.570
been there before, but he never did quite
achieve his goal. What he did though, was

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.030
bring his own carousel from the Venice Pier.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.030
[audience member sneezes]

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:20.341
He owned a carousel on the Venice Pier. The
carousel on the Santa Monica Pier, the Looff

00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:25.710
carousel had been gone for a few years and
this carousel was a much nicer carousel than

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:31.510
what had replaced it. So he bought this 1922
Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel from

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.950
the Venice Pier and put it on to, to the Santa
Monica Pier. It is the same carousel that

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:36.950
is on the Pier now.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:37.950
[audience member coughs]

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:44.340
It was built in 19-, it was built in 1922.
It's Philadelphia Toboggan Company, PTC number

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:51.840
62, all original hand carved horses, and it
is really one of the treasures of Santa Monica

00:20:51.840 --> 00:21:00.280
today. I think it's hard for me to, whenever
I, whenever I meet somebody on the Pier, it's

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.230
hard for me to meet someone who hasn't ridden
it at some point in their life.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:07.130
If they've been to the Pier before or if it's
their first time to the Pier, it's just a

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:12.330
very popular attraction. And it's popular
for all ages. I mean, children love it and

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.490
parents take their children and the grandparents
take their grandchildren. It's just something

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:21.220
that-that provides endless joy and all it
really does is go around in a circle, which

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.960
is also endless joy if you really think about
it.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:35.230
Walter passed away in 1954 and left the amusement
pier to his wife, Enid Newcomb. At the time

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:42.220
it was unusual for a woman to be operating
something as large as an amusement pier, but,

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:48.630
but she did it. She actually, she owned and
operated it until 1974. She did bring in family

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.820
friends, the Gordon family. And I mention
their involvement because their family is

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.990
still on the Pier today. They've been on the
Pier since 1955.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:03.720
They own the Playland Arcade, but throughout
their, their history they owned, for a long

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:09.680
time they owned and operated the carousel.
They had arcades, of course, they had archery,

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.030
they, they had a gift shop. In fact, they
still have a gift shop on the Pier. So, the

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.810
Playland Arcade and Marlene's Beachcomber
Gift Shop -- over 50 years on the Pier. And

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.780
I think that's pretty, pretty astounding these
days to find a family that's been involved

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:32.960
in, in a business like that for, for so long.
The, the late 50s--

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.960
[audience member coughs]

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:39.150
and throughout the 60s and even into the early
70s, were not so kind to the Santa Monica

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:44.450
Pier. It was a financial drain, like I said,
in having to rebuild the breakwater and having

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:50.600
to, to dredge the sand from the harbor and
just general upkeep. And it got to be too

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.630
much for the city to where they couldn't keep
up, and it began to fall into a serious state

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:57.630
of disrepair.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.940
A lot of people consider these the best days
of the Pier and the reason is, is because

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:07.100
the community that developed during that time,
made it to where the Pier was like an actual

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:14.020
neighborhood floating over the water. Apartments
and the carousel, those were not the only

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.150
apartments. There were other buildings that
had been on the Pier began to lease out for

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.270
apartments, and it became the home for a lot
of artists and activists.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:28.970
Now, anyone who knows Santa Monica knows it's,
its history of activism. One of my, one of

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.200
my dearest friends that I've made in all this,
her name is Colleen Creedon, and she used

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:38.040
to host parties in the carousel to support
the plight of Daniel Ellsberg and Cesar Chavez.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:43.320
She was very good friends with Joan Baez,
who we'll hear a little bit more about in

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.780
a minute, but the, the Pier was, was filled
with those kind of people, and it was just

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:53.160
a really interesting community to hang around.
A lot of people considered it seedy. Seedy,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:24:00.110
artistic -- I think they kinda go hand in
hand sometimes in a very positive way. But

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.030
throughout the 60s, the state and the city
of, the state of California and the city of

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:08.630
Santa Monica were trying to figure out what,
what they could do to make traffic towards

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:16.660
Malibu easier and more, more, to, to make
it better. And they were considering making

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.140
a causeway, which is basically a bridge over
a series of small islands that would take

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:26.100
you over the water to Malibu. And when this
i-, idea finally failed--

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.100
[audience member coughs]

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.650
after several attempts that it came up, the
city of Santa Monica, the city manager of

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.190
Santa Monica, was given the task of figuring
out what to do with the Pier.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:38.780
All of this thought of building the causeway,
nobody thought to really, to fix up the Pier

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.910
and the, in that amount of time because they
didn't know if they would keep the Pier. So,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:47.750
you're, are you gonna build a causeway or
are you gonna keep the Pier? They, so much

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.130
attention was put into the causeway, the Pier
was getting worse and worse.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.450
So, the city manager, Perry Scott, was given
the task of trying to figure out what to do

00:24:55.450 --> 00:25:01.380
with the Pier now that the causeway was dead.
He came back with the idea of building a manmade

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:07.160
island out of the rem-, out of the remnants
of the breakwater. The Pier wasn't in his

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:14.891
plans. His idea was to get rid of the Pier.
Now, in 1973, or 1974, the franchise for the,

00:25:14.891 --> 00:25:20.470
the Newcomb Pier, the Enid Newcomb Pier was
going to expire anyway and she was, her orders

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:25.220
were to tear down her part of the Pier at
the end of that, that lease.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.020
The Municipal Pier, of course, I just said
was in a serious state of disrepair, still

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:37.950
owned by the city. Perry Scott thought to
replace both, since the Newcomb Pier was gonna

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:42.270
be torn down anyway, to replace both with
a bridge to this manmade island. The manmade

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:47.370
island would have a resort hotel and a convention
center and all sort of shopping and, and fun

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:54.190
amenities for people; it was a very commercial
affair. The people of the city of Santa Monica

00:25:54.190 --> 00:26:01.800
didn't agree and so there was a great outpour
of, of rebellion actually against, against

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.800
the city.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.510
The city council voted to pass, voted to accept
the city manager's proposal and each city

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:14.350
council member who, who had voted to tear
down the Pier ended up facing an assault from

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:20.650
the city of Santa Monica's and, and other
people who loved the Pier.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:25.030
And ultimately, each of the city council members
who voted to tear down the Pier were voted

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.670
out of office. Now movements, there were two
movements on the Pier, there was the Save

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.140
the, Save the Pier campaign and the Santa
Monica Citizens Committee to Save the Pier

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:40.090
campaign. Both met on the Pier. Both were
very heavily involved with trying to influence

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.960
media and petitioning and trying to influence
the local politicians--

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.960
[man coughs]

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:52.440
During one city council meeting, Larry Barber,
the Chairman of the Save the Santa Monica

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.410
Pier Committee, gave a beautiful, beautiful
speech and part of it he said, and I think

00:26:55.410 --> 00:27:01.050
that this is really striking statement, "It's
like a family. You don't get rid of your grandmother

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:09.200
because she's a little old." Now in this speech,
he presented a plan by a man named Jack Sikking,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.960
who's, everybody credits with the Save, being
behind the Save the Pier movement and really

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:19.010
making it all come together and happen. And
this plan presented a very positive idea of

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:23.740
what the Pier could become if they would,
if the City would just draw, draw their attention

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:31.180
more towards it. It included an amusement
park, it included restoration of the carousel,

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.410
which, like the rest of the Pier, was seeing,
had seen better times.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:41.080
It included bringing all sorts of other fun
elements to the Pier, which would make it

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:47.550
more attractive, including museums to, to
attract, to focus on its history. All of these

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:57.130
things that were in his plan, in some form
or another, has since come to be. In 1973,

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.780
the city council did go ahead and change their
minds and, like I said, each city councilman,

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:06.030
even though they voted to keep the Pier standing,
was ultimately voted out of office.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:13.440
But they saved the Pier and in 1975, the Pier
was declared a landmark, was given landmark

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.830
status and declared that the only way that
anything could happen to tear down or alter

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:24.870
the Pier in a major way was through a vote
of the people, not by the city council.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:30.050
Then in 1983, Mother Nature did, effectively
did what the city council had tried to do.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:36.990
In, on January 27th of 1983, a storm was reported
heading towards, headed towards the Pier with

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:41.020
ten-foot seas. The lower fishing deck at the
west end of the Pier was eight feet above

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:46.910
the water. So, everybody knew something had
to give, and a lot of people, a lot of locals

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:53.120
braved the weather that day, braved rain and
sleet to stand on the palisades and watch

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.350
as these high seas rolled in. And sure enough,
they rolled in and they destroyed the, the

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.451
lower fishing deck at the west end of the
Pier.

00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:07.150
The city manager at the time, after this storm
and after, after surveying the damage said,

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:11.650
without even hesitation, "We will rebuild."
And they began rebuilding out at the west

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:15.110
end, but the, the first thing they had to
do was remove some debris. They took a large

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:19.111
crane out to the end of the Pier and began
cleaning up the, the remnants of the west

00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:20.750
end.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:25.930
Another storm came on March 1st, an even bigger
storm, and this storm ended up knocking that

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:31.740
crane into the water, which served as a battering
ram and it wiped out the Pier, a total of

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:37.540
one-third the surface of the Pier, including
the entire west end, and you can see almost

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:43.010
all the way to the beach. Again, the city
manager said, "We will rebuild," but they

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:50.840
didn't make any immediate plans. It would
be a much greater task, and so they went through

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.720
a lot of city planning as to exactly how to
do this and where the funding was going to

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.720
come from.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.740
And while they were at it, they were trying
to figure out how to make the Pier more viable

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:07.170
and they used Jack Sikking's plans to make
the Pier more attractive and more viable.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:11.140
In 1989, and this is when I came to the Pier,
this is what the Pier looked like. There was

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:18.550
a long metal pier alongside the, what would
become ultimately, the rest of the Pier, and

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:23.880
they ran cranes alongside and they were rebuilding
it. It was a three-year process, from 1987

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.480
to 1990, to rebuild the entire pier as it
was, and that's without any buildings on the

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.480
end.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.390
In April of 1990, they, they opened, reopened
the west end for the first time, and it was

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:40.530
a very exciting day. I was there; it was amazing.
There was a lot of really positive energy,

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:47.260
and it just for a great big flat pier. Now,
that's not the Pier that we know today. Since

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:53.440
then, the Pier has reached the, really the
full potential that everyone wanted, hoped

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.710
and imagined. And it's known, actually, primarily
for two things today. And both of those are

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.710
in this picture. Has anyone been to the Pier
that can tell me what the two things are in

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.520
this picture that really identify Santa Monica
Pier today?

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.660
[no answer]

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.220
The Ferris wheel, the amusement park, Pacific
Park, for one; bringing back the amusement

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.660
parks to the Pier, and all of these people
are sitting on the Pier deck waiting for one

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:21.360
of the famous Thursday night concerts. And
the Thursday night Twilight Dance Series concerts

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.250
have been going on, this will be their 26th
year.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:32.040
Last year, we were so lucky to have Joan Baez,
who's been a long time friend of the Pier.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:38.670
And, and I mentioned her because she and Robert
Redford were the honorary co-chairs of our

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:45.420
centennial committee for our centennial celebration
last year. Each has had a very, very active

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:51.280
role in the Pier's history and, and Robert
Redford actually, his first memory is of being

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.190
four years old when he came to ride the carousel.
And he learned that, or he heard, he knows

00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:01.180
that he was four years old because another
kid had approached him and asked him how old

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.270
he was and, and he said, "I, I'm four." And
the guy says, "Well I'm five. I'm older than

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.831
you." And this is-this is Robert Redford's
first memory. Everybody knows Robert Redford

00:32:09.831 --> 00:32:14.400
was in The Sting, too. I'm sorry, The Sting
also.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:22.080
And he has had a long, long history of, of
just being on or near the Pier and, and of

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:28.370
course, one of his most famous films on the
Pier, in the carousel building. Joan Baez,

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:33.760
I mentioned Colleen Creedon earlier, the activist
that lived above the carousel. Joan was a

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.440
regular visitor. She was around for the 1973
Save the Pier movement and was very involved

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.140
with the, the people in saving the Pier at
the time. But really what she liked to do

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:47.460
was kick back in Joan's apartment, or in Colleen's
apartment and relax. And this is a photograph

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.020
of her kicking back and relaxing in that apartment.
A lot of people thought that she lived up

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:59.280
in that apartment and one my first tasks when
I, I thought that I would write this book

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.970
was to track down that rumor and see if it
was true.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:07.450
And I contacted Joan Baez's manager, he said,
"No, she never really lived there, she just

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:11.240
spent a lot of time in there, but I can put
you in touch with her friend, Colleen Creedon."

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.850
And that's how my friendship with Colleen
started. And it's just been a very beautiful

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:21.560
thing for, for all of us. I think-I know Scott
enjoyed meeting her. Everybody who's been

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.260
at the Pier and has met her really has gotten
a kick out of, out of Colleen and we've seen

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:33.090
a lot more of Joan lately, which has been
great. Now there have been a lot of celebrities

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:37.430
on the Pier, and there have been a lot of,
like I said, other colorful characters on

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.430
the Pier.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:43.310
And there's one that I just can't go without
mentioning, and his name is Captain Olaf C.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:51.020
Olsen. He's a retired sailor who came to Santa
Monica for his retirement and basically for

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:57.680
his health, but he couldn't stop working.
He immediately bought a barge and then operated

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.470
it for awhile, sold it to a movie company,
bought another barge, bought some more fishing

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:08.940
boats, and it's not exactly the life of a
retired man that he left, that he led. Nor

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:14.849
was the fact that he was so active to preserve
the Santa Monica Bay's fishing conditions.

00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:18.919
He fought hard to keep commercial net fishing
out of the Bay.

00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:24.519
Santa Monica activism, I think he fit in pretty
well. He was a local hero during the Great

00:34:24.519 --> 00:34:30.129
Depression in that he would take someone from
the Unemployed Gentleman's League on one of

00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:35.090
his boats for free every day to catch their
haul of fish. He would donate ten percent

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:39.370
of his cash to needy families. He just seemed
like a really great man.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:43.570
I enjoyed, as I was going through all of those
old newspapers over and over again, and, and

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:48.440
finding all these headlines and these little
tidbit stories -- he just seemed like a really,

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.529
really great man who I would love to have
met. And it turns out that in a way I did

00:34:53.529 --> 00:34:59.569
because I was a big fan of the cartoon, Popeye,
and he was the physical model for Popeye.

00:34:59.569 --> 00:35:06.089
E. C. Segar, the man who created Popeye, was
a regular visitor to the Santa Monica Pier.

00:35:06.089 --> 00:35:09.750
He lived here in Santa Monica, he'd go down
to the Pier every day, rent a skiff with his

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:15.470
assistant. They would go out in the water
in the harbor and discuss story ideas. Well,

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:22.670
the man that they rented the boats from was
Olaf Olsen and immediately, Olaf Olsen had

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:28.049
a very distinct look; E. C. Segar saw that
and applied that to his character, Popeye.

00:35:28.049 --> 00:35:33.730
There are all sorts of really interesting
and intricate and fun stories that- that I've

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:40.540
learned through this process; it's been tremendously
rewarding. Sometimes I just don't even know

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.079
when to stop talking about what I, what I
know and if you'd like to hear anything else,

00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:48.960
I'm happy to share any time. I love p-taking
people on tours of the Pier.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.630
So, anytime you come, try to let me know beforehand
that you're coming, and I'll give each of

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:58.640
you my card. And I'm happy to give tours,
I'm happy to just talk and another thing I

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.910
love is to hear stories. I record stories.
It's part of my job. If you've had a long

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:07.680
relationship with the Pier, if you've had
interesting stories, I wanna hear them, and

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.500
I wanna get them recorded so that they don't
get lost. It's been really, like I said, the

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.450
most rewarding part of my job is working on
this project and to me it's never-ending.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:16.810
[pause]

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:31.180
I do, I do, it's a Civil War cannon. They
were gifted to the city, there were two of

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.910
them. They were gifted to the city in the
early 1900s, never, of course, used. They

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:38.695
were not usable ones when they were, when
they were given to the city. They used to

00:36:38.695 --> 00:36:42.519
have actual cannon balls stacked up beside
them and those have, those have long been

00:36:42.519 --> 00:36:46.810
gone, but they're not. I had always wondered
that myself from the first time I went to

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:51.799
the Pier, I thought, "Wow, is that something
left from, from World War II when they were

00:36:51.799 --> 00:36:56.289
worried about an invasion of Los Angeles."
Nothing like that; they're just a decorative

00:36:56.289 --> 00:37:06.270
gift that the city received. Yes.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:14.050
&gt;&gt;audience member 1: [inaudible] [feedback]

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:19.890
&gt;&gt;Jim: There are things that need to be done
and a lot of people, including myself would

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:26.799
like to see the parking lot go somewhere else
and be better utilized. We would like to see

00:37:26.799 --> 00:37:33.480
Pacific Park expand. I would like go get a
mu-, a real museum, not just, you know, we've

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.510
considered small spaces for museums. We have
some his-, historical photo displays. I have

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:41.779
a lot of things that I already can put into
a museum right now. I would like to see a

00:37:41.779 --> 00:37:44.799
space created for that.

00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:47.980
There's been talk about moving the Heal the
Bay Aquarium, which is underneath the Pier,

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:55.220
up onto the deck. Lots of really good ideas,
but it all hinges on finding parking close

00:37:55.220 --> 00:38:01.089
to the Pier, but not on the Pier deck. And
another thing would be the return of the boating

00:38:01.089 --> 00:38:08.359
community. When I first started on the Pier,
in 1989, the, there was talk of rebuilding

00:38:08.359 --> 00:38:13.569
the breakwater and recreating the yacht harbor.
And the city heard the, the US Army Corps

00:38:13.569 --> 00:38:17.980
of Engineers had put up half the money to,
to do that. That money is long since gone.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.490
The city never matched their half, they never
rebuilt the breakwater and there are a lot

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:27.910
of environmentalists who think that it probably
shouldn't be built, be rebuilt anyway as a

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:33.359
yacht harbor. But what we are trying to do
is put a, a gangway at the end of the Pier.

00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:39.299
Number one for emergency escape if, if the
need ever arose, and number two to be used

00:38:39.299 --> 00:38:42.779
commercially to, to get fishing boats back
into the Bay somehow or maybe even just a

00:38:42.779 --> 00:38:49.910
tour boat around the Bay. We're always working
on something.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.069
&gt;&gt;audience member 2: [inaudible]

00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:57.710
&gt;&gt;Jim: Those are the remnants of the breakwater,
those jagged rocks. And actually, they create,

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:06.349
the way that, that, the way that they are
now creates more of a hazard than if it was

00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:10.920
a, makes the water inside more hazardous than
it does actually break the water. The current

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.569
that's right behind those rocks now is extremely
dangerous. That's why that you'll see Harbor

00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:18.849
Patrol won't let any boaters or swimmers out
in that area.

00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:22.910
&gt;&gt;audience member 3: [inaudible]

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:24.940
&gt;&gt;Jim: Uh-huh.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.000
&gt;&gt;audience member 3: [inaudible]

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.039
&gt;&gt;Jim: Oh, great.

00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:38.130
&gt;&gt;audience member 3: [inaudible] Yeah. [inaudible]

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:49.220
&gt;&gt;Jim: Yes, that's all I hear about is the
lobsters in summers as big as people, so.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.310
[laughter]

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.680
&gt;&gt;audience member 3: [inaudible]

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.960
&gt;&gt;Jim: 1934 [inaudible]

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:02.340
&gt;&gt;audience member 3: [inaudible]

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.520
&gt;&gt;Jim: Yes.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.800
&gt;&gt;audience member 4: [ ]

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.990
&gt;&gt;Jim: It--

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:14.359
&gt;&gt;audience member 4: [inaudible]

00:40:14.359 --> 00:40:20.049
&gt;&gt;Jim: That's a very good question. I, the
other piers that you mentioned, the Venice

00:40:20.049 --> 00:40:25.190
Pier, the Ocean Park Pier, and the Horseshoe
Pier, and these other, there were the smaller

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:30.279
ones, the Horseshoe Pier and the Crystal Pier,
they were all privately owned. And one by

00:40:30.279 --> 00:40:37.320
one, they either fell to bankruptcy or weather
or fire. And the Santa Monica Pier, the Municipal

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.440
Pier, the long part that goes out over the
ocean -- the original concrete, that was originally

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:47.630
made of concrete has always been owned by
the city. And, and it never, until 1983 it

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:53.519
never suffered the, the storm damage that,
that would necessitate tearing the rest of

00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:54.519
it down.

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:58.820
So, part of it's by luck and then the other
part is by the people standing up for it.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:03.730
In 1973, it was the only one left. And the
people, the fishermen and the other people

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:07.990
who would come to the piers all the time,
noticed that one by one, each of their piers,

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:12.230
each of their fishing spots, each, each of
their walking over the water spots, was disappearing.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:16.089
This was the last one, and that's why it was
so important to the people to save this last

00:41:16.089 --> 00:41:17.880
one in favor of a manmade island.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.420
&gt;&gt;audience member 5: [inaudible]

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:28.319
&gt;&gt;Jim: I have not, but I've heard that the,
that the Pier's in that somehow.

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:31.160
&gt;&gt;audience member 5: [inaudible]

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.579
&gt;&gt;Jim: Sure.

00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:35.410
&gt;&gt;audience member 5: [inaudible]

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:42.270
&gt;&gt;Jim: I, I remember when we were talking
in the early days of planning for the centennial,

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:46.619
we were trying to come up with the, what the
theme of the centennial would be. And one

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:52.780
of our board members said, "A hundred years
in the past, a hundred years in the future."

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.380
And that's the one that we ended up sticking
with, but she continued with that, she said,

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.470
"For the hundred years in the future part
we can have it 30 feet underwater because

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:01.130
of global warming."

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.160
[laughter]

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.289
&gt;&gt;audience member 6: [inaudible]

00:42:06.289 --> 00:42:08.359
&gt;&gt;Jim: Sure.

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:12.490
&gt;&gt;audience member 6: [inaudible]

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:19.859
&gt;&gt;Jim: They say that the places that hadn't
been on a pier before, those are the stories

00:42:19.859 --> 00:42:24.099
that I used to get as a bartender, and I've
included in the book, in the back of the book,

00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:25.759
there's a section called "Pier Icons," --

00:42:25.759 --> 00:42:26.759
[clears throat]

00:42:26.759 --> 00:42:30.359
and a lot of these are the places that I heard
so much about. I was lucky enough to work

00:42:30.359 --> 00:42:36.060
in one of them for, for several years before
it, it disappeared, too. The Boathouse was

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:42.440
considered the last of its kind, which was
a real dive out on the Pier, and I think that,

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.750
that, that's part of what built the character,
so I'm glad you mentioned that. Some of the

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:51.759
other places, prior to The Boathouse, probably
the most popular restaurant on the Pier was

00:42:51.759 --> 00:42:52.930
called Moby's Dock.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.470
[clears throat]

00:42:54.470 --> 00:43:00.020
And Moby's Dock was out just past where the
ballroom was, if you can picture where the

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:04.089
ballroom was, or if you know the Pier today,
it was out just beyond where the bumper cars

00:43:04.089 --> 00:43:05.089
are.

00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:06.490
[clears throat]

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:12.970
Excuse me. And it was, it was a very popular
place, really drink, most primarily a drinking

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:18.109
establishment. There was, you know, the local
trouble that you get with the term "dive,"

00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:25.130
the visual image that you get, but it was
where all the characters would hang out. Santa

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:30.691
Monica Seafood was right across the Pier from
that, the original Santa Monica Seafood, seafood

00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:40.499
distributors, before moving inland in 1969,
they had been on the Pier for about 40 years.

00:43:40.499 --> 00:43:43.920
There was Al's Kitchen, which I mentioned;
did I mention Al's Kitchen? Al's Kitchen was

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.600
where the Save the Pier movement, that's where
one of the groups met. Al's Kitchen was where

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:53.720
a lot of activists would hang out. Jane Fonda
and Tom Hayden, one of their favorite places,

00:43:53.720 --> 00:44:00.839
Joan Baez, too. That was really the activist
artist hangout for a lot of years.

00:44:00.839 --> 00:44:07.420
Out at the end there was The Porthole Cafe,
which was open all night and really, primarily

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.519
to serve the fishermen who would fish overnight.
They were supposed to have excellent coffee.

00:44:11.519 --> 00:44:17.890
It was where, where Rusty's Surf Ranch is
today was, was called Fish n' Chips. And they

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:21.059
were, they were very well known for their
homemade potato chips which you could smell

00:44:21.059 --> 00:44:26.180
across the entire Pier, and people still today,
you know, when they come to the Pier, they,

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:31.980
they say this place used to smell like homemade
potato chips. Things that we would love to

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.269
see come back.

00:44:33.269 --> 00:44:34.269
[clears throat]

00:44:34.269 --> 00:44:39.579
Before The Boathouse was-it was The Boathouse,
it was for 30 years O. J. Bennett's Seafood

00:44:39.579 --> 00:44:47.749
Grotto. Originally, it was a place where they
had an outdoor patio that overlooked the ocean

00:44:47.749 --> 00:44:51.750
and, and they had card games going out on
the patio.

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:58.170
There was, there were, and then the Pier has
a history of, of gambling going on the Pier

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:04.480
and off of the Pier. There was a, I detail
in the book, a story of a man who was caught

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:12.249
playing craps with loaded dice and was thrown
off the side of the Pier.

00:45:12.249 --> 00:45:16.150
Even more notorious than that was, of course,
the gambling ships. There were gambling ships

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:20.609
out at the Bay that water taxis would take
you from the Pier to the, to these ships to,

00:45:20.609 --> 00:45:28.200
to gamble and they were just beyond the three
mile limit until Earl Warren stepped in, State

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:34.390
Attorney Earl Warren stepped in and declared
the limit to be three miles beyond an imaginary

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:41.190
point between, making it far too out, far
too out of the way to, to water taxis to and

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:47.890
back in a reasonable amount of time. Lots
of really rich stories that, I, I could go

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:49.140
on. Yes.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.619
&gt;&gt;audience member 6: [inaudible]

00:45:51.619 --> 00:45:59.960
&gt;&gt;Jim: The police station was added in -- it
opened in 1995, just before Pacific Park,

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.961
and it was added for the specific reasons
that they were building an amusement park

00:46:02.961 --> 00:46:04.369
on the Pier.

00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:10.840
When I started at the Pier there, it was not
the popular place it is today. There was,

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:15.730
it was really considered seedy and, and not
a, not a good place to visit and certainly

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.749
not a good place to go at night. There was
a homeless encampment along the north side.

00:46:20.749 --> 00:46:25.680
There were, there was always gang activity.
I remember my first Saturday night, I saw

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.650
a gang incident and that was my introduction
to Saturday night in Los Angeles.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:34.539
I'm a small town kid from Colorado, and so
when they decided they were gonna build an

00:46:34.539 --> 00:46:36.770
amusement park on the Pier, they did not want
that to be attractive to, to that element.

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:40.440
They wanted to do something about that element
first and they put the police station on the

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.829
Pier for that purpose. Sure.

00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:48.339
&gt;&gt;audience member 7: [inaudible]

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:59.680
&gt;&gt;Jim: Fall or jump? Yeah, he asked how many,
how many times or how often people fall off

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:07.970
of the Pier. By accident, I don't recall anything
in the last, it's been, I don't recall any

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:17.381
real accidents. There's been people who have
been pushed, there have been people who may

00:47:17.381 --> 00:47:22.420
not have really realized where they were and
fell by accident, but they've been more considered

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:28.480
jumpers. It is illegal to jump off the Pier,
but that's just like being illegal to commit

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:33.430
suicide. It's really only illegal if you get
caught.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:34.430
[laughter]

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.280
And people do get caught. I've, and I've jumped
off of the Pier, I've jumped off of the Pier

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:44.289
under the supervision of the Harbor Patrol,
and it is a long way down. You know, about

00:47:44.289 --> 00:47:48.774
halfway down, you're thinking, "I should've
hit the water by now." And then you end up

00:47:48.774 --> 00:47:52.390
underwater for a long time. The most dangerous
part though, and the Harbor Patrol will tell

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:57.200
you this, they're not so worried about the
fall, it's when you try to, try to rescue

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.730
yourself and grab onto one of the pilings,
because of all the barnacles on the pilings,

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:06.980
cutting people up. That's the most dangerous
part of falling off the end of the Pier.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.130
&gt;&gt;audience member 7: [inaudible]

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:17.519
&gt;&gt;Jim: Swim, yeah, swim to the beach.

00:48:17.519 --> 00:48:40.239
&gt;&gt;audience member 7: [inaudible]

00:48:40.239 --> 00:48:46.000
&gt;&gt;Jim: They did.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
&gt;&gt;audience member 7: [inaudible]

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
&gt;&gt;Jim: Yeah.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
&gt;&gt;audience member 7: [inaudible]

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
&gt;&gt;Jim: Good.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000
&gt;&gt;audience member 7: [inaudible]

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
&gt;&gt;Jim: I have a huge photo library and I have,
I have photos that you can find in other people's

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.990
collections that I cannot give you to use,
but I can send you to the people who have

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:03.849
them and seek their permission. But, I, I
have--

00:49:03.849 --> 00:49:04.849
&gt;&gt;audience member 7: [inaudible]

00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:08.240
&gt;&gt;Jim: No, I have, I have those actual posters
in my office.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.240
[laughter]

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:16.160
Yes, we'll definitely talk and I, I want to
see the Santa Monica Pier room, definitely.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.599
&gt;&gt;audience member 7: [inaudible]

00:49:20.599 --> 00:49:27.260
&gt;&gt;Jim: Good. Very good. Anybody else?

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.369
[pause]

00:49:28.369 --> 00:49:30.590
Thank you.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:31.700
[applause]
