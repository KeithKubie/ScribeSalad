JOSEPH BLASI: Thank you
very much for inviting me,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.030
and I'll just note that
the book is co-authored

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.260
with my colleague Richard
Freeman, in the Economics

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.630
Department at Harvard, and
Douglas Kruse, my colleague

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.285
in the School of Management
and Labor Relations at Rutgers.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.530
So after he was elected
President of the United States,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.680
George Washington faced a
very interesting dilemma.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.780
The cod fishing industry was
the fourth largest export

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.430
of the colonies before
the American Revolution,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.430
and you may not realize this,
but dried cod in barrels

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.030
was a world commodity at
the time with a world price,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.100
and the colonies
here exported that.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.460
It was their fourth largest
export, mainly to Europe,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.500
because the Pope said the
Christians shouldn't eat meat

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.030
on Friday.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.425
So they had a huge
market and as you know,

00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:10.430
there's huge cod
fisheries off the coast

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.660
of Newfoundland and New England.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.630
The British, in order to conduct
not just a military warfare

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.050
but economic warfare,
did everything

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.150
they could to destroy the cod
fishery during the revolution.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.240
They arrested sailors
from the ships.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.860
They destroyed the ships.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.430
They burned the ports.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.379
They burned the
storage facilities,

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:38.420
and they really intended
to destroy the industry.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.200
And they were pretty successful.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.720
So when Washington
became President

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.940
he realized that one
of the things he needed

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.630
to do for an almost
bankrupt group that had just

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.513
won the Revolution was get
that industry back on its feet.

00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:53.596
So he turned to the Secretary
of State-- you know,

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:55.740
at the time there was
just a Secretary of War,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.120
Secretary of State, and a
Secretary of the Treasury,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.270
so it was not a
very big government.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.100
So we turn to Thomas
Jefferson-- just returned

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.200
from France--
Secretary of State,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.110
and Jefferson was negotiating
cod fishing rights

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.280
with the British as part of the
resolution of the revolution

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.490
and he asked
Jefferson to see what

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.310
he could do to help
bring the industry back.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.060
Jefferson-- and you can
Google Jefferson's report

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.850
on the American fisheries--
Jefferson wrote it

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.440
all with his own hand.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.310
He had a research assistant--
Secretary of the Treasury,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.100
Thomas Alexander Hamilton's
assistant secretary

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.270
of the treasury-- [INAUDIBLE],
famous political economist

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.000
at the time, was Jefferson's
research assistant.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.940
And Jefferson did a huge period
of research on the cod fishery

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.410
and at the time he asked
his research assistant

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.170
to find out everything you
can about this fishery.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.560
And so they went to a
gentleman, Mr. Josephs,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.590
who was at the time
the biggest shipper--

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.580
the biggest in our day
would be the biggest

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.740
billionaire of shipping
in Philadelphia--

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.610
and said what do you know
about the cod fishery.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.570
And Mr. Josephs
said-- and you'll

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.910
see his letter to Thomas
Jefferson in the report-- he

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.570
said well, they send
out ships to get cod.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.860
Sometimes they pay
workers on a fixed wage

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.240
no matter what they
catch, but oftentimes they

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.280
pay them a share of the
performance of the ship

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.580
and when they pay them
a share the productivity

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.480
and performance of the
ship is always better.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.130
Jefferson stored
that in his brain.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.950
Subsequently,
President Washington

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.960
decided that they would provide
what we would consider today

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.410
to be tax credits or tax
incentives to any ship that

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.670
went out.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.340
Well, they then
received a letter

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.140
from the owners of cod ships,
and they said in this letter

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.050
basically, "send
the check to us,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.520
just give us these tax credits,
will take care of the rest."

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.240
However, there had been a
custom for over 15 years

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.840
of broad-based profit
sharing on the catch,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.550
as you have heard
from Mr. Josephs.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.370
And so there were a lot
of objections about this

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.350
and the senator
from Massachusetts

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.970
at the time, Senator
Cabot, he introduced

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.320
a piece of legislation which
said that the shippers could

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.040
receive tax credits
only if they signed

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.320
a document before the ship went
out saying that there would be

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.440
broad-based profit sharing
for all sailors on the ship

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.160
on the entire catch,
and not only that,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.450
the tax credits would
be distributed over 60%

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.560
to the crew and 40%
to the shippers.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.760
So this was the first
time in American history

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.050
that inclusive capitalism--
whatever you want to call it,

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.160
broad-based employee equity,
broad-based profit sharing--

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.080
was included in a law
and made a condition

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.570
for receiving tax credits.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.490
And we'll come back
to this story later,

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.590
but it's a really
interesting story.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.370
I discovered it
in the seven years

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.220
I spent writing
this book, it now

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.210
has its own little piece in the
Oxford American encyclopedia

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.930
of American history and it's
really my favorite story.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.650
This book is really a book of
American historical stories.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.600
I did the research on
the American history

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.290
at The Institute
for Advanced Study

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:41.430
School of Historical Studies
seven years ago this spring.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.970
So I'm going to make
four points today.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.990
First point is that democracy
requires broad-based ownership.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.630
In chapter one of
the book I show

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.380
that the founders of
the American Republic

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.270
believed that the best
plan for the Republic

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.760
was to have broad-based
property ownership.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.640
They actually believed
that you couldn't

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.010
have a democratic republic exist
without a broad-base property

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.570
ownership because that would
give you feudalism, which

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.710
they had just rebelled against.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.560
Their main policy to deal with
economic and wealth inequality

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.310
was in fact broadening
property ownership.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.900
It wasn't redistribution.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.140
They were obviously not
socialists or communists,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.780
such things didn't exist.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.630
My second point is that US
wealth inequality is in fact

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.770
from the concentration of
capital ownership and capital

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.570
income.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.250
I'm going to demonstrate the
current wealth and income

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.870
inequality we have
is mainly driven

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.600
by lack of diffuse and
broad-based property ownership,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.190
not mainly by the inequality
in wages, which is obviously

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.290
an issue.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.400
My point today is that therefore
a critical solution to this,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.410
makes sense.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:55.630
If the cause is concentrated
capital ownership and capital

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.660
income than one solution
we should consider

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.310
is ways to broaden capital
ownership and capital

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.050
income in the economy.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.340
And I'm going to talk about
broad-based employee equity,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.190
forms of employee ownership,
broad-based stock option,

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.350
grants of restricted stock,
broad-based gain sharing,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.720
profit sharing as a way
to do this in the economy.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.210
But I'm also going to talk about
the notion that a lot of people

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.510
don't actually
work in workplaces

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.290
for for-profit corporations
in our economy--

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.660
mainly they are teachers,
they work in non-profits,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.090
they work with little children,
they're in the military,

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.120
and so forth.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.160
So we need to figure out
a way for citizen trusts

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.220
to have dividend income
to receive supplements

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.750
to their wages.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.840
My last point is going to be
that the internet can perhaps

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.900
be a useful, disruptive
informational tool dealing

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.190
with this issue of
wealth inequality.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.590
Now chapter one of the
book talks about the fact

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.026
that broad-based ownership
is necessary for a republic

00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:01.400
and I'm going to read you just
a little quote from George

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.870
Washington that opens the book.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.790
"In the first
place it is a point

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.510
conceded that America, under
an efficient government,

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.430
will be the most favorable
country of any kind

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:20.600
in the world for persons
of industry and frugality,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.390
possessed of moderate
capital," he's

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.630
referring to the middle
class, "to inhabit.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.480
It is also believed
that it will not

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.510
be less advantageous to
the happiness of the lowest

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.820
class of people because
of the equal distribution

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.204
of property."

00:08:35.204 --> 00:08:36.620
What was Washington
talking about?

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.850
He was talking about
the notion that there

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.919
would be sufficient
land for every family

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:48.470
to be economically
independent by having a farm.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.660
Not every family to
be rich, but to have

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.550
a certain level of economic
liberty and independence.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.210
President John Adams pushed
broad-base property ownership

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.050
when he was in Massachusetts.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.760
And he wrote, "the
only possible way

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.660
of preserving equal liberty is
to make the acquisition of land

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.150
easy to every
member of society."

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.920
In fact, you might
not know this,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.620
but after the
American Revolution

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.710
when John Adams was drafting the
Constitution of the new state

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.860
of Massachusetts a
number of his colleagues

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.137
suggested changing the name of
the state of Massachusetts--

00:09:25.137 --> 00:09:26.720
of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts--

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.640
to Oceania after British
political theorist

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.720
piece, political treatise,
by James Harrington called

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.800
"Oceania," which was a Utopian
society where there was

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.030
broad-based property ownership
to help preserve liberty.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.750
That's how much they were
thinking about this issue.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.690
President Thomas
Jefferson made it

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.350
a major theme of his writings.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.570
He said that legislators
cannot invent too many ways

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.840
to subdivide property.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.600
And he didn't mean
redistribution--

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.790
taking your property
and giving it to me--

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.160
what he meant was opportunities
to acquire property

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.430
to every citizen.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:11.020
When Jefferson drafted the
Virginia Constitution he wanted

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.530
there to be a part
where every citizen--

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.800
and unfortunately we have to
mention that at this time there

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.350
was a constricted
definition of citizenship--

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.510
the evil of slavery, and
that also terrible evil

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:28.060
of the social exclusion of women
from civil society had not been

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.850
addressed, and one can't
escape from these terrible,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.760
terrible evils--

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.650
But even though
these other founders

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.400
disagreed on these
issues, they all

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.650
did agree that broad-base
property ownership was

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.230
necessary for economic liberty.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:48.620
James Madison, later president--
he developed some criteria

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.510
for laws to maintain
broad-based property ownership.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.500
And he wrote, "the US
have a precious advantage

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.520
also in the actual
distribution of property

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.440
and in the universal hope
of acquiring property."

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.150
So let's be clear,
their view was

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.630
that land was the major
capital of the time

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.530
and in order to have a republic
you had to have broad-based--

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.310
although not completely
equal or egalitarian

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.034
ownership-- ownership of land.

00:11:16.034 --> 00:11:17.450
Madison-- we're
going to come back

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:23.440
to this later-- he expected
that it was possible

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.410
that the country would
run out of land to make

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.350
every person, every
citizen, every household

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.070
economically independent.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.020
So he had some ideas
to how to address that,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.350
and we'll talk about this
again at the end of the talk.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.370
He said the federal
government should withhold

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.080
unnecessary opportunities
from the few, which

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.120
would increase
inequality of property.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.570
He said without violating
the laws of property,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.660
in other words without
redistribution,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.780
reduce extreme wealth
towards mediocrity--

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.400
he means the middle class--
and raise extreme indigence

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.460
to a state of
comfort, and abstain

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.340
from measures that
favor one interest.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.810
I'm going to show you
at the end of this talk

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.750
that the federal
government violates

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.410
virtually every one
of Madison's criteria,

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.160
and how we can apply his
criteria to some reform.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.260
This just wasn't some kind
of a political ideology.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.970
They took very strong
steps, very quickly

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.980
and they were maintained
over about 100 years

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.720
to implement this broad-based
property ownership.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.230
They quickly outlawed
primogeniture--

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.780
those who've watch Downton Abbey
know what I'm talking about.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.840
Jefferson drafted a liberal
policy for land shares

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.340
as Secretary of
State for Washington,

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.180
which allowed sales of
land-- sales of public land--

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.520
that could be provided to
families and households

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.970
at reasonable prices.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.900
I should also point out that at
the Constitutional Convention,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.950
they forced many
of the states that

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.660
were holding large
amounts of public land

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.630
to yield that land to
the federal government

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.850
so it could be made
available to citizens.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.690
In the Northwest
Ordinance of 1787,

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:10.410
they abolished
slavery and servitude

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.630
in that entire area
of what later became

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.435
Ohio, Indiana Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Michigan and one

00:13:17.435 --> 00:13:19.920
third of Minnesota,
and they said

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.180
that that land would be
available for citizen farmers.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.230
Jefferson did the Louisiana
Purchase from Napoleon in 1803.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:32.070
Mainly to, as he said, affect
an "empire of liberty,"

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.090
to allow a lot of
land to be available

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.860
for independent farms.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.780
And we're talking about
here 6 million acres,

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.440
so you can see the
actions that they

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.210
took to effectuate
this policy were really

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.410
significant and big actions.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:53.800
Until 1862, almost 75 years
later, liberal land policies

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.310
were a major part of US policy.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.800
There was constantly a debate
between the Treasury Department

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.160
and the rest of the
federal government over

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.710
should we sell land to the
highest bidder-- people

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.870
are rich, they can buy
land at high prices--

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.390
or should would make it
available at installments,

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.380
at low interest rates, at low
prices to the middle class

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.400
and that second part
of the argument always,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.550
always won out.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.110
And it was very
much like the ESOP

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.818
that I'm going to talk
about later, where

00:14:21.818 --> 00:14:27.280
today workers in the company
can set up a workers trust,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.990
borrow money, and through
installments from the company's

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.790
profits and revenues, pay off
the stock that the trust buys

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.940
and the workers become owners.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.430
Citizens continuously favored
shares-- property shares--

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.300
over selling land to deal
with the budget deficit.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.300
So if the Tea Party has
any question about where

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.840
initial Americans
landed on that issue,

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.600
it is very clear from
historical record.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.540
Land shares were central,
as I show in chapter one,

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.670
to the founding of
the Republican Party--

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.450
founding of the
Republican Party--

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.070
which ran on an
anti-slavery platform.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.860
John Fremont.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:16.080
"Free Soil, Free Labor,
and Fremont" was his model.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.490
President Lincoln
spoke very strongly

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.460
in terms of this notion of
broad-based property ownership

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.700
and he attempted to right the
wrong of the evil of slavery

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.830
with the Homestead Act, which
provided initially 160 acres

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.720
to a family that did
some sweat-equity-- built

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.490
a structure.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.570
Later on there were a
variety of homestead acts

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.180
in different states and in
parts of the United States

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.770
where it took say,
64 acres to support

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.820
a family with
economic independence,

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.320
the acreage was increased.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.280
However, and the
homestead act again

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.204
was an example of
really big, actual

00:15:50.204 --> 00:15:52.620
attempts to implement this
policy-- a broad-based property

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.350
ownership.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:58.880
The Homestead Act dealt
with 20% of all public land

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.930
and 10% of the land mass
of the United States.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:06.630
Imagine if with these
kinds of property resources

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.410
we were to implement
their policy today.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.420
And you're going to see
some very comprehensive

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.990
recommendations at the end
of my talk to do just that.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:21.610
However in 1829, James
Madison after his presidency,

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.070
was at the Virginia
Constitutional Convention

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.610
and he said, you know what,
can we really sustain this?

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.610
So he took out-- I
say an envelope--

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.610
he took out a piece of
paper and he projected

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.284
how much land there would be by
1930, what the population would

00:16:36.284 --> 00:16:37.700
be, he divided one
into the other,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.550
and he said you know
what, we can't do it.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.480
There won't be enough
land to sustain

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.240
a homestead for every
family, and then he

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.850
wrote that this is the
most serious problem

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.710
that we have to
solve in the future

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.100
and we have to figure out
new ways of ownership.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.050
Well, the Speaker of the
House of Representatives,

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.140
Galusha Grow-- who
was often called

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.530
the Father of the
Republican Party,

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:06.040
an anti-slavery Republican
congressperson from Lancaster,

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.609
Pennsylvania-- he wrote after
he managed the Homestead

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.650
Act for President Lincoln
through the Congress

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.579
that we are out of land
and the future this idea

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:19.210
is profit shares and equity
shares in corporations

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:24.190
because corporations
have unlimited assets,

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.710
and this idea was picked up.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:35.210
So in the late 1800s, a number
of very rich businesspeople,

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.750
who were also impacted by
the Christian social gospel

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.880
and by ethics and morality
from their own religious

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.900
backgrounds, they came
forward with the Grow idea.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.160
And leading figures worked
very hard to figure out

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.220
ways to create
broad-based property

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.490
ownership in the
context of corporations.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.680
And this book, as I said,
is mainly a book of stories.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.294
In chapter one, I tell the
story about the founders.

00:17:59.294 --> 00:18:00.710
In chapter four,
we tell the story

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.001
about all these businesspeople.

00:18:02.001 --> 00:18:04.090
I'll just comment
on a few of them.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:08.810
So George Pillsbury, he had the
largest grain mill for flour

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.750
in the entire world.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.542
And actually at one point
his mill burned down

00:18:13.542 --> 00:18:14.500
and he remembered that.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.499
He said, "you know what?

00:18:15.499 --> 00:18:18.830
I want every worker walking
the floors of the mill

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.760
to worry about flour
dust in grain "mills,"

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.330
if there's a spark
you know what happens.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.030
And so he introduced profit
sharing-- really interesting,

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.130
Pillsbury-- became
world-renowned

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.810
for his profit sharing plan.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.910
William Cooper Procter
was sent by his daddy

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:40.070
here to Princeton University
to study in the early 1880s

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.160
and Procter went back
home after hearing

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.350
in his political economy
lecture about broad-based profit

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.310
sharing, broad-based
employee stock ownership,

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.990
and how that was a continuation
of the founders idea.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.410
And he implemented it
in Procter and Gamble,

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.850
which by the way today is
about 20% to 25% worker-owned.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.240
So you can remember that if
you brush with Crest toothpaste

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.990
and use Bounty paper towels.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.630
And then we have
Andrew Carnegie, who

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.500
made terrible errors in his
fights with steel unions

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.230
by trying to tap
down their wages,

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.730
but at the end of his
life wrote a book saying

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.710
that this idea was a
continuation of the founders

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.810
broad-based property ownership
is necessary for democracy

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.100
idea, and he envisioned
federal tax incentives

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.140
to encourage employee stock
ownership and profit sharing.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.630
And George Eastman,
by the way, I

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.790
think very important to Google,
because he probably invented

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:40.830
the broad-based stock option
that many Googlers have

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.120
received, as you know.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:49.660
Eastman Kodak was the high-tech
go-go company of its day.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.390
And when I was up
in Rochester going

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.040
through the archives
of Mr. Eastman I

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.690
came upon a really great
letter, which I could imagine

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.540
could be written to one
of the Google founders.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.080
The letter said,
Dear Mr. Eastman, I'm

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.000
a holder of a lot
of Kodak stock,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.230
and it really bothers
me because-- Eastman,

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.620
when he had a
shareholder meeting

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.470
he would talk about
the broad-based stock

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.553
option, and the employee
ownership, and the profit

00:20:15.553 --> 00:20:18.910
sharing plan, he had all three
of them-- it really bothers me

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.050
how much equity you're
granting to workers.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.970
You're giving them my money.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.110
And Eastman, I found his letter,
on that onion paper that they

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:33.220
used in the late 1800s and
early 1900's, his carbon

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.840
copy that his secretary saved,
and Eastman wrote him back

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.170
and I'm going to kind
of paraphrase it.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.845
He said, Dear x, I remember you.

00:20:40.845 --> 00:20:44.210
You are one of the initial
investors in Kodak.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.180
You're sitting on
your 600 acre horse

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.250
farm in New England because
of all the money made

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.440
by the innovations
and the knowledge

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.170
and the technical insights
of Kodak employees,

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.530
and we provided them
a share the ownership

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.300
so they would be so innovative.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.300
You know what, go to hell.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.000
That basically is the
response that he sent.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.290
OK.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.440
Interesting issue that happened
is in the 1920 election,

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.360
William Cooper Procter decided
to run a presidential candidate

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.680
actually on a platform
to save capitalism

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.644
by introducing these ideas.

00:21:21.644 --> 00:21:23.060
You can read the
story in the book

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.360
there's a lot of scandal
involved in that story.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.110
Not on the side of
Mr. Proctor, who

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:32.456
was a pretty pure, pure soul.

00:21:32.456 --> 00:21:34.080
There was a lot of
research at the time

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.050
on these ideas suggesting
that they were leading

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.290
to higher productivity and
higher employee engagement.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.090
Not going to go into
them in a lot of detail.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.940
Now I've talked already
about the kinds of shares

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.150
that we're discussing.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.430
We're discussing
grants of equity shares

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:58.020
as in restricted stock grants,
employee stock ownership plans,

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.300
which by the way workers do
not buy with their savings,

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.760
and company matching grants
to 401(k) contributions.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.930
I am against, and the
co-authors of the book

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.360
are against, the middle
class worker buying

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.690
huge amount of shares in their
own company with their savings

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.310
because it's too
risky, but grants

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.770
of shares, grants of equity
is something that we're for.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.340
As you know, they're lower risk.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.670
Grants of stock
options are lower risk,

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.600
if you don't buy them
with your savings,

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.420
and certainly cash or deferred
profit sharing and cash

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.050
gainsharing for team or
departmental performance

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.972
is also very, very low risk.

00:22:36.972 --> 00:22:38.930
How many shares are there
in the United States?

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.960
Well, as part of the
extensive empirical research

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.460
we did on the book-- it
was historical research,

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.700
but it also involved
contracting with the University

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.100
of Chicago's National
Opinion Research Center

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.000
to do a nationwide
survey, actually

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.290
six nationwide surveys.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.060
This is the center that does
research for the US Census

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.340
on contract-- and we find that
about 17% of adult workers

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.660
own stock in their
firm, about 19 million.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.267
But 9% hold stock options, so
that's more than executives,

00:23:08.267 --> 00:23:08.870
right.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.480
There's only 5,000
stock market companies

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.800
with 20,000 top five executives.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.930
So stock options as you
have, and have had in Google,

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.850
are pretty ubiquitous,
at least among 9%.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.780
About one third
receive profit shares,

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.150
and every year about 6% of
the US working population

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.420
does receive stock options.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:33.320
We found that about 50%, exactly
about 48%, of all adult workers

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.140
receive some
combination of these,

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.490
and in tech companies
often they receive

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:43.300
a combination of all of them.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:48.560
Now the problem is
that the average dollar

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.590
value of many of these plans is
pretty modest and pretty small,

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.750
except in the most
generous companies.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.980
But the good part
of this is, if you

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.930
were to say that broad-based
equity and profit shares would

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:07.720
be a possible solution
to solve inequality,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.830
the mechanisms to do
that are already there.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.090
Companies are familiar
with these mechanisms

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.550
and they're pretty common
in the United States.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.120
By the way, more
common than in Europe

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.182
and more common than in Asia.

00:24:20.182 --> 00:24:21.890
Now I'm going to skip
through this slide.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.390
What are the share sectors?

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.350
Basically among the 5,000 stock
market companies, about 20%

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.380
of the Fortune 100, and
you see their fortune

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.230
500 ranking there, have either
broad-based equity or profit

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.890
sharing.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.290
Recently, Southwest Airlines,
just to give an example,

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.900
distributed 30% of all
of its cash profits

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:49.940
from the floor sweeper up
to the CEO of the company.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.730
And you see Googles
name up there.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.600
About half of the companies
that win the 100 best company

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.760
to work for in America contest
competition by Fortune magazine

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.847
have inclusive capitalism.

00:25:02.847 --> 00:25:04.555
Among leading high
tech companies-- well,

00:25:04.555 --> 00:25:07.520
I have a book on this with
my colleague Doug Kruse

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.520
and Business Week former
Associate Editor, Aaron

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.830
Bernstein, called "In
the Company of Owners"

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.980
about how this plays
out in tech companies.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.420
Among the 100 largest privately
held companies like Cargill,

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.700
Fidelity, Bloomberg,
Wegmans here

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.390
in New York, which has
cache profit sharing,

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.558
we see a lot of these
kinds of things.

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:27.932
And for example,
those of you who

00:25:27.932 --> 00:25:31.230
have been to Florida and
Georgia and the south,

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.470
Publix supermarkets-- 100%
owned by its employees.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.780
So in chapter two
of the book we show

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.940
that the idea that
you could have

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.280
a lot of broad-based
profit sharing

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.590
and broad-based employee
stock ownership and options

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.519
in the economy is demonstrated
by many of these cases.

00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:51.560
Many that we don't hear
about because they're not

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.970
in the newspaper a lot,
are closely held companies

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.930
in the privately held sector.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.000
There about 10 million
workers in about 10,000 ESOPs.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.010
As I mentioned, an ESOP is
Employee Stock Ownership Plan

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:09.130
where a company sets up a
trust, the trust borrows money

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.410
to buy stock for
workers, and then

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.730
the trust distributes
the stock to workers.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.200
Workers do not have to put
up their house as collateral

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.500
and they receive the
stock as a grant.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.130
You might ask yourself where do
10 million workers, a trillion

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.140
in market value, and
10,000 ESOP's come from.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.210
Well, if any of you like I
am, had a family business

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.710
in your family you know that
the worst thing with the family

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:36.470
business is when there isn't a
son or daughter to take over.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.620
And so what happens
is family businesses

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.090
are now selling the business
to the workers and managers who

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.200
built the business.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.390
The entrepreneur
takes the cash, goes

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:51.100
buy their condo in Southern
California or Boca Raton.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.930
And we have this among
entrepreneurial start-ups.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.940
And in the United States
the purest version

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.920
of this-- only about
400 worker co-ops

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:04.000
with three to 7,000
persons nationwide.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.950
OK, now I'm going to go
on for a few more minutes

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.890
and then we'll
stop for questions.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.490
Certainly employee ownership
has failed in American history.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.320
In the 1800's a
lot of trade unions

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.140
tried to set up
pure worker co-ops

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.690
and they were against hiring
professional management

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.090
and many of them
failed for that reason.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.760
Although some of
them did succeed.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.660
Some unions, when
they were faced

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.920
with the closure of a
factory or a company,

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:38.370
they gave concessions- salary,
benefit, work rule concessions

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.810
for stock.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.880
They implemented the
idea in a company

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.120
on its last breath, that
was not a good idea.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.020
United Airlines you've
heard, had an ESOP.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.180
Well, actually it
wasn't really an ESOP

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.030
it was a union
concessions situation.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.130
The workers of United
traded reduced wages,

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.750
reduced benefits,
increased work hours,

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.070
and more changes in
work rules for stock.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.830
It was implemented in a company
where labor and management just

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.030
hated each other.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.360
It was an important failure.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.830
It was not an ESOP
where workers receive

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.510
grants of stock
financed with credit.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.790
Heavy concentration of workers
being pushed and manipulated

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.010
to buy stock in their companies.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.720
Enron, WorldCom,
Lehman Brothers-

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.990
we know where that went.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.610
Some tech start-ups and
non-tech start-ups fail.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.822
Entrepreneurial companies
have a high rate of failure.

00:28:27.822 --> 00:28:28.905
You're one that succeeded.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.792
Now I'm just going to talk about
this briefly- one of the things

00:28:35.792 --> 00:28:37.750
that we do in the book,
even though it's mainly

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.180
a book of historical stories and
a history-- an American history

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.820
of shares, is we talk about
a review of about 100 years

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.300
of hard-nosed empirical
research using major data

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.040
sets on this question.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.950
I just want to comment on two.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:55.860
At the National Bureau
of Economic research

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.690
we received about
a million dollars

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.550
from the Russell Sage of
the Rockefeller Foundations

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.470
to study intensively
how workers respond

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.970
to inclusive capitalism,
with about 41,000 workers

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:12.020
in 14 firms, including large and
small tech and non-tech stock

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.290
market and privately held firms.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:18.400
And we generally found that the
workers with more share plans

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.430
and above the median percent
of their pay in shares

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.360
exhibited lower turnover,
greater loyalty,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.160
made more suggestions, were
more willing to work hard

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.930
and innovate, and they were
more willing to co-monitor

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.840
their fellow workers.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.440
This worked best when
there was a combination

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.520
with high performance
work practices,

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.120
such as high training of
workers, low supervision-

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.150
not too close supervision,
teams and job security.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.350
When you have this combination,
absenteeism went down.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:54.870
So I'm going to ask, if you
could pass around this chart,

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:59.680
and you can see
how much turnover

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.590
decreased in this research.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:07.480
Now when we did
this research, we

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.490
had to ask ourselves
under what conditions

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:13.750
does broad-based capitalism
really just bomb.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:14.490
OK.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.660
And we know what
those conditions are.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:22.180
You can see them in bold
at the bottom there.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.730
When workers are paid
below market wages

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.640
there's not enough
equity and profit share

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.510
you can throw at them
to motivate them.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.780
It just washes out all
the positive effects.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.880
When workers have
too much risk in

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.410
their personal economic
situation, same thing.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.460
And when you have high
and too close supervision,

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.580
right, you try to do
this kind of a workplace

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.350
and you have the
kind of supervision

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.010
that Henry Ford had in his
factories in the 1920s- not

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:52.120
going to work.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.900
Now a second study I want
to comment on briefly-

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.390
our first study was kind of
challenged because obviously we

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.670
were looking at 41,000
workers in 14 companies,

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.960
it was not a random sample,
although I should mention

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.930
that we commissioned a national
survey of all the adult workers

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.730
again from the
University of Chicago

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.340
in the general
social survey and we

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.520
were able to replicate our
regression analysis with that.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.410
But Eric Maskin who as you know,
later received the Nobel Prize

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.040
in Economics, was the
respondent on this paper.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.420
And he said, you know what,
I would believe these results

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.000
if you gave me many, many
more workers, many, many more

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.800
companies, and
other than a worker

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.360
supplied report measure
on expected turn over.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.814
So I asked myself, "where can
we find such a huge data set

00:31:40.814 --> 00:31:41.730
in the United States?"

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:45.120
And it is, in fact, the
data set of the great place

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.830
to work Institute
that puts together

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:51.310
the scoring for Fortune magazine
for the 100 best companies

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.970
to work for contest.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:57.570
Using the data set of
305,000 random worker

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.540
surveys at the applicants-
both the winners and losers

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.820
from 2005 to 2007, and over
13,000 applicant corporations,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.180
we were able to replicate
the finding from the earlier

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.670
National Bureau of
Economic Research study.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.531
This was funded by
the Sloan Foundation.

00:32:15.531 --> 00:32:17.780
And now I'm going to conclude
in the next five minutes

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.070
and then we'll stop
for questions--

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.700
by the way bless you.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.080
I am not going to read
through this slide other

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.390
than to say that the big
sector of pure worker

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.210
ownership in the United
States is in fact ESOPs.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.830
As I said, about 10,000 ESOPs,
about 10 million workers,

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.030
about one trillion in
market value- mostly

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.570
in companies with
under 500 employees.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:42.070
In general, we find
higher productivity

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.730
when you have this
proper corporate culture

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.810
of high training teams,
not low supervision.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:53.100
We also found that these
companies where a worker

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.950
trust is set up that buys
stock and then pays off

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.340
that stock from the revenues
of the company- they have

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.700
on those loans a very,
very low default rate.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.170
And we found workers
in these companies

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.310
generally are paid above market
because you wouldn't want

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:15.790
to develop inclusive capitalism
if workers wages were cut

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.070
so they could receive
stock and profit sharing.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:21.180
It would be a bad idea.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.170
So why should we care
about wealth shares?

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.500
And if you could pass
around the next two handouts

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.110
I would appreciate that.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.950
The reason to care about
shares is wealth inequality.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.820
As you know, it's the main
economic and domestic policy

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.550
issue today.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:41.310
Inequality is mainly about
capital income and capital

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.520
ownership being concentrated.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.670
So inflation adjusted wages
have been relatively flat

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.030
since 1880.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.220
Globalization, the
decline of unions,

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.530
many things have
contributed to this.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.150
The top 1% of households
control one of all wealth.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:01.590
The top 10% controls 75% of
all wealth, and more than 80%

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:03.540
of financial assets.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.160
And you can see from this
chart in front of you

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.909
called "Capital Income
Highly Concentrated"

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:11.694
from the Brookings
Institution Tax Policy Center,

00:34:11.694 --> 00:34:15.750
that the top 20% of
households receive

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:23.540
86% of all capital gains
and all capital income.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.010
I've passed out another
chart showing, adjusted

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:31.489
for inflation, how the income
after tax income when you take

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:35.666
into account the poor who
receive transfer payments

00:34:35.666 --> 00:34:38.040
and the rich who paid more
taxes when you take everything

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.090
into account.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:40.980
I've passed out
another chart showing--

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.360
it says "summary figure one"--
how incomes grew between 1979

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.860
and 2007.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:51.840
It's been updated to 2010,
and the top 1% income growth

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.553
has been something on
the range of around 250%

00:34:54.553 --> 00:34:59.370
and you could see for the
quintiles of the middle classes

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.600
it's just been pretty
bad-- really horrible.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:07.620
Capital income to
the top 1% recently

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:11.480
went from one third
of all capital income

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:17.380
in 1979 to 3/5 in 2005.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.870
Now the federal government
has in recent times--

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.460
unlike those really
comprehensive policies

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.340
at the beginning
of our history--

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.680
always got this wrong.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.370
OK?

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:31.360
What is the main way that the
federal government encourages

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.010
workers to have employee stock
ownership in their companies?

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.880
Buying company stock in
401(k) plans with their wages.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.870
OK.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.010
That's too risky.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.680
It's too risky and
the middle class

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.090
doesn't have enough extra money
to buy enough capital, capital

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:46.710
ownership.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.340
Why would we have a system,
as the federal government now

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.920
has designed for
us, where those who

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.180
have capability for the
lowest amount to risk

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.920
and have more wealth--
in other words

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.800
top executives in
companies, right-- they

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.750
have access to the lowest
risk forms of employees

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.960
ownership, grants of restricted
stock and stock options.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.120
Where the middle class that has
less wealth and less appetite

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.190
for risk is encouraged
through the 401(k) laws

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:18.080
to buy more risk
with their wages.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.230
The first George Bush and
the Clinton administration,

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.600
without going into detail,
eliminated a large number

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.790
of tax incentives for
stock market companies

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.000
to do big employee
stock ownership plans.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.850
Every major financial
services, Wall Street bank

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:35.580
in New York in the late
'80s and the early 1990s,

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.786
had a employee
ownership division--

00:36:37.786 --> 00:36:39.160
you may not want
to believe this,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.610
but it's true-- to try to
develop this in companies

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:46.550
until Bush and Clinton
destroyed these tax incentives.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.800
The last President
Bush, through a series

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.480
of policies
eliminated incentives

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.480
for broad-based stock options.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.140
An interesting story is
the Clinton-Gore reform

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.407
on executive pay, which said
that companies could only

00:37:00.407 --> 00:37:02.615
deduct one million dollars,
up to one million dollars

00:37:02.615 --> 00:37:05.100
in fixed pay for the
top five executives.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.480
What do they do as it
went through Congress?

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.920
They added that the deductions
for top five executives

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.940
for employee stock
ownership equity

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.780
and profit share related
pay would be unlimited.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.280
Just for the top five, OK?

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.160
You know how much that costs?

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.810
It costs you, the taxpayer, five
to 10 billion dollars a year

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:25.960
in tax incentives.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.630
In other words, you are
subsidizing executive pay

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:34.320
in all 5,000 public companies,
$5 to $10 billion a year.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.170
You know what the
total tax incentives

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.300
for broad-based employee
stock ownership plans

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.590
are in the United States?

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.510
One billion.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:45.880
So federal policy is all
messed up, all messed up here.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:51.150
To conclude, what we would
like to see to move more

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.180
towards broad-based capitalism,
is follow the founders

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.520
principles-- those
points of James Madison

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.420
I mentioned in the beginning.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.760
Public corporations can
only deduct executive equity

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.790
and profit sharing plans if
they have a broad-based share

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.670
plan for all their employees.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.065
By the way, Google
would qualify.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.910
All businesses can only
receive the trillion dollars

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.510
in corporate tax incentives that
get given out every five years

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.900
if they have a broad-based share
plan for all their employees.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.320
To fix the Bush mistake, there
would be a special tax credit

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.870
for firms that have broad-based
stock option and stock granting

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.570
plans, as you have here.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:35.020
There would be a special
tax credit for these firms.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.585
For workers in
not-for-profit companies

00:38:37.585 --> 00:38:39.460
we have to figure out
a way to deal with that

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.630
and I would recommend that we
look to the Alaska Permanent

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.860
Corporation.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.800
The Alaska Permanent
Corporation gets money

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.960
from leasing oil and
natural resources

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.560
fields and access to oil
and resource companies,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.340
puts it in a fund and
invests it and pays

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.870
a dividend to every
citizen of Alaska.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.210
What I'd like to see is the
federal government set up

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.900
a piece of legislation
to encourage in states

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.280
and localities in cities
around the country there to be

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.190
similar kinds of
corporations that would use

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.000
various kinds of assets--
the wireless spectrum,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.240
these corporations would own
solar energy and wind energy

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.850
farms, they might take
ownership of various parts

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.390
of the electromagnetic
spectrum as I said,

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:28.080
and other kinds of assets.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.860
They would get lower interest
loans and tax incentives

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.569
and they would provide
dividend payments to citizens

00:39:33.569 --> 00:39:35.610
because as I've established
and as the evidence's

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.700
has established,
the middle class

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.940
is going to decline because
their wages adjusted

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.060
for inflation are
flat or going down.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.060
Unless we directly
address the concentration

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.325
of capital ownership
and capital income

00:39:48.325 --> 00:39:50.450
we're not going to be able
to deal with this issue.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.720
Finally, can the internet
disrupt wealth inequality?

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.090
Remember it was supposed
to strengthen democracy,

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.300
but the internet has
had very little impact

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.310
on the concentration of capital
ownership and capital income.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:11.200
The concentration of capital
ownership and capital gains

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.450
and capital income.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:16.590
Wealth and income inequality,
during the same period

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:20.420
the internet has grown,
have gotten worse every year

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.610
in the United States.

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.620
The internet has failed
to deal with this issue.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.530
One possibility would
be Shares app that

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:31.290
could pull data from SEC filings
on the extent of stock market

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:33.850
company share plans,
department of labor filings

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.780
on the extent of ESOP's,
and employee surveys

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.780
on the extent of their
equity profit sharing

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.680
plans that every
citizen could get to.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.820
We should brainstorm others.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.670
If you want to read
chapter one you

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.240
could go to our website
site, thecitizensshare.com,

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.300
or you could follow my
comments on Twitter.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.977
Delighted to be with you today.

00:40:54.977 --> 00:40:55.810
Thank you very much.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.625
I'll be happy to take your
questions and discussion.

00:41:06.091 --> 00:41:08.490
Yes?

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.912
AUDIENCE: These days, whenever
the subject of inequality

00:41:10.912 --> 00:41:13.618
comes up, everyone
pretty much automatically

00:41:13.618 --> 00:41:16.820
has to talk about Piketty.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.470
You see, to be talking about
methods for essentially getting

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:26.650
more capital flow to the
people at the low end.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:31.145
Piketty's solution seems to be
to add friction to the ability,

00:41:31.145 --> 00:41:35.610
through taxes and such, to
add friction to the ability

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:40.360
to accumulate large
quantities of capital.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.130
Can you talk at all about
sort of the difference

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.840
between your approach and
Piketty's and what you think

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.840
of Piketty and what Piketty
might think of you--

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.220
or not you, but I mean the work.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.070
JOSEPH BLASI: Well, if you--
don't worry about that-- if you

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:56.510
see the paperback,
Thomas Pikkety's opinion

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.740
about the book is on the
top of the front cover,

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.840
so I'll let him
speak for himself.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:04.770
We met in Paris last
February just before he

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:07.950
came to the United States, but
I will comment on his work.

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:12.290
First of all, I think that
Thomas Piketty's work has

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.990
created a big focus on
wealth and income inequality

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.920
like there has never been,
and despite the debate--

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.340
and by the way I
think that he is

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.780
on solid ground
with his results--

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.290
the census, the
Congressional Budget

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:33.400
Office, and many other
sources support his results

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.350
for the United
States concentration

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:36.790
of wealth and income inequality.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:39.410
As to his solution,
yes, his solution

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.440
would be called a
redistribution because what

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.820
he would like to do is
have high income tax taxes

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.750
for the wealthy,
in the 60%, 70%,

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:54.640
80% range plus a modest
tax on all wealth assets.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:58.620
So high tax on annual
income and a modest 1% to 2%

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.250
tax on all wealth.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:05.460
The rich would have to file
a report on their wealth.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.250
I will make two comments.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:11.810
First of all, if one applied the
broad-based property ownership

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.370
approach of the founders
of the American Revolution

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:17.800
and some of the suggestions
that we're talking about one

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.330
could address this
in a different way

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.090
by broadening
property ownership.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.870
And I think the
stark choice that we

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:30.060
have is between redistribution,
broad-based property ownership

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.130
attempts that we're talking
about, and feudalism.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:33.750
Right?

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:35.910
At the time of the
American Revolution,

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:40.690
the British aristocracy
controlled 80% of all land

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:43.830
in England and you can see
the numbers that I showed you,

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:45.590
those are US government
numbers -- census,

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.950
Congressional Budget Office--
we're approaching or surpassing

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:50.450
that.

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:58.190
James Madison and others of the
founders at the Constitutional

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:02.050
Convention worried about
this, and for those

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:05.170
who have spent their
time attacking Piketty

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:11.940
I will say, go and read the
Constitutional Convention book

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.120
and you will see that they
said if we can't continue

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.490
to maintain broad-based property
ownership there will be calls

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:22.100
through redistribution in a
democratic system, the majority

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.400
that will be disenfranchised
will vote for higher taxes.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:31.090
So I think that that's a
problem and probably we're

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:35.720
going to see a lot more conflict
over this issue in the future,

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:41.000
unless the Republican and the
Democratic Party, both of which

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.590
seem to be bereft of any
real ideas other than

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.250
lies on this issue.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.750
Right?

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:50.080
The Republicans want you think
that every few years then

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.410
give you a $1500
tax cut and it's

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.800
going to solve wealth
inequality and the Democrats

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.940
want you to think that they
can give you the minimum wage

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.390
and health care and it will
solve wealth inequality.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.170
Both are just stark, stark lies.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.070
If we don't deal with
broad-based property ownership,

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:12.750
I think there will be calls
for greater taxes on wealth

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:13.450
and income.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:18.410
Although these things will be
very, very hard to implement.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.775
OK.

00:45:20.775 --> 00:45:21.900
Did I answer your question?

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.590
AUDIENCE: Sort of.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:27.298
JOSEPH BLASI: OK.

00:45:27.298 --> 00:45:28.365
Well, come back to me.

00:45:28.365 --> 00:45:32.640
AUDIENCE: Maybe if I could
just add a mechanical problem.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:39.510
If the top 20% already
have 86% how are you

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.770
get it away from them?

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.780
Without doing redistribution.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:49.470
JOSEPH BLASI: Well, the policies
we talk about in the book

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:52.110
don't involve
redistribution, they

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:56.170
involve broadening
ownership opportunities.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.930
And if there are more
people that have capital

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.250
than that number will go down.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:05.550
If you have broader capital
ownership, so for example,

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:09.570
let's imagine Google was
built on the internet.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:14.630
Let's imagine the next 20
technological breakthroughs.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:19.400
OK, let's imagine an
economy with robots.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:24.910
These items, these
capital resources, I think

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:29.490
should be largely owned by these
citizen trust private market

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.500
economy corporations
to pay dividends.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.620
If you can envision the roll
out of what we're talking about,

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.820
you will see that the
capital income and capital

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.150
gains going to the
top would go down.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:43.415
Not because their property
was taken but because,

00:46:43.415 --> 00:46:45.150
as the founders
talked about, there

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:48.150
were broader opportunities
for acquisition of property

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.720
to everyone else.

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.270
However I do want to be
very clear about this.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:56.900
I do not think that simply
broadening ownership

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.260
in workplaces through profit
sharing and employee equity

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.550
is enough, I think you have
to have things like the Alaska

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:06.610
Permanent Corporation
in addition.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:08.700
But we owe it to our
political traditions

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.380
to at least try these things.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.770
That's the best I
can answer right now.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:17.110
I'm happy to talk with
you more afterwards.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:18.421
Yes?

00:47:18.421 --> 00:47:19.962
AUDIENCE: You just
mentioned that you

00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:23.234
don't think that just
employing things like,

00:47:23.234 --> 00:47:24.942
employee stock options,
things like that,

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:27.067
would be enough to solve
the wealth inequality gap.

00:47:27.067 --> 00:47:29.424
Have you guys done any
quantitative modeling

00:47:29.424 --> 00:47:33.408
to see if, let's say what would
happen if 100% of the top 5,000

00:47:33.408 --> 00:47:35.649
companies adopted
this, like what

00:47:35.649 --> 00:47:37.392
would be the impact
on wealth inequality?

00:47:37.392 --> 00:47:40.271
Or like, how much would it
take to actually solve the gap?

00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:42.270
JOSEPH BLASI: Well, the
analysis that we've done

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:44.790
has to do with who are the
employees of these companies,

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:47.300
and the problem is that there's
a large amount of the US

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:52.350
population in the nonprofit
government sector.

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:56.440
And the second thing is that
our tax incentive policies

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.640
would encourage companies,
but not force them,

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.500
to implement these plans.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.390
So it's likely the people at
the lower end of the spectrum

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:09.430
might still get lower payments
in profit shares and employee

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.360
ownership.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.450
The thing I want to emphasize is
that the US government spends,

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:18.010
as I said, trillions of
dollars every five years,

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.790
over a trillion dollars,
on tax incentives

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.380
and many of these
incentives incent

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.980
concentrated capital ownership.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.317
We simply want to switch
that-- switch that around

00:48:27.317 --> 00:48:28.650
and then we'll see what happens.

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:30.720
I will say one thing
that is encouraging,

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.580
in tech for example, managers
with some government support

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.180
early in the '70s and the '80s,
spread throughout the tech

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:42.270
economy broad-based employee
ownership and profit sharing.

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:45.190
The Bush administration
came in and did some things

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.870
with the expensing
of stock options

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.340
and not creating a tax
incentive for companies

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.190
like-- that have broad-based
stock options after that, kind

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:53.130
of destroyed that.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:53.870
OK.

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:56.880
Employee ownership has fallen
about 75% in tech companies,

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.190
just so that you know.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:01.860
The Bush administration really
hit tech companies hard.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.540
So I think we have
to see what happens,

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.873
but we're certainly going to
need things like the Alaska

00:49:05.873 --> 00:49:09.730
Permanent Corporation
to deal with this.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:11.609
Yes?

00:49:11.609 --> 00:49:24.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
and you don't really

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:28.012
talk about that very much.

00:49:28.012 --> 00:49:30.402
How do you propose to get
the political [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:30.402 --> 00:49:33.270
to actually make this happen?

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:38.010
JOSEPH BLASI: Well,
in three ways.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:40.860
First of all, what
is new about our book

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:45.190
is that we demonstrate to both
conservatives and progressives

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:48.650
that there is a strong
bipartisan American tradition

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:50.771
for broad-based
property ownership.

00:49:50.771 --> 00:49:52.270
For those in the
Tea Party, and I've

00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:56.620
spoken to Tea Party audiences,
I will speak to you again

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.950
and say that yes low taxes
and small government is

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:04.640
right there in the founders
writings when you read it.

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:08.050
But I also will say the Tea
Party, many of the tea parties

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.727
advocates, forget the third
thing in the founders writings.

00:50:11.727 --> 00:50:14.060
Broad-based property ownership
is necessary for a public

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:14.560
to exist.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.982
In fact, the founders believed,
if you read them closely,

00:50:17.982 --> 00:50:19.940
that it was broad-based
property ownership that

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:23.890
caused low taxes and
small government,

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:26.480
because households had
enough economic liberty

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.080
they didn't need the
government enough

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.520
and taxes were not needed
for transfer payments.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.250
So it's a direct
challenge to, I would say,

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:37.330
a dishonest Tea Party
reading of American history.

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.430
Having said that
though, there is

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:43.790
an honest Republican
conservative Tea Party

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:47.240
reading of broad-based
property ownership that I think

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.570
will help them
support these ideas.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:52.640
And there is an honest approach
where broad-based property

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.250
ownership fits with
the social justice

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:58.270
interest of conservatives--
of progressives.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:00.490
The second approach
is that, as I said

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.120
and as we show in
chapter three, there

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.890
are a lot of companies in
all parts of the economy that

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:07.087
do this and we can
demonstrate that this

00:51:07.087 --> 00:51:11.830
is something that could
function acceptably.

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:15.650
But the third thing really
goes back to your question.

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:18.150
There really is no
other alternative,

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:22.840
other than a redistribution or
broadening property ownership.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.540
And I think that we
have to really get

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.940
those are the two
alternatives or simply moving

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.290
more towards feudalism.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.970
If people realize, if our
political leaders realize,

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.900
that's the stark
choice than I think

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.590
we might get some
political will.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:37.650
I certainly hope.

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:39.980
If we don't, I think
we're going to have

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:46.721
a big public fight about this
issue every year going forward.

00:51:46.721 --> 00:51:47.220
Yes?

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:51.172
AUDIENCE: So I'm in the middle
of a book on [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:51.172 --> 00:51:53.750
and it's sort of
interesting the scale

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:55.124
that's unleashed
in combinations.

00:51:55.124 --> 00:51:57.904
So, if you propose, kind
of reallocating capital

00:51:57.904 --> 00:52:00.279
buy, creating stock plans for
those individual companies,

00:52:00.279 --> 00:52:01.277
things like that.

00:52:01.277 --> 00:52:04.770
How do you ensure that
allocation survives big mergers

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:10.202
and acquisitions and those sort
of transactions [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:10.202 --> 00:52:11.660
JOSEPH BLASI: Well
I will say this,

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.326
a lot of the companies that have
broad-based ownership or profit

00:52:14.326 --> 00:52:16.050
sharing have gone
through big mergers.

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.960
For example, Southwest
recently bought

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.232
AirTran and they're rolling
this out with AirTran.

00:52:20.232 --> 00:52:22.190
I know Google is constantly
acquiring companies

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:24.590
and including them in this.

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:27.480
Procter and Gamble has
spin offs and acquisitions.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.960
But specifically focused
on private equity,

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.180
consistent with our
ideas, the special tax

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:40.570
incentive for
special capital gains

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:44.360
treatment of the profits
for private equity partners

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.940
in my view should
only be available

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.150
if they have broad-based
share plans in their portfolio

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.860
companies.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.220
That's an example
of a tax incentive

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.500
which violates each of
those principles of James

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.590
Madison laid it out.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.330
And it has to be
turned on its head.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:01.710
There are ways for
private equity firms

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.980
to use broad-based employee
ownership and profit

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.360
sharing when they acquire
a portfolio company

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:09.810
and then four to six years
later when they spin it off

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.610
they could use an ESOP.

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:13.830
So I think this could be
relevant to private equity.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:17.390
You are correct that if you
look at the stock market

00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:20.210
the NASDAQ and NYSE
I think probably

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:22.210
about 17 trillion
dollars today--

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:24.930
private equity is already
several trillion dollars,

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.550
so you can't deal
with this issue

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:28.480
unless you have approach
to private equity.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.590
You're absolutely
on the button there.

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:33.736
Yes?

00:53:33.736 --> 00:53:37.419
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] what
would happen if this actually

00:53:37.419 --> 00:53:38.892
went through in the end?

00:53:38.892 --> 00:53:44.293
So [INAUDIBLE]
Contract employees

00:53:44.293 --> 00:53:49.700
to get around this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.110
JOSEPH BLASI: No, I
understand and as you know,

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:55.420
Microsoft's part-time
employees had a major lawsuit

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.530
with Microsoft over this issue.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:02.110
It's very clear that in
what Professor of Economics

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:04.630
at Harvard, Martin
Weitzman, called a share

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:10.070
economy that there would be
some changes in laws and laws

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:13.740
necessary and employees,
even part-time employees

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.450
and contract employees would be
more cognizant of their rights.

00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.170
I want to go back at
the beginning just

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.980
for 10 seconds to the
cod fishing story.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.970
Remember, Washington's
legislation

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.440
said that every
ship that went out

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:29.560
had to have a signed contract
between the captain on the ship

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.070
and all the sailors that
the capital would obey,

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:34.500
a broad-based profit
sharing contract.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:40.010
If you go and look at the
local courts in New England

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.140
you will see that fights
over that contract

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:45.660
were a common thing between
sailors and shippers

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.160
at the day.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.200
In other words, some kind of
legal enforcement mechanism

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.030
had to emerge.

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:53.210
For example, if a
sailor got on in Boston

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.070
and didn't get off at
the end of the voyage,

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:58.270
but got off Bangor, Maine how
much of the profit share should

00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:59.320
he or she get?

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.940
So I would expect there
would be some legal uptake

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:05.840
to deal with the changes
that we would have.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.810
Other questions?

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:09.065
Yes?

00:55:09.065 --> 00:55:11.440
AUDIENCE: How's the share--
either in stock or the Alaska

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.130
Permanent Corporation-- how's
the share superior to just

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:17.890
a raw amount of money.

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:22.844
there How is it better than
say, just a 20% bump in salary?

00:55:22.844 --> 00:55:25.010
JOSEPH BLASI: Well, the
problem with bumps in salary

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:28.100
is that we had a
bump-in-salary economy.

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.877
I grew up in the mining region
in Northeastern Pennsylvania--

00:55:31.877 --> 00:55:33.210
by the way thank you for coming.

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.001
I know many of you have
to get back to work

00:55:35.001 --> 00:55:37.425
and I'll conclude
soon-- and we used

00:55:37.425 --> 00:55:39.050
to call it working
for the post office.

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:40.640
Working for the
post office meant

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:44.730
that every year your
union got you a 3% to 5%

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:48.030
real wage increase and you
had a defined benefit pension

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:52.090
plan that paid you 70% to 80% of
your average of your last five

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:55.330
income for life.

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:57.320
Under the protected
economy after World War

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.280
I, where the United States
destroyed all of its enemies

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.830
and was the dominant
power and we

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:05.660
had trade protections
around our economy,

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.350
you remember those days right?

00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:10.900
The union workers from
AT&amp;T wanted a raise,

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.670
the union would
threaten to strike,

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:16.090
AT&amp;T would go to the
FCC and get the money,

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:17.580
and increase your
telephone bill.

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:18.180
OK.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:21.160
That was before globalization
and before deregulation

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.750
and all of these things.

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:25.500
With globalization and
deregulation and heightened

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:29.890
competition, there isn't
as much give in the system

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:32.680
to build all wealth
through wage increases.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.600
So that's one objection.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.140
And we have a different
context now, we have as I said,

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:38.510
we have globalization.

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:40.730
But there's sort
of a second reason.

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:43.160
The structure of the
economy has now changed,

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.930
so as I've demonstrated
with these statistics,

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:50.440
most of the wealth is coming--
so the households that

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.290
are doing best in the economy
are getting that from capital

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:56.310
gains and grants of
capital ownership.

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:58.930
If you own the
robots in the future,

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.740
you're going to get some wealth.

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.390
And the amount of
wage increases,

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:05.960
of wealth increases
coming from labor income

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.600
is going down, whether you look
at the Congressional Budget

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.680
Office or the Bureau
of Labor Statistics,

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.870
the percent of labor income
in the entire economy

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.940
is going down and it
keeps dropping every year

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.440
and this is another
thing that keeps

00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.940
dropping as the
internet keeps going.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.730
Something is wrong.

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:24.490
So that's my response to that.

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:27.760
Labor income won't do it alone.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.800
Although sure, there
clearly are some situations

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.910
where labor income
is unfair, there

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:35.430
should be a minimum
wage I think.

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:37.650
I disagree with
conservatives on this,

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:41.660
and I also think there are some
industries where unions have

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:46.020
a role to play In terms of
getting fair labor income,

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.930
but in general only
focusing on labor income

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:53.230
is not going to solve the
middle classes decline.

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:54.951
Are we at 1 o'clock?

00:57:54.951 --> 00:57:55.450
OK.

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.080
Well I want to
thank you for coming

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.140
and I'll stay around
for a few minutes.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:00.920
Thank you so much.
