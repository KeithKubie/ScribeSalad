00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270
wherever the user is and then think
 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.450
wherever the user is and then think
about how to relate the library to those

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460
about how to relate the library to those
 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.089

digitization very much how do we get
 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.270

potentially use network services for
 

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.810
potentially use network services for
some types of things and we've seen a

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:10.820
some types of things and we've seen a
 

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.840
some types of things and we've seen a
lot of this moving up in the network as

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:13.850
lot of this moving up in the network as
 

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.910
lot of this moving up in the network as
we share infrastructure it's very

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:15.920
we share infrastructure it's very
 

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.560
we share infrastructure it's very
difficult though and a lot of the

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:17.570
difficult though and a lot of the
 

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.720
difficult though and a lot of the
discussion earlier was about at some of

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:19.730
discussion earlier was about at some of
 

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.310
discussion earlier was about at some of
the difficulty of that collective

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:21.320
the difficulty of that collective

but really how do we do that and so

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.140
but really how do we do that and so
 

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.380
but really how do we do that and so
focus on infrastructure that

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:29.390
focus on infrastructure that
 

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.590
focus on infrastructure that
infrastructure is changing and but

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:32.600
infrastructure is changing and but
 

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.839
infrastructure is changing and but
really the attention is now shifting to

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:34.849
really the attention is now shifting to
 

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:36.790
really the attention is now shifting to
some extent away from that

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800
some extent away from that
 

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.620

infrastructure are thinking about how we
manage that infrastructure differently

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:40.280
manage that infrastructure differently
 

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.180

that really shifts quite quite quite a

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:06.329
that really shifts quite quite quite a
 

00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:08.809
that really shifts quite quite quite a
bit of the focus and and you know we're

00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:08.819
bit of the focus and and you know we're
 

00:11:08.819 --> 00:11:12.079
bit of the focus and and you know we're
in the middle of all of these shifts and

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:12.089
in the middle of all of these shifts and
 

00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:15.620
in the middle of all of these shifts and
and this obviously causes some tensions

listening to the BBC while ago and there
 

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.559
listening to the BBC while ago and there
was this program on about architects and

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:33.569
was this program on about architects and
 

00:11:33.569 --> 00:11:36.139
was this program on about architects and
there was an architect on bemoaning the

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:36.149
there was an architect on bemoaning the
 

00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:37.939
there was an architect on bemoaning the
fact that there were fewer employment

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:37.949
fact that there were fewer employment
 

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:42.220

all these other people and it just
 

00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:47.929

struck me it was exactly like some of

libraries so the point that they made
 

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:52.970
libraries so the point that they made
was well the opportunity the employment

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980
was well the opportunity the employment
 

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.490
was well the opportunity the employment
opportunity for architects is not as

and it you know it's interesting to

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:02.070
and it you know it's interesting to
 

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.070
and it you know it's interesting to
consider you know what we've done

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080
consider you know what we've done
 

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.140
consider you know what we've done
successfully there and what is remained

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:06.150
successfully there and what is remained
 

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.140
successfully there and what is remained
within within the institution and I do

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:09.150
within within the institution and I do
 

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.940
within within the institution and I do
think that's an area where where some

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:10.950
think that's an area where where some
 

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.040
think that's an area where where some
serious investigation would be would be

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.050
serious investigation would be would be
 

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.210
serious investigation would be would be
would be quite interesting now by chance

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:16.220
would be quite interesting now by chance
 

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.310
would be quite interesting now by chance
and I came across this video a while ago

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320
and I came across this video a while ago
 

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.040
and I came across this video a while ago
so this is a sociologist here at

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:22.050
so this is a sociologist here at
 

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.350
so this is a sociologist here at
Columbia and he's talking about

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360
Columbia and he's talking about
 

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.330
Columbia and he's talking about
innovation and quite quite an

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.340
innovation and quite quite an
 

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.760
innovation and quite quite an
interesting way and so he says the

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:28.770
interesting way and so he says the
 

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.620
interesting way and so he says the
received wisdom about innovation is that

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:30.630
received wisdom about innovation is that
 

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.690
received wisdom about innovation is that
arises from some recombination of

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700
arises from some recombination of
 

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.820
arises from some recombination of
existing and novel resources that bring

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:34.830
existing and novel resources that bring
 

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.310
existing and novel resources that bring
about something new so that's part of

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320
about something new so that's part of
 

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.380
about something new so that's part of
the story and but it's the least

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:39.390
the story and but it's the least
 

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.840
the story and but it's the least
interesting part so that's the stuff

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:41.850
interesting part so that's the stuff
 

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.390
interesting part so that's the stuff
that's sort of near the center you know

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400
that's sort of near the center you know
 

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.180
that's sort of near the center you know
that's the new novel gold iPhone you

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.190
that's the new novel gold iPhone you
 

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.850
that's the new novel gold iPhone you
know I'm type stuff the real achievement

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860
know I'm type stuff the real achievement
 

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.169
know I'm type stuff the real achievement
and I think this should this should be

00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.179
and I think this should this should be
 

00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:53.510
and I think this should this should be
the basis of the basic goal of the

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520
the basis of the basic goal of the

the basis of the basic goal of the
Academy is figuring out how to mobilize

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280
Academy is figuring out how to mobilize
 

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.760
Academy is figuring out how to mobilize
new ideas so that they stabilize new

knowledge within larger networks of
 

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.860
knowledge within larger networks of
interaction outside the Academy so the

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:03.870
interaction outside the Academy so the
 

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.980
interaction outside the Academy so the
example he uses is that pastor you know

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:06.990
example he uses is that pastor you know
 

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:12.919
example he uses is that pastor you know
so pastor works on pasteurization in in

00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:12.929
so pastor works on pasteurization in in
 

00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:15.500
so pastor works on pasteurization in in
the laboratory and it's by interacting

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:15.510
the laboratory and it's by interacting
 

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.419
the laboratory and it's by interacting
with these networks of physicians

00:24:19.419 --> 00:24:19.429
with these networks of physicians
 

00:24:19.429 --> 00:24:21.799
with these networks of physicians
farmers of others that he actually

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:21.809
farmers of others that he actually
 

00:24:21.809 --> 00:24:24.049
farmers of others that he actually
stabilizes the idea of pasteurization

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059
stabilizes the idea of pasteurization
 

00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:27.919
stabilizes the idea of pasteurization
and moves it into general practice so

00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:27.929
and moves it into general practice so
 

00:24:27.929 --> 00:24:31.280
and moves it into general practice so
the argument is that you have to develop

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:31.290
the argument is that you have to develop
 

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.770
the argument is that you have to develop
solutions to problems but then you make

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:33.780
solutions to problems but then you make
 

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.230
