SHANEE NISHRY: Hey, I
did not see you there.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.210
I was just watching 360
videos with Cardboard.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.710
HUSAIN BENGALI: Did you mean
you were watching a Jump video?

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.080
SHANEE NISHRY:
Yes, that's right.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.940
HUSAIN BENGALI: That's great.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.750
Have you checked
out the Jump camera?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.680
SHANEE NISHRY: Let's go see it.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.596
HUSAIN BENGALI: Great.

00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:17.100
Let's do it.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.080
So here we have our
Jump camera, which

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.620
is 16 camera modules in
a circular arrangement.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.520
And this allows us to capture
stereoscopic 360 video

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.460
in a way better
than ever before.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.040
What we do with
these 16 cameras is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.540
we take the video
coming from them

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.060
and put it in our
cloud assembler.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.330
Our assembler uses thousands
of machines and some software

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.130
magic to create a
seamless panorama.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.820
That's a panorama without
any boundaries, borders.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.780
And you get to take a
look at this in 360 3D,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.320
which means near things look
near, far things look far.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.320
And you can look anywhere
just like you normally

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.234
would if you were
actually in a place.

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:58.650
SHANEE NISHRY: And we are using
Cardboard to look at it as

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.180
though a video's through it.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.120
And speaking of Cardboard,
we have a new version here.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.110
We have replaced the magnet
with a capacitive trigger

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.320
right here.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.530
And now it gives us the
access to a lot more devices,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.640
such as iOS iPhone devices.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.320
And speaking of
Jump and Cardboard,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.655
what else can we do with it?

00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:19.780
HUSAIN BENGALI: With Jump,
that's a great question.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.110
So I think we're only at
the tip of the iceberg

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.722
as far as possibilities
with Jump go.

00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:25.930
We hope you will use Jump
to capture some of the most

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.310
beautiful places on Earth.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.160
In fact, Expeditions, which
is a way for school children

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.850
to go on field trips while
sitting in their classrooms,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.780
through the help of VR,
is using some Jump content

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.120
to go to really interesting
and educational places.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.370
SHANEE NISHRY: That's awesome.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.340
You know what I'd like?

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.390
I'd love if a class could be
studying Mars, for example,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.460
using 360 videos.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.251
HUSAIN BENGALI: Yeah,
we need to figure out

00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:50.556
how to get this thing to Mars.

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:52.930
SHANEE NISHRY: But if
you're a developer,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.100
then check out our website.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.800
We have listed a new UX
library, a new UX application,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.560
so you can see our best
practices for designing for VR.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.380
Thank you for
watching us from I/O.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.730
