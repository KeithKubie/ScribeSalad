00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:09.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Go ahead, pull.

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:15.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: From the outside, Mary
Scroggs Elementary School looks

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:18.576
like it could have been built
in the '20s, but this building,

00:00:18.676 --> 00:00:21.636
part of a neo-traditional development
in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:24.836
is just three years
old, and on the inside,

00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:27.446
it's one of the most wired
schools in the country.

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.426
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And there's our web page,
and our end of the day summary.

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:34.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Here, tech
tools facilitate everything

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:37.156
from kindergarten web pages
to the daily morning newscast.

00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:39.396
&gt;&gt;Student: The news is
brought to you by the students

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:41.216
from Miss Todd's third grade class.

00:00:41.876 --> 00:00:43.586
Now, Bryson, what are
today's announcements?

00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:47.146
&gt;&gt;Bryson: Hello Scroggs Frogs,
here are today's announcements.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:48.396
Today, Wednesday, some people--

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:49.186
&gt;&gt;Susan: We let everyone

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:51.686
from kindergarteners to
fifth graders try it.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:54.236
And then they practice with
their teachers in the classroom.

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:56.696
I give them a sample script,
they practice with that.

00:00:57.116 --> 00:01:00.946
And then they come down, and that
morning, the five or ten kids

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:04.546
that are going to be on, and we run
through it a few times with them,

00:01:04.546 --> 00:01:06.406
and then we do it live every day.

00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:07.386
&gt;&gt;Student: I woke up, I listened

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:09.086
to all the different
sounds coming from--

00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:10.996
&gt;&gt;Susan: I've got four
fifth grade helpers.

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:14.116
They're there every day to help
with all the backstage stuff,

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:15.496
and they basically
run the whole show.

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:18.126
&gt;&gt;Student: Dear Martin Luther
King, I have a problem.

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:20.626
It's that all children
cannot have equal access

00:01:20.986 --> 00:01:22.316
to shelter and healthcare.

00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.276
&gt;&gt;Susan: Sometimes it's really
good, sometimes it's not,

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:26.976
and sometimes we have
major calamities

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:28.166
and sometimes it goes smoothly.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:31.766
&gt;&gt;Student: Today's date is
January 15th, 2000 and--

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:34.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The newscast is beamed
to every room in the building

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.116
over the school-wide data network.

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:40.036
&gt;&gt;Susan: The general setup of
technology here is that we have four

00:01:40.036 --> 00:01:44.206
to five computers in every classroom,
and then we have three wireless labs

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:47.826
of iBook computers, so
everybody has a network account,

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.756
and a kid can walk just
about anywhere in the school,

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:54.166
log into the computer,
and get what they need.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:55.976
All their documents
are available to them

00:01:55.976 --> 00:01:57.256
from almost any computer
in the school.

00:01:57.486 --> 00:02:00.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The laptop people,
Miss Dodge will come around

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:02.596
and let you know when it's
time for you to log in, okay?

00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:03.356
All right.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:06.376
&gt;&gt;Susan: And those wireless labs
come into play when a teacher needs

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:09.976
to introduce something new, or have
the whole class working on a project

00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:11.736
at the same time, maybe to move

00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:13.306
through a project a
little bit faster,

00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:16.176
or because that's the best
way to teach the concept.

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:18.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The main thing that
I want you to focus on today,

00:02:19.186 --> 00:02:22.026
is how to group your information
so when you start writing,

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:23.726
you'll be able to get
your paragraphs.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:25.936
&gt;&gt;Susan: The inspiration,
and kidspiration,

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:29.256
are both very powerful tools,
because they allow children

00:02:29.256 --> 00:02:33.866
to organize their thoughts and
their ideas before writing.

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:36.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: A lot of people are
moving into their spreadsheets now.

00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:40.276
Make sure you have the number of
shares of each stock filled out.

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:41.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Much of the
school's curriculum is delivered

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:45.046
through projects like this
stock picking competition.

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:49.556
&gt;&gt;Student: I get General Electric,
Walmart, Coca-Cola, Nike and Target.

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:51.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students
often work in pairs,

00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:54.276
with tech savvy students
tutoring their peers.

00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:57.136
&gt;&gt;Student: Did you get your
stuff today or yesterday?

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:58.016
&gt;&gt;Student: Yesterday.

00:02:58.016 --> 00:03:00.006
&gt;&gt;Susan: Kids who spend more
time on computers at home,

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:03.486
are much more comfortable doing
basic things here at school,

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:07.216
working the mouse, working the
keyboard, typing, scouting around,

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:08.436
being creative on the computer.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:13.236
And we want to give kids who
don't have the resources at home,

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:15.726
necessarily, we want to give
them more opportunities.

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:19.626
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The goals of the
Tech at Home programs are

00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:21.616
to extend the learning opportunities
and resources into students' homes--

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:23.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To help
bridge this digital divide,

00:03:23.346 --> 00:03:26.026
the school established
a Tech at Home program,

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:30.146
which provides free computers and
low internet access fees to families

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:32.356
of students on free
and reduced lunch.

00:03:32.406 --> 00:03:35.456
&gt;&gt;Julie: Our goal is that children
will be online every night,

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:38.656
they'll look up our website,
they'll-- when they see our website,

00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:42.376
they'll see a homepage that will
give you updates of what's going

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:45.456
on at Mary Scroggs in our classroom.

00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:48.216
They'll find a separate
homework link where they'll go

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:49.576
and see the homework for the week.

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:50.406
&gt;&gt;Student: Tuesday.

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:52.816
&gt;&gt;Dorothy: Tuesday, what
do you have to do today?

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:56.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: So far, the Tech at
Home program is getting high marks

00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:58.906
from teachers and parents
like Dorothy Setliff.

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:02.526
&gt;&gt;Dorothy: They're naturally inclined
to start using computers early,

00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:04.546
they play games on it, and
it's so that it becomes,

00:04:04.546 --> 00:04:06.026
homework becomes like
part of the game.

00:04:06.026 --> 00:04:08.586
Having him start now, means that
it will be so much easier later on.

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:09.966
&gt;&gt;How do you spell
music, do you remember?

00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:12.696
&gt;&gt;Student: U, U, U..

00:04:12.696 --> 00:04:14.496
&gt;&gt;Dorothy: That's right, then what?

00:04:14.496 --> 00:04:16.536
&gt;&gt;Julie: A majority of the homework
that we're moving more toward is,

00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:20.186
they respond through the e-mail to
me, because it's a really great way

00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:23.756
to keep track of their homework,
I can reply very easily.

00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:26.366
Less paperwork, I don't
have a stack of papers to go

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:28.886
through that sometimes
don't make it back home.

00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:31.706
It's just much easier to
give them immediate feedback

00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:32.486
through the e-mail.

00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:36.776
&gt;&gt;Student: Send it
to me on the e-mail.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:40.326
&gt;&gt;Dorothy: And having a nice way of
getting in contact with the teacher,

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:43.686
just send an e-mail, and you get
an e-mail back, rather than trying

00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:45.206
to catch a teacher on the telephone.

00:04:45.946 --> 00:04:47.796
Now old technology,
this is much better.

00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:50.306
&gt;&gt;Kathleen: That's the
sound a crow makes,

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:51.576
let's see if we hear that sound?

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:53.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition
to new technology,

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:56.686
Mary Scroggs new building
design facilitates a variety

00:04:56.686 --> 00:04:58.076
of learning experiences.

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:00.706
&gt;&gt;Kathleen: Put your
binoculars on, I see something

00:05:00.706 --> 00:05:01.676
on that tree right there.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:02.446
Can you look right straight--

00:05:02.446 --> 00:05:04.716
&gt;&gt;I think that the building
itself is just wonderful.

00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:07.056
It's beautiful and
I love the porches.

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:11.386
The area for science, for what
we're doing with the birds,

00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:14.496
as far as having bird feeders out
there, and the children being able

00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:15.796
to go out and watch the birds.

00:05:16.256 --> 00:05:18.616
&gt;&gt;Kathleen: You see a blue jay?

00:05:18.806 --> 00:05:19.156
&gt;&gt;Student: Me, too.

00:05:19.156 --> 00:05:21.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Inside, every
classroom features wall coverings

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:24.506
that allow children's work
to be displayed everywhere.

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:27.276
There are several rooms
where teachers can gather

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:29.906
and small nooks for
one-on-one sessions.

00:05:30.386 --> 00:05:32.096
In fact, the building
has been an asset

00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:35.196
in recruiting prospective
teachers, especially when they learn

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:37.396
that they will have their
own office and phone.

00:05:37.846 --> 00:05:39.336
&gt;&gt;Paula: I think typically,
over the years,

00:05:39.476 --> 00:05:41.916
teachers have gotten
by on a shoestring.

00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:43.506
They're told they're professionals,

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:45.756
but sometimes not always
treated as professionals.

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:49.626
For teachers, it's a
big deal to have a phone

00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:52.476
that they can use throughout the day,
either to communicate with parents,

00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:54.756
or to be available to
their own families.

00:05:55.516 --> 00:05:57.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The physical
plant is just part

00:05:57.286 --> 00:05:58.606
of the appeal of working here.

00:05:59.006 --> 00:06:02.976
For kindergarten teacher, Kathleen
Eveleigh, the best of Mary Scroggs,

00:06:03.276 --> 00:06:06.916
the technology, the literacy focus,
and the parent involvement parts,

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:10.746
come together every day when her kids
write the end of the day summary.

00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:13.156
&gt;&gt;Kathleen: Who has something to
tell me about what we've done today?

00:06:13.646 --> 00:06:13.976
Jeffrey?

00:06:13.976 --> 00:06:15.816
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: Are we going
to have enough room

00:06:15.816 --> 00:06:18.176
for the whole webpage
just on that one line?

00:06:18.176 --> 00:06:19.286
&gt;&gt;Kathleen: We will,
you'll be surprised.

00:06:19.286 --> 00:06:20.416
It just goes right down.

00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:24.276
&gt;&gt;When we started discussing ways
to make the webpage more powerful,

00:06:24.896 --> 00:06:27.856
the suggestion came up of
putting a daily synopsis

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:31.066
of what we had done during the
day, and it was very easy to sit

00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:33.436
down with the children,
just put the keyboard

00:06:33.806 --> 00:06:36.036
in my lap, and just go to it.

00:06:36.036 --> 00:06:39.076
&gt;&gt;Student: Some people
want to reading books.

00:06:39.126 --> 00:06:39.936
&gt;&gt;Kathleen: Some people--

00:06:40.756 --> 00:06:43.406
&gt;&gt;And it tied in with
what we do in literacy,

00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:47.376
which is to have children say things
and you write them out for them,

00:06:47.376 --> 00:06:50.096
and then they're able to
read what they have said.

00:06:50.686 --> 00:06:54.756
And so it tied into the balanced
literacy that we do in our school.

00:06:54.926 --> 00:06:57.476
&gt;&gt;Our mystery was four o'clock.

00:06:57.736 --> 00:06:58.406
Very good.

00:06:58.706 --> 00:07:01.216
&gt;&gt;All of a sudden, I was
getting e-mails from parents,

00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:05.166
letters from parents, I love the
website, it's helping me so much,

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:08.816
I can get things from the web page,
and then ask my child about it,

00:07:08.816 --> 00:07:10.416
and we have so much to talk about,

00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:13.556
so that kind of input
just got me more excited,

00:07:13.556 --> 00:07:15.136
and then I just started
doing it more and more,

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:16.426
and making sure I was
doing it every day.

00:07:16.946 --> 00:07:19.066
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: We had a
fantastic super day.

00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:25.236
&gt;&gt;Kathleen: We had a
fantastic super day.

00:07:25.906 --> 00:07:27.646
Wow, that sounds so great.

00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:29.526
You guys did a good job.

00:07:30.076 --> 00:07:33.576
See you-- do you want me
to put, see you tomorrow?

00:07:33.576 --> 00:07:34.976
See you tomorrow.

00:07:35.796 --> 00:07:39.106
