1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,750
Well,

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,300
it should be a comfort that there's
people smarter than the people that don't

3
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:04,140
think that we're doing it.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,360
That there are people that can possibly
consider some sort of way to mitigate

5
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,220
this. Yeah. And what, what are the,

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,940
what are the ways that are being proposed
and how seriously are they being taken

7
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:17,880
other than this, um, the idea
of building these machines,

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,390
extract carbon from the atmosphere.
I'm sure you're probably aware of. Um,

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,430
there's some of the programs that they've
talked about a suspending reflective

10
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,990
particles in the atmosphere to,

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,320
to minimize the amount of
solar radiation we receive.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,290
Yeah.
So it's interesting,

13
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:36,340
this guy who I mentioned earlier who like
done the most sort of most innovative

14
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:41,290
carbon capture machine. I talked to him a
few weeks ago and he was like, no, no, no,

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,740
but we shouldn't be using carbon capture.

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,060
We should be doing solar geoengineering,
which is what you're talking about. Um,

17
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,440
and that means probably suspending sulfur
is like the most useful thing in the

18
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:55,030
atmosphere. I'm great. We're
going to smell like sulfur.
The Sky would get red. Oh,

19
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:57,850
Jesus. They're all of these aesthetic
effects too, which nobody talks about.

20
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:00,940
So like trees are going to just turn
immediately brown or not going to turn

21
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:01,774
color.

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,820
There was a study a couple of weeks
ago that the oceans are going to change

23
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:06,960
color. Um, there, this is, if we
do that, if we suspend this for,

24
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,680
this is just pure warming
just from warming.

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,190
The ocean is going to change color to
what I think just from more green to more

26
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:16,090
blue. But uh, I mean
Nice. Yeah. Um, but yeah,

27
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:20,970
so the sulfur thing is, um, so we could,
you know, we could suspend these, um,

28
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,610
basically an umbrella of sulfur
around, um, in the atmosphere,

29
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,080
which would mean that it would,

30
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:28,810
some of the sunlight coming to the
earth would be reflected back into the

31
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:32,380
atmosphere and that would mean that
the sun would absorb less sunlight.

32
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,720
I mean the earth would
absorb less on sunlight,

33
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,110
which would make it a little bit cooler.
Um,

34
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,150
the problem is that would have some
crippling impacts on agriculture and we

35
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:45,370
basically don't know other
side effects that would have.

36
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,570
And how would you take that stuff out?
Well, you could just stop doing it.

37
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:51,820
It has a shelf life of, I don't
know what it is, 10 years,

38
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,040
so you could just stop doing it.
And that's a big concern actually,

39
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:58,540
because if we did that just to mask the
amount of global warming that we were

40
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:02,500
doing,
then whatever program was responsible for,

41
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:06,070
it would be really vulnerable
to terrorism, um, to war.

42
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,560
Because if we,
if we were,

43
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,640
if the planet were functionally warmed,
say five degrees,

44
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:15,910
but we were suspending enough sulfur
that it was actually only two degrees

45
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:18,400
warmer than if we just,
for instance,

46
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:20,890
like somebody bombed the
facility that was doing it,

47
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,440
the planet would be immediately
tripped into a much,

48
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:27,370
much hotter state and that would
be completely catastrophic.

49
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:31,060
Even more catastrophic than a more slow
approach to five degrees because we

50
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:33,880
would adjust to it. We, over a
century or several centuries,

51
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:37,510
we met in ways we'd be able to adjust to
it. But if it was immediate, immediate,

52
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,490
yeah.
Why Sulfur?

53
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,880
I think it's just something about
that particular characteristic of it.

54
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,830
I don't know.
Wouldn't it

55
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,190
smell? Hartman would literally be
like hell. Like, that's what you yeah.

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,670
You always hear about with
the horror movies, right?
The devil smells like sulfur.

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

58
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,800
And I mean it's the, um, it's what farts
smell like. And the reason that we would,

59
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,560
the reason we're able to smell
farts is because sulfur is also,

60
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,820
I mean some related compounds,
hydrogen sulfide are um,

61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,860
are really toxic. And so that brings me
to methane. That's another issue as well,

62
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:13,740
right? Yeah. Cows producing methane
gas, large scale agricultural. Yeah.

63
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,080
Wait, let me just say one more thing
about shortly. The solar geoengineering.

64
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,410
So the thing about that, that's real,
this sounds horrifying. This program,

65
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,180
people are excited about it
because it's really cheap.

66
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:26,410
It's way cheaper than carbon capture and
um, but so there's a positive for it.

67
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,220
But it's also,
um,

68
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,810
we are basically already doing this.

69
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,110
So we have what's called small
particulate pollution. Um,

70
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,100
that's or aerosol pollution. I'm stuffed,
suspended the, in the atmosphere.

71
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,920
That's why like Delhi is really hard
to breathe in cause we have a lot of

72
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,020
particulate in the atmosphere that is
already suppressing global temperatures by

73
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,470
as much as a half degree or
maybe one degree, which means,

74
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,110
and that's the reason that those 9 million
people are dying every year from air

75
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:56,410
pollution. So if we solve that problem,
if we solve the air pollution problem,

76
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,380
save those 9 million lives,
we,

77
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,110
every year we would immediately make the
planet at least a half a degree warmer

78
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,340
and possibly one degree warmer,

79
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:07,660
which would put us at the threshold
of catastrophe or above it. Um,

80
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,750
so we're sort of already doing this
program, just not in a systematic way.

81
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,130
We're doing it in a haphazard way.
Um, the methane you mentioned,

82
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:18,910
they're basically two big issues
with methane. First is, um, cows.

83
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,330
Um, so yeah, cows
produce a ton of methane,

84
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:27,331
which is depending on how you count
about 35 or maybe 85 times stronger,

85
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:31,720
a greenhouse gas than carbon. Whoa.
Yeah, it's really intense. Um,

86
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,860
but there are also these like small
scale studies that show if we feed cattle

87
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:40,360
just a little bit of seaweed there,
methane emissions could fall by 95 or 99%.

88
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,620
So we could if, if that was scalable,
which is not clear it is, but if it was,

89
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,860
we could immediately eliminate the
entire carbon footprint of beef,

90
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,980
which people talk about a lot now.
That's incredible. Yeah, just,

91
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,500
it's a reminder to me that
like, you know, you get told,

92
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,180
oh you should eat less
hamburgers or whatever.

93
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,090
But obviously this is like a problem
that's too big to be solved with like

94
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:58,930
individual choices.

95
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,020
We need some kind of global policy
or national policy about it.

96
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,870
But the scarier methane issue is,
um,

97
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,760
there's all this carbon stored in frozen
permafrost in the northern latitudes.

98
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,140
Um, that permafrost is
melting and when it melts,

99
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,940
that carbon will be released
into the atmosphere.

100
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,680
We don't know the proportion that it
will be released as carbon dioxide versus

101
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,500
methane,
but um,

102
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,100
there is in that permafrost twice as much
carbon as now exists in the atmosphere,

103
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,300
which means if it were all released
possibly in a relatively sudden way,

104
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,780
it could make our carbon problem
immediately, three times worse. Um,

105
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,340
and it could be even the effect could
even be more dramatic than that if it was

106
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:42,370
released mostly as methane because
methane is stronger greenhouse gas.

107
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,490
Most scientists think that that's not
something that we need to freak out about

108
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:47,860
in the short term,
but it's there,

109
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,920
it is melting and methane is
being released at some rate.

110
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:55,921
So craziest solution than I ever heard
for that one was to bring back the woolly

111
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,600
mammoth. Yeah, yeah. They're
trying to do that. Yeah.

112
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,590
And did the idea that the woolly mammoth
is going to save us all by releasing

113
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:07,460
them throughout Siberia. Yeah.
That's crazy, right? I mean,

114
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:11,510
I think that we're going to have a whole
a century of shit like that and shit,

115
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,810
like cows eating seaweed,
that everything, you know,

116
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,840
we'll have our global politics will be
reoriented around climate change so that

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,280
you'll start to see sanctions put against
nations that are behaving badly. Um,

118
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,790
NBS, the guy who's, you know,

119
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,850
the like kind of thug who's
running Saudi Arabian assets,

120
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,750
he needed Saudi Arabia's economy
to be totally off oil by 2050.

121
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,090
And I think that's cause he knows that,
you know,

122
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:39,980
the global community will not tolerate
someone producing more oil and, um,

123
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,150
as recently as you know, as soon as a few
decades from now. But the impacts are,

124
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,190
you know, everywhere. So that like, um,
yeah, like in California now you can,

125
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,420
you know, during wildfire season
you can buy, um, masks to, you know,

126
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,390
to shield yourself from the smoke,
which is really, really damaging.

127
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:59,450
Its Effects on cognitive
performance are really dramatic.

128
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,330
Can lower cognitive
performance by like 10 or 15%.

129
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,530
It's effect on the development
of kids is really dramatic. Um,

130
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,910
there was an incredible study a few
years ago where if you looked at places

131
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:14,030
where they instituted easy, do you have
easy pass out here in California? No,

132
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:17,840
we don't. We don't have tolls.
Oh, right. So amazing. Yeah.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,630
You guys think what one or two places,
depending on where you live, do,

134
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:26,440
you'd have to take that every day. Dude,
in New York, they're everywhere. Okay.

135
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,870
All right.
Yeah.

136
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,440
So it used to be the case that cars had
to like slow down and pay a toll and

137
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,340
because they were slowing down,

138
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:35,210
they produce more exhaust when they
instituted easy pass cars could just drive

139
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:39,380
through and that meant they produce
less exhaust and the effect on the,

140
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,890
on premature birth and low birth weight
in the areas where they instituted these

141
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:46,100
new easy pass toll plazas,
it reduced them by like 15% each.

142
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,140
That's how dramatic just the exhaust
effect is on development of babies. Um,

143
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,310
how much is an effect of
electric cars? Yeah. That, I
mean, that, that will be right.

144
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:59,420
You know, it hasn't had enough of an
effect because there's not enough of them.

145
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Yeah. Um, and, but yeah,

146
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,050
I mean that problem on the,

147
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,880
unlike at the technological
level has been solved.

148
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,920
We know how to replace
cars with electric cars.

149
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,810
We can make them even pretty affordable,

150
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:15,650
not quite as affordable as they need to
be, but the new Teslas are like 35 grand.

151
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:19,500
I think if you get it down to
15 grands, that'll be, you know,

152
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,540
that'll be a huge solution.

153
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,460
But then there are a lot of other
problems that are more difficult.

154
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,770
Like air travel,
you can't,

155
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,090
we don't have electric plans around
the corner. You can't fly planes.

156
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,940
Is there anything like
that on the horizon? Is it,
there's some people who are,

157
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,110
who are trying to develop it,

158
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:36,680
but it seems like probably it's at
least like a decade away. And you know,

159
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,980
one cross country flight in the u s is
the equivalent one seat on one Costco

160
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,660
cross country flight is the
equivalent of eight months of driving.

161
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,510
Every time you fly from New
York to London and back,

162
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,900
you melt nine three square meters of ice.

163
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,740
Every single seat on every flight from
New York to London melts three square

164
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:59,400
meters of ice, um, of articles. Yeah.

165
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,320
That's insane.

166
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,270
That's right.

167
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,930
Real. Yeah. Yeah.

168
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,260
I think it's time you fly
across the country. It's
like eight months of driving.

169
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,870
Yeah. Whoa. So globally,

170
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,410
air travel is only 2% of the carbon
footprint. So it's relatively small,

171
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,890
but for people in especially
rich people in rich countries,

172
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:23,270
it's a much bigger part of the folks.
They fly around all. Yeah. But yeah, no,

173
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,330
the average American,

174
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,070
I think the stat is the average American
every year admits enough carbon to melt

175
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,650
10,000 tons of ice.

176
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,640
Jesus Christ.
That's just the average American.

177
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,960
And if you're a person like me who
flies like every other weekend,

178
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,950
it's way worse. Way Worse. Yeah. Oh.

179
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,080
So Holy Shit,
you put it in that perspective.

180
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:55,160
It's how much fucking eyes is there?
I mean, there's a lot of ice. Yeah.

181
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,460
But it's gonna melt. Well,
that's how you get, you know,

182
00:09:58,461 --> 00:09:59,930
the out the outside projections,

183
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:04,490
the high end projections for sea
level rise are 260 feet. No. Um,

184
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,530
the plus sign is it's way better to
get hotter than it is to get colder.

185
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,090
Right? Like ice ages kill everything.
Well, the, you know, the, each of the,

186
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,090
so there've been five mass extinctions
and planetary history in Earth's history

187
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:20,030
before one of them was killed,
was caused by an asteroid,

188
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,190
but the other four were um,

189
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,330
were produced by global warming
related to greenhouse gas. Um,

190
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,810
and one of them the ice age when the
ice age doesn't count, it didn't,

191
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,030
didn't kill as many know really the,
the biggest mass extinction,

192
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:38,390
the end Permian extinction, which
is 250, 2 million years ago,

193
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,620
90 to 95% of all life on earth died.

194
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,490
When was that? 250. 2
million years ago. God.

195
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,170
So each of these mass
extinctions basically is like
a complete slate wiping of

196
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:53,720
the evolutionary record. It's like
we're starting over from scratch.

197
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,100
So we want to think that the,

198
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:58,940
the asteroid that hit the Yucatan did
the most damage in terms of the fossil

199
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:01,560
record. Is that not true?
Is the one that was the,

200
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,770
the global warming was that more?
Well this other,

201
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,500
there are five and four of them were
from global warming and the worst,

202
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,110
the worst one was just from, from
greenhouse gas warming. But yeah, the,

203
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:12,620
the one that killed the
dinosaurs was also really bad.

204
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:14,210
It was something like
70% of all life on it,

205
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:18,260
but it's less than the one where there
was a temperature rise. Yeah. Wow.

206
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,350
There was a, um, a volcano, this
is a little bit sketchy science,

207
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:23,960
but there was a volcano explosion,
um,

208
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,610
something like 30,000 years
ago or something. I don't
remember the exact dates,

209
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:31,820
but that um, volcanoes can cool, uh,

210
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,980
global temperature for the same reason
we're talking about with suspending

211
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:36,440
particles because it basically
clouds the atmosphere with, um,

212
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,240
and it dropped global temperatures.

213
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:43,190
I think it was two degrees and the human
population at the time then shrunk to

214
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:44,270
7,000.

215
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,540
There's this incredible bottle that a
bunch of times that's the less people than

216
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,690
live on Nantucket.
And it just,

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,880
it just makes you see like everything
about the way that we live on this planet

218
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,610
is dependent on climate
conditions. Yeah. Like,

219
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,810
we'll figure a way to like have a
civilization, but it will be transformed.

220
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:04,840
It will be very different if the
world is four degrees warmer. Um,

221
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,850
and you know,

222
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,660
everything about the way that we take
for everything we take for granted today

223
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,600
is like a permanent feature
of the modern world.

224
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,640
I think we're going to learn is much
more precarious, much more unstable.

225
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,390
Um, and yeah, like I
said earlier, you know,

226
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,680
climates were stable for
all of human history. That's
how we were able to evolve.

227
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:28,450
It's how we were able
to invent agriculture.

228
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,420
The part of the world where we did
invent agriculture in the Middle East,

229
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,670
it's now getting almost
too hot to grow crops.

230
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,420
It's also going to be too hot to go to
Mecca for a pilgrimage in just a couple

231
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:42,190
of decades, whether like we're
entirely outside of that, um,

232
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,570
window of temperatures,

233
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,200
which means we're functionally now living
on an entirely different planet than

234
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:50,020
humans ever lived on before.
And it's going to keep changing.

235
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,660
So by the time we get to two
or three or four degrees,

236
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,870
will be a living in a climate that's,
you know,

237
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,220
two or three or four times as
much different as the one that,

238
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:05,140
where as now from the one before
the industrial revolution. And yeah,

239
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,070
it's like those impacts could be
totally overwhelming and catastrophic.
