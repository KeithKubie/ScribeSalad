00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.036
( intro music )

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.469
( applause )

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.574 line:0%
Cory: My story is actually
today-- It's very, very simple.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:42.775 line:0%
It's not science.

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:45.278 line:0%
It's very, very
simple, and it starts

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.513
with climbing trees.

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:50.416
This is a photo of me
when I'm, like, two.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.151
My parents are like,
"Yeah, just go get dirty.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.186
Go play."

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.687
People are like, "Hey,
your son's up a tree.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.256
"It's 40 feet. That
limb looks pretty ... "

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:58.258
They're like, "He's fine."

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.692
Then it's like,
ch, ch, ch, boom.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.894
Then it's like, "Ah, (beep)!"

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.931
( laughter )

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:08.635
Here we are in the
emergency room again.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.037
But early on, what
I realized was that

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:13.839
pushing boundaries
has consequences. Right?

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:15.174
Like, that's part of it.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.108
But we have to push boundaries

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.710
to understand our limitations.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.480
We have to learn
how far we can go.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.015
You know, that was
ingrained in me very early on,

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.083
that pushing boundaries

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.918
was something that was important

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:29.354
to not just where I
would be, where I was,

00:01:29.354 --> 00:01:31.891
but how far I could take myself.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.694
Early on, I did everything
in the mountains.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:36.963
That was my life.

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.297
That was my family.

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:39.265
But pushing boundaries

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.301
became something
a little bit more.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.236
It became about pushing
social boundaries for me.

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:47.573
That ended up becoming
quite a problem.

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.876
I was a smart kid.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:52.711
I was 12 years old when
I went to high school,

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.780
and I was a straight A student.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.983
That had its own challenges.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.786
That was pushing
boundaries in its own way.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.354
However, what ended
up happening was,

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.322
rather than going out
and climbing or skiing,

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:06.759
or venting my frustrations
as a young kid in high school,

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.128
I basically glommed
on to the older kids,

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.663
and I started doing
all the wrong things,

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:11.830
hanging out with people

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.799
that were more socially
advanced than I was.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.001
I was pushing those boundaries.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.503
I learned very, very
early on that rules,

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:19.472
all of the rules that we follow,

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.706
are arbitrary.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:22.541
There's only one that
actually sticks,

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.943
and that's that we all die.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.612
Other than that,
it's all arbitrary.

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:28.247
When you learn that
when you're 14,

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:29.749
and your parents are
like, "You're grounded

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.016
if you don't come
home at 11:00."

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:33.152
You're like, "Phh. Whatever."

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:36.855
( laughter )

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.991
Maybe that's not
the right boundary to push,

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:41.160
but I was pushing those.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.862
And because of that,
I ended up

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:45.898
being a high school
dropout at 14.

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.100
I had gone from being
a straight A student,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.335
to being a high school dropout,

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.537
completely on the streets.

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:53.406
I was in rehab three...

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:56.175
Well, I ran away from rehab
three times.

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:58.311
Another boundary
pushing exercise.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:03.216
The last time I remember
the director of the rehab

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.450
looked at me and he said,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.953
"If you leave, you will
end up in the gutter.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.288
You will never
amount to anything,

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:11.457
and you will likely die."

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.826
He's actually--

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:16.094
I don't begrudge him
for saying those things.

00:03:16.094 --> 00:03:17.697
That's actually fairly correct.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.032
A lot of people that do
end up in that situation

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.900
do just fall into the cracks.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.002
But it was because of that time

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.804
when I was homeless,
for the most part,

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.673
that I started to learn about

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:31.110
the larger human
struggle, that story.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.378
I wanted to tell it.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:34.646
I wanted to tell people
what I was experiencing,

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:37.383
how I was going through that.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.718
So I used climbing.

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:42.522
I used photography and climbing,

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:44.123
to try to tell that story.

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.557
That was my early attempt.

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:47.059
It was beautiful
because it's allegorical

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.295
for the struggles we have.

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.830
Like this photo,
it looks fantastic.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.667
But the real risks
there are minimal.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:55.868
They're tiny.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:56.869
That's a rope.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.137
If he falls, he's safe.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.940
But it's a wonderful
story to tell.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.575
But really early on
climbing for me

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:06.679
was about proving to everybody

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.248
that I was not a (bleep) up.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:10.883
I was just trying to
prove to the world

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.285
that I was not that kid that was

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:14.687
going to fall
through the cracks.

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:17.256
I was going to use
the energy that I had

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.358
to propel myself
and tell this story,

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:20.960
this larger narrative.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.461
But as I got into that,

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:25.097
I started looking at
people and characters,

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:26.732
the people I was climbing with.

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:29.469
How pushing boundaries
is a transformative

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:30.903
psychological issue.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:33.005
How we change ourselves
when we do that.

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:36.876
How we continue to learn
through our exercise.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:39.078
Not just climbing
mountains, but also

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:42.014
how our world is
affected by that.

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:43.983
As I traveled more
and more and more,

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:45.784
and climbed more
and more and more,

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:47.854
I started to observe that world.

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:50.256
All of a sudden,
something that was

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:53.592
very, very much about me,
a selfish pursuit, climbing,

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:56.396
became about telling
the larger story of the planet.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.965
Because I could not move
through these environments

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.666
and not care.

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:02.668
That just couldn't happen.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:04.904
The mountains have always been

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:07.239
a vehicle to voice myself.

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.840
So I'd continue to go back,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.476
and I continued to push myself,

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:11.844
and I continued to try.

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:13.946
But that's sort of
taken a little bit

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.148
of a back seat.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.683
In 2010, in Pakistan,
we went to climb the first

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:19.752
winter ascent of an
8,000 meter peak,

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.119
Gasherbrum II.

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:22.655
But what's interesting is that,

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.089
as important as that
climb was for me,

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.659
it was more important
for my photography.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.926
Because as you'll see here

00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:29.695
in the upper left hand corner
of this,

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.264
is the border of
Pakistan and India.

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:33.098
So while I was there,
I was actually talking

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:35.535
with Sadie Quarrier, who is
one of the photo editors here,

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:36.835
and talking about--

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:39.504
She wanted me to exercise
my storytelling capacity.

00:05:39.504 --> 00:05:41.840
Climbing was that, I had that,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.043
and my skills
had brought me there.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:46.245
But what I started
to actually focus on

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.680
was this conflict zone.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.514
It's the highest
battleground in the world.

00:05:49.514 --> 00:05:50.916
This is the Pakistani military

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:53.452
living on the border
of Pakistan and India.

00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:56.655
I became engaged in
using my photography

00:05:56.655 --> 00:05:58.057
to tell this larger narrative.

00:05:58.057 --> 00:06:00.860
What does it feel like
to be a Pakistani soldier

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.962
fighting on the highest
battleground in the world.

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.563
What does that look
like texturally?

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:06.132
How do we bring
that back to people?

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:08.534
How do we translate
that experience

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.735
for people through imagery?

00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:12.338
That was what I
dedicated myself to.

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:14.573
I still keep a very
small collection

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:16.475
on my website that
I'm very proud of it.

00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:17.876
I'm very proud of
it because I noticed

00:06:17.876 --> 00:06:19.578
that I was pushing
my own boundaries

00:06:19.578 --> 00:06:20.579
as a storyteller,

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:23.549
which to me is invaluable.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:24.850
How do you tell the story

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.886
of a broken conflict,
of a broken war?

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.387
How do we use media

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.489
to translate that experience
for people?

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:32.324
How do we use art to do that?

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:34.760
The first assignment
I did for the magazine

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.729
was another step
in that direction,

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.397
where we started
bringing together three--

00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:39.432
I call it the golden trifecta:

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:42.935
adventure, culture,
and science.

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:45.504
We were using climbing,
I had that skill set,

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:48.074
to go into this
ancient cave complex

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.608
in the Kingdom of Mustang.

00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:51.744
Mustang is a kingdom
that's on the border

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.212
of Nepal and Tibet.

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:55.214
We were trying to
reexamine perhaps

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.683
a forgotten path
on the Silk Road.

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:58.684
We were using climbing

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.286
to access these ancient
cave complexes.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:02.355
We were looking
for human remains,

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.456
and we found plenty.

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:04.657
We were looking
for burial crypts,

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:06.359
because we needed
the strontium.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:09.028
The strontium is in
your tooth enamel.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:10.195
It's an element.

00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:11.263
It can tell you where
somebody's born,

00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:13.599
based on what's in their
mother's breast milk,

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:14.834
the water we drink.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:17.470
Now if where they were
born and where they died

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.303
is different,

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.806
you can start to paint
a picture of human migration.

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:22.775
So all of a sudden,
I was using photography

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:23.942
in a different way.

00:07:23.942 --> 00:07:25.244
It was not about adventure.

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:26.778
It wasn't about
necessarily being

00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:28.114
in the highest
mountains in the world.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.183
But it was about communicating
science to people

00:07:31.183 --> 00:07:33.385
in a tangible way,
in a way that engaged them

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:35.788
and gripped them.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:36.922
But it's never
been enough for me

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:38.190
to just stay in one spot.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.924
I'm not good at it.

00:07:38.924 --> 00:07:39.725
Ask my wife.

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:40.659
Ask my parents.

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:41.993
They're like, "You're a mess."

00:07:41.993 --> 00:07:43.429
I'm like, "I got to
get on another plane."

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.064
They're like, "You
got back 4 hours ago.

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:46.265
"Just relax, dude."

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.433
( laughter )

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:50.769
I put myself on assignment
down in Indonesia.

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:51.837
I went down there.

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:53.005
I wanted to expand.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:55.107
I wanted to push
my boundaries again

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.208
as a photographer.

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.243
I wanted to be underwater.

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.844
I felt like, "Okay, I've
been up on the mountains.

00:07:58.844 --> 00:08:01.113
How do I expand myself more?"

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:06.885
So I went down, and I wanted
to use imagery and media

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:08.821
to talk about things
in a cultural context.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:11.290
The Bajau, they
were sea gypsies.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.225
They always used
subsistence fishing.

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:15.928
They lived on the ocean,
and from the ocean.

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:18.030
And as the Indonesian government
has started to mandate

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.032
that they stay in one spot,

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.567
that has changed everything.

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:22.968
How do you tell that story?

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:23.969
That's a very important story.

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:24.703
Why?

00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:27.073
Because as people stop moving,

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.775
they start to impact
the area they're in heavily.

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:32.277
Now that they're
in stilt villages,

00:08:32.277 --> 00:08:34.212
they start to
overfish their reefs.

00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:36.682
They start to overuse
their resources.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:37.649
How do they do that?

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:39.018
They use net fishing.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:42.121
But more importantly,
they use bomb fishing.

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.323
What happens to a reef

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:46.025
when you throw a bomb
in the water?

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:49.194
Sure, you get a lot of
fish out, and that's great.

00:08:49.194 --> 00:08:50.763
But it's not great,
because it destroys

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:54.266
the whole marine ecosystem
in one fell swoop.

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:57.536
It's dead. It's gone. It's done.

00:08:57.536 --> 00:09:00.506
I started to look at
storytelling and imagery

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:02.641
as a way to look at some
of the harder issues,

00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.043
the issues that our
planet is facing.

00:09:05.043 --> 00:09:06.278
How do we do that?

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:07.979
It's not just about science.

00:09:07.979 --> 00:09:09.381
It's not just about adventure.

00:09:09.381 --> 00:09:10.783
It's not just about culture.

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:12.651
It's about
how we as a human family

00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:14.286
are impacting everything,

00:09:14.286 --> 00:09:16.689
and only through pushing my own
boundaries as a storyteller

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:19.091
and having that
insatiable curiosity

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:21.093
could I continue to do that.

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:22.928
What does it look
like when we mandate

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:25.530
a way of life is
different from something

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.499
that everybody has always known?

00:09:27.499 --> 00:09:28.800
It changes everything.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.001
It changes everything instantly.

00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:32.071
How do you put that in pictures?

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:36.075
How do you put it online
so that other people care,

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:39.945
so that they want to be
engaged with this culture?

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:42.247
My most recent assignment
for the magazine

00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:43.715
was going to Franz Josef Land.

00:09:43.715 --> 00:09:46.285
But that's again where I'm
trying to push boundaries.

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.821
I don't know how to tell
a natural history story.

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:51.357
I don't know but I'm going
to go and I'm going to try.

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:52.958
I'm going to try
to tell the story

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.427
of a changing
landscape, a landscape

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:58.063
that is changing because
of our human impacts.

00:09:58.063 --> 00:09:59.064
Right?

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:02.301
What happens when we don't
take care of our planet,

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:05.137
when we are not stewards
of it in the right way?

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:08.307
Now, granted, this is a very,
very impactful photograph.

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:11.443
This is one tiny, tiny
piece of Franz Josef Land.

00:10:11.443 --> 00:10:12.644
It's tiny.

00:10:12.644 --> 00:10:15.348
But it's very, very
visual and graphic.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.749
It tells you that
story instantly,

00:10:17.749 --> 00:10:19.685
that we are a damaging species.

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:23.322
We are an invasive
species everywhere we go.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.428
But I want to try and
expand myself always

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:32.131
and push boundaries of
adventure and storytelling

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:35.066
to give people a view that
they might not expect.

00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:37.102
Is this the Arctic we think of?

00:10:37.102 --> 00:10:38.237
No.

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:39.404
Big sandy plane?

00:10:39.404 --> 00:10:40.372
Not at all.

00:10:40.372 --> 00:10:41.773
How are we having that impact?

00:10:41.773 --> 00:10:43.208
What is going on there?

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:45.044
What's our interface?

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:49.714
How do I get people excited
about bird populations,

00:10:49.714 --> 00:10:51.350
the barometer of an ecosystem?

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.551
How do you do that?

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:54.786
How do you make
pictures that do that?

00:10:54.786 --> 00:10:58.090
That's what-- I've changed
my whole way of thinking.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.826
When once I was
completely devoted

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:04.129
to one thing, climbing,
to prove to everybody

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:05.163
that I was good enough,

00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:06.898
I've now changed that and said,

00:11:06.898 --> 00:11:09.367
"How do I prove to
everybody that we

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:12.104
are good enough
to change our problems?"

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.672
It's very, very simple.

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:15.841
Art is very simple.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.810
The other day I was driving.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.312
I'm in Yellowstone, and
I'm on assignment out there

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:23.516
trying to tell
a coexistence story.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:28.386
Honestly, it's the hardest
thing I've ever done.

00:11:28.386 --> 00:11:29.788
I moved up there.

00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:32.557
I was a vegan
and I didn't drink.

00:11:32.557 --> 00:11:35.460
I'm a carnivorous, functioning
alcoholic at this point.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.563
( laughter )

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:40.365
I'm trying to figure out,

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:42.234
how do I bring all
of this together?

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:44.502
How do I tell this
story to this audience?

00:11:44.502 --> 00:11:46.305
Because you guys are
all way smarter than me.

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:47.673
That's it.

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:49.641
Then I saw a bumper sticker.

00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:51.777
That's where my
inspiration comes from.

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:53.278
Bumper stickers.

00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:55.614
It was a very, very
simple bumper sticker.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.316
It just said this.

00:11:57.316 --> 00:11:58.417
It said a little
bit more than this,

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:00.052
but just this.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.788
Art is not
a painting on the wall.

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:05.624
Art is not just
a piece of music.

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:07.293
It's all of that together.

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:09.561
Art is about
communicating ideas.

00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:13.231
We have to readjust
how we think about art.

00:12:13.231 --> 00:12:14.733
Art is everything.

00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:16.368
Art is science.

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:19.003
Art is engaging our
kids in science.

00:12:19.003 --> 00:12:20.772
There is an art to education.

00:12:20.772 --> 00:12:22.708
Art is communicating ideas.

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:25.544
That's what the first
cave painting was about.

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:27.846
It was,
"I want to tell you this."

00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:29.981
There is so much
information in this room,

00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:32.884
and there is so much that we
have to share with each other,

00:12:32.884 --> 00:12:35.387
in order to solve our problems

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:37.422
that we're facing as a planet.

00:12:37.422 --> 00:12:39.358
When you think of this word,

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:41.760
you have to think of what
is at the heart of it,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.428
right in the center of it.

00:12:43.428 --> 00:12:45.564
That, in and of itself, alone,

00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:47.766
with everybody in this room,

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:51.070
can change the
course of our future.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.437
That's it.

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:53.438
That's my message.

00:12:53.438 --> 00:12:54.640
It's very simple.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.043
Taking the complex,
boiling it down,

00:12:58.043 --> 00:13:01.880
to something that is beautiful,
simple, and complete

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.248
in itself.

00:13:03.248 --> 00:13:05.183
So go forth and create.

00:13:05.183 --> 00:13:07.853
( applause )

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:10.256
( outro music )
