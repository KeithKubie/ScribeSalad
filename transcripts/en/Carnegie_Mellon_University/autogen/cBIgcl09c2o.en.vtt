00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.289
so our work on question-answering

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:09.299
so our work on question-answering
 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.020
so our work on question-answering
focuses on providing the capability for

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.030
focuses on providing the capability for
 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.220
focuses on providing the capability for
human user to ask for information in a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230
human user to ask for information in a
 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.500
human user to ask for information in a
very natural way the same way that they

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510
very natural way the same way that they
 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.720
very natural way the same way that they
would ask a human assistant for

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730
would ask a human assistant for
 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.180
would ask a human assistant for
information

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190
information
 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.930
information
it's actually built up of several

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940
it's actually built up of several
 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.640
it's actually built up of several
fundamental algorithms that we work on

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650
fundamental algorithms that we work on
 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.800
fundamental algorithms that we work on
in the language Technologies Institute

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810
in the language Technologies Institute
 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.470
in the language Technologies Institute
so the first thing you have to do is to

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480
so the first thing you have to do is to
 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.240
so the first thing you have to do is to
analyze the users question and

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250
analyze the users question and
 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.640
analyze the users question and
understand what they're asking for at

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650
understand what they're asking for at
 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.080
understand what they're asking for at
the level of the underlying meaning

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090
the level of the underlying meaning
 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.940
the level of the underlying meaning
rather than just the words that they're

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950
rather than just the words that they're
 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.700
rather than just the words that they're
using so that involves doing work on

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710
using so that involves doing work on
 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.479
using so that involves doing work on
what we call natural language parsing

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
what we call natural language parsing
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.030
what we call natural language parsing
then we have to search for the relevant

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040
then we have to search for the relevant
 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.700
then we have to search for the relevant
documents or information resources that

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710
documents or information resources that
 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.920
documents or information resources that
we can use to answer that question and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930
we can use to answer that question and
 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.100
we can use to answer that question and
that involves algorithms in indexing and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110
that involves algorithms in indexing and
 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.100
that involves algorithms in indexing and
retrieval or search engines which is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110
retrieval or search engines which is
 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.329
retrieval or search engines which is
another you know big part of the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339
another you know big part of the
 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.649
another you know big part of the
research that we do here at the LTI then

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659
research that we do here at the LTI then
 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.450
research that we do here at the LTI then
we have a step where we take those

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460
we have a step where we take those
 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.460
we have a step where we take those
documents that we've retrieved and then

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470
documents that we've retrieved and then
 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.500
documents that we've retrieved and then
we try to extract the candidate answers

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510
we try to extract the candidate answers
 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.000
we try to extract the candidate answers
for the question

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010
for the question
 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.490
for the question
which involves the field of information

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500
which involves the field of information
 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.899
which involves the field of information
extraction which is yet another

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909
extraction which is yet another
 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.960
extraction which is yet another
component technology that we work on

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970
component technology that we work on
 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.230
component technology that we work on
here in the LTI and then finally we have

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240
here in the LTI and then finally we have
 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.630
here in the LTI and then finally we have
to combine all of the candidate answers

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640
to combine all of the candidate answers
 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.090
to combine all of the candidate answers
together and reason about what is you
