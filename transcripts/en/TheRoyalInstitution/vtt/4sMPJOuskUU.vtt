00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.010
Crystals are highly ordered structures.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.590
They can be made up of atoms of ions which
are charged species

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.960
or they can be made up of molecules as well.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.640
But what's important is that they have a very
regular arrangement.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.160
So they could either be oriented in the same
way or they're alternating regularly.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.370
but we're not just talking in a couple of
dimensions, we're talking a 3D structure here.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.050
Diamonds, salt, sugar and ice, they all look
kind of colourless but they've all got a crystalline

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.450
structure.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.520
Diamond is made of highly ordered Carbon atoms.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.860
The sodium-chloride that makes up your salt
is made of sodium and chloride ions

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.280
that have been arranged in a 3D structure

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.620
that repeats again and again, but also ice.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.190
Now ice and sugar, they're not atoms and they're
not ions but they are molecules,

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:09.140
and these molecules are able to order themselves
against one another and around one another.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.330
Entropy, as dictated by the second law of
thermodynamics means that

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.630
things tend to move towards a more disordered
state

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.280
and you would think that crystals are disobeying
that law of thermodynamics because effectively

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.820
you're creating order.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.750
What's actually happening though is that as
a crystal forms, it often releases heat

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.430
and so that energy isn't just sort of staying
within that system, it is being redistributed.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.270
So it's the redistribution of heat which is
actually the increase in entropy that we're

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.490
seeing

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.409
even though the physical ordering of these
bits of matter is increasing.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:58.240
When we think about a thermodynamic problem
like this, it's easy to presume that it is

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240
a closed system,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.229
but actually you can't just think of the problem
in isolation from the rest of your lab,

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.600
or your city, or the world.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.020
You're actually thinking about it as one part
of a system the size of the universe.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.640
So really, these entropy issues are way bigger
than you can confine in your lab.
