00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.503
Done already.

00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.936
Let's go to the solution. 
In the menu layout file

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:10.540
for the main activity, called main.xml, 
we add another menu item

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.850
that will always be in the overflow menu.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.830
We also define the string 
in the strings.xml file.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.660
The menu will be inflated 
in the main activity class,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.560
so we can handle 
the map menu item being inflated.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.560
by calling helper method 
called open preferred location in map.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.600
The helper method reads the users

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.070
preferred location 
from shared preferences.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.650
Then we create a view intent, 
indicating its location in the data URI.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.390
The format of the data URI 
was from the documentation

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.099
page on common intents, 
where you can append

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:49.268
a postal code as a query parameter.

00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:53.325
Finally, we start an activity 
with this intent.

00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:54.642
(typing)

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:58.620
Note that we only start the activity
if the activity resolves successfully.
