NECESSARY TROUBLE.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.970

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.010

MADAM PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR

TOWARD A MORE ALL-INCLUSIVE
INSTITUTION.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.430
[APPLAUSE]
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, YOU

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.720
REALIZED THAT THE BRILLIANT MIND
IS NOT CONFINED TO ONE

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.200
DISCIPLINE OR ONE WAY OF
THINKING.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.780
IN FACT, TRUE GENIUS SEES
CONNECTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.930
ACROSS BARRIERS, TO BUILD A NEW
UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.189
AROUND US.

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.800
CREATING ONE HARVARD IS MUCH
LIKE THE WORK I DEDICATED MY

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.400
LIFE TO.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.219
EVER SINCE AS A YOUNG GIRL YOU

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.030

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:18.010
GRADUATED FROM THIS UNIVERSITY,
YOU MUST LEAD.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.439
YOU'RE NEVER TOO YOUNG TO LEAD,
YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD TO LEAD!

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.459
WE NEED YOUR LEADERSHIP NOW MORE
THAN EVERY BEFORE.

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.959
WE NEED IT!

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:42.790
[APPLAUSE]
WE MUST SAVE OUR COUNTRY!

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.849
WE MUST SAVE IT!

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:54.719
[APPLAUSE]
WE MUST SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:00.819
[APPLAUSE]
THERE ARE FORCES IN AMERICA

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.329
TODAY AND AROUND THE WORLD
TRYING TO TAKE US TO SOME OTHER

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.309
PLACE.

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:15.290
OUR FOREMOTHERS AND FOREFATHERS
BROUGHT US TO THIS PLACE.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.190
MAYBE OUR FOREMOTHERS AND OUR
FOREFATHER'S ALL CAME TO THIS

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.480
GREAT WORLD IN DIFFERENT SHIPS
BUT AS THE LATE GREAT RANDOLPH

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.760
SAID "WE ARE ALL IN THE SAME
BOAT NOW" AND WE MUST LOOK OUT

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.720
FOR EACH OTHER AND CARE FOR EACH
OTHER.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.860
[APPLAUSE]
YOU'RE NEVER TOO YOUNG OR TOO

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.230
OLD TO LEAD!

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.590
TO SPEAK UP!

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.910
SPEAK OUT!
AND GET IN GOOD TROUBLE,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.440
NECESSARY TROUBLE.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.670
YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO STAND ON
THE SIDELINES.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.540
ANOTHER GENERATION OF YOUNG
PEOPLE AND PEOPLE NOT SO YOUNG

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.270
ARE INSPIRED TO GET IN THE WAY.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.970
STUDENTS FROM HARVARD, DR.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.910
COLE,
WHO I HAVE BEEN KNOWING FOR MANY

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:29.720
YEARS CAME TO MISSISSIPPI, CAME
TO THE SOUTH AND GAVE EVERYTHING

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.940
YOU HAD.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:41.430
DURING THE 63 YOUNG MEN THAT I
KNEW, ANA GOODMAN, NICK WILL YOU

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.960
SAY SHRENER AND JAMES GAVE THEIR
LIVES WHILE THEY WERE HELPING

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.860
PEOPLE TO REGISTER TO VOTE.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.240
THE VOTE IS PRECIOUS.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.770
IT'S ALMOST SACRED.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.210
IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL,
NONINSTRUMENT OR TOOL WE HAVE IN

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.390
A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND WE MUST
USE T IF WE FAIL TO USE IT, WE

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:10.190
WILL LOSE IT.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:18.600
[APPLAUSE]
SO DURING THIS ELECTION YEAR, I

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:28.530
URGE YOU, I PLEAD WITH YOU TO DO
WHAT YOU CAN TO SAVE AND RESCUE

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.840
AMERICA.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.350
TO DO WHAT YOU CAN TO SAVE THE
PLANET!

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:41.160
SAVE THIS SPACESHIP WE CALL
EARTH AND LEAVE IT A LITTLE

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.600
CLEANER, A LITTLE GREENER, AND A
LITTLE MORE PEACEFUL.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.620
FOR GENERATIONS YET UNBORN.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:59.420
[APPLAUSE]
WE HAVE A MISSION AND A MANDATE

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.490
TO GO OUT THERE, PLAY A ROLE AND
PLAY IT SO WELL AS DR.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.530
KING
WOULD SAY, THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.280
PLAY IT ANY BETTER.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:18.170
SMV YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY FROM
TIME TO TIME THAT I GREW UP IN

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.230
RURAL ALABAMA ON A FARM.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.850
PICKING COTTON, GATHERING
PEANUTS, GATHERING CORN,

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.370
SOMETIMES I WOULD BE OUT THERE
WORKING AND MY MOTHER WOULD SAY,

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.370
"BOY, YOU'RE FALLING BEHIND!

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.910
YOU NEED TO CATCH UP" AND I
WOULD SAY "THIS IS HARD WORK AND

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.950
SHE SAID "HARD WORK NEVER KILLED
ANYBODY AND I SAID I SAY ABOUT

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.430
TO KILL ME!

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.950
[LAUGHTER]
WE NEED TO WORK HARD!

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.710
THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:56.110
THESE SMART GRADUATES WILL LEAD
US.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:04.050
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS LEAD US,
AND GUYS, I SAY TO YOU, IF

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:17.340
YOU'RE NOT MINDFUL, THE WOMEN
ARE GOING TO LEAD US!

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:23.100
[CHEERS &amp; APPLAUSE]
IT IS MY BELIEF, IT IS MY

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.970
FEELING AS A TRAVELLER OF
AMERICA THAT THE WOMEN AND YOUNG

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.029
PEOPLE, HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS,
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS AND

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:41.840
COLLEGE STUDENTS WILL LEAD US AS
PART OF A NONVIOLENT REVOLUTION.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:50.310
WE WILL CREATE AN AMERICA THAT
IS BETTER, A LITTLE MORE HUMANE

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:56.140
AND NO ONE, BUT NO ONE CAN DENY
US OF THAT.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:03.520
[APPLAUSE]
I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE OR TWO

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.320
WORDS TO THE GRADUATES.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.080
TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND TAKE IT
ALL IN.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:17.860
BUT TOMORROW, I HOPE YOU ROLL UP
YOUR SLEEVES, BECAUSE THE WORLD

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.940
IS WAITING FOR TALENTED MEN AND
WOMEN TO LEAD IT TO A BETTER

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.360
PLACE.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:31.480
DURING THE 60s, PEOPLE LITERALLY
PUT THEIR BODIES ON THE LINE!

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:38.170
MANY CAME FROM THIS UNIVERSITY,
CAME FROM CAMBRIDGE, FROM

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:43.180
BOSTON, THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND
THROUGHOUT AMERICA.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:48.570
JUST THINK A FEW SHORT YEARS AGO
THAT BLACK PEOPLE AND WHITE

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.860
PEOPLE COULDN'T BE SEATED
TOGETHER ON A GREYHOUND BUSINESS

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.960
OR TRAILWAY BUS, LEAVING
WASHINGTON, D.C. TO TRAVEL

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.210
THROUGH VIRGINIA, NORTH
CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA,

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.850
GEORGIA, ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.380
WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO NEW
ORLEANS TO TEST A DECISION OF

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.330
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:17.960
WE WERE BEATEN, ARRESTED, AND
MORE THAN 400 OF US WERE JAILED.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:25.520
MY SEAT MATE WAS A YOUNG WHITE
GENTLEMAN FROM CONNECTICUT.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.960
WE ARRIVED IN A SMALL TOWN IN
SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.510
WE WERE BEATEN, LEFT BLOODY.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:41.380
BUT MANY YEARS LATER AND THIS
WAS MAY, 1961, SAME YEAR THAT

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:48.110
BARACK OBAMA WAS BORN, BUT MANY
YEARS LATER, ONE OF THE GUYS

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:53.290
THAT BEAT US CAME TO MY OFFICE
IN WASHINGTON.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.900
HE GOT INFORMATION FROM A LOCAL
REPORTER.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:02.200
HE WAS IN HIS 70s, HIS SON CAME
WITH HIM IN HIS 40s.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.040
HE SAID, MR.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.400
LEWIS, I'M ONE OF
THE PEOPLE THAT BEAT YOU.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.610
BEAT YOUR SEATMATE.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.290
I'VE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE KLAN.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:18.380
HE SAID "WILL YOU FOR GIVE ME?"

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.110
"I WANT TO APOLOGIZE."

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.310
"WILL YOU ACCEPT MY APOLOGY?

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.200
WILL YOU FOR GIVE ME?"

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.040
HIS SON STARTED CRYING, HE
STARTED CRYING AND I SAID I FOR

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.040
GIVE YOU.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.500
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.880
THEY HUGGED ME, I HUGGED THEM
BACK AND I CRIED WITH THEM.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.770
IN POWER OF THE WAY OF PEACE,
THE POWER OF LOVE, IT IS THE

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:53.120
POWER OF THE PHILOSOPHY AND
DISCIPLINE OF NONVIOLENCE.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.250
WE NEED TO CREATE A SOCIETY
WHERE WE CAN BE RECONCILED AND

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:03.540
LAY DOWN THE BURDEN OF HATH FOR
HATE IS TOO HEAVY OF A BURDEN TO

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.080
BEAR.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:17.920
[APPLAUSE]
50 YEARS AGO THE MAN THAT I

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:26.540
ADMIRED, THE MAN THAT WAS LIKE A
BROTHER, MARTIN LUTHER KING,

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.510
JUNIOR, WAS TAKEN FROM US.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.100
WHEN WE HEARD THAT DR.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.210
KING HAD
BEEN ASSASSINATED I WAS IN

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:43.850
INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA
CAMPAIGNING WITH BOBBY KENNEDY.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.930
I CRIED.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:59.490
STOPPED CRYING AND I SAID TO
MYSELF "WE STILL HAVE BOBBY."

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.430
TWO MONTHS LATER BOBBY KEPT DID
I WAS GONE -- KENNEDY WAS GONE

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.000
AND I CRIED SOME MORE.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.670
TODAY WE'VE GOT TO GET RID OF
OUR ARE TEARS AND NOT BE DOWN

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.290
AND NOT GET LOST IN THE SEA OF
DESPAIR.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:24.520
WE'VE GOT TO BE HOPEFUL AND KEEP
THE FAITH AND TURN THE SHIP

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.520
AROUND.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.970
WE CAN DO IT AND WE MUST DO IT!

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:40.649
[APPLAUSE]
HERE AT HARVARD YOU'VE BEEN WELL

00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:43.310
TRAINED.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.190
YOU MUST LEAD.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.990
YOU MUST GET OUT THERE AND AS
DR.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:54.920
KING WOULD SAY, BE A
HEADLIGHT, NOT A TAILLIGHT!

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:01.709
IT'S YOUR TIME, IT'S YOUR
CALLING.

00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:07.780
DURING THE 60s I GOT ARRESTED A
FEW TIMES, 40 TIMES!

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.540
[LAUGHTER]
AND SINCE I'VE BEEN IN CONGRESS

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:16.650
ANOTHER FIVE TIMES!

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:23.570
[APPLAUSE]
AND I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GET

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.550
ARRESTED AGAIN!

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.600
MY PHILOSOPHY IS VERY SIMPLE,
WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT IS

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.970
NOT RIGHT, NOT FAIR, NOT JUST,
STAND UP!

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:34.970
SAY SOMETHING!

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:41.750
SPEAK UP AND SPEAK OUT!

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:47.779
[APPLAUSE]
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AS A YOUNG

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:55.330
BOY IN RURAL ALABAMA, 50 MILES
FROM MONTGOMERY, I HAD AN AUNT

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.800
BY THE NAME OF SINEVA AND MY
AUNT LIVED IN A SHOTGUN HOUSE,

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.260
HERE AT HARVARD YOU NEVER SEEN A
SHOTGUN HOUSE, YOU DON'T EVEN

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.030
KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.750
ONE WAY IN, ONE WAY OUT.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:15.529
WHAT IS A SHOTGUN HOUSE?

00:15:15.529 --> 00:15:20.380
OLD HOUSE, DIRT YARD.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:25.540
SOMETIMES MY AUNT SINEVA WOULD
GO OUT ON THE WEEKEND, FRIDAY OR

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:32.810
SATURDAY, AND TAKE A BRUSH BROOM
MADE FROM DOGWOOD BRANCHES AND

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.899
SWEEP THE YARD VERY CLEAN.

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:44.640
ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON FEW OF MY
BROTHERS AND SISTERS, COUSINS,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.350
ABOUT 15 OF US YOUNG CHILDREN
WERE PLAYING IN HER DIRT YARD.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.360
AND AN UNBELIEVABLE STORM CAME
UP.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.610
THE WIND STARTED BLOWING, THE
THUNDER STARTED ROLLING AND THE

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:01.480
LIGHTNING STARTED FLASHING AND
SHE TOLD US TO COME IN.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:06.140
WE WENT IN.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.490
THE WIND CONTINUED TO BLOW, THE
THUNDER CONTINUED TO ROLL, THE

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:16.810
LIGHTNING CONTINUED TO FLASH,
AND THE RAIN CONTINUED TO BEAT

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.610
ON THIS OLD TIN ROOF OF THE
SHOTGUN HOUSE.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.959
AND WE CRIED AND CRIED.

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:26.380
AND IN ONE CORNER OF THE OLD
HOUSE APPEARED TO BE LIFTING UP

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:32.589
AND MY AUNT WALKED OVER TO THAT
SIDE TO HOLD THE HOUSE DOWN WITH

00:16:32.589 --> 00:16:33.589
HER BODY.

00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:35.480
WHEN THE OTHER CORNER APPEARED
TO BE LIFTING SHE HAD US WALK TO

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.850
THAT CORNER, WE WERE CHILDREN
WALKING WITH THE WIND, BUT WE

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.200
NEVER, EVER LEFT THE HOUSE!

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.760
I SAY TO EACH OF YOU, EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF US, THE WIND MAY

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:53.060
BLOW, THE THUNDER MAY ROLL, THE
LIGHTNING MAY FLASH AND THE RAIN

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:59.790
MAY BEAT DOWN ON AN OLD HOUSE,
CALL IT A HOUSE OF HARVARD, CALL

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:05.610
IT A HOUSE OF CAMBRIDGE, CALL IT
A HOUSE OF GLOUCESTER, CALL IT

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:10.520
THE HOUSE OF WASHINGTON, OR
ALABAMA OR GEORGIA, WE ALL LIVE

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.760
IN THE SAME HOUSE.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.829
WE ALL MUST HOLD OUR LITTLE
HOUSE DOWN.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:24.610
SO I SAY TO YOU: WALK WITH THE
WIND.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:30.090
LET THE SPIRIT OF HISTORY BE
YOUR GUIDE.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:35.690
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:41.030
