00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.769
- [Voiceover] Use the rotation tool

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:04.137
to determine the angle of rotation

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:08.871
about the point (2, -3)

00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:13.438
that will map line segments HE and RO

00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:16.197
onto the other line segments.

00:00:16.197 --> 00:00:18.844
So, we wanna rotate HE,

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:20.144
this is segment HE,

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:22.327
and this is line segment RO,

00:00:22.327 --> 00:00:24.277
and we wanna rotate it around this point

00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:27.180
so that they map, so that their images

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.683
after the rotation map to these two

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:31.215
right over here.

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:32.123
Let's think about it:

00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:33.499
which one should map to which?

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:38.397
So, it looks like HE

00:00:38.397 --> 00:00:42.140
should map to this right over here.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.596
Well, actually, let me just play around.

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:46.496
I can add a rotation.

00:00:46.496 --> 00:00:48.957
I could add a rotation here,

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:51.325
and let's see, I could rotate around.

00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:55.319
If this point over here is going to,

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:56.410
well, we already know we're gonna

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.467
rotate around the point (2, -3),

00:00:58.467 --> 00:00:59.419
so let me write that.

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:02.479
We're gonna rotate
around the point (2, -3),

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.174
and let's see, if we rotate by 90 degrees,

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:05.068
what happens?

00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:09.899
That was too much.

00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:14.265
Oh, actually that's too little,

00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:16.308
because a positive angle right over here,

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:19.721
we're going counter-clockwise
by 90 degrees,

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:21.671
so Point R mapped to this point

00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:23.691
right over here, Point O mapped

00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:25.363
to this point over here,

00:01:25.363 --> 00:01:26.478
but we want it to go even farther.

00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:28.237
We want it to map to maybe this point

00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:30.861
over here, so let me increase this.

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.679
I don't know, let me try 135.

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:37.674
All right, it looks
like we're almost there.

00:01:37.674 --> 00:01:42.485
Maybe let's try 140.

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:43.952
Press "Enter."

00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:47.342
That still didn't get us there.

00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:48.687
Let me see 145.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.439
We're getting close, maybe 150.

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:58.093
150, and that looks pretty good.

00:01:58.093 --> 00:01:59.931
It looks like we have done it.

00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.162
So, if you start with these,

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:02.624
the set of points that represent

00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:04.969
line segments HE and RO,

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.917
if you rotate them about the point (2, -3)

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:12.098
by 150 degrees, and the convention is

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:14.025
that that's going to be counter-clockwise,

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:16.138
we see that we map, their images

00:02:16.138 --> 00:02:17.333
are going to be these two lines

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.237
right over here, and we saw that

00:02:20.237 --> 00:02:23.000
Point O right over here maps

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.416
to this point right over here.

00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:26.409
Point R maps to this point.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.170
Point E is going to map
to that point, I believe.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.371
Yup, that's right, and then Point H

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:33.834
is going to map to that point,

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.478
and obviously all of
these points in between,

00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:37.312
for example, this point right over here

00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:39.333
that's on the line, that would map

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:41.157
to halfway between these two segments

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:43.433
right over there, so there we have it.

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:44.323
We've done it.
