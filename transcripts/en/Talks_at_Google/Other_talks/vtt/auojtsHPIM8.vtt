SPEAKER 1: Can you please
give a warm welcome

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.962
to today's speaker, Ian McClean.

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:14.406
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.257 --> 00:00:19.423
IAN MCCLEAN: Good afternoon.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.320
I'm on.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.920
So welcome unofficially to
the start of the long weekend.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.890
And it's interesting,
because when Caroline invited

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.050
me to speak here,
I didn't realize

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.940
until I looked in the
calendar to realize

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.890
that I got the afternoon just
after lunch slot on the Friday

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.244
before the start of the
long bank holiday weekend.

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:47.910
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.868
IAN MCCLEAN: So the one
thing that I almost did

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:54.330
was I thought long and
hard about packing a mirror

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.690
so that I wouldn't be the
only person in the room

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.090
and there would at least be one
other person in the audience.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.040
So I can only
conclude on that basis

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.319
that you guys are the
optimistic learners.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.490
So I better be clear that
I don't disappoint you,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.370
either with your optimism
or with your learning.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.550
And this is my first
talk at Google.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.780
So I fit into that
category, Caroline.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.270
And it's really good to
be here, and particularly

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.340
on the run in to
the long weekend.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.000
And we're going to spend a
little bit less than an hour.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.100
And I'm going to make
it a little interactive.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.420
So there's going to be
some of me, some of you,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.470
and then we'll kind of make
up the rest of it in between.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.804
But I think everybody starts
off by telling their story.

00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:43.803
I'm going to give you a
very, very short version

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:44.410
of the story.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.020
So I'm the founder
of a business,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.880
which is called Flow Group.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.460
And I started the
business 20 years ago.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.070
So it's actually 20
years old this year.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.470
And I didn't have any great
grand ambitions or plans

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.150
to be an empire builder.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.600
And we built the business pretty
slowly, steadily, organically.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.200
And we now have a business
that has got operations

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.960
across four continents.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.789
And during the last
20 years or so,

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.750
we've worked with a very, very
wide range of organizations.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.620
In fact, these are just
some of that brands

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.670
that you'll be familiar with.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.490
In the last 10
years alone, we've

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.590
worked with over 300
different, mostly,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.600
international organizations in
all sorts of shapes and sizes.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.080
So many of them are
bluechip multinationals.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.410
And a number of them
are sports governing

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.880
bodies, government agencies,
voluntary organizations, NGOs.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.124
We are kind of
industry agnostic.

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:41.040
I think we worked with
38 different industries

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.747
in the last 10 years alone.

00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.580
And the one thing that
we bring to the party

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.260
is the common element of people.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.630
And that's probably the one
single variable or expertise

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.610
that we specialize in.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.639
Now, when you looked
at the list of things.

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.180
We call the things
down at the bottom

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.849
the centers of excellence.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.640
You'll probably be very
familiar with them.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.035
And you can imagine that that's
what an organization that

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:04.410
would do what we
do around people

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.020
would cluster their activities
in under the headings

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.340
that you see.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.710
The one that put the
red circle around

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.440
is the one which is
probably least familiar,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.310
if at all familiar to you,
which is called GreenLine.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.100
And that's what I'm going
to talk to you about or work

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.181
with you on this afternoon is
this GreenLine proposition.

00:03:23.181 --> 00:03:25.680
And the reason that I chose
this is because Caroline kind of

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.050
invited us to think about
something that would

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.090
add value or be interesting.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.020
Because it didn't
exist five years ago.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.420
And five years ago,
we saw something

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.210
that was missing in the
market in the organizations

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.330
that we were working
with across the globe.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.340
And we created-- myself and
my co-founder of GreenLine

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.640
who is based in Toronto,
Blair Steinbach.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.810
And his background
is neuroscience.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.300
So he, for almost a
quarter of a century,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.030
has worked with all
sorts of agencies

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.070
from athletes to
government agencies

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.360
to military to
business organizations

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.660
in the area of how do you
perform best under pressure.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.750
And that combined with our own
experience and field research

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.750
came to create something
which we call GreenLine.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.240
And here's the proposition.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.240
So the title that
I've chosen for today

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.050
is this whole idea of what
I've put up on the screen here.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.570
So it's a proposition.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.840
And there are three key
words to share with you

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.160
or to think about for the
purposes of the next hour.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.030
The first is effective leaders.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.080
I'm guessing that all of us
here at this stage in our career

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.950
have had the experience of what
it's like to work under or work

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.590
with an effective leader.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.830
We probably have
even more experience

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.470
of what it's like
to work with or work

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.870
under an ineffective leader.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.602
And they are different.

00:04:53.602 --> 00:04:55.560
And the difference between
effective leadership

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.190
and ineffective leadership
is that the effective leader,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.450
he or she, has thinking
and behaviors that

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.960
cause them to be able to
create an environment, which

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.610
in this world we call
culture, which is productive

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.480
and engaging and
gets great work done.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.610
And we all probably
have the experience

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.800
of both during our
careers at this point.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.117
So this whole idea of effective.

00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:24.700
The second word,
which is interesting,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.800
is the OS, or the
Operating System.

00:05:29.294 --> 00:05:31.710
Because effective leaders with
their thinking and behavior

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.501
probably don't even
know what they're doing

00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:35.550
or how they're doing it, right?

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.159
They just show up
the way they show up

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.450
with the thinking and behavior.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.660
And it's underneath the surface.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.120
So the idea of an
operating system

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.930
is a very good analogy
for this proposition.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.000
And actually, it was
brought to our attention

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.480
working with one of the big four
accountancy firms in London.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.330
And they were wowed by
the GreenLine proposition,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.190
which we're about to explore.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.630
And they ran into a challenge.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.400
Because they said,
well, hang on a second.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.620
Where do we deploy this?

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.950
Because we can see this
is so good as a basic--

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.077
and they called it
our operating system.

00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:10.410
It's going to affect our teams
and make our teams better

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.670
and more collaborative.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.700
It's going to affect the way we
interact with our key clients

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.165
on our customer relations.

00:06:16.165 --> 00:06:17.790
It's going to help
with our innovation,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.248
because we need to be innovative
and creative in a changing

00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:21.180
environment.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.070
And it's going to help
with our efficiency

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.200
and our effectiveness
by reducing down

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.530
waste and increasing
speed of execution.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.120
But it's all under the surface.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.220
And we know that the value
of the operating system

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.810
is that, if you've got a
robust operating system, then

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.510
you can run more
programs simultaneously.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.780
You've got higher efficiency and
higher speed with your process.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.910
And you get less blue screens
of death, which in leadership

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.330
terms is pretty invaluable.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.270
So what we did was, over
the last four or five years,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.060
we've managed to
codify and build

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.330
the evidence for what is
the operating system that

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.870
differentiates effective leaders
from ineffective leaders.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.580
And that's what
GreenLine has become.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.580
And one of the other
interesting elements of it

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.380
is, in spite of
the fact that we've

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.210
got a pretty mature business
after 15 years and 5 years ago,

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.510
in the last five years,
the GreenLine proposition

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.030
amongst our clients
now accounts for 40%

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.469
of our revenue from a
standing start, from nil.

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:26.010
I'm looking out at
the audience here.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.440
And I'm imagining
there aren't many of us

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.480
that remember there was a
motor oil advert in the 1970s.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.650
And the tag line for it was,
it gets to parts of the engine

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.960
that other oils don't reach.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.090
Well, we found that
GreenLine seems

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.240
to get to parts of organizations
and people's psyche

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.970
that other types of
development doesn't reach.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.720
So we call it the
Castrol GTX of develop.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.150
That's what we are.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.064
So for today, I'm going to
share with you a few things.

00:08:00.064 --> 00:08:01.730
The first thing is
I'm going to give you

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.090
a context where this came
from apart from the history.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.270
So where does it apply?

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.124
How does it work?

00:08:07.124 --> 00:08:08.540
The second thing
we're going to do

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.700
is I'm going to share with
you a very simple model.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.230
And the model is very simple.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.770
The third thing we're going
to do is the methodology

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.320
of the operating system is
broken down into, as you'll see

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.970
here, seven do's
and seven don'ts.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.380
And we've got cards.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.310
We've got seven red cards.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.100
In the current
footballing environment,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.004
that's pretty understandable
and intelligible what that does.

00:08:28.004 --> 00:08:29.420
And then we got
seven green cards,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.860
which are the very
opposite of the red cards.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.470
So I'm going to
share those with you.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.700
And then that's
effectively what we're

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.450
going to spend our
time at this afternoon.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.408
There's going to be some
audience participation

00:08:39.408 --> 00:08:40.200
as we go along.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.840
I'll engage with you at
the appropriate moment

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.679
and get some input.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.304
Because I'll be very
interested in your

00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:47.100
take on some of this stuff.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.360
So let's just talk about
context for a second.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.780
When we talk about context
when we look at business,

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.120
we look at it as a
game of two halves

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.900
just extending on the
football analogy for a second.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.670
On one half or on
one side of business,

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.100
you've got what we
call the mechanics.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:08.720
And the mechanics are simply
the structures and systems

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.300
and processes and
policies, procedures--

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.680
they will begin with P--

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.880
the strategies that
are necessary to create

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.780
order in what otherwise
would be chaos.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.730
So they are very necessary.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.220
And they create order, and
they create transparency.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.520
So this is the
mechanics of business.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.950
On the other side,
you've got the humanics.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:35.930
Because I've still yet to
see a project deliver itself.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.814
I've still yet to see a
strategy implement itself.

00:09:39.814 --> 00:09:41.480
And the interesting
thing about business

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.780
and our experience over the
last quarter of a century or so

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.900
is that, when there is a problem
and something needs fixing

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.100
and the business has to go
to try to find a solution,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.320
where do you think
it typically goes?

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.470
Do you think it goes to
fix it to the humanics

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.720
or to the mechanics?

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.240
What's your sense?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.060
Almost exclusively,
it's the mechanics.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.650
Let's write a new policy.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.060
Let's restructure.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.600
Let's take it with the system
or investigate the system.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.760
We had a classic
example of this with one

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.750
of the leading banks that
moved to an outsource model

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.000
just over 10 years ago.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.640
One of the things that
came into our orbit

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.977
was the performance
management area.

00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:27.060
And they knew they needed
to do something with it.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.350
So they'd outsource it, and
they centralized everything.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.780
They realized, when they
did their due diligence,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.930
that there were 65 different
performance management

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.970
systems out there in the group.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.120
And that wouldn't do.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.700
So what they decided they
needed to do what they needed

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.560
to find one that
was going to be fit

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.510
for purpose and
the silver bullet

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.910
for all performance management.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.720
So they went out, and they
spent two years investigating,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.630
crafting, recrafting.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.940
And two years later, they
came up with the silver bullet

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.950
performance management system.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.020
They ran it for six months.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.390
After six months,
they abandoned it.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.200
The reason they abandoned it is
because they realized when they

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.700
did their
investigation as to why

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.550
it wasn't working that
the problem or the cause

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.440
was not with the system.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.899
It was basically
that people didn't

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:18.565
have the skill or the
confidence to have

00:11:18.565 --> 00:11:20.750
the type of conversations
you need to have in order

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.820
to keep performance going.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.090
So it's a classic example
of an organization

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.800
looking in the wrong place
to try to solve the problem

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.290
and prioritizing
mechanics over humanics.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.290
And actually, it's
very understanding.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.660
Because mechanics
are predictable.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.850
They're tangible.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.410
They're measurable.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:47.190
People, on the other
hand, they're messy.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.690
A manager in the very early
stages of my own career

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.160
took me aside and
said, Ian, you're

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.940
going to learn one thing
about organizations.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.570
All problems come
with hair on top.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.040
Or not, as the case may be.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.040
And it's actually true.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.160
And if you think about it, the
only way to get anything done

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.940
is through human interaction,
whatever that is.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.730
And we've kind of tagged
the idea of conversations

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.570
onto GreenLine.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.930
Because the lowest common
denominator or base

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.810
unit of currency
of all interaction

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.080
is the individual conversation.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.330
And if you think about
individual conversations,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.890
when I talk about conversations
in the current epoch,

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.080
it's not just face to
face anymore, obviously.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.720
It's not just the telephone
anymore, obviously.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.440
It's not just meetings
anymore, which

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.960
are now virtual and global.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.800
But it's also inclusive of
and trumped by-- if you pardon

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.900
the expression--

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.160
the electronic conversation.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.872
So you put all of those
channels together,

00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:55.080
and I got a question for you.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.060
How many interactions
do you think

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.974
happened through those
channels on a daily basis?

00:13:04.974 --> 00:13:06.640
I'm not even going
to talk about Google.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.710
I'm just even talking
about Ireland.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.168
I'm not even talking
about Ireland.

00:13:09.168 --> 00:13:11.440
I'm talking about your own team.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.970
We had one client mad enough
to undertake a challenge

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.279
to investigate and
come up with a number.

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:19.820
And I'll tell you
who the client was.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.230
The client was a retailer in
Ireland, Primark, or Penneys

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.410
to you and I. And
they discovered

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.560
that there were 220,000
interactions that take place

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.635
across their network
on a daily basis.

00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:35.290
Now, the question I have, and
it's a rhetorical question,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.050
is, do you think that the
quality of the conversations

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.840
or interactions
that are happening

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.570
are having an effect or
an impact on the business?

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.609
OK, you don't even need
to answer that one.

00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:47.650
That's not even the audience
participation point.

00:13:51.209 --> 00:13:53.250
What we've discovered is
that there are basically

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.160
three outcomes to
any interaction.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.080
And it's a little bit
like, if it's a machine,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.010
then you need to drive it.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.426
And if you need a drive it,
you probably got a gear shift.

00:14:01.426 --> 00:14:03.480
And those of us who've
got automatic cars--

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.980
and anybody from the US wouldn't
know what anything else is,

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.870
I'm sure--

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.690
you've got three settings
on your gearstick.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.770
So the first is D. You
have the interaction.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.220
You have the engagement.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.740
You have a conversation.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.220
Business moves on.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.180
There's a second
category of interaction--

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.990
N, neutral.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.390
Conversation happens,
and nothing happens.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.030
But there's a third
category of interaction.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.770
And the third category
of interaction

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.450
is R, which stands for--

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.200
AUDIENCE: Reverse.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.550
IAN MCCLEAN: Reverse.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.760
In GreenLine language,
we call it residue.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.950
Because what ends up
happening is, now,

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.160
as a result of this
conversation, poorly handled,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.520
poorly communicated
or executed, now, it's

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.710
not just one
conversation we've had.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.380
Now, there's a multitude of
conversations that escalate

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.982
or ripple out from this.

00:14:57.982 --> 00:14:59.440
Now, instead of
having one meeting,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.320
we need to have a series
of meetings, many of them

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.280
unofficial and in car parks
and in coffee coolers.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.770
Now, instead of having
a few people involved,

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.415
it's escalated.

00:15:10.415 --> 00:15:11.290
Emails have gone out.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.420
CC, BCC-- now, the head of
the department is involved.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.180
Oh, and by the way,
if this is at home,

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.730
it's your mother-in-law.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.760
We call this residue.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.880
And residue actually has a cost.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.570
The way it shows up--

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.570
and this has me kind of
short-circuiting this--

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.090
from our analysis of
it or our research is

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.700
it shows up in two camps.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:42.140
One impact of residue is it
creates a lack of clarity

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.990
or/and it creates a
second category, which

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.640
is a loss of commitment.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.640
And these are some of
the headings that it has.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.710
And this is real.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.670
The interesting thing is
that managers typically

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.120
spend a portion of their time--

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.530
guess what?

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.670
Mopping up residue, going
around with a mop and a bucket

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.900
tidying up the result or
the residue of things that

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.050
could have, should have
been handled more skillfully

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.510
earlier on in the piece.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.510
People get paid to
come to work to mop up,

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.110
highly paid in many cases.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.440
So does this resonate
with you by the way?

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.710
Or does this never
ever happen here?

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.030
Are you residue immune?

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.650
Or are you human?

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.520
So if that's true, here's
my question to you.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.800
And it will be different
from person to person.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.090
The question I have is,
how many hours a week

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:47.020
would you say, on average,
the average supervisor or team

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.780
leader or leader or
manager in Google

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:55.490
would spend tidying up residue?

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.147
Have a reflection.

00:16:57.147 --> 00:16:58.480
So there's four categories here.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.130
And I'm just going to
ask you to volunteer.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.420
How many of us would
suggest or say no to five.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.280
How many of us would
be in that camp.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.130
OK, three to four people.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.349
Oh, I've just given it away.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.627
We're short on time so I
just kind of shortcut it in.

00:17:19.627 --> 00:17:21.210
But at least we know
the three or four

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:25.212
people in the room we
believe it's less than six.

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:26.670
What would you say
your average is?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.552
Would you be putting
it in this category?

00:17:29.552 --> 00:17:31.260
Would that be the
general consensus here,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.590
somewhere in here?

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.710
Yeah?

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:39.490
The international average
is about 12 hours a week.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.960
Now, if we talk about residue
and what causes residue,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.880
let me ask you--

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.920
so this is a piece where I'm
interested in hearing from you.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.380
Because it manifests
itself differently

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.860
in different organizations,
but not too differently.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.755
What I'm interested in is, if
you had to come up with reasons

00:17:55.755 --> 00:17:58.380
why conversations go wrong-- so
if you want to go into the root

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.837
cause and do your
root cause analysis,

00:18:00.837 --> 00:18:02.670
what are the things
that cause conversations

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:07.290
to go wrong typically in your
experience in Google here?

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.440
Give me an example.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.090
Anybody?

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.462
I'm just going to take
anything from the floor.

00:18:11.462 --> 00:18:13.450
AUDIENCE: Not knowing
what you want.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.121
IAN MCCLEAN: OK,
so not knowing what

00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:16.370
you want for the conversation.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.430
So not having a clarity.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.743
What else?

00:18:19.743 --> 00:18:21.826
AUDIENCE: Back and forth,
doing things too quickly

00:18:21.826 --> 00:18:24.820
and then having to come
back again and again.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.710
IAN MCCLEAN: So doing
things too quickly

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.250
and then having to rework
and do it again and again.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.070
We had over here.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.880
AUDIENCE: Not listening.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.790
IAN MCCLEAN: Not listening.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.800
So people not listening.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.730
I was listening by the way.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:34.990
I was just paying
attention over here.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.989
But I get what you mean.

00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:38.270
AUDIENCE: Some hidden agenda
from different parties.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.561
IAN MCCLEAN: OK, hidden
agendas from different parties.

00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:42.590
AUDIENCE: Not knowing the
"why" you're doing it.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.740
IAN MCCLEAN: OK, so not
only not knowing the "what"

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.927
but also the "why."

00:18:45.927 --> 00:18:47.260
AUDIENCE: The wrong [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.230
IAN MCCLEAN: The wrong
people in the room.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.526
Go on.

00:18:50.526 --> 00:18:52.286
So Google is you.

00:18:52.286 --> 00:18:54.062
AUDIENCE: Lack of context.

00:18:54.062 --> 00:18:55.270
IAN MCCLEAN: Lack of context.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.030
OK, so context is
either not [? not ?]

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.680
or different for
different people.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.415
Anything else?

00:19:00.415 --> 00:19:01.540
Was there a funny one here?

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.014
Because we'd love to hear it.

00:19:03.014 --> 00:19:04.436
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:10.630
IAN MCCLEAN: What we typically
do when we work with groups

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.880
is we take this information,
and we put it together.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.870
We take a sheet of flip-chart
paper, we take a red marker,

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.300
and we write up everything
that the group has got

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.560
to go through, and we put it.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.726
And we call it the red list.

00:19:24.139 --> 00:19:25.930
I'm going to come back
to that in a second.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:26.700
So we'll take all of this.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.700
We put it in a red list.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.090
So I want you to imagine big
sheet of flip chart paper

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.580
here with all the red
stuff that includes

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.210
what you said plus much more
that's already in the room.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.560
Here's the interesting aspect
of the whole proposition

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.172
is we're very keen to go back
to very simple first principles.

00:19:44.172 --> 00:19:45.630
And the very simple
first principle

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.050
about effectiveness, whether
we're lead or we're not--

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.180
by the way, there's one thing
that I forgot to mention.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.590
In the title of the talk,
it says effective leaders.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.320
When I talk about a
leader in this context,

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.140
you don't need to be
anointed or appointed

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.230
with the title of leader
for this to apply.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.650
And actually, even with
leaders that we've worked with,

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.150
when they come back
and they tell us

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.840
how this has worked
for them, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.700
they come back and
tell us the human story

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.910
of how it helps them with
their 14-year-old daughter,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.460
with their relationship at
home, with their whatever else.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.190
So even if you're
not a leader in here

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:27.210
formerly anointed, as long
as you are a human being

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.726
and you've got a personal life--

00:20:28.726 --> 00:20:30.600
and I won't even ask
you to put your hands up

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.040
if you haven't got one of those.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.150
But as long as you have, then
this applies just as well.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.860
And this is the reality of it
because it's a human reality.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.300
We have a situation
where, to get

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.580
stuff done, unless
it's self-directed

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.820
and we're doing our own
thing on our own time,

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.410
a lot of what we need to get
done is through other people.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.366
And you've got person
A, which is my side,

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:52.740
and you've got
person B, which is

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.040
the person on the other
side of the bridge.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.360
And you've got a gap.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.950
And as those in transport for
London continue to insist,

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:01.950
we need to mind the gap.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.350
And that actually
is the challenge.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.470
It is this fundamental
human challenge.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.141
Because if we were
easy as this, we

00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:12.390
wouldn't even have a business.

00:21:16.237 --> 00:21:18.070
When given a problem
or a challenge to solve

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.861
and we've got to sit
down and work it out--

00:21:19.861 --> 00:21:22.105
and there could be
A, B, C, D, E, and F

00:21:22.105 --> 00:21:24.230
perhaps if it's a project
or if it's a team meeting

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.750
or whatever it happens to be.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.910
Very often, what
happens is, instead

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.470
of moving in the
right direction,

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.930
the problem of a
challenge creates

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.560
a tension, which is A versus
B. Because I've got a view.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.460
I've got a history.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.797
I've got a prospective.

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.880
Caroline might have something
completely different

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.680
on the other side.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.850
And we start to try and
engage to solve the problem.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:44.969
And it creates a tension.

00:21:44.969 --> 00:21:46.760
And part of the reason
it creates a tension

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.870
is because of the red list.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.970
And the red list is real.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.430
And it's also human.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.870
And the thing
that's fascinated us

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.500
is that there's a policy and
a procedure for practically

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.910
everything.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.390
If it's in the EU,
there's a policy

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.650
and a procedure for the
shape and size of bananas.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.240
There are some organizations
we've encountered

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.960
where there's a policy on soda.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.790
You can't bring soda
into the building

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.951
because it will ruin
their vending sales.

00:22:15.951 --> 00:22:17.450
There's another
company that we work

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.640
with that has a policy
on furniture removal.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.950
Because they're so
heavily unionized that,

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.870
if you want to move a
desk from here to here,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:28.250
you've got to go and call
the furniture removal people.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.130
So we have policies
for all of this trivia.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.040
Yet we actually don't
have an operating system

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.140
for how to interact
with one another

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.170
to get a best result
or a best outcome.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.860
It doesn't actually exist--

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.090
until now.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:49.880
So the proposition is we know
that this red list is real.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.070
We still have to solve the
problem of the challenge.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.010
How do we navigate
our way skillfully

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.220
through what is
present very often

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.880
and produce an outcome that
isn't a residue outcome but one

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.750
which actually leaves us
with clarity and commitment

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.680
around the outcome?

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.871
So we know exactly what it
is we're supposed to do,

00:23:08.871 --> 00:23:10.370
we know what the
context is, we know

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.689
the "why," we know that
"what," we know "how,"

00:23:12.689 --> 00:23:15.230
we're committed to it, we have
the same idea of it, and we go

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.860
and we deliver it.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.270
And we're committed to doing so.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.095
That's the proposition.

00:23:20.095 --> 00:23:21.470
And the final
thing before we get

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.190
into the brain science, which
I'm about to share with you,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.440
is there's a cost to this.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.260
And organizations are
really waking up to it.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.620
Let me give you a really
crude residue calculator.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.130
We'll start off
with the 12 hours.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.130
So we take the 12 hours.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.171
This is a real live example
of an investment bank

00:23:39.171 --> 00:23:41.180
that we've worked with globally.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:47.720
So 12 hours times 48 weeks
times average hourly salary

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.790
globally times the number of
people employed by the business

00:23:52.790 --> 00:24:00.410
globally, and you get a
result. I did this presentation

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:05.730
most recently to 300
CFOs who are not normally

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.910
renowned for their interest
in conversations or anything

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.930
people-oriented usually.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.880
And we were flooded
with inquiries

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.190
on the back of this one
slide that we've just given.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.160
Because they did their own
maths with their own numbers.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.210
And they came up with a
very, very large number.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.420
Now, those of us who
aren't already gone

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.380
on holiday for the weekend will
appreciate that this number is

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.342
only half of the real number.

00:24:30.342 --> 00:24:31.800
Because for every
one hour that I'm

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.680
spending tidying
up residue, it's

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.610
an hour that I'm not spending
doing what is actually going

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.270
to add value to the business.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:41.705
So it's a six-point game.

00:24:41.705 --> 00:24:44.040
If you get tired of the
football analogy at any point,

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.697
I can just switch metaphors.

00:24:48.527 --> 00:24:49.860
Let me share with you the model.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.640
The model is deceptively, but--

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.650
it's deceptively simple.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.770
It's based on a journey.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.500
So this is the GreenLine model.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.290
And any journey that we have,
people identify with this.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.090
So they relate to it very well.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.120
Because we're all on a journey.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.510
And whether it's a
macro-level life journey,

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.350
whether it's a career
journey that we're on,

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.150
whether it's a relationship
journey that we're involved in,

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.940
we're all simultaneously
on multiple journeys.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.780
And whilst the journeys
are all different,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.357
the elements of the
journey are all the same.

00:25:19.357 --> 00:25:21.440
So one of the things you
need to have on a journey

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.720
is you need to have a
destination, which we simply

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.050
call the "there."

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.590
It's somewhere where we
haven't arrived at it yet.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.660
We haven't got there yet.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.310
It's over there.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.000
And it's not where
we currently are.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.615
So that's one fixed point
that we have in any journey.

00:25:35.615 --> 00:25:37.990
The second fixed
point in any journey

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.260
is where we currently are.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.510
You can take a snapshot in
time of any moment, which

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.400
is a "here."

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.802
If the language,
by the way, gets

00:25:44.802 --> 00:25:46.760
too technical at any
point, please let me know.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.080
AUDIENCE: Where?

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.551
IAN MCCLEAN: That's
in the middle.

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.050
So how do you connect
here to there?

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.260
What's the fastest way?

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.530
Straight line.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.480
We actually draw it
as a dotted line.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.490
Because life
teaches us that life

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.990
never really works
in a straight line.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.560
And interestingly, we
have friends and clients

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.860
in the aircraft business
or airline business.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.100
And they would tell us that,
if you take airplanes, which

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:20.176
most of us do a lot of the time,
then the airplane's trajectory,

00:26:20.176 --> 00:26:21.800
it's in the aircraft's
interest to stay

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.550
as close to that
straight line as possible

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.420
for obvious reasons.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.890
The first is it's the
most cost effective.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.350
Secondly, related to that,
as you've identified,

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.790
is the fastest.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.790
Thirdly, beyond that, it
consumes the least amount

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.690
of energy--

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.310
in this case, fuel,
which is tied into cost.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.150
And finally, people can get
there faster and cheaper.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.570
So they're happier.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:46.250
So these could be the KPIs for
any business, any industry.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.680
Interestingly, the
aircraft flight path

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.230
doesn't stay exactly
on the straight line.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.550
They tell us that actually
it looks more like this.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:59.804
It kind of wiggles and
wriggles from here to there.

00:26:59.804 --> 00:27:01.970
And it actually only
intersects with a straight line

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:06.860
or the optimal line 8%
of the time on average.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.680
8% of the time it's
connecting to the line.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.430
92% of the time,
what's it trying to do?

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.210
Get back on the line.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.460
It's a bit like Irish whether.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.251
It's either raining,
or it's about to rain.

00:27:18.251 --> 00:27:21.560
There's only two variables.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.830
And you're either on the line or
trying to get back on the line.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:30.110
And this is simple and easy
enough in aircraft territory.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:34.250
Because what they simply do
is they put in the onboard

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.940
coordinates.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.160
They onboard it of
the destination.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.687
And then the GPS kicks in
and makes the autocorrections

00:27:39.687 --> 00:27:40.520
all the way through.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.620
That's how the flight works.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.870
GreenLine just
follows that metaphor

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.670
but in the people sense.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.160
So in order for a
GreenLine to work,

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.020
there are four key skills
that we need to have.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.150
The first, which is obvious,
but not common practice,

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.880
is we need to create
an agreed "there."

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.630
We need to understand
what the purpose is.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.310
We don't need to understand
what the destination is.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:02.976
We need to understand
why we're doing it

00:28:02.976 --> 00:28:04.410
and what we expect
as an outcome.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.120
So that's the agreed "there."

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.030
Step 1.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.500
The second thing
we need to do is

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.875
we need to be able to recognize
when things are going off

00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:13.386
the straight line.

00:28:13.386 --> 00:28:15.260
Because sometimes, if
we're working together,

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.450
somebody will always recognize
first that we're going off.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.810
But it's the recognition of it.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.430
Sometimes, it doesn't
happen, the recognition.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.263
And things are way off
before we realize it.

00:28:24.263 --> 00:28:25.869
So that's the second competency.

00:28:25.869 --> 00:28:28.410
The third thing that people need
to do is they need to have--

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.210
and this becomes
the moment of truth.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.910
Do I have the
courage to call it?

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.880
And this is very interesting
from a cultural perspective.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.142
Because in some
cultures, the culture,

00:28:37.142 --> 00:28:38.600
the habit of
behavior, the received

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.308
wisdom of how things
get done around here

00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:41.520
is you never speak out.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.727
And in some cases,
people break down

00:28:45.727 --> 00:28:47.310
and they go the
opposite extreme where

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.810
people are speaking
out all the time

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.490
but then nobody's listening.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.519
So there's an
element where do I--

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:54.060
because there may
be a tension that's

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.160
created by speaking out
or talking to somebody

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.360
or bringing it up.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.650
That's a cultural issue.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.560
And finally, the final element
of, is part of the reason

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.030
that people often
don't speak out

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.054
or they don't step in to
tap somebody on the shoulder

00:29:06.054 --> 00:29:07.720
and say, I think we
need to address this

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.360
or we need to look at
doing it a different way,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.770
is because they're
not sure that they're

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.090
going to leave the conversation
or the relationship

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.699
or the project in a better
condition or even as

00:29:15.699 --> 00:29:18.240
good a condition as when they
found it before they tapped in?

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.610
So very often, very humanly,
they'll decide to avoid.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:27.710
So this, essentially, is the
proposition of the metaphor.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:32.500
In 25 years of working across
organizations globally,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:38.870
what we find, sadly, is not
very much of this in reality.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.420
What we find far more is this.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.360
There's far more red line
than there is green line.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.450
And you'll see the differences
in many, many different ways.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.480
And we're to dig into
this now in a second.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.260
And the green line outscores the
red in all four key areas, KPIs

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.650
that we identified earlier on.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.040
And there are many
reasons why not.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.590
So the proposition
for GreenLine,

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.090
which I'm going
to share with you,

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.950
there are seven green cards.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.180
And the green cards
are the mechanism

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.240
by which we keep us close to
the center line as possible

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.940
and on the green line,
navigating from here to there--

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.199
seven cards.

00:30:21.199 --> 00:30:22.490
And you've got a handout there.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.940
But we're going to come back
to that now in a second.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.040
The red cards are
the things that

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:33.920
are most likely in interactions
to cause the conversation

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.520
to go onto the red
line and, therefore,

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.380
in the wrong direction.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.170
Before we get into
the cards, I mentioned

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.760
that my partner in
founding GreenLine

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.890
is in the neuroscience game.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.360
And there's a really
robust set of neuroscience

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.100
that underpins the cards.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.860
So I'm going to give you the
15-minute version of something,

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.916
which would probably take
15 hours if we had 15 hours.

00:30:57.916 --> 00:31:00.290
But I'm going to give you the
short, simple version of it

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.331
because it's the weekend.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.270
So the brain.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.730
How many of us have an
interest in or an awareness

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.070
of the function of the brain
from a neuroscience point

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.570
of view?

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.590
How many of us have?

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.120
Not unusual and not surprising.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.311
So that's really good.

00:31:17.311 --> 00:31:19.810
So you can probably teach me a
thing or two even in addition

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.177
to what I'm about to teach.

00:31:21.177 --> 00:31:23.010
So for those of us who
have or haven't, what

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.676
I'm going to ask you
to do is, would you

00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:27.040
put your hand out like
this and splay out

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.590
your fingers and thumb?

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.880
OK, would you put your thumb
in, wrap around your fingers,

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.450
bring the fist toward your head,
turn around and turn your fist

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.777
and say, hi, brain.

00:31:38.777 --> 00:31:40.055
AUDIENCE: Hi, brain.

00:31:40.055 --> 00:31:42.430
IAN MCCLEAN: This is actually
a pretty good working model

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.720
of your brain, in
a couple of ways.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.970
Firstly, it's about this size.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.762
It's just a little bigger.

00:31:47.762 --> 00:31:48.720
It's about this weight.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.440
It's just a little heavier.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.420
And there are two
component parts to it

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.120
that are two functioning
parts at minimum that

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.240
work in parallel with one
another simultaneously.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.870
The first is the thumb,
which is one function.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.370
And this is the limbic or the
older part of the brain, which

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.410
is called the feeling brain.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.400
The fingers that
wrap around the front

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.770
is a more recent development.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.690
And that's the neocortex.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.584
And the two, they work
well independently.

00:32:13.584 --> 00:32:16.000
But actually, together, they
can do an awful lot more just

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.490
like your fist.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.440
But they actually
compete with one another.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.790
And their function--
sometimes, they get mixed up.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:29.470
So let me describe
briefly what each does

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:33.490
and where the risk is in the
context of our conversation

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.240
today on cards.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:39.140
So let's talk, first of
all, about the green brain.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.160
And the green brain
is a cognitive system.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.320
A cognitive system is
something where our logic,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.250
our ability for complex
thought, our problem-solving

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.450
capability--

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:53.560
so most of the time, from one
end of the day to the next,

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.820
this is on.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:59.445
We are solving problems,
everything from programming

00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:00.820
all the way through
to, what am I

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.010
going to wear in the
morning or tonight,

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.500
or what am I going
to have for lunch?

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.630
This is constantly on.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.952
So when I say, 7 times 7--

00:33:11.952 --> 00:33:13.200
49.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.960
OK.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.370
That is a good demonstration.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:17.740
You've passed your [? MOT, ?]
your problem-solving brain

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.750
is working even at this time.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.070
So you have to engage
your problem-solving brain

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.400
to solve a very simple
problem like that.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.816
So that's the first thing.

00:33:27.816 --> 00:33:34.330
The second aspect of the green
brain is it creates context.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.410
What do I mean by that?

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.170
There are seven
birds on a fence.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:38.890
You shoot one.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:39.640
How many are left?

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.540
OK.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.820
So the interesting thing is,
when you ask that question,

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.680
it ranges from none
to dead or alive.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.490
So there are many, many
answers to the same question.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.650
And it all depends on one thing.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.230
Even the question,
dead or alive,

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.570
begs the question-- context.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.800
What is the context?

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.179
So you change your context,
you change the problem you see.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:13.630
Change the problem you see, you
change the problem you solve.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.780
And we are infinite
context makers.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.270
The human brain, each
of us individually,

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.610
is creating context every
minute of every day.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.730
One of the challenges
is we often

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:28.440
think that, when we sit down to
have a discussion, that we're

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.780
operating from the same context.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.350
When you disagree or you
can't agree or there's tension

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:42.639
or there's an A versus B in the
room, it is never about logic.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:46.179
We make the mistake of
thinking that it's about logic,

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.639
and my logic is better
than your logic.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.510
Disagreement is
never about logic.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.320
It is always about context.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.590
But by then, it's
often gone too far.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.860
Let me demonstrate context.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.800
I've got two marbles here.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.450
Yellow marble is a dog.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:12.660
Blue marble is a car.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.580
Dog, car.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.330
Put the two together.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:23.150
It is impossible
practically not to have

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:26.440
a mental image in your
head with a dog in a car.

00:35:28.504 --> 00:35:30.920
How many of us have got a
mental image with a dog in a car

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.050
as I was describing it?

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.740
How's your dog in a car?

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.404
Describe where they are.

00:35:38.404 --> 00:35:40.750
AUDIENCE: It's sitting
down on the back seat

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.697
and watching out
from the window.

00:35:42.697 --> 00:35:45.030
IAN MCCLEAN: OK, so the dog's
in the backseat of the car

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.400
watching out from the window.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.550
OK.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.470
Anybody else with
something different?

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:53.410
AUDIENCE: I imagined the
dog getting hit by a car.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:56.520
IAN MCCLEAN: OK, so
we've got a dog lover

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.040
and a dog hater over here.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:58.912
Yeah?

00:35:58.912 --> 00:35:59.620
What have we got?

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.110
AUDIENCE: I have the car
that has a dog exterior

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.420
from "Dumb and Dumber."

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.700
IAN MCCLEAN: Yeah.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.909
I know exactly what you mean.

00:36:05.909 --> 00:36:07.491
Now, I've got that
picture in my head.

00:36:07.491 --> 00:36:08.610
It probably won't leave.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.206
AUDIENCE: I'm
thinking [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:10.206 --> 00:36:11.994
so like the front
side [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:11.994 --> 00:36:13.730
and then the back is a car.

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:14.980
IAN MCCLEAN: No.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.380
So this beautifully
illustrates the fact

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:21.060
that all you need to do is
introduce two pieces of data,

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.180
and you can't help but create
an image in your own mind.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.510
And it's different
from person to person.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.409
So that's what I mean
by creating context.

00:36:28.409 --> 00:36:30.700
So that's the second thing
that the logical brain does.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.404
Interestingly enough,
we have great capacity

00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:38.320
in this brain of ours.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.710
And depending on which
piece of research you read--

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.050
since the 1950s, it vacillates.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.900
We have the capacity
in the cognitive brain

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.510
to hold between not just
two pieces of information

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.240
like a dog in a car but
as many as between five

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.250
and seven pieces of information
we can hold simultaneously.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.920
Now, here's the question I have.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.940
If you can take six, let's
say-- we'll take the average--

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.840
data packs and you can hold them
simultaneously and you can spin

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.857
and move these and manipulate
them into any order or sequence

00:37:07.857 --> 00:37:09.940
which will create a different
picture in your mind

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.550
or your ability-- this is the
wonderful power that we have,

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.140
computing power--

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.030
how many options
or possibilities

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.359
do we have if we've
got six variables?

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.580
Who knows the maths theory?

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.540
Six variables.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:30.414
How many possibilities
or options?

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:31.330
AUDIENCE: 6 factorial?

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:33.180
IAN MCCLEAN: It is 6 factorial.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:37.155
So it's 6 times 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:37:37.155 --> 00:37:39.350
So that's exactly
how many you have.

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:42.410
You've got a total
of 720 possibilities.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.780
So we have the ability,
or the capability,

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.770
with the thinking mind
to engage with the world

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.780
and make of it with
all the data that we've

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:55.150
got that many impressions,
that many possibilities,

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:57.470
that many opportunities,
that many ways of looking

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.620
at the same thing.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.200
It's quite remarkable.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.765
That's what makes us brilliant.

00:38:01.765 --> 00:38:03.890
But what makes us more
brilliant is the final thing

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.482
in the thinking route.

00:38:05.482 --> 00:38:07.940
And this is what differentiates
us from the animal kingdom.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.820
We have this ability
to imagine a future.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.360
This is a little bit like
telling fish about water.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.950
Because we do this without even
knowing that we're doing it.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.100
But we are the only
mammal on the planet that

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.840
can meaningfully
think of a future that

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.190
doesn't exist currently,
imagine it to be the way it is

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:32.930
or isn't, work in the present,
and make decisions and spin

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.630
the marbles in creative ways
that enables us to achieve what

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.330
it is we imagined.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.850
Squirrels don't do this.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:44.870
They don't gather around
the squirrel family

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.591
and say, last year,
guys, we ran out of nuts.

00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:50.090
We're going to have to kind of
delegate it out a bit better.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:51.860
We're going to have to
create a spreadsheet.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.401
And we're going to
have to figure out

00:38:53.401 --> 00:38:55.620
how we're going to get
more nuts in so that next--

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.210
no.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.490
What they do is they
actually just go out.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:01.550
All squirrels instinctively
go out and find nuts

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:02.390
and bury them.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.580
And they just hope that
they've found and buried

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.080
enough nuts that
there's going to be

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.650
enough nuts for the
squirrel population to find.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.080
So it's a remarkable
gift that we have.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.800
And actually, isn't
this future orientation

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.180
and this future capability
the very essence

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.610
of what leadership is?

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.570
The ability to imagine something
that doesn't exist and work

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:26.440
at the present and even subsume.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.780
Because what
happens is the brain

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.380
organizes your marbles
for you, in order of--

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.850
so it sequences priority.

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:36.200
How do we sequence it?

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.670
So when the cognitive brain, or
the green brain is operating,

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:44.510
it sequences our brain and our
thinking from there to here.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.960
So it enables us to make
decisions in the present

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:53.010
and even subsume some present
desires for a better future.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.590
And for the greater good.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:57.410
And we can make that
decision in the now.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:59.580
It's what distinguishes
us from the animals.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.080
So we are not the most--

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.110
we're not the strongest
mammal on the planet.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.650
We're not the most naturally
armored or most armored

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:08.720
mammal on the planet.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.905
We're not the fastest.

00:40:09.905 --> 00:40:11.390
But we dominate the planet.

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:13.490
And it's because of
this ability to sequence

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.090
our marbles from there to here.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.320
So that's on one side.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.570
On the opposite side, we
have the feeling brain.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:28.550
And the feeling brain has got a
completely different function.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.870
The feeling brain does
not care about the future.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.580
It only cares about now.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.510
It's the older
part of the brain.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:36.880
It's the limbic system.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.330
And it's like a 24/7,
always on, surveillance

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.140
system that is designed
for one purpose only--

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.510
to keep you safe.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.950
That's all it's got to do.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.070
So you're a zebra.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.090
You're grazing in the savanna.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.190
A lion jumps out.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.440
The last thing you
want to do is begin

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.870
to engage your thinking
brain and think,

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.564
I wonder, is it a hungry
lion or is it lunchtime?

00:41:01.564 --> 00:41:03.730
I wonder maybe we could
make friends with the lions.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.320
And if we befriended the
lions, we could probably--

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:06.820
no.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.040
By then, you're already lunch.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.560
So the red brain
only wants you acting

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.740
and wants you acting
as quickly as possible.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.410
In fact, how quickly--

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.840
the red brain
reacts or activates

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.680
100 times faster than the time
it takes to think a thought.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.800
Now, we can't even
imagine how fast that is.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.130
But let me give you a
demonstration of it.

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:36.170
I recently had shoulder
surgery on this shoulder.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:38.860
And when I came
out from hospital,

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.560
I had about 40 degrees of
movement in any direction.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.210
So I could probably
do this and this.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.350
And I was at home
rehabilitating.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:51.790
And on my second day at home,
I was walking up the stairs.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.080
And guess what?

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.970
I tripped on the way up.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.350
So I'm in this situation,
and I'm going forward.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:03.739
Before I had any chance to do
anything, guess what happened?

00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:06.280
Now, I don't know if you've ever
had shoulder surgery and two

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.280
days later-- and you had
40 degrees of movement.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.690
But you can probably imagine
what the pain was like.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:11.874
But it didn't matter.

00:42:11.874 --> 00:42:13.540
Because whatever pain
I was experiencing

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.890
in the future was
nothing compared

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:16.556
to what I would've
done if I had crashed

00:42:16.556 --> 00:42:19.490
my head against the
stairs on the way up.

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:23.724
So what had happened was the red
brain had simply taken control.

00:42:23.724 --> 00:42:25.390
So if you imagine,
it's like the cockpit

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.760
to go back to the aircraft.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.620
You've got a pilot
and a copilot.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.170
The green brain is like--

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.820
one of them has
got the controls.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:37.060
Most of the time, the green
brain has got the control.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.370
But occasionally, when
the need is there,

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.780
the red brain takes over.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.690
It just moves in like a flash,
takes over the controls,

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:46.624
and makes decisions on your
behalf to keep you safe.

00:42:46.624 --> 00:42:48.790
Why do you think it's 100
times faster than the time

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:49.956
it takes to think a thought?

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:53.490
Survival.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:55.220
It's the older brain.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.150
It's the preservation
of the species.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.650
So the interesting
aspect about this

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:04.075
is that it also has an impact.

00:43:04.075 --> 00:43:06.075
So your marbles have
sequence from there to here

00:43:06.075 --> 00:43:07.300
and normally.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:11.026
But guess what happens when
it takes over the controls?

00:43:11.026 --> 00:43:12.400
Have you ever been
in a situation

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.800
where you were in a
meeting, somebody puts you

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.150
on the spot, like asked
you what 7 times 7

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.740
is in front of your peers
and that sort of thing,

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:23.200
and you're not expecting
it, and all of a sudden you

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.270
mentally freeze?

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.220
And something that
you-- you just freeze.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:27.850
You can't.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:29.650
You give you your best answer.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:31.316
You come up with the
best thing that you

00:43:31.316 --> 00:43:33.220
can think of on the spot.

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.720
You go off.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.809
20 minutes later, guess what?

00:43:37.809 --> 00:43:39.850
You think of all the things
you should have done,

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.183
should have said, should have,
should have, should have,

00:43:42.183 --> 00:43:42.760
should have.

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.551
And as Ken Blanchard
says, all of a sudden,

00:43:44.551 --> 00:43:47.930
you should all over yourself.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:51.579
But you only
afterwards realize it,

00:43:51.579 --> 00:43:52.870
because something has happened.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.432
And something has
happened in here.

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:57.640
So what is happening here
is that the red brain takes

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.740
the controls, and guess
what it does first?

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.320
It resequence is
your marbles for you.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.150
And it does it very quickly.

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:07.420
Fast enough for you not to
hit your head on the stairs

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.560
on the way up.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.120
So now, instead of a
there-to-here sequence,

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.140
there's a
here-to-there sequence.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.056
And the red brain
or the red marble,

00:44:16.056 --> 00:44:17.680
which is the here
and now, and survival

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.840
becomes the very first thing.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.340
The interesting
thing about survival

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:27.340
is that 21st century threats
no longer are in the savanna.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.470
The 21st century
threats that we have

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.540
in Google and in
our organizations

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.900
and in our families are
now represented in the team

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:38.050
meetings and are
represented in the project

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.680
and are represented at home,
around the family table,

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.990
or between ourselves and some
other sibling, or whomever it

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:46.190
happens to be.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.970
And now, when it
kicks in, what we

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.940
do is, in order to
keep ourselves safe,

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.890
the red brain is
taking controls.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.260
We have to, in that
moment, make a decision

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.932
as to, how do I stay
safe in this environment?

00:44:58.932 --> 00:45:00.640
What have I got to do
to get out of this?

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.800
What have I got to
do not to lose face?

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.600
What have I got to do not to
take responsibility for this?

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.800
By the way, it gets better.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.160
So we got our six marbles.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:16.630
If this lasts or persists this
state for about 20 seconds

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:20.500
or more, what ends up
happening is a chemical,

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:23.170
cortisol, gets released
into the brain, which

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:29.090
literally burns working memory.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.320
So it literally burns off
your capability to think

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.570
and the range of what
you're capable of.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:35.860
And it narrows it down.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.110
So I've now just
lost three marbles.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.600
I've gone from six
marbles to three.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.900
I've lost half of
my working memory--

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.650
three marbles.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.640
It's a trick question.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.681
It's not even a question.

00:45:48.681 --> 00:45:50.550
But it's a trick statement.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.690
Because I've gone from 6,
which is 720 possibilities,

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:54.660
3 marbles.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.750
What are my possibilities now?

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:57.590
6.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:59.250
It's 3 factorial.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.440
I've literally gone
from 6 marbles,

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.440
720 possibilities, down to 6.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.520
And the 6 now are so clear.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.440
Have you ever been
in this situation

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.800
where you were sitting at your
desk and an email comes in

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.840
and you go, that's the
fourth time this week.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.564
I've got to do
something about this.

00:46:16.564 --> 00:46:17.480
And you start to type.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.080
You start to compose that email.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.810
And as you start to compose it,
you get stronger and stronger.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.269
You get clearer and clearer.

00:46:23.269 --> 00:46:24.060
You're a wordsmith.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.830
You should be a poet laureate.

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:29.400
All of a sudden, I should
have done this weeks ago.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.850
And the kind of
energy surge that

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.850
goes in through there--
and you get to the point

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.027
where you want to hit Send.

00:46:34.027 --> 00:46:35.610
And what does it
feel like when you're

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.052
about to hit that Send button?

00:46:37.052 --> 00:46:39.510
You just hit Send, and you feel
like you've just taken down

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:46.860
the woolly mammoth, until 20
minutes later when somebody

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.690
walks in with a
copy of the email

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:51.419
that you just CC'd to
everybody and says,

00:46:51.419 --> 00:46:52.710
did you really send this, mate?

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.330
By which time, the other marbles
that had fallen on the floor

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:01.060
have come back in.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.780
And you now have a
perspective that you

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.780
didn't have at that moment.

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:11.130
Any of us here, have got
kids or access to kids?

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:12.880
Because I know, Caroline,
you're going off

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.170
to play with your borrowed
kids for the weekend.

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:21.160
Well-- and seen them
lose their marbles?

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.150
Because if we've seen
them lose their marbles,

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.090
we have a situation
where, let's say,

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:28.256
we've got somebody
who's five years old.

00:47:28.256 --> 00:47:29.380
They've lost their marbles.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.120
They're all over the floor.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.190
And we, as parents, have a
strategy for dealing with this.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:35.836
Now, if you're a
five-year-old kid

00:47:35.836 --> 00:47:37.210
and you've just
lost your marbles

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:38.860
and you're down to
six options, you've

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.680
only got three left,
what is my ability

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:46.150
as a five-year-old to have
reasonable conversation in this

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.810
moment?

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:49.800
Very little.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.630
So what do we do
as good parents?

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:56.940
Well-intentioned,
we reason with them.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.689
At what point do we realize that
reasoning isn't going to work?

00:48:00.689 --> 00:48:02.730
Well, normally, at the
point where they literally

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:05.490
drop one more marble.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:09.180
And then they race off to their
room and they slam the door.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.370
Because they've only
got two choices.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:12.300
That's all they got.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.716
Because they feel
more threatened.

00:48:13.716 --> 00:48:15.969
So they lose another marble.

00:48:15.969 --> 00:48:17.510
And we're just kids
with longer legs.

00:48:20.144 --> 00:48:21.060
We think we're adults.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.268
We think we're sophisticated.

00:48:22.268 --> 00:48:24.684
But inside of us, there's
that five-year-old kid.

00:48:24.684 --> 00:48:26.100
And the red brain
is the red brain

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.840
is the red brain when
it comes to that.

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:34.590
Now, I say all that to say that,
in most civil organizations,

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:41.220
what tends to happen is people
don't lose three marbles.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.110
It's pretty destructive.

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.910
People comport
themselves in ways--

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:48.720
but it is fairly regular that
people might lose one marble.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.330
What's the impact of
losing one marble?

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:53.380
The impact of losing
one marble is--

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.340
first of all, when the red
brain's resequenced the marbles

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:59.160
from here to there, what's
the marble on the end that

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.130
is going to go first?

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:02.410
It's the green marble.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.170
It's the future-oriented one.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.600
So now, we've got
a situation where--

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.690
I'm in a situation where the
least important element is

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:11.850
the future outcome of what
we're about to do here.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.920
The most important
element is what

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.724
I need to do to defend myself.

00:49:15.724 --> 00:49:18.390
And when I say, lose one marble,
one very simple example of what

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:21.300
that would look like would
be, you know the phone rings

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.770
and you pick it up?

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.960
And it's that number.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.810
It's just that caller ID
number that's on there.

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:30.450
That's enough for you just
to trigger and just lose

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.830
one model.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:35.070
Now, you're going to
prepare yourself differently

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:36.780
for that call, for
that conversation,

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.550
for that interaction
than you would do.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:43.920
Because you've just lost
the future-oriented marble.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.110
Interestingly enough,
if you lose one marble,

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:49.830
you go from 720
options to how many?

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:51.120
You go to 120.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:55.260
You've just lost 600 options.

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:58.020
And they're the ones that
are most future oriented.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.140
As somebody who has had to
lead and develop a business,

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.360
it's very critical
that, if we're

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.640
going to hire the best
and the brightest--

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.117
and the lengths
that you go to here

00:50:07.117 --> 00:50:08.700
in Google and many
other organizations

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.840
to find, hire, and recruit
the best and the brightest,

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:18.656
we do that and they perform
in their 720-marble state.

00:50:18.656 --> 00:50:22.320
But what happens when
people are under pressure?

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.050
Because it's only then that
you really begin to see how

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.100
people perform and
work under pressure.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.840
And we have lots of
evidence of high flyers,

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.540
high potentials, very
talented people, very

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:37.470
gifted people who
around the organization

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.912
are just walking around
pulling pins out of grenades

00:50:39.912 --> 00:50:41.370
and leaving the
grenade in the room

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:45.519
and walking right out there and
causing devastation around them

00:50:45.519 --> 00:50:47.310
without even knowing
that they're doing it.

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.400
Simple hint.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.050
If you're down to 120, one way
to help yourself and understand

00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.790
and self-diagnose-- and
this is very helpful for me.

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.560
How do you know
you've lost a marble?

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.650
As soon as you find yourself
mentally moving into what

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:07.950
we call binary thinking--

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:09.190
it's either you or me.

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:10.830
It's either them or us.

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:12.420
It's either yes or no.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.770
It's either black or white.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.380
It's either-- as soon as
you find yourself moving

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:20.250
into a state where it
becomes binary, rest assured,

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:23.850
you are now in a
chemically induced state.

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.770
It's not a great
time to be making

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.710
decisions, which is why good
negotiators at that level

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:31.020
will always take breaks,
and lots of them,

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.670
to walk out to cool off
for that 20-minute period

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:36.570
so that they have got the
perspective of the 720

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:38.080
possibilities and
the 720 options.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:46.220
Leadership reputations get made
or broken in these moments.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:52.405
Marriages get made or
broken in these moments.

00:51:52.405 --> 00:51:57.160
So that's the short science.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.440
Let's do the short
version of the cards.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.530
So what we've done
is, Blair and I

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:05.920
is, we've endeavored to create a
system to codify this operating

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.770
system that will enable
us, first of all,

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:11.920
not to create situations
where we're triggering,

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.430
losing marbles, and we become
suboptimal in our ability

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:18.220
to make decisions, make choices.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.690
And also how do we
stay on the green line?

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:23.870
How do we avoid going
onto the red line?

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.180
So we're going to start off.

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.930
And I'm going to spend most of
the time in the remaining time

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:29.880
that we have-- oh.

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:36.110
OK.

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:38.030
We're a little short on time.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.780
How many of us have
to leave at 3 o'clock.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:40.905
That's going to determine--

00:52:40.905 --> 00:52:41.750
OK.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:44.470
So the very most of us.

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:50.250
OK, in that case, I'm going to
show you a five-minute video.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:53.020
And I'm going to ask you
to have a look at the video

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.740
through the lens of the
red cards if that's OK.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:59.120
So these are the cards.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.120
They're pretty self-explanatory.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.550
And the five-minute video
that we're going to watch

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:05.770
is a conversation between
two people, A and B,

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:09.320
who got two different
views of the same thing.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.880
And they've got to
resolve a situation where

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.820
Barry, who manages Lisa
in a technical function,

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:19.610
she wants to apply for a
role which will promote her.

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:22.637
But it involves managing
people for the first time.

00:53:22.637 --> 00:53:24.220
He doesn't believe
she's ready for it.

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.590
She believes she's already
demonstrated a capability

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:27.970
and that she is ready for it.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:30.792
And they're in to have
a discussion around it.

00:53:30.792 --> 00:53:33.250
We're simply going to observe
it through the lens of Barry.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:36.659
So if you watch the
cards played by Barry--

00:53:36.659 --> 00:53:38.200
and maybe the impact
that it's having

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.690
on Lisa on the other side
in terms of marble retention

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:42.250
or marble loss.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:45.640
And once that's done, then
we'll just wrap it all up.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.480
OK, so this is
the purpose of it.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.980
So I'm going to flip
through the introductions.

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.140
And we'll just get
straight onto the cards.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.660
So cards at the ready.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.760
I'm not saying that all
of the cards appear.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.950
And some of them might
appear more than once.

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:02.245
Let's see what you can see.

00:54:02.245 --> 00:54:02.911
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:54:02.911 --> 00:54:03.760
- Hello, Lisa.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.497
- Hello, Barry.

00:54:04.497 --> 00:54:05.080
- How are you?

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:05.710
- I'm well.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:06.320
And you?

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.900
- Good.

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.060
So you applied for a promotion.

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.710
Where are you at
with the application?

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:14.620
- Oh, well I haven't
actually filled it in yet.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.440
I wanted to come to you
first and get your advice.

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.350
- How ready do you think
that you are for this step?

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:22.240
- Oh, I'm definitely ready.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.930
I mean, I think I've proven
myself in my current role.

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:28.900
And I think I'll make a
good manager, actually,

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.420
if I'm given the opportunity.

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.460
I am a key contributor.

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:34.455
You say so yourself.

00:54:34.455 --> 00:54:35.080
- Yes, you are.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.038
It goes without saying.

00:54:36.038 --> 00:54:39.090
You're a great asset
to this organization.

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:42.560
But how do you think that you
would cope with the greater

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.535
responsibilities?

00:54:44.535 --> 00:54:45.410
- Oh, well, I would--

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:48.530
- It's a big step when you
move into people management.

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.170
I remember when I
was promoted myself.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:52.700
I found it a big challenge.

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.110
There's a lot to take on.

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:57.890
And you're managing people.

00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:58.830
You're coaching.

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.371
You're giving feedback.

00:55:00.371 --> 00:55:01.370
You're doing appraisals.

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.200
It's a lot, you know?

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.460
And it takes a while
to get it right.

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.620
And you have a lot of
experience and a lot

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:13.770
of management potential.

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.045
Are you sure you're ready?

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:16.550
- Well, I think so.

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:17.810
Yes.

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:19.870
I mean, I've seen
a lot of people

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.350
with a lot less
experience and expertise

00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:23.470
get promoted in the past.

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:26.610
And they seem to
be doing just fine.

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:30.330
I think I'll make a
good manager actually.

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:32.090
I'm looking forward
to the challenge.

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:35.909
And I'm already the one people
come to when there are issues.

00:55:35.909 --> 00:55:38.450
And I'm often the one who has
to point out issues before they

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:39.590
impact the business.

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:43.220
And I think, with a
greater scope of influence,

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:47.600
I could influence the system
instead of just helping people

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.929
work around the inadequacies.

00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:51.470
- Well, do you not think that
there are a few things that you

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.750
need to work on first?

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.130
- Oh, well, yeah.

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:57.020
I'm sure there are.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:57.850
Such as?

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:02.540
- Well, for example,
your communication style.

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.490
How do you think
you come across?

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:07.070
- I'm not really sure
what you mean, Barry.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.890
I am a key contributor
on this team.

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:11.360
I'm the go-to person.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.880
I mean, I'm always willing
to help and give advice.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.540
And I try to help them out
the best way that I can.

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.280
- Our last team
meeting, Kathleen

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.290
wanted to make a suggestion
about a potential change

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:23.390
to the report.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:25.790
Do you remember how
you spoke to her?

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:26.960
- No.

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.510
- Well, you were
very condescending,

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:33.410
and you made her feel and
look like a bit of a fool.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:34.740
Are you aware of that?

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.080
- Oh, come on, Barry.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.392
Her idea, it was
impossible, and you know it.

00:56:39.392 --> 00:56:41.600
I mean, she clearly doesn't
know how the system works

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.760
or she wouldn't
have suggested it.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.620
I said what needed to be said.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.270
And she got the
message, didn't she?

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:50.450
I mean, what do
you want me to say?

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:54.240
Be quiet, say nothing, and
let the business suffer?

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:54.910
- No, no.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:55.430
Not at all.

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:58.070
Look, I just think that you
are very direct with people.

00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:02.420
And that is not a style that
suits people management.

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:06.410
Look, I just think
that, at this moment,

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:09.211
your leadership style suits
more to an autonomous role.

00:57:09.211 --> 00:57:10.460
Would you not agree with that?

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.110
- No, I don't.

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:13.340
I want this promotion, Barry.

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.070
I think I deserve it.

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.090
But you obviously don't.

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:17.619
- No, no.

00:57:17.619 --> 00:57:18.410
Don't get me wrong.

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:21.685
Look, Lisa, I think
you're a fantastic worker.

00:57:21.685 --> 00:57:23.000
You're a top contributor.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.370
I just-- I want to support
you in achieving your goal--

00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:29.227
- Frankly, Barry, it
doesn't sound like it.

00:57:29.227 --> 00:57:30.810
- I just don't think
that you're ready

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:34.030
for this, not at this moment.

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.910
- Lisa, you asked
me for my advice.

00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:38.710
I'm giving it to you.

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:41.771
And I think that we can work on
developing your people skills.

00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:43.270
But in the meantime,
maybe something

00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:45.760
comes up that doesn't
involve people management.

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.660
- You know, I'm fed
up waiting, Barry.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.720
I want this promotion.

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:53.480
And I think I'm more than
capable of managing people,

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:54.530
actually.

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:58.550
- Look, if you really want to
move into people management,

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:00.800
we can do a development plan.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.680
I'll look into some courses
that may be available.

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.747
And we can start there.

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:05.580
How does that sound?

00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:06.500
- Yeah, that's fine.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.010
Thanks.

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:08.650
- OK.

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:10.100
Look, why don't
we meet in, what?

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.810
Say, two weeks?

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.310
In the meantime, I can look
into what courses are available.

00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:15.940
And I'll email you the link.

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.060
You can have a look at those.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.792
We can have a chat about then.

00:58:19.792 --> 00:58:20.730
How's that sound?

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.160
- Yeah, that's great.

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:22.700
OK.

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:24.410
- Good.

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:25.548
- Thanks, Barry.

00:58:25.548 --> 00:58:28.540
[END PLAYBACK]

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.130
IAN MCCLEAN: When facts
doesn't really mean facts.

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:33.316
Could you see the
red cards at play?

00:58:33.316 --> 00:58:34.274
How many did you count?

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:39.220
Four?

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.940
Any advance on four?

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:41.960
AUDIENCE: Seven.

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:42.290
IAN MCCLEAN: Seven.

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:43.539
OK, somebody got the full set.

00:58:43.539 --> 00:58:45.280
It's like bingo.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.600
Any recidivists?

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:50.500
Any kind of repeat offenders?

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.352
Which ones?

00:58:51.352 --> 00:58:52.810
AUDIENCE: Asking
leading questions.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:53.470
IAN MCCLEAN: Yes, yes.

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:55.678
Very often, it's a master
class in leading questions.

00:58:55.678 --> 00:58:56.650
That's for sure.

00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:58.360
OK, so the interesting
thing about it--

00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.590
we talked about
operating systems--

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:01.215
and this is where
I'm going to finish--

00:59:01.215 --> 00:59:03.100
is that we all have a
basic operating system.

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.056
We use it.

00:59:04.056 --> 00:59:05.680
But we judge ourselves
by the intention

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.980
that we have, not the impact
that it has on the other side.

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:11.500
We either have an effective
operating system, or we don't.

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.060
These seven red
cards are the ones

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:15.130
that are most likely
to actually create

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:16.540
the impact on the other side.

00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:19.600
Because what's the
impact on the other side?

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.360
Not very good.

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.769
And in rating it, when you
look at that conversation,

00:59:24.769 --> 00:59:27.310
if you had to give it a rating
in terms of its effectiveness,

00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:28.726
how would you rate
it here looking

00:59:28.726 --> 00:59:30.604
at it through your
own lens neutrally?

00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:35.430
2 or 3?

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:37.420
2's-- 3's is this
what I'm hearing.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:38.080
OK.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:41.254
Barry, now, on the other hand,
goes to his management meeting.

00:59:41.254 --> 00:59:42.420
And he sits down with Aiden.

00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:45.580
And Aiden says, I know you had a
difficult conversation to have.

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.850
How is he rating it?

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:50.410
7 or an 8.

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:52.360
I gave her the feedback.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:53.610
I gave her the example.

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:54.236
We got a plan.

00:59:54.236 --> 00:59:55.360
We're meeting in two weeks.

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.930
I think I got away with it.

00:59:57.930 --> 00:59:58.836
Right?

00:59:58.836 --> 01:00:00.700
A 7 or an 8.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:04.180
Meanwhile, Lisa, whilst
tidying out her desk--

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.820
Caroline inquires
and says, well, she's

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.740
putting her effects into a box.

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.860
How did it go?

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.380
And she's rating it a what?

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:11.889
A 1.

01:00:11.889 --> 01:00:13.930
Well, it's definitely
lower than we're rating it.

01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:17.770
So now, you've got three
versions of the truth, right?

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:21.220
And there's only one
that is legal tender.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.750
And that's Lisa's.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.270
But the sadder thing about
it is, is that not only

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:28.570
is the impact on Lisa a
sad part of this equation,

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:30.600
but it's the
implication that there

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.350
are Barrys walking
around the organization

01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:34.058
pulling pins out of
grenades and thinking

01:00:34.058 --> 01:00:35.980
they're doing a great
job because they

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.480
don't have an operating system.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.870
And he's not a bad guy.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:40.900
He's doing the best
with what he has

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.970
to get a result in a
difficult situation.

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:46.740
And this is as good as he's got.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:51.290
So guys, apologies for
running 4 minutes and 28, 29,

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:53.020
30 seconds over.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.030
Because I normally
castigate people

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.080
for running over on
my side of the fence.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.450
So mea culpa for that.

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:00.171
Thank you very much
for the invitation.

01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:01.420
Caroline, thank you very much.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.770
[APPLAUSE]
