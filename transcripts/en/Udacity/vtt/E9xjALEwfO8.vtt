00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.890
In the developer console,
when you create a billing account,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.410
there are a number of steps
that you need to go through.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.993
The first is to name the account.

00:00:06.993 --> 00:00:09.071
And then later on when you're
creating your project,

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:11.068
you'll pick the billing
account based on its name.

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:13.368
Then you have to specify the country for
the account and

00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:15.110
where the account resides.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.190
Payer details are going to
be linked to this country.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.560
So be sure to pick the right one.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.280
Then you just pick the account type.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.390
You might be paying as a business or
you might be paying as an individual.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.280
You just pick which one.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.290
Next comes the payer details.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.124
And that's just the name and
address of the payer.

00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:33.050
And then finally there's
the payment type.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.220
And this is going to be a credit card or
bank details.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.850
And depending on which one you pick,
you have to configure it.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.730
It's as simple as that.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.230
Once you've filled out this form with
all of these details and submit it,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.830
it will take a few moments.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.260
But then billing will be available and
you'll be able to create a project and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.200
select the billing profile
that you've just set up.
