00:00:00.397 --> 00:00:02.844
Voiceover:Fuel is being
pumped into a storage tank.

00:00:02.844 --> 00:00:05.851
The volume, V, of the fuel in the tank

00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:08.824
depends on the depth, d,
according to the formula.

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:12.099
V of d is equal to four
times three d squared

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.792
plus five to the third power,

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:16.073
where d is in measured in meters.

00:00:16.073 --> 00:00:18.996
Suppose that the depth, d, of the fuel

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:22.029
depends on time measured in hours

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.560
according to the formula.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.882
d of t is equal to one over
the square root of three

00:00:25.882 --> 00:00:28.068
times the square root of t minus five.

00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:29.680
That makes sense, that if I'm filling,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.216
if I'm pumping something
into a storage tank

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:35.340
the depth of what I'm filling,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.410
of the fuel I guess is what I'm filling

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.945
is going to depend on time

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:41.989
and then the volume could
be dependent on the depth.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.687
Use function composition
to write the volume

00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:48.679
of the fuel of the tank
as a function of time.

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.270
Simplify your answer as much as possible.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.167
Let me get my scratch pad out,

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:55.187
so I've already written
what they told us here.

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:57.083
This is volume as a function of depth

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:59.477
and now this is depth
as a function of time.

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:02.230
If we want volume as a function of time,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.192
what we really want to
do is figure out what is,

00:01:05.192 --> 00:01:09.799
so we could take V of d

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.029
where we could take V of d of t.

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:19.691
Now this would give me
volume as a function of time.

00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:21.221
Everywhere where I see a d,

00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:24.963
I should replace it with this description

00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:27.911
of how does d vary with respect to time.

00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:28.890
Let's do that.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.708
V of d of t is going to be equal to

00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:36.665
four times three, times d squared.

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:38.460
Instead of writing d squared,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.211
I'm going to write all
of this business squared,

00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:45.732
so one over square root of three,

00:01:45.732 --> 00:01:49.160
times the square root of t minus five,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.658
all of that squared plus five

00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:57.658
to the third power.

00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:00.628
I really hope this simplifies
in a reasonable way.

00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:02.736
Let's see, let me actually
copy and paste this

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:04.968
so I can have a little
bit more real estate.

00:02:07.352 --> 00:02:09.830
Let me just paste it down
here so I could work it out.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.295
All right, so then we get
this is going to be equal to,

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:15.860
this is going to be equal to,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.669
let's see if we square
this right over here

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.261
and I could do it all in.

00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:21.665
This is going to be four times three,

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:27.174
times this whole thing squared.

00:02:27.174 --> 00:02:28.621
One over square root of three squared

00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:31.177
is going to be 1/3

00:02:31.177 --> 00:02:33.433
and then square root
of t minus five squared

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:36.772
is going to be t minus five

00:02:36.772 --> 00:02:42.733
and then of course we have
plus five to the third power.

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:45.137
Let's see three times 1/3,

00:02:45.137 --> 00:02:47.358
well that's just going to be equal to one.

00:02:47.358 --> 00:02:49.350
We are left with,

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.697
this is equal to four times t minus five

00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:58.075
plus five, this does simplify nicely.

00:02:58.075 --> 00:02:59.486
Plus five,

00:02:59.486 --> 00:03:04.852
we're going to be left with four times t

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:08.860
to the third power.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:13.172
Let's input that into our V of t

00:03:13.172 --> 00:03:14.649
and let me just make it clear.

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.679
This is now V, this is giving our volume

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.200
as a function of time.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.497
We can now say that this is V of t.

00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:26.913
V of t is four t squared.

00:03:26.913 --> 00:03:29.361
Once again this is the
volume as a function of time.

00:03:29.361 --> 00:03:31.535
You give me a time, I'll
tell you what the volume is.

00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:33.602
Four t to the third.

00:03:33.602 --> 00:03:36.482
Four t to the third power.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.967
V of t, did I say four t squared?

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:40.371
I don't know, sometimes
I do strange things.

00:03:40.371 --> 00:03:45.022
I said four t to the third power,

00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:46.519
I did format it correctly

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.591
and then there's a second
part to this question.

00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:51.092
How many cubic meters
of fuel are in the tank

00:03:51.092 --> 00:03:52.318
after two hours?

00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:54.015
Round your answer to the nearest 10th.

00:03:54.015 --> 00:03:57.277
Well two hours, that means t is equal two.

00:03:57.277 --> 00:03:59.225
They say t is measured in hours.

00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:00.953
When t is equal to two,

00:04:00.953 --> 00:04:06.099
the volume is going to be two
to the third power is eight.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.399
Eight times four is 32.

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:13.544
Let's check our answer
and we got it right.
