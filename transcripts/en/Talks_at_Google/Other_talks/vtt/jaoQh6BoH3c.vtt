MALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, everybody,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.390
to one more Talks
at Google session,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.980
today with Joseph Henrich.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.430
The book we're
talking about today

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.810
is "The Secrets of Our
Success-- How Culture

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.790
Is Driving Human Evolution,
Domesticating Our Species,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.640
and Making Us Smarter."

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.200
Joseph Henrich is professor
of human evolutionary biology

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.700
at Harvard University.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.110
He also holds the
Canada Research Chair

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.080
in Culture, Cognition,
and Co-evolution

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.290
at the University of
British Columbia, where

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.000
he's a professor in the
departments of psychology

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.250
and economics.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.270
He's the co-author of
"Why Humans Cooperate"

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.400
and the co-editor
of "Experimenting

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.690
with Social Norms."

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.541
Please join me in welcoming
Joseph Henrich to Google.

00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:49.822
JOSEPH HENRICH: Thanks.

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:51.480
Thanks, Boris.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.170
It's good to be
with you all today.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.670
All right.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.050
So I want to begin by
introducing you to a puzzle,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.720
and the puzzle
has to do with how

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.100
it was that our species became
so ecologically successful.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.300
So long before the agriculture
or the first cities

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.010
or, especially, industrial
technology, humans

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.600
expanded out of Africa
about 100,000 years ago,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.890
parallel to the coast here.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.680
Ended up in Australia by 60,000,
50,000 years ago, into Europe

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.040
by 40,000 years ago,
eventually into the New World,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.010
and then down to the
tip of Tierra del Fuego

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.860
by about 16,000 years ago.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830
This is all before the
origins of agriculture,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.780
which begins to emerge
around 12,000 years ago.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.030
While spreading across the
globe, this species of primate

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.930
entered a vast
diversity of habitats.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.100
So, arid deserts in Australia.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.390
The malarial swamps
in Melanesia.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.740
Actually got to island
Vanuatu by 40,000 years ago.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.610
Arctic tundra in
Siberia and Canada.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.430
And then, of course, down all
the way to Tierra del Fuego.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.340
Now what's interesting
about our species

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.880
compared to other ecologically
successful species

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.870
is that we have few
environment-specific genetic

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.580
adaptations.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.670
As a species, we're relatively
genetically homogeneous,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.550
especially given the
number of diversity

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.130
of environments we live in.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.740
But now if you compare this
to other species-- so say

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.590
we took the most successful
invertebrate species.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.670
This would be ants.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.190
So ants have covered the earth.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.330
They control a massive
amount of biomass.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.530
But they've done so by
speciating into over 14,000

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.670
different species, and
they have agriculture,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.274
and they have classes.

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:23.940
But they've done it
in a different way--

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.530
through genetic adaptation.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.630
So the question is,
how do we do it?

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.305
Now I take the
common explanation

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:32.439
to be kind of obvious, and
this kind of a dumb question.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.980
We're intelligent,
so I want to begin

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.920
by trying to convince you that
the secret of human success

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.710
is not our intelligence--
that we have a process that

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.820
makes us smart, that gives
rise to our intelligence.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.180
So I want to start with
dipping into the files

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.280
that I call lost
European explorer files.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.530
And these are cases
in which explorers

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.710
got trapped in environments
where hunter-gatherers

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.870
routinely live in,
and we get to see

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.330
if they can survive with their
big brains and ample hubris.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.002
So the case I want to point out
is the Burke and Wills case.

00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:05.460
So if you're from
Australia, you've

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.010
definitely heard
of Burke and Wills,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.500
the first Europeans to go across
the interior of Australia.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.120
So they started
here in Melbourne,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.640
and they go up to the
Gulf of Carpentaria.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.989
Now this was an expedition
launched for both exploration--

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.530
we want to find out what's in
the interior of the continent--

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.640
but also the possibility
of running a telegraph

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.430
cable from there to there.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.070
It was extremely well-funded.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.060
So they even imported
camels from India

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.910
because they thought they
would be good in the desert.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.450
Now crucially, a bit of
information about Australia-- I

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.402
mentioned it was colonized
60,000 years ago, so it

00:03:41.402 --> 00:03:42.610
was full of hunter-gatherers.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.210
So no agriculture had
ever emerged in there

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.400
until the Europeans arrived.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.330
So there's two
different expeditions.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.930
One group of four men takes
off from Cooper's Creek

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.890
to make the run.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.830
Another resupply group is going
to meet them in Cooper's Creek.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.870
These guys take 12 weeks of
food, and they head up there.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.680
Now they don't
actually see the Gulf,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.370
but they kind of
smelled the salt air,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.399
found some briny water,
and declared victory

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.190
because that was eight
weeks into the trip.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.648
So if you're doing
the subtraction,

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:09.500
they've only got four
weeks of food left.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.350
Things start going
poorly, and then they

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.720
start-- they run out of food.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.220
They have to eat
their pack animals.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.329
They're having trouble finding
food, going very slowly.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.814
These guys are waiting
for them, and the deadline

00:04:19.814 --> 00:04:21.730
comes when they have to
leave, and they're not

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.896
supposed to stay any longer.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.634
They decide to
wait another month,

00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:26.050
and still these
guys don't arrive,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.840
so they leave early one morning.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.000
Later that same
morning, Burke and Wills

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.072
come in with one other guy.

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:33.780
They lost one guy
along the way who died,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.250
so they have three guys now.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.152
They decide they just
missed these guys.

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:39.110
And they're not going to
be able to catch them,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.460
so the leader Burke
decides their best chance

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.520
is to head for a police station,
a police station and ranch

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.846
at a place prophetically
called Mount Hopeless.

00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:50.720
So these guys start
following Cooper's Creek,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.570
and that's going pretty well.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.049
Oh, so I should
mention that they

00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:56.715
were able to resupply
at Cooper's Creek,

00:04:56.715 --> 00:04:59.090
so they have a little resupply.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.630
They're going along
Cooper's Creek,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.490
and they end up getting trapped
because their last camel dies

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.645
in the mud, and there's
a stretch of desert

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:08.270
that they need to cross in order
to get to the ranch and police

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.956
post.

00:05:08.956 --> 00:05:10.080
So they can't make the run.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.110
So they're sort of marooned
along Cooper's Creek

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.910
for their lack of ability
to find water in the desert.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.570
Now they're struggling
to catch fish or hunt,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.770
but they find they're
able to possibly survive,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.780
and things are looking hopeful
because they get gifts of fish

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.364
from the local aboriginals,
the Yandruwandha tribe.

00:05:26.364 --> 00:05:28.030
And when they're in
a Yandruwandha camp,

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.320
they noticed them
making nardoo cakes.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.750
So the nardoo cakes
are this sporocarp.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.250
So you gather up
these sporocarps,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.360
and the women were
grinding them.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.840
So Burke and Wills
headed out, and they

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.110
managed to find some
of these, and they

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.530
ground them and they ate them.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.500
So it seemed like
they were going

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.666
to do well because they
were getting enough calories

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:45.630
and they're getting
these gifts of fish.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.010
But when they were in the
camp, what they didn't notice

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.781
is that the women actually used
a sophisticated processing.

00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:54.280
So they grind them, leech them,
heat them, and then only eat

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.113
with a mussel shell.

00:05:55.113 --> 00:05:57.090
You can't let an
organic substrate-- yes.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.090
AUDIENCE: What year,
roughly, or decade is this?

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.881
JOSEPH HENRICH: Oh.

00:05:59.881 --> 00:06:00.920
1860 1860.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.940
Should have said that.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.680
Or they grind them, leech
them, and bake them in ash--

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.920
because if you don't do
that, nardoo turns out

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.530
to be toxic and indigestible.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.570
In particular, it has an
enzyme called thiaminase, which

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.010
depletes the B1 in your system.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.630
You eventually get a horrible
disease called beriberi.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.962
So William Wills, a good
Victorian of his time,

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:22.420
was actually writing
in his journal

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.830
as he experienced
these symptoms.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.740
And so you can actually
read it online.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.270
It's quite amazing.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.940
So Burke and Wills
eventually die.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.190
They basically poison
themselves and starve to death

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.050
at the same time.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.020
The third member of their
group, King, wanders,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.420
delirious, off into the bush but
is rescued by the Yandruwandha

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.730
and eventually gets rescued by
a team that came from Melbourne.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.230
OK.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.390
So what this and
many other tales

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.060
like it tell us is that
despite months actually

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.634
in the outback with supplies
in order to prepare,

00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:53.050
these guys couldn't
figure out how

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.360
to survive as hunter-gatherers.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.880
They couldn't figure
out how to survive

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.590
in the environments
in which we evolved,

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.670
in which humans have
lived in for 60,000 years.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.422
So no specialized
mental models fired up.

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:05.130
No instincts models
gave them the ability

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.460
to figure out what
they needed to know.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.900
And no general intelligence
helped them figure it out.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.602
And they couldn't find water
or identify edible plants.

00:07:11.602 --> 00:07:14.060
Now you might think, well, that
would be pretty hard to do.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.140
No animal could do it-- except
some of their camels escaped,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.540
and now the interior
of Australia

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.280
is full of feral
camels, because camels

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.640
have-- they can smell
water from a mile away,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.220
and they have innate
taste and sense

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.574
cues which allow them to eat
the right plants for them.

00:07:27.574 --> 00:07:29.490
And so even in a completely
novel environment,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.294
they can find the right
plants, but humans can't.

00:07:32.294 --> 00:07:34.710
One important thing that Burke
and Wills didn't know about

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.543
was something that
Australians commonly use.

00:07:36.543 --> 00:07:39.050
This is a plant called spinifex,
and if you break these off

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.950
and you smash them, you get
these little crystals off

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.400
of it.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.899
Then you can heat
them, and it makes

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:45.490
a resin that is as strong
as cement once it hardens

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.620
but soft and pliable
when it's heated.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.740
So that's really useful
for making tools.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.240
OK.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.940
So they couldn't hunt or
actively make spears or make

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.570
fishing hooks, but
this is something

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.544
any local adolescent could do.

00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:01.460
So you can ask the
question, what was missing?

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.350
What they were missing
is what the adolescent

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.960
gets, which is this
download of a vast body

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.560
of cumulative
cultural information

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.220
that has built up
non-genetically

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.020
in this whole system of cultural
inheritance over generations.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.130
So they didn't get that,
so they can;t survive.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.855
So this is something that
really makes humans different,

00:08:17.855 --> 00:08:19.980
and it's going to be the
main thing I'm going to be

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.650
emphasizing as I go along here.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.650
But I want to come to
this intelligence question

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.810
from a different angle.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.200
So this is an experiment done
by Esther Hermann and Mike

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.940
Tomasello at the Institute
for Evolutionary Anthropology

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.070
in Leipzig.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.350
And what these guys did
was they put this series

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.070
of different primate
species-- so you've

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.690
got your three
primate competitors--

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.240
into a series of
18 cognitive test

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.550
to see how well they
did on the tests.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.762
It's actually a
picture of my son Josh.

00:08:46.762 --> 00:08:48.470
He's a representative
2 and 1/2 year old.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.095
So it's the three primates, and
the humans are represented only

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:52.830
by 2 and 1/2 year olds.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.660
We'll come back to that.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.530
So if you break the 18 tests
down into different categories,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.280
there's tests about
how you can understand

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.250
space, how you understand
quantities, causality,

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.260
including tool use
here, and your ability

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.990
to do social learning,
to observe someone

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.210
doing a demonstration
and then take advantage

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.910
of that demonstration.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.910
And you can see
how well they did.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.300
So the humans here--
you know, the humans

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.402
are doing about as well
as the chimpanzees here.

00:09:19.402 --> 00:09:21.211
No different in quantities.

00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:23.460
The orangs are doing a little
bit worse in each place,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.080
in causality about the same.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.570
And then the big difference
is really social learning.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.940
And this finding is
actually deceptive

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.170
because they had trouble
finding a test where

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.130
the two-year-olds
weren't at ceiling

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.390
and the apes weren't at floor.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.806
So they finally
found a test where

00:09:37.806 --> 00:09:42.050
the apes could do it sometimes
and the humans didn't get 100%.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.792
So this doesn't give
you the usual picture

00:09:44.792 --> 00:09:46.000
of humans being much smarter.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.780
So, for example, in
the tool use test,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.970
the chimps actually
out-compete the humans.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.730
So the chimps are
better at tool use

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.810
compared to 2 and 1/2 year olds.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.040
Now--

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.480
AUDIENCE: Sir, what was
the age of the primates?

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.950
JOSEPH HENRICH: The primates
actually vary in age.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.110
So there were infants-- so
chimpanzee infants go up

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.060
to age 5, and then
juveniles and then adults.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.320
So this included infants
and adult chimps.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.607
Same thing with the orangs.

00:10:12.607 --> 00:10:14.440
Now what's interesting
about that-- and this

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.740
is a point I was going to come
to in a second-- with humans,

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.396
this guy's going to get much
smarter as he gets older,

00:10:21.396 --> 00:10:23.520
and he's going to get much
better until by the time

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.530
he's an adult, he
could smash these guys

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.600
and get 100% on all the tests.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.350
These guys don't get
better as they get older.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.490
In fact, the five-year-olds
and the four-year-olds

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.254
are just as good as
the 25-year-olds,

00:10:35.254 --> 00:10:37.420
so they don't get better
in the cognitive abilities,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.250
and that's going to
be part of our story.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.000
Question?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.440
AUDIENCE: What is
the rationality

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.704
behind studying human kids?

00:10:43.704 --> 00:10:44.620
JOSEPH HENRICH: Right.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.960
So, great question.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.920
So why not put them
up against the adults?

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.760
And part of the reason
is Mike Tomasello

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.550
and his collaborators
want to see what

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.840
an uneducated
human that has less

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.420
of the cultural download that
he's going to eventually get.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.570
So the idea is to minimize
the cultural input,

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.570
and you'll see why that's
important in a second.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.044
Because we know the adults
could beat the apes here.

00:11:05.044 --> 00:11:06.960
So the question is, how
do the kids look like,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.890
and what's the age trajectory?

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.220
So I think I'm going to
eventually get to your question

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.109
more directly.

00:11:14.109 --> 00:11:16.400
In the book, you'll see that
there's other experiments.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.070
So for example, you
can take the chimps

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.840
and compare them
to undergraduates--

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.220
and it doesn't matter what
country they're from--

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.807
and compare them
on working memory.

00:11:24.807 --> 00:11:26.890
And the chimps are faster
at working memory tests,

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.223
so they have faster processing
speeds, and at least some

00:11:29.223 --> 00:11:31.740
of the chimps can tie or even
beat the humans in the working

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.950
memory tasks.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.420
And tests of
strategic thinking--

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.840
so there's a game in economics
called the matching pennies

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.869
game, and it
requires you to play

00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:41.160
what's called a mixed strategy.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.830
So you play a certain strategy
some percentage of the time

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.202
depending on the payoffs.

00:11:45.202 --> 00:11:46.410
And chimps are great at that.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.451
They zoom right in on what
the economists predict

00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:49.636
is the Nash equilibrium.

00:11:49.636 --> 00:11:51.760
The humans systematically
miss it and can't hit it.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.051
They seem to have some strange
biases that prevent them

00:11:54.051 --> 00:11:55.156
from getting there.

00:11:55.156 --> 00:11:56.780
So at least on these
counts, it doesn't

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.759
look like humans are
obviously endowed

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.550
with some innate
brainpower that gives them

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.450
a big advantage on the apes
except in this domain, where

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.440
they really crush the apes.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:06.940
OK.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.180
So this is the point
about the age effect.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.239
Why do humans get smarter?

00:12:11.239 --> 00:12:12.780
AUDIENCE: Could you
just clarify what

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.590
you mean by social learning?

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:15.580
JOSEPH HENRICH: Sure.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.038
So I'll tell you
what the task was.

00:12:17.038 --> 00:12:19.510
So the task was you had some
hard-to-figure-out problem

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.250
or you had to get some
food out of a tube.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.760
All these tasks are
incentivized by food.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.350
All three species like snacks.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.750
So you got to see a demonstrator
use a tool to push the food out

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.430
or get the food out
in some other way,

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.669
and then you see if the
other, the observer,

00:12:35.669 --> 00:12:37.960
will use that technique or
is able to get the food out.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.030
OK.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.051
So to head off-- because there's
kind of an obvious problem

00:12:45.051 --> 00:12:45.550
here.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.540
We know that humans
are much smarter, so

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.010
how do you explain that?

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.930
So part of the
answer for sure is

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.550
that we culturally inherit
pre-built solutions

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.570
to lots of problems.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.420
So it's the software,
not the hardware.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.250
So just to give you a
sense, if you grow up

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.780
in a world with screws,
springs, levers, and pulleys,

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.410
those things are
easy to figure out

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.060
and then reapply if
they already exist.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.101
But they're actually--
each one is hard to invent

00:13:07.101 --> 00:13:09.590
and emerges at different
points in human history.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.600
My favorite example
is the wheel concept.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.300
So if you look at Gary
Larson cartoons or something,

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.060
it'll look like cavemen
are doing wheels,

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.110
but the wheel is actually
invented relatively late

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.250
in human history.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.990
So, 6,000 years ago.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.910
It's only invented in
Eurasia, so it's never

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.560
invented Australia
or the Pacific

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.112
or anywhere in the New World--
except some Mayan toys seem

00:13:30.112 --> 00:13:31.570
to have wheels,
but they didn't put

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:36.650
it to use, letting their dogs,
for example, pull these carts.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:37.870
Elastically stored energy.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.940
So you can make spring
traps and bows and arrows

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.700
by storing energy in
bendy things and things

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.370
with elasticity.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.730
That's not invented in the
continent of Australia,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.742
and neither is compressed air.

00:13:48.742 --> 00:13:50.200
But once you have
these things, you

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.117
can then reapply them
in different ways.

00:13:52.117 --> 00:13:53.450
Let me give you another example.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.900
So you all, by virtue
of learning English,

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.810
are endowed with a
system that allows

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.300
you to count without bounds.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.810
So you can differentiate
27 from 28.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.610
It's packaged into these
nice packets of 10.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.420
But lots of societies
that anthropologists

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.361
have studied count
1, 2, 3, many.

00:14:09.361 --> 00:14:10.860
And then in New
Guinea, you can find

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.984
a whole range of societies.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:16.340
Some count to 27, to 34,
to 12, and then they stop.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.440
So if you have this
counting system

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.630
and you have to
distinguish 37 from 38,

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.640
it's hard because you don't have
any way to mark those, at least

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.580
linguistically.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.450
There are sort of techniques
to get around the problem,

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.590
but they're not
nearly as efficient

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.400
as having a good
numbering system, which

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.570
we know evolved over
cultural evolutionary time.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.580
And I'll give you
one final example.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.910
So English, like lots
of modern languages,

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.450
is endowed with three separate
spatial coordinate systems

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.846
for referring to and, it turns
out, thinking about space.

00:14:42.846 --> 00:14:44.470
So one is north,
south, east, and west.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.010
So that's the absolute
coordinate system,

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.250
and you could say
hey, I'll meet you

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.405
on the north side of the house.

00:14:48.405 --> 00:14:50.155
And if we both know
the coordinate system,

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:52.210
we can both meet on the
north side of the house.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.918
There's an ego-centered
coordinate system

00:14:53.918 --> 00:14:56.320
with its front,
back, left, right.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.190
And you can attach that
to a house and say,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.200
I'll meet you in
front of the house.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.690
And people have a sense of
what the front of the house is.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.440
There's also a relative
coordinate system.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.024
So this is where you could draw
yourself a line between myself

00:15:06.024 --> 00:15:07.856
and the books, and I
could say I'll meet you

00:15:07.856 --> 00:15:09.106
on the left side of the books.

00:15:09.106 --> 00:15:11.022
And then we would have
a sense of where to go,

00:15:11.022 --> 00:15:13.300
and that comes from this
line between the books and I.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.110
But lots of languages only
have one or two of these,

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.734
so they don't have
right and left

00:15:17.734 --> 00:15:20.150
or front and back, so they
have no ego-centered and no way

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.520
to say the relative
right to left.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.630
So if you had to set the
table, you'd have to say,

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.430
put the fork at the
north end of the table.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.880
And then you'd have to have a
different rule for every room.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.540
So this is a spatial
coordinate system

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.990
which helps us, gives us new
tools for thinking and doing

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.489
things.

00:15:33.489 --> 00:15:36.230
Driving on the left would
be impossible in populations

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.500
that only have absolute
coordinate systems-- north,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.131
south, east, and west.

00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:40.630
All right.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.130
So that's just some
of the examples

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:46.030
that we get for free by this
cultural inheritance that

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.570
helps us solve more
and more problems.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.310
So the key, the
secret of our success,

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.810
is not our intelligence but our
cultural abilities, the fact

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:56.000
that because we're such
powerful social learners,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.935
we can accumulate ideas,
beliefs, values, heuristics,

00:15:58.935 --> 00:16:01.400
bodies of know-how,
bits of our language.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.380
And these accumulate over
time, and they form what

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.464
we call cultural adaptations.

00:16:06.464 --> 00:16:08.130
I'll give you lots
of examples of these,

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.910
but these are packages
of these ideas, beliefs,

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.340
and values that
help people solve

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.020
different kinds of problems,
and it's cultural inherited.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.236
The key to these--
and so this is a very

00:16:17.236 --> 00:16:18.610
mathematical
enterprise, so there

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.677
are lots of models of
cultural evolution.

00:16:20.677 --> 00:16:22.510
You can assume different
amounts of fidelity

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.640
of cultural transmission,
and you can assume

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.996
different amounts of sociality.

00:16:25.996 --> 00:16:27.870
And you can show that
you get different rates

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.420
of cultural accumulation, and
you get different equilibria.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.180
So the amount of
cultural accumulation,

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.500
how sophisticated
your technology gets,

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.290
actually depends on
these two things.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:38.790
OK.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.450
And once you have this, it
gives rise to collective brains.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.580
So how good a society is at
developing new technologies,

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.192
new ways of solving problems,
new institutions, how

00:16:50.192 --> 00:16:51.650
fancy their language
is, the number

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.010
of words in your language
depends on the size

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.490
of your collective brain.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.290
So, the interconnectedness
between people

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.240
and the flow of information.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.670
Now the next step is
that this is important,

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.930
but then it turns out to
have been important for much

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.270
of our species evolution.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.819
So this actually drove
our genetic evolution,

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.140
and we have the interaction
between two kinds

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.252
of inheritance systems, genetic
and cultural inheritance.

00:17:15.252 --> 00:17:17.210
So one of the problems
why I think-- well, it's

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.369
kind a little bit of sociology--
but why this idea has taken

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:23.730
a while to take
hold and influence

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.800
human evolutionary
biology-- yes.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.720
AUDIENCE: The
previous slide-- that

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.040
sociality was very important.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.780
If that's true, then why do
we have so many introverts?

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.750
Why didn't we then select
for more extroverted people

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.760
that are going to have more
social interaction with others?

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.270
JOSEPH HENRICH: Well,
compared to lots of species,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.450
we're actually quite extroverted
and quite willing to engage

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.759
with people from other groups.

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:47.800
So I'll give you example.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.852
When two different
chimpanzee groups meet,

00:17:51.852 --> 00:17:53.460
if the two groups
are equal size,

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.535
they're going to start
hooting and hollering

00:17:54.535 --> 00:17:56.382
and gradually back
away from each other.

00:17:56.382 --> 00:17:58.340
If one group is much
bigger than another group,

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.990
they're going to try
to kill the other guys.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.490
So you have very
hostile relations

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.573
between chimpanzee groups.

00:18:02.573 --> 00:18:04.720
But humans live in these--
at least traditionally,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.240
humans live in
tribal groups which

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.440
have all kinds of
relationships between groups,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.600
and when you meet someone
from another group,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.300
you begin to figure out
what your connections are,

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.820
what your social
connections are.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.779
So, I mean, maybe we're
not as outgoing, as

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:20.070
friendly as we could be, but
we're certainly a long way

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.770
from other primate species.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.800
One of the reasons why I
think we've had trouble

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.220
getting this idea, why this
idea didn't get traction

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.250
before recently,
is because there

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:33.197
is this sense in which there
are cultural explanations

00:18:33.197 --> 00:18:34.780
for behavior, the
kinds that you might

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.830
get from social psychology
or from anthropology,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.440
and then genetic or evolutionary
explanations, the kinds you

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.020
might get from biology
or sociobiology.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.692
But what this approach
does is it says,

00:18:44.692 --> 00:18:46.400
let's take the logic
of natural selection

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.850
that has helped us explain
so much of the natural world

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.760
and apply it to understanding
culture and cultural evolution.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.630
So, how should natural
selection have shaped our minds

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.229
to make us better learners?

00:18:57.229 --> 00:18:58.770
And so you think
about the capacities

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.130
for cultural learning,
and then these--

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.629
once you have
something that you can

00:19:01.629 --> 00:19:05.380
make an assumption or an
empirically grounded assumption

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.980
about psychologically,
you can then

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.460
build models of
cultural evolution.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.820
So if everybody is using a
set of learning strategies,

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.730
they interact.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.950
Where does that process go?

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:16.740
And then finally, the gene
culture co-evolutionary point

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.670
is that this is going to feed
back and get this loop here,

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.471
which I'll say more
about a minute.

00:19:22.471 --> 00:19:22.970
OK.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.428
Now I want to give
you a little bit

00:19:24.428 --> 00:19:27.240
of a sense of how we can use
the logic of natural selection

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.250
to think about learning.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.220
And so you can say, how might
natural selection shaped

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.540
our brains, and what kinds
of content should we look at?

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.670
So should we be
interested in knowledge

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.500
about plants and animals,
about sex, about fire?

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.900
Things like that.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.910
Or you can say, who should
we pay attention to?

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.720
We have this whole
world full of people we

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.390
could attend to and learn from.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.250
Who is most likely to have
information useful to me

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.021
later in my life or now?

00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:54.270
And then finally, how do I
integrate that information?

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.410
So he's doing one thing.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.493
She's doing another thing.

00:19:56.493 --> 00:19:57.650
He's doing a third thing.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.400
How can I balance
that information?

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.780
So this is the approach
we take, and these

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.010
are mathematical models of
genes and culture co-evolution.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.877
So just some sense-- there's
now quite a bit of evidence

00:20:09.877 --> 00:20:11.460
that children and
adults pay attention

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.000
to cues of success or skill.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.900
So if someone's more
successful or better,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.080
if someone's better
at playing golf

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.260
if you care about
golf or shooting

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.830
arrows if you're
a hunter-gatherer,

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.300
then you preferentially attend
to them and learn from them.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.640
Cues of success actually
integrate more things.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.040
So in hunter-gatherer
groups, you

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.720
can look at the guy who
brings back the most big prey.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.190
Doesn't say exactly
how he did it,

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.814
but you know he's
doing something right

00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:35.960
if he's able to consistently
bring back the most big prey.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.290
Cues of prestige are kind
of a second-order effect.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.070
So if everybody is
doing this, and they're

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.810
trying to figure out-- who
should I pay attention to

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:42.960
in my social group?

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.870
Then you can step
back and look at who

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.380
others are paying attention to.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.580
So who's being deferred
to in conversation?

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.440
Who are people tending to watch?

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.090
Who do people say
nice things about?

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.400
And those are cues of
prestige or deference.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.140
And that helps a
learner, in combination

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.890
with these other cues, zoom in
on people most likely to have

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:02.590
good information for them.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.510
Age seems to be
an important cue.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.410
So for young children,
this can be valuable

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.640
because a young child has
to scaffold up their skills.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.990
So they might-- if you're
a five-year-old in a hunter

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.406
gatherer community, you might
know who the best hunter is.

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:17.690
He's probably about 38
or 40, but his skills

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.150
are way too advanced for you
as a five-year-old to get to.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.500
So you can look at the
best seven-year-old,

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.520
and then when
you're seven you can

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.930
look at the best nine-year-old.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:27.240
So you can self-scaffold
your skills up that way.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.560
Another interesting way in which
you can pry information out

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.630
of this system is to
look at older people.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.770
So in lots of societies, not
everybody gets to be old,

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.310
so by the time you have people
who are 60, 70 years old

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.700
in a small-scale society,
natural selection has taken

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.080
out a bunch of other people.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.780
So if you get to be
60 or 70, there's

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.940
informational content in the
fact you've got to be that old.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.940
And then finally,
self-similarity cues.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.940
So if the sexual division
of labor is at all old,

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.200
and lots of paleoanthropologists
think it is,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.630
then males should tend to
focus in and learn from males,

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.630
and females should tend
to focus in and learn

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.110
from other females.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.840
Same thing with
dialect and ethnicity.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.490
So in order to get
the right norms

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.364
for the people you're
most likely to interact

00:22:10.364 --> 00:22:12.920
with later in life, it seems
our psychology, at a young age,

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.990
causes us to key in on those who
speak a language like our own

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.850
and preferentially both interact
with them and imitate them.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.940
So these cues-- there's
now ample evidence

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.210
that this is relevant for
lots of different domains.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.480
There's differing
degrees of evidence

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.020
for all these
domains-- but really

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.070
basic things like
food preferences.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.027
So if you want to get your child
to like a certain food that he

00:22:32.027 --> 00:22:34.110
or she doesn't like, you
should put him at a table

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.532
with same-sex kids who
are slightly older.

00:22:36.532 --> 00:22:38.490
And they also have to
like the food that you're

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.985
trying to get the kid to like.

00:22:39.985 --> 00:22:41.360
So there's good
experimental work

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.814
on that showing that they'll
shift their preferences.

00:22:44.814 --> 00:22:47.230
What people like in mates can
be affected by these things.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.530
Economic strategies.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.580
Suicide actually spreads
through these things,

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.620
so when a celebrity
commits suicide,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.810
people will copy method.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.268
And you can predict
that it's going

00:22:55.268 --> 00:22:57.820
to be people who match
them on sex and ethnicity,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.630
statistically speaking.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.520
And motivations for
fairness and punishment

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.060
also can be
transmitted this way.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:05.572
OK.

00:23:05.572 --> 00:23:07.030
Now what this says--
you can't see.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.779
It's blocked here.

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:10.170
But these things these
appear to be adaptations.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.470
So they reliably develop.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.960
We see them in children
as young as one.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.160
They operate automatically.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.618
People don't know
they're doing it,

00:23:16.618 --> 00:23:19.250
and they can often
remain unconscious.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.140
So there are adaptations,
mental adaptations

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.530
for cultural learning.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.750
Now once you have those--
and individuals interact.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.920
So, say, generation
after generation, you're

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.590
copying those who are most
successful and healthy

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.716
and have all those cues.

00:23:30.716 --> 00:23:32.590
You're going to eventually
be able to produce

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.185
cultural adaptations without
anybody knowing about it.

00:23:36.185 --> 00:23:37.310
Let me give you an example.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.610
So two biologists
studied the patterns

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:42.392
of spicing around the earth.

00:23:42.392 --> 00:23:43.850
And other animals
don't use spices,

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.700
so this is kind
of a funny thing.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.390
You don't get any
nutrition from spices,

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.520
and there's no caloric
content to spices

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.807
and nothing significant.

00:23:52.807 --> 00:23:54.390
And the other thing
is, when you begin

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.440
to look at the active
ingredients in spices,

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.230
they've often evolved
to keep mammals away.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:04.017
So natural selection has favored
capsicum in chili peppers

00:24:04.017 --> 00:24:05.850
in order to prevent
mammals from eating them

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.550
because they want
to be eaten by birds

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.090
because birds do
better dispersal.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.050
So the chemicals
in this actually

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.920
taps right into some
of our pain systems

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.680
and causes us to feel pain.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.960
The thing with humans is we
can see someone experience

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.522
pain-- I mean, see someone
eat a chili pepper--

00:24:21.522 --> 00:24:23.980
and they're going to experience
what would be pain for most

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.890
animals, but if they
seem to like it,

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.530
we can learn to like it.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.780
So we seem to be able to
overcome our innate aversion.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.550
So chimps won't
eat chili peppers,

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.090
and babies don't
like chili peppers.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.680
This is why they recommend
to nursing mothers

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.555
not to eat too many
chili peppers, because it

00:24:36.555 --> 00:24:40.670
gets into the milk, and the
baby might not like the milk.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.280
But these spices seem to be--
they are used in the hottest

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.670
climates, and they
seem to be chemically

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.570
active against pathogens.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.410
So if you use the
spices typically

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.170
found in traditional
recipes-- they're

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.890
typically meat
recipes-- they actually

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.010
reduce the load of
pathogens in the meat.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.740
They're effective
against pathogens.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.440
So they're kind of a
pathogen reduction system.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.220
And correlations
across the globe-- you

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.850
don't find people in
Norway using many spices.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.360
The Inuit don't use many spices.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.790
But when you go
into the tropics,

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.123
there's lots and lots of spices.

00:25:12.123 --> 00:25:13.850
They tend to be the
spices most effective

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.280
at suppressing
pathogens, traditionally.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.460
Another one is corn.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.930
So when the Europeans
arrived in the Americas,

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:26.180
there were many populations
dependent on corn, maize.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.940
And the thing about maize is
if you become dependent on it,

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:35.010
it actually-- you can't get
enough niacin from maize

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.220
unless you do something very
odd and non-intuitive to it,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.880
which is to mix in an alkali.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.420
So you can put burnt
seashells into it.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.910
You can shovel ash out of
your fire into the corn mix.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.576
And then what that
does is it chemically

00:25:47.576 --> 00:25:49.970
breaks open the niacin,
and then you can get to it,

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.220
and you don't get a terrible
disease called pellagra.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.287
Now we have a natural
experiment that shows us

00:25:56.287 --> 00:25:57.620
that this is hard to figure out.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.494
So all these different
Native American groups

00:25:59.494 --> 00:26:02.300
had figured out various
versions of this trick,

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.940
but when the Europeans took
it, it comes over to Europe,

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.670
and it becomes a staple food
in many poor populations.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.260
And there were
epidemics of pellagra

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.370
that went on for centuries
until-- actually,

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.330
the guy who figured out was
Joseph Goldwater, an American.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.750
But it took him
years to convince

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:16.970
the medical establishment.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.560
They all thought
it was a pathogen.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.340
And then finally, I've
done this work in Fiji,

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.130
and there are these
food taboos against

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.980
particular marine species when
women are pregnant or nursing.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.730
And when you begin to
look at the species,

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.712
you find that they're all
ones high in Ciguatera toxin.

00:26:33.712 --> 00:26:35.920
So if you've spent any time
in the tropics living off

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.920
reef fish, this is some
you've got to watch out.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.980
Don't eat the moray eel.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.530
And there's a number of
other species-- barracuda--

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.630
who are potentially
high in Ciguatera toxin.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.950
So this is a case where
there's a bunch of taboos,

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.200
which-- people don't
know why they have them.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.230
They just know-- pregnant?

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.850
Breastfeeding?

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.010
Don't eat these fish.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:51.110
The taboos kick in.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.170
And the taboo seem
to be effective.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:54.860
Women during those
periods don't have

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.210
any kind of fish poisoning.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.680
So these are adaptations
that evolve unconsciously

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.660
over generations that
people didn't figure out

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.490
or have any causal model for.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.290
And the book is full
of lots of these.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:07.180
OK.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.410
Now once you begin to--
once you accept that

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.190
and you begin to study it, you
come to the collective brain

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.160
idea, which is that larger
and more interconnected

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.100
populations will generate
more rapid cultural evolution,

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.950
and the equilibrium of how
fancy their tools, technologies,

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.580
and practices can get is higher.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.940
It also means that if suddenly
a population is cut off,

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.760
they will begin
to lose know-how.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.880
So you've got to maintain
that size in order

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.617
to keep your
adaptive complexity.

00:27:33.617 --> 00:27:35.450
So let me show you a
little bit of evidence.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:38.920
So this is research done by
Michelle Klein and Rob Boyd.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.180
And it's hard to study
continental populations

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.830
because technologies and
ideas can move fluidly,

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.540
and it's not clear
what a population is.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.840
How do you kind of isolate that?

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.340
But in the Pacific, it's easier
because you have islands.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.548
Now of course, these islands
aren't all disconnected.

00:27:52.548 --> 00:27:55.230
There was movement between them
and people moving between them.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.680
But it at least gives you a way
to encapsulate a population,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.740
and then you can measure the
amount of interconnectedness.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.921
So they measured how
fancy the tools were

00:28:03.921 --> 00:28:05.670
in these different
islands in the Pacific,

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.620
and they went back
to-- you know,

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.970
this the ethnography
from the first arrivals,

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.230
from the missionaries
and the anthropologists

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.930
and the early
explorers, on how fancy

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.720
the fish-getting or the marine
foraging technology was.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.502
And they used a simple method.

00:28:19.502 --> 00:28:21.960
Nobody's ever really completely
satisfied with this method,

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.990
but you take each tool,
and you break it down

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.770
into a bunch of component parts.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.550
So each tool gets a measure
called techno units.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.520
It's the number of
parts in the took.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.110
OK.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.047
So these are the population
sizes of the different islands,

00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:36.630
and the islands are
represented there,

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.140
and that's the number of tools.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.290
So you can see the
larger the population,

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.680
the more tools they have.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.310
And the larger the
population, the higher

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.560
the number of average
techno units per-- so

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.330
there's more tools and
more complicated tools.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.990
Now the high and low contact
is whether the islands were

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:54.970
sort of isolated for
long periods of time

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:56.790
or whether they
had routine trade

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.470
contact with other islands.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.457
And contact has an independent
effect on populations.

00:29:02.457 --> 00:29:04.040
So you can look at
this graph, and you

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.550
can see that the high
contact islands tend

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.630
to be above the regression
line I've shown here,

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.860
and the low contact
tend to be below.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.730
It's 10 data points, so
it's not that big a sample.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.291
All right.

00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:17.790
OK.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.320
So that is consistent
although there's

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.395
lots of things that could be
affecting those technologies.

00:29:21.395 --> 00:29:23.228
These guys did a whole
bunch of regressions.

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:25.280
They included all kinds
of ecological variables.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.490
In general, it seems to hold up.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.323
But of course, you only
have 10 data points,

00:29:28.323 --> 00:29:30.974
so you have to put the other
variables in one at a time.

00:29:30.974 --> 00:29:33.865
But my grad student, Michael
[INAUDIBLE] Christian and I--

00:29:33.865 --> 00:29:35.670
we wanted to see if we
could replicate this

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.320
idea in the laboratory.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.370
So this is with
100 undergraduates

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.187
at the University
of British Columbia.

00:29:42.187 --> 00:29:44.520
And students come into the
lab, and what they have to do

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.030
is they're given a complex
image editing program,

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.410
and they're told they have
to replicate this image.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.700
And the closer they get to
this image, the more money

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.408
we will pay them.

00:29:52.408 --> 00:29:53.610
So they're paid in cash.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.680
They have a time limit.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.924
And for everybody
but the first--

00:29:57.924 --> 00:29:59.840
so there's going to be
a bunch of generations.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.090
So there's going to be a
bunch of guys that come in.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:01.906
They do this once.

00:30:01.906 --> 00:30:04.280
And then another group comes
in, and they get information

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.800
from the previous generation,
and then they get to do it.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.216
And they can pass information
down to the next generation.

00:30:09.216 --> 00:30:10.690
We do this for 10 generations.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.732
And either you can only
access one other person--

00:30:12.732 --> 00:30:14.898
one person came before you,
and you learn from them.

00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:16.070
Pass to that guy, that guy.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.690
Or you can look at all five.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.530
So you're this guy,
but you can check out

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.790
what all these guys did.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.470
And then 10 generations.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.650
So that's the "one
or five" models.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.970
So after you do it, then you can
write up information and pass

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.540
it down to your students, so
you get two pages of things

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.930
to pass down.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:35.870
So your student gets
your product-- so,

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.070
whatever image you made.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.700
They also get this,
so they get to know

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.350
what you're trying to get to.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.641
And they get your write up.

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:45.390
So then we can take
each image-- and we've

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.660
done this a number
of different ways--

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.510
but you can get a
measure of similarity

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.010
between whatever the person
made and this target image.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.600
So you get a score.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.380
So, 10 generations.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.770
You can see in the
"one" model treament--

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.030
that's the blue-- those guys
never really go anywhere.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.130
They just kind of bounce around.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.190
They had a really good
first round, actually,

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.360
but then things bounce around.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.962
And these guys start
off slow there,

00:31:07.962 --> 00:31:09.420
but then they just
take off, right?

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.170
And so they end up with
much higher, much more--

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.740
they're producing
images much closer

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.799
to the target image
over 10 generations.

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:18.840
People are randomly assigned
to treatment groups,

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.756
so we know there's no
intelligence difference,

00:31:20.756 --> 00:31:22.750
but something about the
informational dynamics

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.242
let these guys do a lot better.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.410
It's also clear
from other analyses

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:32.280
that each learner is recombining
ideas from the other learners.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.460
So this allows people to
come up with innovations

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.150
without invention, because
they are recombining ideas

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.092
from other learners.

00:31:39.092 --> 00:31:40.550
This is kind of a
fun thing to look

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.065
at because you get to see a
big chunk of the data here.

00:31:43.065 --> 00:31:45.440
So this is the "one" model
treatment and the "five" model

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.320
treatment.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.879
This is each generation.

00:31:47.879 --> 00:31:50.420
So you can see the "one"-- this
first generation of the "one"

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.150
models did pretty well.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.210
Those things look
moderately like that.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.240
These guys did terrible.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:55.920
I don't know.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.710
Some people didn't
even turn in answers.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.987
But then things awry here
on the next generation,

00:32:00.987 --> 00:32:03.320
and these guys aren't really
going anywhere here at all.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.374
But then things click in.

00:32:04.374 --> 00:32:06.290
You get this guy, and
then you get these guys,

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.914
and then things are rolling, and
these guys are chugging along.

00:32:08.914 --> 00:32:12.780
By the time you get to the end
here, the worst one in round 10

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.860
is better than
the best guy here.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.550
And that's just all
informational dynamics.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.490
OK.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.330
Let me give you the
case of the polar Inuit.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.010
So I mentioned earlier
one of the things

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.940
about the collective
brain is the possibility

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:31.200
that you can lose information.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.220
So we have kind of a
natural experiment.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.800
So these are the northernmost
group of hunter-gatherers

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.870
in the world, the polar Inuit.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:41.640
And two explorers, Elisha
Kane and Isaac Hayes,

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:48.370
winters with them in
the 1850s and-- 1863.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:50.932
And they lacked many of the
technologies, the fancy tools,

00:32:50.932 --> 00:32:52.390
that Inuit typically
have that have

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.910
been recorded by so many other
explorers an anthropologists.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.940
So Inuit houses typically
have a long entrance.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.800
It's a heat system.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.520
You keep the heat
outside by trapping it--

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.330
to the snow houses.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.100
They don't have that.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.641
They lack the bow
and arrow, which is

00:33:05.641 --> 00:33:07.180
necessary for hunting caribou.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.390
Inuit typically have
complex compound bows.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.310
And the fishing leister, which
is these three-prong fishing

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.860
spears.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.970
So when you spear a fish,
you need the prongs.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.292
Otherwise, the fish will
just slide right off.

00:33:19.292 --> 00:33:21.000
So they lacked all
three of those things.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And crucially,
they lacked kayaks.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.970
So they lost the
ability to make kayaks.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.882
Things were going
wrong, so they were

00:33:26.882 --> 00:33:28.590
limited on what they
could hunt and fish,

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.730
and their populations
were declining.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.600
Now crucially, John
Ross, another explorer,

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.330
had been there in the
1820s, and he records them

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:38.780
as having all these things.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.910
So sometime between
1820 and 1850, 1860,

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:46.730
they lost all of
these technologies.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.720
Now later, a Norwegian named
Knud Rasmussen figured out

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.450
the puzzle here.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.630
It turned out that after
Ross had been there,

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.510
there had been some
whalers visiting,

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.470
and this initiated
a plague which

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.140
took out the most senior
members of the community.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.620
So with them died
their knowledge.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.550
So this means the information--
the community took a quick hit

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.520
from the plague, but
then it was never

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:16.320
able to be regenerated by
the people in the community.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.900
He meets this guy--
Rasmussen meets this guy--

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.449
and he tells him the
story about how they came

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:24.620
to have the technology again.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.120
Because by the time
Knud's there in 1900,

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.190
they have all the
technology back.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.319
So after the plague, they
weren't able to regenerate,

00:34:32.319 --> 00:34:33.860
and then this guy
is traveling north.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.739
He's a Baffin Island Inuit.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:39.380
And they encountered him, and
he had his group teach them

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.620
all the stuff they'd lost.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.996
So they were able
to get it back.

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:43.495
In some sense, you
can think of them

00:34:43.495 --> 00:34:45.530
as being reconnected to
the collective brain.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.212
And that they-- in part
because they lost kayaks.

00:34:48.212 --> 00:34:50.170
So they couldn't go to
other groups and get it.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:54.190
They sort of became marooned
in that part of Greenland.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.790
And there's good
circumstantial evidence

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.240
to believe this account is true.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.150
So they were hunting again
with their bows and arrows,

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.520
and they were using
kayaks for the seals.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.020
The population
decline had reversed,

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.560
and it was increasing.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.040
And their kayaks that they used
resembled the Baffin Island

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.532
type and not the one typical
of western Greenland.

00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:18.990
So you can see that
it was actually

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:22.210
him that taught it because
he came from Baffin Island.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:23.844
Now eventually, in
the next 50 years,

00:35:23.844 --> 00:35:25.760
their kayaks revert back
to Western Greenland,

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.593
but that's because
they've been reconnected.

00:35:27.593 --> 00:35:30.684
So now they're more connected
to the rest of the Greenlanders.

00:35:30.684 --> 00:35:32.600
The next thing, the next
point I want to make,

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.710
is-- so there's all
this important--

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.220
these cultural adaptations
and on this accumulation

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.020
of know-how, but
this has actually

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.400
affected our genetic evolution.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.500
So in the book, I spent
time trying to figure out

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.530
when the process of cumulative
cultural evolution got started,

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.946
and I think there's good reason
to believe it started over

00:35:46.946 --> 00:35:47.900
a million years ago.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.420
So the way to think about this
is once our genetic evolution

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.090
gives us enough
cultural capacities

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.610
to get cumulative cultural
evolution, you create

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.570
an autocatalytic process.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.315
So cultural evolution
produces a few tools

00:35:59.315 --> 00:36:01.690
that are better than individuals
could make on their own.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:04.420
You get fire and cooking and
some tracking information

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.130
and food.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.670
And then you're a learner,
and you can either

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.370
try to figure this
stuff out for yourself,

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.700
or if you're good
enough learners,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.200
you can learn it from the other
members of your community.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.800
And so that's going
to favor brains

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.290
that are better at
doing cultural learning,

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.526
at acquiring and organizing
all of this information.

00:36:19.526 --> 00:36:20.900
Then once you have
bigger brains,

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.140
you're going to increase
the size of this pool.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.650
So you get this
interactive effect

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.699
where no matter how
big your brain gets,

00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:28.990
you're going to have more
valuable cultural information

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.010
that, if you can't
learn it and acquire it,

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:32.280
you're going to lose.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.200
Now this process of
course eventually hits

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.490
the stops because of
the primate body plan.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.330
The canal where the
baby has to come through

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.060
can only get so big,
and so natural selection

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.924
has shaped us so that our
babies are born premature.

00:36:46.924 --> 00:36:48.340
Their heads kind
of squish up when

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.506
they come through the canal.

00:36:49.506 --> 00:36:51.910
Other primates don't
have this problem.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:54.660
And in fact, our babies
are born about a trimester

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.210
too early because the woman's
body has to get the baby out

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:58.594
before its head gets too big.

00:36:58.594 --> 00:37:00.010
So this has kind
of hit the stops,

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.062
but of course this problem
continues to spiral.

00:37:02.062 --> 00:37:04.270
And we soon we have a division
of labor between males

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.270
and females and then other
kinds of division of labor,

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.860
external storage systems,
etc. as that information

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.710
continues to expand.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:13.600
OK.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.202
Now at the same time, it's
creating a general pressure

00:37:16.202 --> 00:37:18.410
for brains that are capable
of organizing and storing

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:19.120
this information.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.450
It's also creating specific
genetic adaptations.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.890
So these are genetic
adaptations that we

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:26.210
have that are driven
by cultural evolution.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.830
So let me start off
with some physiological

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.290
and anatomical examples.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.310
Fire and cooking.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.150
So my colleague Richard
Wrangham at Harvard

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.570
has analyzed our
digestive tract.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.120
So our teeth are small.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.210
We have stomachs that are
too small for a primate

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:42.090
of our size.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.630
Our colons are too short
for a primate of our size.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.844
We don't seem like we
have these anomalies

00:37:47.844 --> 00:37:49.510
relative to other
primates, but they all

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:52.920
make sense if you think of us
as an obligate cooking species.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.770
So we're required to predigest
our food in some sense

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.960
by cooking it or
processing in other ways,

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.280
making it easy to chew so
we don't need small teeth.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.451
Breaks it down.

00:38:02.451 --> 00:38:04.450
Now the interesting thing
about cooking is fire.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.580
As my book shows in lots
of lost European explorers,

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:10.290
we're terrible at making fire
when we need to make fire.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.379
You know, unless we have
technology to make fire,

00:38:12.379 --> 00:38:14.420
we're not good at just
figuring out how to do it.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.479
So we need this
cultural know-how

00:38:16.479 --> 00:38:18.270
to figure out how to
make fire and to cook,

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.940
but then that
shaped our biology.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.720
The same is true of--
let me go to running.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.020
So Dan Lieberman has argued
that our bodies are adapted

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.390
for long-distance running.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.080
So we have this
amazing sweating system

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.990
that other species
don't have, that dumps

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.820
sweat onto us that can only
cool if you're actually running.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.680
We have springy
arches in our feet

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.650
which other primates
don't have, and we

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.840
have a new, cool ligament
in the back of our head

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.484
here which allows our head and
shoulders to turn independent

00:38:44.484 --> 00:38:46.900
of each other whereas chimps
are kind of like this, right?

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.320
They can't do that.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.910
And other animals
that have that are

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.280
things like horses and
other running species.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.270
So those are two
physiological examples.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.270
And oh, I'm sorry.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.070
In this case, the reason why
you need the culture stuff

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:04.120
is the sweating system--
there's a reason, tracking.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.515
But I'll tell you
the sweating one.

00:39:06.515 --> 00:39:08.640
If you look at-- so it
looks like an amazing system

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.120
of adaptations for
long-distance running.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.578
We can outrun all
kinds of animals.

00:39:11.578 --> 00:39:12.370
We can outrun dogs.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.911
You know, these other animals
can't do marathons or even come

00:39:14.911 --> 00:39:15.550
close.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.310
But we have this
great sweating system,

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:18.666
but there's no water tank.

00:39:18.666 --> 00:39:19.540
So you start running.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.630
You would immediately run out
of stuff to put in the tank.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.610
You wouldn't sweat, and
the whole thing collapses.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:24.980
And the way hunter
gatherers do this--

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.210
when you study hunter
gatherers who are chasing down

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.126
antelopes-- is they have
knowledge about where

00:39:29.126 --> 00:39:31.280
to find water, and they
have cultural technologies

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.410
for carrying water,
like ostrich eggs.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:36.300
And so you need that
cultural know-how in order

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.480
to make this system work.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.020
So it's a package of genetic
and cultural adaptations.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.524
Now developmental
psychologists have

00:39:43.524 --> 00:39:45.190
noticed that young
children seem to have

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.850
a specialized system for
acquiring information

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.470
about plants and animals.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.552
So a simple example is
category-based induction,

00:39:51.552 --> 00:39:52.510
which is never learned.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:53.530
We do it automatically.

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:57.731
So if you learn that
Felix the cat likes milk,

00:39:57.731 --> 00:39:59.480
you don't just assume,
well, that's Felix.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.030
Felix has a particular
taste for milk.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:02.696
You generalize that
to all cats, and you

00:40:02.696 --> 00:40:04.020
assume it's a feature of cats.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.450
And then if I say, well,
what about a tiger?

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:06.710
Would a tiger like milk?

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:08.830
You can say, well,
probably, because, you know,

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.954
they're kind of related,
and I think they're close.

00:40:10.954 --> 00:40:12.980
So if I had to bet,
tigers would like milk.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.400
So we have this system
that we don't learn that we

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.010
seem to get automatically.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.420
Same thing about artifacts.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.150
Kids readily distinguish between
different kinds of artifacts,

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.210
and when they know
something's a tool,

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.072
then they begin to
say, what is it for?

00:40:25.072 --> 00:40:26.530
When it's not in
the tool category,

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:28.113
they're less concerned
about function.

00:40:28.113 --> 00:40:31.340
So they apply a functional
stance to tools.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:34.530
Humans seem to have
two kinds of status.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.570
One kind of status we inherited
from our non-human primate

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:38.630
ancestors, chimpanzees.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.300
So chimps have dominant status.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.430
Dominant individuals can
control costs and benefits.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:45.560
They do it by force
and force threat.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.170
But humans have another kind of
status that's due to this fact

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.650
that when you have
a social group,

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.733
they're going to vary in
their knowledge and skill

00:40:51.733 --> 00:40:52.580
and abilities.

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.040
And if someone has a lot
of knowledge, skills,

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.850
and abilities and you're
a social learner--

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:59.800
you can learn from other
people-- then you can tap that.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.760
And now you want to pay
them deference in order

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.689
to get access to
their information.

00:41:03.689 --> 00:41:05.480
And here the ethology
is totally different.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.260
So in dominance, you stay
away from the dominant.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.176
You don't look at him.

00:41:08.176 --> 00:41:09.070
Keep your head down.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.290
But if you gotta
learn from him, you've

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:11.831
got to watch him
and get close to him

00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:13.005
so you can learn from him.

00:41:13.005 --> 00:41:14.880
So you lead to two
different kinds of status.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.671
And there's a lot of
research on psychology

00:41:16.671 --> 00:41:18.740
about how human status
partitions into these two

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.010
kinds.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.710
Cultural evolution also
produces social norms,

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.140
so we acquire rules
about how to behave

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.040
and, we acquire rules
for judging others.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.540
And once you have
that, then you can

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.960
have these mutually
reinforcing stable equilibria,

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.020
where-- economists, they call
these Nash equilibria, right?

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.800
Once everyone's
there, we have a rule.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.370
Everyone has to wear clothes,
and if anybody deviates, is not

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:45.030
wearing clothes-- but
then different groups

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.614
can get very different
norms, and this

00:41:46.614 --> 00:41:47.988
can get sorted
out through groups

00:41:47.988 --> 00:41:49.120
competing with each other.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.790
But we seem to have
a norm psychology,

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.824
so we're prepared from
a young age to say,

00:41:52.824 --> 00:41:54.740
I don't know what the
rules are in this world,

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.157
but I know there's
rules, and I've

00:41:56.157 --> 00:41:58.531
got to start trying to figure
out how to learn from them.

00:41:58.531 --> 00:42:01.240
And we have lots of inferential
machinery to help us with that.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.360
And then finally, we seem to
have an ethnic psychology.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.000
So cultural evolution
goes first here,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.250
and it produces a world in
which different groups have

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.583
different norms, and they're
marked by different markers

00:42:11.583 --> 00:42:13.700
like dialect or
dress or whatnot.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.660
And then young learners
readily key in on that.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.970
And I mentioned before how
young kids preferentially

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.710
learn from those who
share their dialect.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.720
That's because they need to
get the underlying information

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.595
because they're going
to be interacting, most

00:42:23.595 --> 00:42:26.080
likely, with members-- at least
in traditional societies--

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.356
of those who share
their dialect-- are also

00:42:28.356 --> 00:42:29.480
going to share their norms.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.950
That's who they're going
to have to interact with.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:33.640
I'm happy to say more about any
of those, if you're interested.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I have a question

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.458
about the last comment.

00:42:35.458 --> 00:42:37.432
JOSEPH HENRICH: Yeah.

00:42:37.432 --> 00:42:39.890
AUDIENCE: So my understanding
is that at least is something

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.250
that you see in other animals,
especially in other mammals,

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.750
right?

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.484
That they-- you'll have
some area in Africa

00:42:46.484 --> 00:42:47.900
with a bunch of
different animals,

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.370
but the animals of
a particular species

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.430
will congregate
together rather than

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.810
with other animals that
are kind of related

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:55.870
but not the same species.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.036
So it's a different, maybe,
level of categorization,

00:42:58.036 --> 00:43:03.210
but it's still kind of selecting
other people or other animals

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:05.060
to stay with that
are very like you.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.420
JOSEPH HENRICH: Yeah.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.990
So the big difference
is whether it's

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:09.200
your local group of familiars
that you grow up with

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.042
or whether this can be applied
to someone you've never met.

00:43:12.042 --> 00:43:14.500
And so that's, again, this idea
that humans live in tribes.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.505
So there's strangers, but if you
share these cultural markers,

00:43:17.505 --> 00:43:19.130
then you're preferentially
interacting,

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:20.230
preferentially learning.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.470
Animals don't do the
social learning, either.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.669
Yes.

00:43:23.669 --> 00:43:24.460
AUDIENCE: I'm sold.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.580
Culture sounds great.

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.550
So why don't all
animals do this?

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:28.635
Why are we so different?

00:43:28.635 --> 00:43:29.510
JOSEPH HENRICH: Yeah.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:31.926
So that's a great question,
and that is, like-- let's see.

00:43:31.926 --> 00:43:33.800
Chapter 17.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.570
No, 16.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.210
So there's a startup problem.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:40.480
And the problem is
when culture is rare,

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.720
it's not-- natural
selection doesn't

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.440
want to make the
investment in making

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.960
you a good cultural
learner because if there's

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.336
nothing out there to learn,
then it's a wasted investment.

00:43:51.336 --> 00:43:53.710
So in that case, you should
invest in individual learning

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.040
and make you better at figuring
out things on your own.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.180
So the only way to jump
start the whole system

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.200
is to somehow get a lot
of cultural information

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.624
out there in the
minds of others.

00:44:01.624 --> 00:44:03.540
Then selection can favor
a brain that can take

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.160
advantage of that information.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.050
So it's kind of like a fitness
valley when you do the math.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:12.470
So in the book, I lay out a
case for how we could have

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:13.800
crossed that fitness valley.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.240
And I don't posit any magical
genes that suddenly appear.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.780
I posit an ecological
circumstance.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:24.620
So in the Pleistocene,
humans faced intense pressure

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.660
from predators.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:29.200
And what animals do when they
face a predator from pressures

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.990
is they live in bigger groups.

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.440
And I talked earlier-- if
you have a larger group,

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.950
you're more likely to begin
to get this process going

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.699
because there's more
people to learn from,

00:44:37.699 --> 00:44:40.319
more individuals to
have individual ideas.

00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:41.860
And it was probably
a savanna dweller

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:45.564
because they would have been
most susceptible to predation.

00:44:45.564 --> 00:44:46.980
There's a number
of other factors.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.535
The climate was
starting to oscillate

00:44:48.535 --> 00:44:49.910
in a way that
would have also put

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.860
a pressure on social learning.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.100
So in the book, I kind of put
together-- and that's the idea,

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.960
is that those ecological factors
push you across this thing.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.600
You begin to turn the wheels on
cumulative cultural evolution,

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.349
and then you can do
the selection pressure

00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:04.141
and it'll pay off.

00:45:04.141 --> 00:45:05.850
AUDIENCE: So are
there other animals

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.586
who may be good at
social learning who

00:45:07.586 --> 00:45:09.660
could have done this
and may be not so

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.915
good on the other
measures of intelligence?

00:45:11.915 --> 00:45:12.790
JOSEPH HENRICH: Yeah.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.890
Well, throughout the book,
I used chimpanzees a lot

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:20.272
because chimps do have
some cultural traditions.

00:45:20.272 --> 00:45:21.730
And this is relevant
to this point.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.150
So chimps live in these
fission-fusion groups,

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:27.270
and they do transmit things like
techniques for nut-cracking,

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.930
techniques for getting at ants.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:32.100
A few other things.

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.790
And the problem is that most
of the time, a young chimp

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:37.700
is only with mom, so
you can only ever have

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.727
vertical transmission.

00:45:38.727 --> 00:45:41.060
But if you had a group that
was pushed into large groups

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.830
by predation, then
the young chimp

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:45.310
could look at all these
different potential models

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:47.730
and learn not just from
mom but from ants and all

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:49.690
these other possibilities.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:52.010
So chimps are a
cultural species.

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:54.260
Another interesting
species that's relevant

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:58.647
are elephants and dolphins.

00:45:58.647 --> 00:46:00.230
Elephants have some
cultural learning.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.563
And actually, one of the
things I talk about in the book

00:46:02.563 --> 00:46:04.700
is the evolution of menopause.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.870
And elephants and at least
some species of toothed whales,

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.239
of cetaceans, have
menopause, too.

00:46:10.239 --> 00:46:12.280
And I think there's similar
cultural stories that

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.480
could help explain that.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.790
Basically, if you have
some cultural abilities,

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:18.360
when you get old, there's
an opportunity for you

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.386
to shut down your
reproductive system

00:46:20.386 --> 00:46:21.760
so you can continue
disseminating

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.507
your cultural knowledge
to the younger generation.

00:46:24.507 --> 00:46:26.840
AUDIENCE: I always find sports
teams really interesting.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.381
You know, when
they're young, they're

00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:29.720
just focusing on the sport.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.170
But how do they become a coach?

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:33.560
For example, Jacques Lemaire.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.550
He said he couldn't read,
but he's won a Stanley Cup.

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:39.530
And you see-- I don't know
if you've studied those.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.760
And what's the factors
that are playing in--

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.350
because those people, they're
not going into MBA programs.

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:45.670
They're not in business.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:49.610
But how do they go from a
player to running a organization

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:53.460
that's quite complex?

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:58.070
JOSEPH HENRICH:
So, how do people

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.480
end up running sports teams?

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.900
AUDIENCE: Yes, when they
started off as a player.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.790
Because it's a completely
different skill.

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:05.791
Is it the institutional
knowledge, or are they--

00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:06.665
JOSEPH HENRICH: Yeah.

00:47:06.665 --> 00:47:08.720
So I haven't studied
that, but my intuitions

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.550
would be that they're
heavily influenced

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:13.237
by the coaches and the
managers and all the people

00:47:13.237 --> 00:47:15.570
that they were exposed to
over the course of their time.

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:17.690
So they're kind of the
old-fashioned style

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:19.984
apprentice-style learning.

00:47:19.984 --> 00:47:20.760
All right.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.060
So this is just a quick review
of the stuff I've talked about.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.000
So we can approach
our learning abilities

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.650
as adaptations for
extracting information

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:33.182
from the social world and
also from the environment.

00:47:33.182 --> 00:47:35.390
So one of the things we
focus on is-- when should you

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:36.310
use social learning?

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:37.400
When is that optimal?

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.450
And when is it optimal
to switch over and rely

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:40.860
on your own experience?

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.890
This creates a second
system of inheritance

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:45.190
which leads to a culture-driven
genetic evolution.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:47.180
So I briefly pointed
to some examples

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.060
that I discussed in the
book of how culture has

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.547
driven our genetic evolution.

00:47:51.547 --> 00:47:53.880
One of the things I didn't
get much chance to talk about

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.110
was the process of
self-domestication.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.210
So I mentioned how cultural
evolution gives rise

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:00.120
to social norms
and institutions.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.740
So this means that
if you deviate

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.980
from what the group
does, you're going to get

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.400
punished or a bad reputation.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.144
People gossip about
you, be mad at you.

00:48:06.144 --> 00:48:07.560
But that's eventually
going to get

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.050
people to be more compliant,
to fall into line,

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:11.800
and to do with the
group wants them to do,

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.750
to be more conformist,
more docile.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:16.750
So you get this process
of self-domestication.

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.460
It's part of the process that
makes us more cooperative.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.460
So one of the things I
discuss a lot in the book

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.730
is the evolution of cooperation.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:26.600
Didn't fit into today's talk.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.400
Now if we can expand
our cultural brains,

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.340
we can generate faster
cumulative cultural evolution,

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.600
more innovation.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.351
And then a final point
that I'll leave you

00:48:34.351 --> 00:48:36.016
with-- there's a whole
chapter on this--

00:48:36.016 --> 00:48:38.210
which is that culture is
part of our biology in two

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:39.180
separate ways.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.180
One, that our genetics have been
shaped by cultural evolution.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.500
But the second is-- and
people often separate culture

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.920
from biology-- but when you
learn to read, for example.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:48.990
So that's a cultural practice.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:50.031
You got to learn to read.

00:48:50.031 --> 00:48:51.500
It actually changes your brain.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.084
You have a thicker
corpus callosum--

00:48:53.084 --> 00:48:55.250
that's the information
highway that connects the two

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:56.890
brains-- after you've
learned to read,

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:59.160
if you compare literate and
non-literate populations.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.570
You have a larger verbal memory.

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:02.360
You actually have
specialized circuitry

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.680
that's specifically
for recognizing letters

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.550
in your left hemisphere.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:10.820
So culture shapes our biology
in non-genetic ways as well.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:11.632
And that's the end.

00:49:17.996 --> 00:49:20.370
AUDIENCE: Everything you said
makes a lot of sense to me,

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:23.260
but there's one
aspect of evolution

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.710
that I'm wondering
whether or not we have any

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:28.050
or you have any better
understanding of, because it

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.790
seems to me that there's
a necessary requirement

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:32.570
for either kind
of evolution that

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.760
requires a certain amount of
variance in the population.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:41.170
And if that's the case from a
cultural standpoint, that there

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:44.260
would be a risk or that you
wouldn't want the population

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.050
to be too good at
learning-- otherwise

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.090
you could latch
onto the wrong thing

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:48.180
and then everybody's dead.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.910
Is there any sort of
understanding or any evidence

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:53.430
or model to understand
how that works

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:54.860
or where the right balance is?

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:55.080
JOSEPH HENRICH: Yeah.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.520
I mean, that's the
right intuition.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.561
So that's certainly what
we get from the models--

00:49:58.561 --> 00:50:02.850
is variance is the engine of all
these evolutionary processes.

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:04.479
The thing about
culture-- one reason

00:50:04.479 --> 00:50:06.270
to worry about that
less is actually-- it's

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.150
more of a worry of
genetic evolution,

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:10.530
because genetic replication
is so much more exact

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:12.220
than cultural transmission.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.680
Even when people
are good copies,

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.170
there's still lots of noise.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.660
And the other thing that
culture has is multiple models.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.880
So genetic
evolution-- you either

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.120
have one parent or
two parents, usually.

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.120
Some exceptions to that.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.870
But in cultural evolution,
you could have 50 parents,

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:27.900
and you're actually
recombining ideas.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.650
So your actual
repertoire doesn't

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:31.710
look like any are 50
parents because it's

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.390
a recombination of all of those.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:35.820
So it can definitely happen.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.837
There's probably specific
cases of maladaptation

00:50:37.837 --> 00:50:40.170
where everybody was forced
to do exactly the same thing,

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:41.600
but in general,
I think it's less

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.130
of a problem for
cultural evolution.

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:44.800
AUDIENCE: So just
a quick question

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.145
on the feedback loop between
genetic and cultural evolution.

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:50.020
Seems like that the
genetic problem might not

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:51.070
be very relevant today.

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:54.290
There's not a lot of lions and
bears around outside, right?

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:58.530
So how does the cultural
evolution look today?

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.900
What's your thought on that
for the next 100 years?

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.560
JOSEPH HENRICH:
Yeah, I guess I don't

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.040
think there's
been-- if anything,

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.415
there's been an acceleration
of gene-culture co-evolution

00:51:08.415 --> 00:51:10.960
in the last 10,000 years.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:14.640
So one of the things
I do in chapter 6

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.080
is I discuss recent evidence
from the human genome

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.970
on gene-culture co-evolution.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:23.020
And so one good well-studied
example is lactose.

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:27.010
So some populations
domesticated cows and then

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:29.400
didn't develop cheese
or yogurt technology.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.700
So this created a selection
pressure for people

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.830
to be able to-- normally, in
humans, like in other mammals,

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:38.340
babies can drink milk, and then
the whole system shuts down

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:38.840
for adults.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.660
So adults can't process
milk and get the sugar

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.965
and the nutritional benefits.

00:51:42.965 --> 00:51:45.340
But in some populations that
had this particular cultural

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:48.660
situation, selection favored
keeping that system on.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.350
And it's a change
on chromosome 2,

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:53.680
and it just wipes out
the regulatory gene

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:58.310
that normally prevents the
lactose gene from operating.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:01.390
So you get adults who can
drink milk into adulthood.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:04.210
And this has spread faster
than any other known gene,

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:05.167
essentially.

00:52:05.167 --> 00:52:07.000
There's also genes for
alcohol dehydrogenase

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.094
that seem to be associated with
the emergence of agriculture.

00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:13.260
So I think there's good
reason to think that culture

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:17.036
is actually more of a pressure
on human genetic evolution now.

00:52:17.036 --> 00:52:19.410
AUDIENCE: How do you think
this would affect family size?

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:21.534
Do you think somebody could
use this as an argument

00:52:21.534 --> 00:52:25.060
against having an only child,
reasoning that they have fewer,

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:28.794
say, older siblings they can
look up to as cultural parents?

00:52:28.794 --> 00:52:31.210
Or do you think that's not as
relevant because we normally

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:33.255
raise our kids in
large group settings?

00:52:33.255 --> 00:52:34.130
JOSEPH HENRICH: Yeah.

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:38.290
So I think that
probably isn't relevant

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:40.640
because-- so in all our
studies of young kids,

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.842
they seem to be very willing
to look widely and learn

00:52:43.842 --> 00:52:45.300
from all kinds of
other individuals

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.930
besides their siblings.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.900
So I've worked in three
small-scale societies

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.650
in the Pacific, in Peru,
and in rural Chile.

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:53.440
And there, the kids
live in a big group,

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.890
basically, in the
middle of the village

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:56.210
or on the beach in the village.

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:59.610
And I mean, of course older
siblings have some influence,

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.480
but they seem just as happy
with the neighbor's older

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.550
sibling or--

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:08.390
AUDIENCE: So in this light, I
see kind of a positive feedback

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:10.730
loop that keeps our
brains getting larger,

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:13.590
keeps our culture
getting more complex

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:17.940
and advanced until we reach
that limit with brain size.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.800
At the same time,
my understanding

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.390
is humans used, basically,
stone tools for the better

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:26.700
part of 100,000 years
without a lot of advancement,

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.890
which doesn't seem
to jive with this.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.920
Yet somehow in the
last few millennia,

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.970
technology got a whole
lot more advanced.

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:37.060
How do all these
things square up?

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.430
JOSEPH HENRICH: OK.

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:39.350
I mean, let's see.

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:42.252
This is chapter 15.

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:43.710
I go through the
stone tools, and I

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:45.460
don't think there's
any evidence of stasis

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.610
in the anthropological record.

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:49.200
So tools get better.

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.300
Adhesives get added.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.670
Projectile weapons are in.

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:54.210
You got spears, wooden
spears, at 400,000.

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.210
AUDIENCE: But this is on
the scale of millennia.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:57.190
I mean, think what we've done
in the last two millennia.

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.840
JOSEPH HENRICH: So
things are going slower.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:53:59.340
Yep.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.040
So definitely there's been
an exponential explosion,

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.540
but that's actually
what you get out

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.150
of the models when
you begin to consider

00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:08.779
the size of populations, the
emergence of communication

00:54:08.779 --> 00:54:11.195
technology where you have more
and more minds interacting.

00:54:11.195 --> 00:54:13.499
You have trade routes
that's running information

00:54:13.499 --> 00:54:15.540
across different, and then
you have recombination

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.400
of different ideas.

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.340
Right.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:18.880
Writing.

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.080
All kinds of communication.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:21.580
Yeah.

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:23.810
So that's what I think happened.

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:25.134
AUDIENCE: Chapter 15, huh?

00:54:25.134 --> 00:54:27.050
MALE SPEAKER: Speaking
about the domestication

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:31.730
of the human species, how
would you connect that

00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:35.120
with, let's say, contemporary
politics of Democrats

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:38.890
and Republicans and big
government, small government?

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:41.240
Is there anything
going on there that

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:45.890
is-- or is this just a
completely disconnected effect?

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:48.360
And the other, at
the same venue,

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:53.160
is-- I mean, obviously group
learning-- that advances

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.520
society and advances
our culture,

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.670
but there's also
groups of people

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.920
that did less palatable things.

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.414
Is there any comments from
your angle about those things?

00:55:04.414 --> 00:55:06.580
JOSEPH HENRICH: So one of
things I didn't talk about

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.970
is-- using the same
kind of approach,

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.410
you can think about the
emergence of maladaptation.

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:14.360
So the stuff I
talked about often

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.519
gives rise to
cultural adaptations,

00:55:16.519 --> 00:55:18.310
but there are interesting
models in which--

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:20.110
and then I think actual
empirical cases--

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:22.190
where the whole thing
goes completely awry.

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:23.890
And the easiest
one to understand

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:25.700
is the prestige situation.

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:30.440
So if you have something where
there's a certain cue-- and so

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.260
I'll give you the
Melanesian example.

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:36.780
So in Melanesia, men got
prestige for growing yams,

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.020
and so people copied
the bigger yam growers.

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:41.470
But then they began to
have competitions to see

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.280
who could grow the biggest yam.

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:45.030
And then they grew
bigger and bigger yams,

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.790
and they would
have a competition.

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:47.831
But it turns out when yams
get to a certain size,

00:55:47.831 --> 00:55:48.990
they're not edible anymore.

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.230
So there's all these guys
putting all these resources

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:54.000
into making these giant yams
which are largely inedible.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.220
So that's kind of
where things begin

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.040
to get maladaptive from the
genetic evolutionary point

00:55:59.040 --> 00:55:59.540
of view.

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:00.700
But the guys are, you
know-- they're into it.

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.491
In fact, the Fijians
have yam competitions.

00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:04.740
A group I worked with.

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:08.689
The contemporary
politics question.

00:56:08.689 --> 00:56:10.230
It seems to me-- so
one of the things

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:12.020
that this kind of
suggests is that we have

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:15.730
a tribal psychology, that we're
looking for people to build

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:19.250
relationships with that
share our cultural beliefs,

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:22.380
speak our language
in the same dialect,

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.059
share our same cultural cues.

00:56:24.059 --> 00:56:26.350
And so I feel like that has
relevance for understanding

00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:27.886
some political division.

00:56:27.886 --> 00:56:29.260
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering, also--

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:33.260
I mean, a lot of the
culture that we have is--

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.670
so if you look at, say, the
culture the chimpanzees have,

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:39.160
it's tool use that is
consistent with their biology.

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.550
But a lot of--
especially when we

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:44.060
get to more complicated human
tools, they sort of crucially

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.230
rely on things like opposable
thumbs and separately

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:49.410
but movable digits that
other primates don't have.

00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:50.870
So do you feel
like, again, there's

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:53.300
some sort of feedback between
the evolution of culture

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:54.340
and the development
of these things?

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.100
JOSEPH HENRICH: So I didn't
talk about it in this case,

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.058
but there's a bunch of
changes with our nerves.

00:56:58.058 --> 00:56:59.820
So our ability to
sort of directly

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.340
move each finger and
whatnot is probably

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:06.100
a co-evolutionary effect
of co-evolving with tools.

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.370
So tools are evolving
culturally to fit our hands,

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:11.710
but our hands are also adapting
to be better at using tools.

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:13.380
This is very clear
in our tongue.

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.780
So we've clearly had evolution
to make us better language

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.250
users.

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:21.750
AUDIENCE: So you talked
about the benefits

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:24.780
of learning from a large
number of different people,

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.200
different adults.

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.450
But these days,
one of the things

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:31.230
that we've heard about a lot is
that the internet is becoming

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:33.420
an echo chamber, so
you tend to learn only

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.130
from people that are
very, very similar to you,

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:38.540
and you're able to
effectively filter out

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.400
other opinions and views.

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.897
Does that bode badly
for our future?

00:57:44.897 --> 00:57:45.730
JOSEPH HENRICH: Yes.

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:48.020
Nah.

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.070
So this fits into the
interconnectedness problem,

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:50.570
right?

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:51.710
So if the internet is-- so.

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:52.210
Right?

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:53.270
The great promise
of the internet

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:55.700
is it fully interconnects us
and we can learn all this stuff,

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.283
but if we're only
connecting to people

00:57:57.283 --> 00:57:59.270
we like or are
very similar to us,

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:01.890
then you lose that flow of
ideas and the diversity,

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:04.481
the power that comes from the
variation in selection systems.

00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:05.980
AUDIENCE: I loved
your presentation,

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.410
and sorry if this seems a little
insulting, but how much of this

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:10.480
is new ideas?

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.600
And I ask because a
lot of what you said

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.710
reminded me strongly of some
kind of old science fiction

00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:18.480
like Larry Niven's
Ringworld, where society

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.300
degrades due to disconnection.

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:21.460
JOSEPH HENRICH: OK.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:23.980
I don't know
Ringworld, but this is

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.540
stuff that draws together
things I've been working on

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:27.440
since the mid-90s.

00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:33.010
So, 20-something years of stuff.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:37.810
So yeah, it varies in how
new it is, but in some sense,

00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:42.870
it's sort of my career up
to this point summarized.

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:45.740
AUDIENCE: What other questions
about evolutionary biology

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.390
are scientists still trying
to look at and answer

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:51.274
right now that maybe we sort of
have some vague theories about

00:58:51.274 --> 00:58:53.440
but maybe are bigger questions
that people are still

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.152
trying to solve right now?

00:58:55.152 --> 00:58:57.110
JOSEPH HENRICH: Well, I
think the big-- I mean,

00:58:57.110 --> 00:59:00.280
the center of a lot of
debate is the origins

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.570
of human cooperation, and that's
one of the real flash points.

00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:05.710
So the position I
defend in the book

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:09.380
is that it's been a
culture-gene interaction

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:12.080
and that inter-group
competition is really important.

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.120
But there's another
group of scholars,

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.859
for example, that
really reject the idea

00:59:15.859 --> 00:59:17.650
that inter-group
competition was important,

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:18.560
that groups were
kind of fighting

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.370
with each other and those who
had the best ways of organizing

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:24.590
won and then that led to a
gene-culture co-evolutionary

00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:25.090
process.

00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:27.120
So cooperation is certainly one.

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.860
I mean, with the
human genome, we're

00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:32.390
really just-- it's kind of
a Wild West, New Frontier

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:34.979
time because there's so much
interesting genetic variation

00:59:34.979 --> 00:59:35.770
that we're finding.

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:37.320
And just going
through and looking

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.030
at what caused that
variation, a lot of it's

00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:42.810
turning out to be cultural
differences among populations

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:44.440
that then lead to
genetic differences.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.148
MALE SPEAKER: And with
that, let's please

00:59:46.148 --> 00:59:48.360
thank our guest today.
