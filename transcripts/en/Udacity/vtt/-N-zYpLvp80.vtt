00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.420
Although we each have our own set of traits, sometimes

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.880
it's useful to think about traits among a population of

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.450
individuals. For example, a population is a particular group or

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.410
type of people in an area. So although there are

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.540
many ways to identify a population, a common metric is

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.330
geography, as you can see here, with a map of

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.790
the world. Just as people and families share common traits

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.600
because they're genetically related and they share a common environment.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.910
Some geographic populations share common traits because, like

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.560
families, they're also genetically related and share a common

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.860
environment. For example. Here's a map of the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.210
world, divided by countries, showing you the breakdown for

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.110
the trait of sex. For our purposes, sex

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.030
simply means whether or not you have male or

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.100
female reproductive organs. Now, it is true that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.030
it's possible to have both male and female reproductive

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.500
parts, and those are called intersex individuals. But for

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.300
our purposes we're only going to consider two categories in

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.030
the meantime. In our world map here, the redder

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.630
a country seems, the more males to females it has

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.510
in its population. And the more blue a country

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.550
appears, the more females to males you have in that

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.890
country. The closer it is to a more neutral

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.550
color, white. So a, a lighter blue, a lighter red.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.060
Or a white color, in fact. This means that the male and female ratio is

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.130
roughly equal. So what I want you to do is look at the map here and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.310
tell me. Which two geographic regions in the map here have the highest imbalance

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.020
of either males or females? Is it Canada, Russia.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.620
China, Saudi Arabia, Australia, or Brazil. Remember, I want

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.800
you to pick two geographic regions that have the highest

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.240
imbalance of either males or females. Remember to use the

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.360
legend over here and look at the map to see

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.460
if you can figure out which countries have the highest imbalance.
