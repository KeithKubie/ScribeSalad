00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.120
Despite Disney’s plethora of female characters,
only eleven of them count as “official”

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.290
Disney Princesses.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.410
And Cinderella, Ariel, Belle, Anna, and Elsa
make up the big five, even though the last

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.390
two aren’t technically on the list.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.950
The meticulous studio is notorious for their
hidden details, and the internet is drowning

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.760
in theories about subliminal messaging corrupting
children’s morals.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.170
Wherever you stand, it’s worth pointing
out that most of it is flying right over their

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.590
kid’s heads.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.000
Just because they’re made with children
in mind doesn’t mean adults can’t enjoy

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.230
them.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.670
Before we get started on our list, can you
guess what movie this is based on these emojis?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.041
Stick with us and we’ll reveal the answer
at the end of the video.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.041
But first, let’s give you what you came
for.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:47.370
Here are 10 Disney Princess Secrets Only Adults
Will Notice.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.109
Rapunzel, Tangled
The cover for 2010’s Tangled gives new meaning

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.040
to the term “sex hair”.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.059
That is, if you believe Disney animators prey
on youth with subliminal messaging.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.350
Concerned parents were sure they spotted the
word ‘sex’ in Rapunzel’s hair on the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.409
movie’s cover.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.409
See it?

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.409
Neither do we.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.990
But others swear up and down that it’s written
there, clear as day.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.841
Considering it took 10 software engineers
to work on just the characters’ hair, it

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:20.110
seems pretty far flung that they’d all band
together to sneak a little innuendo on to

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.110
the cover.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.960
But stranger things have happened, so we’ll
let you be the judge.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.170
Jasmine, Aladdin
Ears intent on finding sexual innuendo will

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.640
hear it in everything.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.170
And since many of the Disney conspiracies
have to do with sex-type things, it’s understandable

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.470
that people get riled up about morality.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.890
No parent wants their kids childhood to be
marred by naughty, adult stuff.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.700
So when a concerned citizen heard what they
thought was dirty talk in Aladdin, it was

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
a big deal.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.630
While most people heard the line as “good
kitty take off and go” others swore he said

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.170
“good teenagers take off your clothes”.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.939
We can argue about it all we want, but at
the end of the day the only one who knows

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.860
for sure is Princess Jasmine.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.540
Belle, Beauty and the Beast
For better or for worse, Disney princesses

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.069
hold a lot of sway when it comes to teaching
lessons to kids.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.190
It turns out that the magic of song is a wonderful
medium for transmitting messages of self-esteem

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.190
and kindness.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.880
None of the ladies on this list take any crap
from anyone, and that’s especially true

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.810
of Belle.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.510
The team behind the character has said they
wrote her to be someone their own daughters

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.730
could look up to.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.230
“Feminist” is a big word, and people seem
to understand it differently.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.489
But when it comes to conversations about empowered
female characters, her name is almost always

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.740
on the list.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:57.890
Tiana, The Princess and the Frog
Of all the criticisms that have been lobbed

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.860
at Disney over the decades, the issue of cultural
representation is one of the heaviest.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.650
Historically (and with very few exceptions)
white characters have dominated the entertainment

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.409
industry, including animation.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.500
The release of 2009’s The Princess and the
Frog finally bucked the trend.. sort of.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.650
Tiana is the first African-American princess
to enter the Disney canon.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.720
But considering she’s turned into a frog
quickly and stays that way for most of the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.049
movie, viewers have argued that it was a clever
way for the studio to appear diverse without

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.129
actually having to follow through on it.

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.480
And while really little kids might not give
it a second thought, older folks understand

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.360
the magnitude of that choice.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.579
Merida, Brave
Merida isn’t just Pixar’s first female

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.660
lead, she’s also has the honor of being
their first princess.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.170
An incredibly skilled archer with a headstrong
attitude, she’d rather stomp around in the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.379
forest than follow stuffy old customs.

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.500
And obviously, disaster ensues.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.030
Sure, it’s technically a kids movie, but
Pixar doesn’t forget about the adults.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.360
There is one moment where Merida’s brothers
turned bear cubs chase down a nursemaid to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.510
find a key hidden in her cleavage.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.940
And after one of them dives in headfirst,
the other two have different reactions.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.350
One of them is shocked, but the other is clearly
having a flashback to the days when he was

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.000
breastfed.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.090
Cinderella, Cinderella
Perhaps the ultimate Disney princess, no discussion

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.440
of the studio’s royal lore would be complete
without a nod to Cinderella.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.520
Everyone knows the story: terrible living
circumstances, slave labor, and snotty stepsisters

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.720
all fade away when the Fairy Godmother makes
her over for a couple of hours.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.639
The most iconic part of that makeover is also
the key to Cinderella’s freedom, glass footwear.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.760
It’s easy for the youngsters to get so swept
up in the spectacle of it all that they never

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.100
even consider how horrendously impractical
that would be.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.259
If the fairy godmother really had Cinderella’s
back, she’d have given her some sensible

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.100
shoes before sending her to a night of dancing.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.180
Snow White, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
For most people, Snow White is the story of

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.650
a girl in unfortunate circumstances.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.150
But not everybody sees it that way.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.110
Conspiracy theorists hypothesize that the
whole thing is actually a metaphor for substance

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.300
abuse, specifically cocaine.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.360
This group posits that each dwarf corresponds
to a symptom of withdrawal, the princess symbolizes

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.820
the drug itself, and Doc is, well, a doctor.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.960
It’s an interesting mental exercise to imagine,
but was debunked by the folks over at Snopes.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.180
In addition, cocaine withdrawal is different
for every user, and there isn’t an official

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.509
checklist of symptoms to cover everyone.

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.039
So for this analogy to work, there’d have
to be, like, 50 more dwarves.

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.960
Ariel, The Little Mermaid
Ariel is part of the Big Five princess group,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.990
and has the best hair of them all.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.650
But her accomodations are less than stellar.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.800
If you own a copy of The Little Mermaid produced
in the movie’s initial run, the front cover

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.680
is going to be different from the ones that
came after it.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.360
But you have to look very closely.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.860
That’s right, friends, Ariel lives in a
dick palace.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.290
There’s some Michael Bay lens flare action
happening to try and obscure it, but it’s

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.290
there.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.080
In this case, we’re using the loose definition
of “adult”, because dick jokes transcend

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:26.100
all traditional age boundaries.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:47.560
It’s science.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:07:02.080
Anna, Frozen
In 2013, Disney released a movie that took

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.379
the world by storm and kicked everyone in
the pants.

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:09.930
Frozen obliterated the box office and is one
of the most successful, highest grossing films

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.930
of all time.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.370
And the soundtrack was just as successful.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.440
The movie’s charm lies in the relationship
between the two princesses; Anna and her sister

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.440
Elsa.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.191
No, they’re not technically on the official
list of Disney royalty, but we can’t just

00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:24.770
overlook them!

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:30.020
Most of the humor in Frozen is very family-friendly,
but one conversation between Anna and Kristof

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.139
about a man’s shoe size is guaranteed to
have the adults giggling.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:41.550
It’s good to know the writers consider the
grown-ups occasionally, except for when they’re

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.550
writing the music.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.550
Mulan, Mulan
Mulan is the story of one daughter’s profound

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.550
love for her father.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.550
The lengths she goes to in order to protect
him are truly heroic.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.757
Disguising herself as a man, Mulan enlists
in the army and gets away with it for a long

00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:47.757
time.

00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:48.757
All the while she’s been developing a crush
on her teammate Shang, who thinks she’s

00:07:48.757 --> 00:07:49.757
a dude.

00:07:49.757 --> 00:07:50.757
Obviously she can’t keep it up forever,
and Mulan’s true identity is discovered,

00:07:50.757 --> 00:07:51.757
leading to some straight-up discrimination.

00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:53.190
Some audience members have argued that the
princess’ journey is a metaphor for gender

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.190
inequality in the workplace.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.190
Something that, hopefully, kids have no first-hand
experience with.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.190
How’d we do?

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.190
Did we miss any obvious ones?
