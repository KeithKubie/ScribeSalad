00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:02.910
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Well, thanks so much,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.640
guys, for coming to the talk.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.740
Really excited to have Rick
and Wendy Walleigh here

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.980
to talk about their book, "From
Silicon Valley to Swaziland,"

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.730
and to talk a little bit, also,
about the value and promise

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.110
of an encore career.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.070
And then, also, we have Megan
Moyerman from TechnoServe

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.470
who will talk a little
more about the organization

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.970
and other ways to get involved.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.200
Because encore careers
aren't the only ways to get

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.630
involved with TechnoServe--
though they are a great one.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.640
So, Megan will kick it off.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.534
MEGAN MOYERMAN: So
I just want to say

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:34.700
I'm really happy to be here.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.440
So thanks for
having me, Lindsey,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.180
and for having Rick
and Wendy here.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.040
I think we're all excited.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.240
So, as Lindsey
said, I'm just going

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.880
to talk a little bit about
TechnoServe, an introduction

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.220
to our organization.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.180
We believe in the power
of private enterprise

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.660
to transform lives.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.320
Just a quick look
at one crop, coffee.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.820
Coffee is a really important
cash crop for more than nine

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.610
million smallholder farmers.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.840
And small family-run farms
contribute to more than half

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.230
of the world's coffee supply.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.340
Unfortunately, nearly
half of those families

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.340
are living on less
than $1 a day.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.540
And that's 4.2 million
households and about 20 million

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.080
individuals.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.740
So we have here, a picture
of Jackeline Mukandori,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.170
and she's a member of the Mizero
Coffee Farmers Cooperative

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.545
in Rwanda.

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:47.440
She grows coffee in about
one to two hectares of land.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.110
And, in 2010, she produced about
90 kilograms of coffee beans.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.890
She has seven children, and
she does have additional income

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.270
besides coffee.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.440
So TechnoServe, through agronomy
training that we provided,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.830
she learned how to
apply fertilizer,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.984
how to prune her
trees, manage pests,

00:02:12.984 --> 00:02:14.400
and other critical
skills that are

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.050
necessary for her to improve
the quality and the quantity

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.620
of her coffee.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.920
TechnoServe also helped
establish local wet mills

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.590
so that they run as
small businesses,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.570
and they help to
ensure that the coffee

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.880
beans that come from
Jacqueline's coffee

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.026
are of high quality.

00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:39.950
And TechnoServe also helped
to connect these wet mills

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.780
with new markets so that
Jacqueline and her coffee

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.682
receive the best price.

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:49.390
And you might already
know this, but some

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.690
of the coffee from Rwanda
and other of our locations

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.520
that we work in, made
their way to Pete's Coffee

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.520
and some other
different coffee chains.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.090
So that is exciting.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.840
OK, so our mission-- TechnoServe
works with enterprising people

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.260
in the developing world.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.491
And we do that to build
competitive farms, businesses,

00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:11.116
and industries.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.250
What do these words mean to us?

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.080
Enterprising-- so the
people that we work with

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.746
are hardworking, and
they are aspirational.

00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:29.370
They are agents of
change, and they are

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.120
leaders in their communities.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.230
Work with-- so we work
with them, not for them.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.160
And we help them to acquire
the skills that they need

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
to have successful businesses.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.210
We connect them to opportunities
that they previously just

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.192
were out of reach for them.

00:03:50.192 --> 00:03:53.410
Competitive-- we
help build businesses

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.650
that can achieve
success-- small scale

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.210
or large, short and long term
success in the marketplace.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.780
We also help to-- these
types of businesses

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.750
are sustainable
sources of change,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.820
so they're long-term
sources of change.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.709
And we're hoping that
they stay like that

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.800
long after TechnoServe
is out of the picture.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.240
Our founder Ed Bullard,
almost 50 years ago,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.270
went to Ghana for about
a year and volunteered

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.760
with his family.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.500
And from that
experience, he really

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.180
believed that
talent is universal,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.070
but, unfortunately,
opportunity is not.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.810
TechnoServe develops business
solutions to poverty.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.702
We help connect people
to capital, to markets,

00:04:49.702 --> 00:04:53.750
to suppliers, to information.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.910
And we believe that we're
partners in this process.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.920
And I think that was a
big key to Ed Bullard when

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.380
he started the organization.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.610
We're a nonprofit.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.840
We've been around for,
again, almost 50 years.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.540
So we've been around
for a long time.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.940
We have programs in about
29 different countries.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.200
We have about, a little
more than 1,400 employees--

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.630
the majority of whom
actually work in the field.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.533
Only about 60 to
80 of our employees

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:30.660
work in US-- so DC, New
York, Connecticut, and then

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.700
also in London.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:38.780
And in 2014, our revenue
was about $80 million.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.010
So we're not small, and we've
been around for a long time.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.532
We do a lot of work.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.001
So what do our programs do?

00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:54.395
Well, some of our programs
help develop capacity.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:59.190
And we try to help individuals
and communities acquire

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.620
new skills.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.300
We help them to share knowledge,
to apply opportunities or apply

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.900
technology that will help them
grow their business and farms

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.850
and help them be successful.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.530
And some of these programs
involve financial literacy,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.040
financial management training,
youth training-- so youth

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.500
leadership training.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.910
We have farmer organization
strengthening--

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.870
we work with that-- intensive
operational support, and so on.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.230
Our programs help strengthen
market connections.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.990
So we help coordinate
among industry players,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.690
and we help them connect
emerging farms and businesses

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.010
to capital, to
information, to suppliers.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.006
Some of our programs
that involve this area

00:06:49.006 --> 00:06:53.530
would include business
planning, market linkages,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.140
supplier linkages, financial
services, and capital raising.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.450
So, also, some of
our programs involve

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.460
or help us to improve
the business environment.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.940
And that's where we encourage
self-sustaining economic

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:15.200
activity by addressing policies,
information, and incentives

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.680
that help markets
function better.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.010
So our programs
within that region

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.380
would involve industry
strategic planning,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.650
developing local agricultural
service organizations, youth

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.480
and gender focus-- so making
sure a lot of our programs

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.860
focus on youth and also
include a lot of women in them.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.160
So we also have environmental
sustainability and ICT

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.010
innovation or integration.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.540
And if you're not familiar
with what ICT means,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.730
it's information
communication technology.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:52.430
So, for instance,
working with farmers

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.250
to use their mobile
phones for bank

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:01.280
accounts, tracking financial
information, and all of that.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:08.990
In 2014, we reached more
than 333 farmers, businesses,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.810
and employees.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:17.310
And we helped add more than $61
million in revenue and wages.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.680
And we helped mobilize
more than $23 million

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.810
in new finance that's
necessary to grow markets

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.160
and to be successful in your
business and your farms.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.050
And so we're back to Jacqueline.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.270
What did TechnoServe
do for Jacqueline?

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.960
Just as a reminder,
Jacqueline grows coffee.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.530
She has seven children.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.679
And she lived on about $1 a day.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.260
Well, TechnoServe helped her
to improve her farming, helped

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:52.090
her to produce better coffee,
and to have a better business.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.010
She is holding, right now,
health insurance cards

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:01.780
that she was able to purchase
from the profits of her coffee.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.584
And these health
insurance cards--

00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:05.000
so, this health
insurance-- helped

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.570
her to get treatment for her
son who contracted malaria.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.870
In addition, she was able to
open up a savings account.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.300
So she's able to start saving.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.870
And she also used
some of her savings

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.060
to purchase a cow so that
her family could drink milk.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.076
So what does TechnoServe do?

00:09:26.076 --> 00:09:28.360
TechnoServe uses
business solutions

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.620
to help improve the lives
of people living in poverty

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.924
in developing worlds.

00:09:33.924 --> 00:09:36.590
So I'm going to actually turn it
over to Rick and Wendy Walleigh

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.200
now, who are going to talk
about their experiences

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.370
as Volunteer Consultants working
with TechnoServe in the field

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.225
and about their book
on that experience.

00:09:48.435 --> 00:09:49.310
RICK WALLEIGH: Great.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.360
Thanks, Megan.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.500
So what do you do after
a successful career

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.020
in Silicon Valley?

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.830
Obviously, move to Swaziland
and work with poor people

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.090
and work for a nonprofit.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.240
That's the obvious thing
to most high-tech veterans,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.990
but that is what Wendy
and I did a few years ago.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.460
And we'd like to
try and convince

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.680
you to think about doing
something similar at some point

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.010
in your life-- whether
you're at our stage,

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.310
where we were getting close to
a traditional retirement age,

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.900
or whether you just want to
take your career in a more

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.540
socially beneficial direction.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.000
In any case, neurologists
tell us that,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.350
if we want to keep our
brains young and active,

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.810
that we should challenge them
with new and different things.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.300
And I can tell you
that, by working

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.150
with poor people
in Africa, you will

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.040
be challenged and learn new
things that you can never

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.460
have imagined.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.290
For example, did you
know that, in Swaziland,

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.110
the traditional bride price
that a new husband would

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.650
have to pay to his future
father-in-law was 17 cows?

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.680
I never knew that,
but I learned.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.270
And I also learned that you
could negotiate a discount

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.493
if the bride was not a virgin.

00:11:04.493 --> 00:11:09.280
So, if the bride had a child
already or was obviously

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.930
pregnant when she
got married, that

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.690
was pretty much assured that
you could get a discount.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.520
Now, I should tell you that
I did not learn any of this

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.570
by personal experience,
even though polygamy is part

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.600
of traditional Swazi culture.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.730
I wasn't willing to go that
far for a local experience,

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.880
and Wendy might
have had something

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.470
to say about it, as well.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.800
But, from more of
a work perspective,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.960
I think you probably know
that our background is

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.030
in the high-tech industry
here in Silicon Valley.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.930
My education was in engineering
and business-- nothing

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.210
to do with agriculture.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.690
But if you work with poor
people in the developing world,

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.080
you're going to have
to work somewhere

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.300
in the agricultural value chain.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.480
75% of the world's poor
are smallholder farmers.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.770
So you will have to work
with them at some point,

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.220
in some way, if you're
going to work with the poor.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.250
And so, as I did
that, in working,

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.890
I ended up working in a number
of different agricultural value

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:18.390
chains.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.820
The one that I found
most fascinating

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.300
was the pork industry.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.930
And I love the terminology.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.430
Did you know that when
little piglets are born

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:29.800
they're called suckers?

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.480
And then, six weeks later,
they become weaners.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.850
That's W-E-A-N-E-R-S-- they
don't become the other kind

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.246
of hot dog wieners
till much later.

00:12:39.246 --> 00:12:48.050
So as males grow, they become
porkers and then baconers.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:52.540
The females become gilts,
which is analogous to a heifer,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.030
and then they become
breeding sows.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:13:01.130
And breeding sows have litters
of about 10 suckers every six

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.700
months for three years.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:09.700
And then, they become tired
sows-- no wonder, right?

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.810
And when they become
tired sows, their litters

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.750
start to decrease in size.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:20.620
And so, then they become
wieners-- the hot dog type--

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.200
because they get
sent to the butcher.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.930
So how did we get to Africa?

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.920
Well, as Wendy and
I got into our 50s,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.920
we started thinking about
wanting to do something

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.590
more directly socially
beneficial as the end

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.060
of our careers.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.210
And Wendy took the first step.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.230
And after thinking about
what she wanted to do,

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.230
she became the vice president
of marketing and development

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.120
for the local chapter
of Junior Achievement.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.440
And she took a
salary cut of 50%,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.940
but she got to work
in areas that she

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.430
was interested in--
entrepreneurship, education,

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.660
and youth, primarily
young women.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.820
So she did that for
three years, and then

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.650
I decided, well,
it's my turn, too.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.730
I want to do this, as well.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.750
I didn't know what I
wanted to do, though.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.830
So I started thinking about it.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:21.230
And as I did, I realized I
could do anything I wanted to.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.602
I didn't have to worry
about my next raise.

00:14:23.602 --> 00:14:25.310
I didn't have to worry
about a promotion.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.110
I didn't have to worry
about my next job.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:32.690
So I really expanded my mind
and thought about, well,

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.950
what would I like to do?

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:38.610
And so, to make a long story
short, I did a lot of research.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.680
I read about 15 books on
international development.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.480
I did a lot of
networking, and I found

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.300
TechnoServe, whose
tag line is "business

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.386
solutions to poverty."

00:14:50.386 --> 00:14:53.800
And with my background
and Wendy's background,

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:59.110
as well, they had roles that
we could fulfill and support.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:04.500
So I contacted the CEO, who
was Bruce McNamer at the time.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.000
I met with him and
talked about TechnoServe.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.430
And he introduced me to the
Volunteer Consultant Program.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.500
For those of you who
haven't heard of it,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.710
we call them volcons--
V-O-L-C-O-N-S--

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.160
Volunteer Consultants.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:25.400
And so, I was ready to sign
up for a role right away.

00:15:28.517 --> 00:15:29.600
WENDY WALLEIGH: I was not.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.240
Rick and I, over the
years, had talked

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.520
about living abroad,
the international career

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.380
assignment.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:44.860
Paris, London, Hong Kong
were what I imagined.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.350
When we started talking
about international economic

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.440
development, I
kind of understood

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.800
those were out of the picture.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.890
So I said, OK, I'm
willing to go along.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.730
You need to do
really good research

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.540
and make sure we're able
to do this financially,

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.650
because I figured we were not
going to make money on this.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:10.240
And I said, but I have
four absolute conditions

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.890
for any place we want to
go-- no flying bullets,

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:19.140
must have hot showers,
must have flush toilets,

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.940
and no countries with
"stan" in their names.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.600
So that eliminated a few
countries, but not many,

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.280
and probably eliminated much
of the Peace Corps work.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.880
But I figured, when
I was ready to leave,

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.400
I wanted to be in a place
where I could be generally

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.470
comfortable-- recognizing I was
going to move far, far away.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.770
So it took me a while
to get ready to leave

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:48.690
Junior Achievement.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.240
I had to finish a major project.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.100
But when I was ready, Rick and
I had both sent our resumes

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.500
to the volcon
manager at the time,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.000
and she sent them out
immediately to the country

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.315
directors across TechnoServe.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.390
And within less
than 48 hours, we

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.859
got a contact from the
Swaziland country director,

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.890
who had opportunities
for both of us

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.990
with each of our
different skill sets.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:22.710
And she said, can you
be here later this week?

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.060
We were not quite ready,
but, within a month,

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.850
we were living in Swaziland.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:33.160
So when some people ask, how
did you choose Swaziland?

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.280
We say, it chose us.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.030
So that's how we got there.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.910
RICK WALLEIGH: So the journey
from San Francisco to Swaziland

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.710
is about as far as
you can go on earth.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.380
It took us 36 hours--
two overnight legs,

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.780
four flights in
total-- and we finally

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.680
got to Matsapha
International Airport

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.990
near Manzini, Swaziland.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.210
Now Matsapha
International Airport

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.800
is a very, very small airport.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.200
Their whole boarding lounge
is less than half the size

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.300
of this room.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.070
And so, however, it's
Swaziland's only airport,

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.000
so by definition it's an
international airport.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.440
So we got there, and we were
hoping that our driver would

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.710
be outside and waiting for us.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.730
Fortunately, he was, and
he had pictures of us

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.320
so that he could
recognize who we were

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.180
as we came out of the lounge.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.890
But it wasn't a big problem,
since we were the only

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.170
white people on the plane.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:45.490
So we were easy to recognize.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:52.500
As got out of the airport,
we went into our office,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.940
saw the office, and
started our work.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:01.210
And I'll make it a
short part, go quickly

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.030
through our work experience.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:08.445
We worked in Swaziland for
six months, and, after that,

00:19:08.445 --> 00:19:11.490
we decided, well,
that wasn't bad.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.387
We feel like we could
tolerate some more,

00:19:14.387 --> 00:19:15.970
and we wanted to
contribute some more.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.990
So we asked the regional
vice president for Africa,

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.250
and he said, oh, yeah.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.320
Go up to Kenya for another
year and work up there.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.180
So we did that.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.710
So, in Swaziland, I worked
mostly with small businesses,

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:34.540
trying to help them create jobs,
create economic opportunity.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.290
Wendy worked
primarily to start up

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.940
a youth program,
which turned out

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.000
to be Junior Achievement
of Swaziland.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.640
We also worked on the business
plan competition in Swaziland.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.100
In Kenya, I took on a
different kind of role.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.460
I took on an internal role,
because the country directors

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.730
of Kenya and Uganda
were brand new.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.730
They'd never been
country directors before.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.860
They hadn't had those kind of
management responsibilities.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.030
So I worked to support
them, primarily

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.120
on improving project
management and improving

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.180
internal financial management.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:18.380
Wendy worked primarily,
again, on youth programs

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.950
with Young Women in Enterprise.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.980
And then, once again, we both
worked on the business plan

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.030
competition.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.877
So would you like
to show some slides?

00:20:29.877 --> 00:20:30.710
WENDY WALLEIGH: Yes.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.698
RICK WALLEIGH: OK.

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.686
WENDY WALLEIGH:
So I'll let you--

00:20:34.686 --> 00:20:36.250
RICK WALLEIGH: I'll click.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.710
WENDY WALLEIGH: Most of
these are-- well, first

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.540
of all, let's start with, for
those not familiar with where

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.970
the heck Swaziland
is-- as you can see,

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.710
it's surrounded on three sides
by South Africa and one side

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:51.570
by Mozambique.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.890
It is landlocked.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.450
It is a tiny country.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.610
I think it's under the
size of New Jersey,

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.460
bigger than Rhode Island,
just to give you an idea.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.970
And it's about a million
people, versus Kenya,

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:09.040
which has its own coastline
and has I don't know how many

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.920
millions of people.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.540
40--

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.230
RICK WALLEIGH: 30, I think.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.480
WENDY WALLEIGH: 30-40 million.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.750
And the city of Nairobi
has about four million.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.990
So we went from a city of
Mbabane, which is 100,000,

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.570
to a city of four million.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.020
OK.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.530
This, in my estimation,
is a tired sow.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.760
She certainly looks
tired, and I'm not

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.400
sure you can count
every single piglet,

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.520
but I think it's a
slightly smaller litter.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.166
So we're just going to
call her a tired sow.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.960
Rick and I were able
to finish projects

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.300
while we were in our
six months in Swaziland.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.660
I was very excited that
we were able to establish

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:53.390
Junior Achievement of Swaziland,
and we piloted our first class

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.340
before we left.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.400
So Rick and I each taught part
of this class called, Personal

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.230
Economics.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.650
And the goal of the class is
to teach kids about managing

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.860
their money, the
importance of staying

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.110
in school to get a career,
how you have to negotiate

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.550
in the world at large.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:17.070
And one of the things that
we had a talk about was debt.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.630
Now, thinking about it,
most of the curriculum

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.680
is based on Western knowledge
and it was a Western curriculum

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.390
that I adapted.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:30.070
But it still was pretty
based in Western culture.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:35.330
And one of the elements
was credit card debt.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:39.700
And the kids said, that's
the most stupid thing

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.070
I've ever heard.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.346
Why would you spend more
money than you have?

00:22:46.082 --> 00:22:51.320
As Megan and Rick
referred to, Swaziland

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.720
helps-- or TechnoServe with
agricultural value chains.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.510
Sometimes they help the
farmers, and sometimes they

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:03.370
help people like this, which is
Eswatini Kitchens in Swaziland.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.850
And they process
fruits and vegetables

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.550
from the local
smallholder farmers.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.210
So they take in stuff
that is grown locally

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:18.130
and to make sauces,
including ketchup, and fruits

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.860
and vegetable sauces.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.320
And they cook it on
pretty primitive stoves--

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.480
kind of like a burner like this,
with the pot that's that big,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.300
and that's how they do it.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.590
And yet, they're able to
get fair trade certified

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.100
and are selling in Sweden,
and Germany, in South Africa,

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:37.900
and Swaziland.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:43.010
So that is pretty impressive
for an operation that size.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:46.250
So that was Eswatini Kitchens.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.250
That's Rick.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:54.206
And, yes, one of these
are what he was wearing.

00:23:54.206 --> 00:23:59.290
So, Rick, our son Adrian who
came to visit us, and Mkhululi

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.100
was one of our colleagues
in the office, his daughter,

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.660
and his wife Katie.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.960
And, particularly,
Mkhululi persuaded us

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.210
that he thought,
when we were going

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.100
to attend the national
major festival,

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.480
called the Annual
Reed Dance, that we

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.360
needed to go in costume.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.960
And so, the nature of
the Annual Reed Dance

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.110
is that the traditional
homes are made out

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:34.130
of reeds, kind of like a
shaped dome made out of reeds.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.210
And the theory is that,
every year, the queen mother

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:41.490
needs to have her
reed home repaired.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.550
So all the young women
across the entire country

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:50.010
gather reeds and bring
them to this one location

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.170
to help the queen
mother rebuild her home.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.840
That's part one
of the operation.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:01.350
Part two is that then these
young women sing and parade

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.150
in front of the
king in the hopes

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.506
that they will be his next wife.

00:25:06.506 --> 00:25:12.220
So Mswati-- it's Mswati,
right-- the Third, I think.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.700
But he was the king at the time.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.870
He was already on
wife number 14.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.140
So, I think now
he has number 15.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.951
His father had 83 wives.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:25.700
We were not going to go there.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.820
But in any case, so
there we were in costume,

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:35.450
and we entered this very
large football-like stadium.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:40.610
And we were certainly only a
handful-- among only a handful

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.620
of white people.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:45.710
And we had to walk across
the whole end of the stadium

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.620
to get where we could sit.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.340
I think we had as much attention
on us as the young women.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.180
Well, the other thing about
the young women that was unique

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.061
is that they were topless.

00:25:59.061 --> 00:26:01.600
About a decade ago,
they were naked.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:09.670
But they had a little PC and
were able to just be topless.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:14.100
So, obviously, Rick and
Adrian, our son, enjoyed that.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.650
But even they said, after the
first 10,000 pairs of boobs,

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.140
they kind of all look alike.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.281
So we left.

00:26:24.281 --> 00:26:28.340
One of the programs that I
worked on when we were in Kenya

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.680
was called Upscaling.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.980
And this program helped
small, micro businesses

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.840
grow to expand the
number of employees

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.250
that they would be able to hire.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.350
And this was Aspen Orchards.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.200
They created yogurt drinks.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.270
And it started pretty
small, out of his own home--

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.940
the gentleman who ran it-- and
cooked pretty much like you

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.870
saw in the Eswatini Kitchens--
a single, big burner

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.600
stove with a big pot.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.250
And he was very
successful in his area

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.600
and was bottling yogurt
drinks and selling them

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.890
to the local markets.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.940
And they were very popular.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.340
So he had an internal
process for getting

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.460
the bottles ready for market.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.820
You can see the labels.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:18.372
And every bottle
was hand-labeled.

00:27:18.372 --> 00:27:21.930
And every bottle
was hand-sealed.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.730
So the little foil tops that
you see in a lot of things,

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.740
they use an iron to
iron those on by hand.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.600
So the good news is
they were able to hire

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.330
a number of local youth
to actually do this.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.680
So he was a very
successful small business.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.130
We helped him with his
finance and accounting

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.090
so that he would be able
to grow his business.

00:27:45.626 --> 00:27:48.510
I was also involved with
Young Women in Enterprise,

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:50.906
as Rick mentioned.

00:27:50.906 --> 00:27:52.990
This is the Mathare,
which is one

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.340
of the major slums in Nairobi.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.200
This is a typical back
street, if you will,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.270
or back alley behind the
homes that look like that.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:10.620
They are powered
by propane lights,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:15.210
and you have to walk, even
in here, to get your water.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.930
So it's pretty
primitive, but it's

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.152
right on the edge of Nairobi.

00:28:20.152 --> 00:28:23.220
The program, Young
Women in Enterprise,

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.420
gathers young women from
different circumstances,

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.200
often in communities like
this, and teaches them

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.200
how to behave in business,
how to run a business,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.055
and it also teaches
life skills--

00:28:36.055 --> 00:28:39.920
so some commonality with Junior
Achievement, plus the life

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.300
skills.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.633
And it was totally
funded by Nike.

00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:49.640
And that's a Nike representative
in the back who came to visit.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.950
So we took him on
a tour of Mathare.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.830
And that's Esta Proshoto--
not Esta Proshoto,

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.190
that's another person.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.600
RICK WALLEIGH: Kamau.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.058
WENDY WALLEIGH:
Kamau-- Esta Kamau.

00:28:59.058 --> 00:29:01.490
Who was one of our
colleagues on the program.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.290
So we were giving him
a tour of the area.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.242
This is one of the businesses.

00:29:07.242 --> 00:29:09.980
And this young woman,
who's kind of bending over

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.280
in the back, her business
was selling hot boiled milk

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.400
to local people in
her Mathare area.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.615
And, again, she used a
pretty primitive stove

00:29:21.615 --> 00:29:25.290
and a pretty primitive
pot, and took milk in,

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.350
boiled it so it was
clean, and sold it

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:32.570
to people and to
little kids, and was

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.190
able to make money at it.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.410
The young women that
were helped were often

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.540
what they called school
leavers, which we call dropouts.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:46.880
So giving them the tools to
be able to have a business

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.160
or be employed
successfully in a business

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.610
was really important to them.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:57.700
And being able to handle
their various relatives, who

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.720
might want to take
advantage of them,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.931
was also a big element
of what we were doing.

00:30:03.931 --> 00:30:06.510
This young woman is
Cecilia Katungwa.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:12.110
She was the winner of
the regional competition.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:16.080
So, once the young women went
through their class exercises,

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.420
they will then be able to
create a three-page business

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.550
plan, which they then had
to present to local judges

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.752
from the business community.

00:30:27.752 --> 00:30:32.410
And the winners of those
club contests, or community

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:38.570
contests, were then went to the
regional contest in Nairobi.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:42.140
And Cecilia was
the winner of that.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.390
She had started a
knitting business, where

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.120
she took a little
knitting machine-- a hand

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.340
one, not anything
that was electrified,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.330
a hand knitting machine--
and created clothing

00:30:54.330 --> 00:31:01.040
for babies, sweaters, vests,
scarves, et cetera, for adults.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.320
And she was
extremely articulate.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.150
I don't know if you can see
it, but it's like 30,000--

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:11.160
what looks like $30,000
but it's Kenya shillings,

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.760
which amounts to
maybe $300-$400,

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.950
depending on the exchange.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.930
But that was her grand prize.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.312
Amazing young woman.

00:31:19.312 --> 00:31:22.430
We talked about the
value chain that's

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.780
typical in what a project
of TechnoServe's is.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.820
This was matoke
farmers in Uganda.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.760
We went to visit them with some
other people from TechnoServe.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.630
And the matoke banana
is a starch banana,

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.060
different from
what we have, which

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.960
is considered a dessert banana.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.455
But what they do
is the matoke are

00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:51.540
cooked while the fruit
is green and then mashed

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.010
as if it were mashed potatoes.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.480
And it's a staple
in the Ugandan diet.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:02.090
So, every week, as part of
the training, the young--

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.650
the farmers who became
part of the training

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:11.470
would go to a marketplace and
carry their 50 to 100 pound

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:16.340
bunches of bananas on whatever
mechanism they could do it.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.850
Sometimes it was pull
carts that they pulled.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.200
Sometimes it was donkeys.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.820
And sometimes it was bicycles.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.610
But they knew that every
week, at a certain time,

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.970
they would get their
matoke to market

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:30.430
and know that they
would get money,

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.440
which is a major
improvement over what

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.450
they had been able to do.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.330
And here's a woman
who was receiving

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:41.910
some training on
fertilizer and irrigation,

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.580
as part of the matoke project.

00:32:46.466 --> 00:32:49.910
And this is a
farming couple, also

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.761
part of the matoke project.

00:32:52.761 --> 00:32:56.600
They had noticed
that beans, which

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.890
are an incredibly
important staple in Uganda,

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:04.300
the beans got low prices
during the harvest, when

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.590
they were plentiful, but
could be charged higher prices

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.040
during those off times.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.970
And so they borrowed
money, got money

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.960
from their relatives
and friends,

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.640
and used some of
their own money,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:25.200
and began storing dried
beans for those times when

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.930
they could make more money.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.140
So, in essence,
unbeknownst to them,

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:35.470
they independently created
leveraged commodity buying.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.540
This is a group that we talked
with when we were there--

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.600
one of the groups of
farmers who wanted to meet

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.580
was with us when
we were visiting.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:48.840
And they had the desire
to ask questions and get

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.580
as much information from
us as we could provide.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.480
And they also requested that we
help them open up the US matoke

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.860
market.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.000
Unfortunately, we had
to tell them there

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.290
was no matoke market in the US.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:08.860
They were disappointed,
but they were obviously

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:13.780
trying to be very enterprising
in their perspective of life.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.350
And they asked me
to take a picture

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.960
with the women in the group.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.230
They were delightful people.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.804
And this was my new friend.

00:34:21.804 --> 00:34:25.620
Along with beans,
most farmers had

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.060
secondary income from their
livestock-- goats, cows,

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.989
chickens, et cetera.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.020
Rick would not let me
take him home with us,

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.082
but he was my friend.

00:34:37.082 --> 00:34:40.850
This is a mall that was about
a quarter to a half a mile

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.350
from where we lived in Nairobi.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.060
It was called Westgate Mall.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.550
I don't know if you are
familiar with that name.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.699
That was the mall
that was blown up

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:55.300
by Al-Shabaab a
couple of years ago.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.139
67 people died.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:01.690
100 and some odd 50,
60 people were severely

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:06.280
injured by four men who
came in and just took over.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.220
This is the mall that was
where we went to most weekends.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.700
It's where we shopped for food.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:11.900
It's where we ate.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.540
It was walking distance
from our apartment,

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.930
and we went there every weekend.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:19.565
So it was horribly upsetting
to hear about that.

00:35:19.565 --> 00:35:22.705
The good news was it just
reopened this past summer.

00:35:22.705 --> 00:35:26.722
So it's back to, hopefully,
looking something like that.

00:35:26.722 --> 00:35:28.430
RICK WALLEIGH: One of
our main objectives

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:31.370
in writing this book
was, as I said before,

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.210
to encourage other
people-- whether you're

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:38.460
our age or your age-- to go
out and experiment and try

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:43.910
something like this and find
your own next chapter that

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.095
can have both purpose
and adventure.

00:35:46.095 --> 00:35:49.600
And in the book, we give
a number of suggestions

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:54.160
on thinking about this
and what you should do.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.430
And I'll just give
you a couple today.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.450
The first one is do
something that excites you.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:05.050
Particularly if you're our
age and you're doing this

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.890
as the last stage
in your career,

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.530
all the restrictions are off.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.690
You don't have to do
what you've always done.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.410
You can think about new things.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:21.050
And, if you've always had an
idea in the back of your head

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:24.240
that you wanted to do something
or experiment with something,

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.000
that's the time to do it.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.690
You can also do this at a
break in your career, as well.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:33.727
And it's a great
opportunity to have a chance

00:36:33.727 --> 00:36:35.310
to explore something
new and different

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.900
and help people
at the same time.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.315
The other suggestion
I would have

00:36:42.315 --> 00:36:45.720
is to do something that makes
you feel good about yourself.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.210
Particularly as you get
later in your career,

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.980
people start to think
about their legacy,

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.220
and they think about asking
questions, such as am I

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.970
proud of my life, am I
proud of what I've done,

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:04.770
am I happy if I look back on my
life at what I've accomplished.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.630
And when they do
that, people start

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.400
to think about giving back,
particularly if they've

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.320
been fortunate in their lives.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.530
And that's a real opportunity
to do something good

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.970
for the world, but
also psychologists

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:24.530
tell us that people that
do things for other people

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.300
feel happier themselves.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.160
And so, I would urge
you to think about that,

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.340
to do those kinds of things.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.810
And what's important is not
what other people think,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.720
but what you think
about yourself.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.330
Now, on the other
hand, I can tell you

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.250
that it does feel good when
somebody else recognizes

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:48.020
what you have done
and compliments you.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:52.520
I had an experience
that way in Swaziland.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.610
I mentioned the business
plan competition,

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:58.600
where we not only took
in the business plans,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.550
but we trained people
in business concepts

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.790
along the way.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.770
And, one day, I was at
the Swazi Sun Hotel,

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.130
and a young man walked up to me.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.610
He introduced himself.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:11.180
His name was Thembisa.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.690
I didn't recognize him
at first, but he knew me.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:17.750
And he said that I had
done some of the training

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:18.820
that he had attended.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.440
And he'd been a participant in
the business plan competition.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.090
He had had the idea to start
up a mobile hair salon,

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.460
where he would
take his equipment,

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.100
go to people's houses--
particularly in off hours--

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.150
and then cut and
color their hair.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:38.110
And he'd been thinking about
doing that for a long time,

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:41.740
but he hadn't had the
confidence to actually start up

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.360
the business.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.960
He felt like he knew about
some parts of the business

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.350
but not the other parts.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.710
And so that had held him back.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.320
But, with the training
that TechnoServe gave,

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.980
he had confidence that he was
going to go out and start up

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.200
his business.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:04.780
And so, he was very thankful
that we had come to TechnoServe

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.930
and had come to Swaziland
and that TechnoServe

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:12.000
had put on this business
plan competition.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.394
And he had been a semifinalist.

00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:16.810
He didn't make it
into the finals,

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.770
but we were doing some more
work with the semifinalists

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:21.230
to keep them going.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:25.690
And he said he really thanked
God for sending TechnoServe

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.430
to Swaziland and us included.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:32.400
So I felt rewarded
much more than I

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.110
deserved with that experience.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:39.580
So, in conclusion, just do it.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.400
Go out there, be
adventurous, have fun,

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.110
do something good for the
world, and feel good about it

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:47.180
yourself.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.344
So thank you.

00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:53.357
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:55.290
AUDIENCE: The role
of technology-- so,

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.660
you know, you're going in,
you're working with farmers,

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.590
things like.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.132
How do you see--
and I actually don't

00:40:00.132 --> 00:40:01.506
know when you were
in Swaziland--

00:40:01.506 --> 00:40:02.830
but how do you see technology?

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.410
Especially, working at
Google, can our products

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:08.500
even help solve any
of these problems

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.260
that you're dealing with
in these small areas?

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:15.490
I'm just curious, because
I think, as a lot of Google

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:18.630
is focusing on emerging
markets and places in Africa,

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.810
where they have mobile phones,
they're growing very rapidly,

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:24.180
and we want to figure
out how can we help

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.350
in these kind of situations?

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.290
I'd love to hear your
thoughts on that.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:28.123
RICK WALLEIGH: Yeah.

00:40:28.123 --> 00:40:31.670
Absolutely there's
opportunities for technology.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:35.810
We already are doing a number
of things with technology.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:39.170
And, as smart
phones get cheaper,

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.420
there will be a lot
more opportunities.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.560
Some of the things
that are available now

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.180
in some countries, I
think you've probably

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.100
heard of M-Pesa in Kenya.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.480
If you haven't heard about
it, this is basically

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.440
banking on your phone.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.000
So, without a bank
account in a bank,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.250
it's just through the phone,
through the phone company,

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.690
you can send and receive money.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:08.830
You can have a balance,
and it's very simple.

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:12.540
They're way ahead of
us in that regard.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.640
There's a lot of communication
that happens with farmers,

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:21.560
both directions-- telling
farmers what the prices are

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.620
in various markets
for their produce

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.520
so that they can choose to go
to this town, or this town,

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.710
or that town to
sell their produce.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:34.520
There are advisories coming
out that say, OK, now

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.620
is the time to apply
fertilizer, or think

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.432
about pruning your trees.

00:41:40.432 --> 00:41:44.160
There's a lot of work going
on today-- a lot of concern

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.100
about traceability of food
through the value chain.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.490
Particularly if
there's a problem,

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.180
people want to
search back and say,

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.120
where did that problem come from
so that we can eliminate it.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.330
But a lot of concern--
a lot of requirements,

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:03.790
particularly to get into the
EU for the traceability of

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:04.750
produce.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:10.340
And so technology offers a lot
of opportunity there with GPS

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:19.020
tracking and being able to link
the location of the farm that

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.800
produced some produce
and tracking that

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.340
through the value chain.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:32.062
So some other
examples-- we've set up

00:42:32.062 --> 00:42:37.470
a portal that is a coffee
transparency portal,

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:45.030
where, for each co-op,
we show the price

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.160
that the co-op
paid to the farmer

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.590
for their coffee and the price
that they got in the market.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:57.390
And so, this is a way to
make everything visible.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.350
Because there's a
lot of corruption,

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:00.630
as you probably know.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:05.080
And sometimes the people that
run the co-ops skim a little

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.170
off the top as it goes through.

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:11.830
And so, if you see that
your co-op is giving you

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:14.240
a lot lower price
than everybody else,

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.720
you start to ask questions.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.750
And so, there's a few examples.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:22.730
But there are lots more
opportunities, and, as I say,

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.000
regular, traditional cell
phones are really cheap,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.120
and they're pervasive, and
text messaging is really cheap.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:36.270
With smart phones, there's
lots of opportunities,

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:38.480
and hopefully they'll
come down in price.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.355
And there will be more
and more things to do.

00:43:42.355 --> 00:43:43.980
WENDY WALLEIGH: But
still, the internet

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.274
is not the dominant
means of communication.

00:43:47.274 --> 00:43:48.260
RICK WALLEIGH: Yeah.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.140
WENDY WALLEIGH: There's
no infrastructure in place

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:50.639
to do that.

00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:54.110
So I think phones will probably
be the dominant communication

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:55.897
tool for quite a while longer.

00:43:55.897 --> 00:43:56.980
RICK WALLEIGH: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.480
AUDIENCE: So one of
the biggest problems

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.370
I faced, when I
was in Panama, when

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.410
trying to use business for
sustainable development,

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:07.870
was trying to change the
villagers mindsets of,

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.371
kind of like what you mentioned
with the credit card of they

00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:12.745
couldn't even conceive of the
fact of spending more money

00:44:12.745 --> 00:44:13.330
than they had.

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:16.370
Well, when I tried to explain
the fact of making a profit,

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:20.340
they didn't really understand
why would they sell something

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:22.950
to someone who needed
it for more money

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:24.720
than maybe that
person had to offer.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.202
And it was very nice to see
that, from my point of view,

00:44:28.202 --> 00:44:29.910
in this selflessness
that we don't really

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:32.690
see too often here in kind
of a competitive culture.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:36.490
But, in the sense that business
development, to be sustainable,

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.470
of course, you need to make
money to have these savings,

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:42.210
and I'm just curious if
in Swaziland you kind of

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.710
met some resistance to that
kind of just a cultural mindset,

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:47.310
or--?

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.220
RICK WALLEIGH: We
didn't see exactly that,

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.790
but what we've seen in
a number of countries

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:59.850
is also a cultural mindset
of how can I be successful?

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:02.250
We've done a number of
programs with youth,

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:05.950
who just see things
the way they are,

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.070
see what their
parents did, and they

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:12.620
don't have an idea that they
can actually have a business

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.640
and make money.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:18.110
Particularly in farming-- as I
said, 75% of the world's poor

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:23.010
are smallholder farmers, and
it's primarily subsistence.

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:27.130
They don't think about, well,
gee if you have extra milk,

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:28.270
you could sell it.

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:30.510
Or, if you have a
couple of chickens,

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:31.700
you could sell the eggs.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.100
Or, you could have
subsistence crops over here

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.110
to feed your family, and you
can have a cash crop over here

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:39.290
and make a cash income.

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:43.630
And so, a lot of the training
that we've done with youth

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:48.230
has been to open up their
eyes about opportunities

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:53.210
and to give them the confidence
that they can do it themselves.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:58.040
So, different cultural
issues, but cultural issues--

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.140
analogous cultural issues.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.570
WENDY WALLEIGH: I think
the other thing is it often

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:07.710
takes a leader who is going
to take a risk to kind of be

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.720
at the forefront of
whatever recruitment

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.720
you're trying to put in place.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:18.130
And so, TechnoServe often
looks for the local leaders

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.550
in an area and pull
them in, and then

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:26.930
people go, well, if he's doing
it, maybe I should do that.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:30.240
So it's kind of almost like
a standard business practice

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.610
where you look for people
who are risk takers,

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:35.820
and you try to bring
them to what you want

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.660
them to start being able to do.

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:43.030
And then, it kind of
ripples out from there.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.140
AUDIENCE: So I'm a
little bit curious

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.790
about how, specifically, your--
you said you had an engineering

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.470
and sales background--
how that sort of allowed

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:56.300
you, what skills you were
able to gain there, how that

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.360
specifically allowed you
to help in Swaziland--

00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.880
sort of the application of that.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:00.630
RICK WALLEIGH: OK.

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:02.770
Well, it didn't teach
me to be a pig farmer,

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:11.090
but TechnoServe's approach is
business solutions to poverty.

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:14.150
So we believe in building
up the private sector,

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:19.110
independent businesses, to
get people out of poverty.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.610
And so, in Swaziland,
I was primarily

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.720
working with small businesses.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.260
Now, I couldn't
advise the pig farmers

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:31.180
on how to feed the pigs
better, or take care of them

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:35.730
better, whatever-- but I could
teach them about finances

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:38.920
and get them to look
at their business

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.860
and whether they were
making money or not.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:46.510
I worked with
another company that

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:50.640
was trying to pressure-treat
poles for telephone poles,

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.170
and I put together a
business plan for them,

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:59.010
so that they could get
financing to build the factory

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:02.960
to do the pressure
treating, et cetera.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.740
So that's the kind of thing.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.080
I used my business skills.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:15.840
I didn't have to learn baking,
or water treatment, or raising

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.480
pigs, or what have you.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.772
So yeah.

00:48:18.772 --> 00:48:22.410
We've given this talk,
or similar talks,

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.030
at a number of different venues.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:28.940
And a month or so ago, we
were at the Los Altos Library,

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:33.170
and, at the end of the talk,
the woman in the back row

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:35.160
raised her hand
and said, well, I

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:41.420
came tonight, because I had been
in Swaziland after you left.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:45.680
And I lived there a couple
of years with my husband.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.060
And she said the
strangest thing-- Thembisa

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.570
used to cut my hair.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.220
He would come to my
house and cut my hair.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.560
And he did a great job.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.330
And so, I was really
pleased to hear about that.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:01.120
So that was a great experience.

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.680
One more thing-- after
the presentation,

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.970
feel free to take a book.

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:10.660
They've got donation envelopes
in there for TechnoServe.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.030
So hopefully you will give
TechnoServe a donation,

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.424
but feel free to take one.

00:49:14.424 --> 00:49:16.840
MEGAN MOYERMAN: I'm just going
to talk about ways that you

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.670
can get involved, as
well, with TechnoServe

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:20.360
if you're interested.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:25.609
The first way is very
similar, or the same as what

00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:27.900
Rick and Wendy did, is through
the Volunteer Consultant

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.410
Program.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.366
I'm actually the
manager of that program.

00:49:31.366 --> 00:49:35.110
And then also through the
Global Advisory Council.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.719
And Lindsey knows a lot
about that, as well.

00:49:38.719 --> 00:49:41.260
Volunteer Consultant Program--
again, Rick and Wendy Walleigh

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.810
did this.

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:46.340
We have been around
since about 2001.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:51.682
We've engaged more than
970 Volunteer Consultants.

00:49:51.682 --> 00:49:53.140
We've sent them
out into the field.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.520
They work with our
full-time staff

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.020
to further the mission
of TechnoServe.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:03.290
We send them to places
in Africa, in India,

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:06.992
and also Latin America,
and the Caribbean.

00:50:06.992 --> 00:50:09.530
And they could go for about,
anywhere from two to three

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:11.060
months to 12 months.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.105
Sometimes people will
do two-year projects.

00:50:14.105 --> 00:50:16.730
So they'll do one year, and then
they'll do a whole other year.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:18.430
But that's a little less common.

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:20.102
So if you're interested
in that or you

00:50:20.102 --> 00:50:21.810
want to learn a little
bit more about it,

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:22.950
feel free to talk to me.

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:25.980
Also our site is there.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:30.490
So technoserve.org/volunteer,
so you can read more there,

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:33.106
and the applications is there.

00:50:33.106 --> 00:50:37.360
The other option is through
the Global Advisory Council.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.820
And we call them GAC members.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.830
So GAC members, they're
ambassadors for TechnoServe.

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:46.390
So they help with
financial support,

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:49.760
but they also help
with strategic advice.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.630
They give strategic
advice, and they also

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:56.120
help connect TechnoServe
with other people

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.590
and other organizations,
and hopefully

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:02.300
help with increasing the
support for TechnoServe, too.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.250
So there are some really
interesting things

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.600
that I think you can
get involved with.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.900
If you did decide to
be part of the GAC,

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.590
there's an annual meeting that
happens in December every year.

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:16.085
And I think, Rick, you spoke
to the last one, right?

00:51:16.085 --> 00:51:16.895
RICK WALLEIGH: Yes.

00:51:16.895 --> 00:51:19.330
MEGAN MOYERMAN: So
that was interesting.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:22.830
There is also council meetings.

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:26.430
There are reports that you get
to receive about TechnoServe

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:29.080
that other people outside
don't actually get to see.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.850
And then, there's
actually field visits.

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:33.909
So, for instance, I
think Peru was one.

00:51:33.909 --> 00:51:34.700
AUDIENCE: Ethiopia.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.200
MEGAN MOYERMAN:
Ethiopia is another.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.190
So you get to see what
TechnoServe projects do

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.950
and meet some of the
beneficiaries, too.

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:42.658
I think that's a really
interesting part.

00:51:42.658 --> 00:51:47.630
There are some requests
for being a GAC member.

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:50.620
There is a annual
gift of $2,500,

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:56.072
and then, also, to help
further TechnoServe's name,

00:51:56.072 --> 00:51:57.530
get the name out
there, and to help

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:00.160
connect us to other
supporters, as well.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.740
So those are a
couple ways you can

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.570
get involved with
TechnoServe, and feel

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:06.740
free to talk to us about
it if you're interested.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.250
But, otherwise,
that's where we are.

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:12.196
We're located in DC.

00:52:12.196 --> 00:52:16.060
That's actually where I am, too,
and I think that's pretty much

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:16.810
it.

00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:18.726
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, a
huge thank you, again,
