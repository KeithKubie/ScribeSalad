1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.233
Okay.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.650
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.
Jess,</v>

3
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:10.140
before Friday,
Monday morning podcast in,

4
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:14.350
<v 2>ah,</v>

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.850
<v 1>just checking it on you.
I'm just checking in to see how your week's going out.</v>

6
00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:23.530
Fuck you're doing and everything and you're fucking lap.
Um,

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.910
all right,
let's get into it.
Uh,
I already recorded this podcast.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.200
I recorded it from my movie trailer,
um,
yesterday,

9
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:35.140
but for some reason the file corrupted.

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.630
So now I have to do it again,

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.700
which is all right because I would have made a fool of myself because I thought

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.700
last night was game three of the NBA finals and game five of the Stanley Cup

13
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:49.631
final.
I'm like,

14
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:53.500
why can't those two leaks get on the same fucking page and kind of,
you know,

15
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.660
just pick different nights.
But evidently that's already happened.
So,
um,

16
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.080
I apologize to the NBA and the NFL Nhl for the podcasts that they never heard.

17
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.880
Um,
I actually watched game a fucking three last night

18
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.450
of a Toronto verse,
uh,
Golden State Warriors.
And um,

19
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.470
yeah,
it was great game.
It was just,
you know,
just watching Toronto,

20
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.260
no matter how much golden state kept coming back,
they just kept,

21
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:26.540
they couldn't cut it less than fucking 10 or nine.

22
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.300
They stayed out in front of them.
They hit some big shots,

23
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:33.560
they blocked a bunch of shots and all of that shit.
Um,

24
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.210
you know,
this is a,
and it was very easy.

25
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.930
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.900
<v 1>To root for Toronto.
You know,</v>

27
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.200
it was very easy to root for because they weren't cutting the Drake every five

28
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.100
fucking seconds.
Whatever the hell they're doing.
Like I tune,

29
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.310
I'm tuning in to watch the raptors first,
the warriors.

30
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
I'm not tuning in to watch Drake,
watch the raptors in the warriors.

31
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.670
I don't understand it.
All right.
But I've already covered that.
So anyway,
um,

32
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.450
congratulations to them.
Um,
I didn't see clay play.
My,
I don't know,

33
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.720
I don't know shit about basketball,
but it seemed like,
um,

34
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.830
he wasn't playing that much either.
But,
um,
we'll say,
well,

35
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.960
we will see what happens.
Well,
you know what?
His fucking,
you know,

36
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.200
it's getting like fucking becoming a trope though,

37
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.230
is them cutting to Toronto sports fans standing outside their fucking arena,

38
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.540
uh,
in,
in,
you know,
every time I see that I'm just like,

39
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:33.900
I don't want to watch these people fucking hang their heads in misery of another

40
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.550
God damn loss.
It would be,

41
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.590
I'm still rooting for Toronto despite all that other bs that's going on out

42
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:42.750
there.
So congratulations to them.

43
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.080
You two victories away from your first bucket championship,

44
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.980
at least at basketball and hockey.
Since I've been alive,

45
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.160
I don't know what's been going on with your,
uh,

46
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.500
what do you got the Toronto or was it the argonauts?
Ah,
the rough riders.

47
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.880
The stampede,
the eagles number,
roads.
I don't know.

48
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.260
I don't know anything about the CFL.
The Eskimos.
Um,

49
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.350
all right,
let's,
let's talk about what I really want to talk about.

50
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.750
Let's talk a bottle of Saint Louis blows

51
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.310
coming back in game four and quite frankly,
kicking the shit out of my boss,

52
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.890
the Bruins.

53
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.780
I've never seen a Bruins team get manhandled like this in my 40 years of

54
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.471
watching them.

55
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:31.471
And we are simply not built for the kind of hockey that Saint Louis is playing.

56
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.060
And neither was Saint Louis,
I'm sorry,
neither was San Jose.

57
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:42.061
And the result of that was their top three players were unable to finish the

58
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:46.500
series.
And um,
I don't know,

59
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.130
this is going to be weird.
I,
I,
this is,
this is what I believe.
Okay.

60
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:55.660
This is somebody who never got beyond fucking pond hockey,

61
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.720
you know,
in that sport.
Even then I wasn't even good on the pond across,

62
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.770
over one side,
couldn't,
could stop on one side,
couldn't skate backwards.
Um,

63
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800
the way Saint Louis has playing the Bruins named to wrap it up by game six or I

64
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:14.770
don't see us winning it because I don't think we're going to have enough good

65
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:15.760
players left.

66
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.783
<v 3>MMM.</v>

67
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.610
<v 1>Cause they're just taken runs at everybody and they're running our goalie and</v>

68
00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:25.970
they're playing a trap defense.

69
00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:30.830
So the way to beat those guys is you have to get up,

70
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.690
you got a score first,

71
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.010
which will hopefully make them take more chances.

72
00:04:37.011 --> 00:04:39.830
So they're not just going to play that fucking stupid trap defense.

73
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.370
We've got to dump and chase,
um,
you know,

74
00:04:43.371 --> 00:04:47.000
so they can protect their fucking astoundingly mediocre goaltender.

75
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.460
Um,
but I will say this,
I've,
I've been a fan of,

76
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.000
of not only sports,
but sports is history.

77
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.380
And this is my prediction.
If Saint Louis wins the cup,

78
00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:02.060
which they could very well do.

79
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.000
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

80
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.290
<v 1>Which I felt from the beginning,</v>

81
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.410
which is why I never understood people gonna do it.

82
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:12.190
We're gonna fucking sweep these guys.
It's like they are big and they're fast.
Um,

83
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.190
I didn't realize how filthy they were though.
Um,

84
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.570
which is fine though cause it's fucking playoff hockey and this has always

85
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:21.280
happened.
But the problem is,

86
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.020
is that because of all the whiny snowflake concepts out there who kept

87
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.660
pressuring them to get fighting out of the game,

88
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.950
what I'm actually watching is a different kind of of greenery.

89
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.440
It's funny that the goons used,
used to fucking police.

90
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.800
Um,
I dunno.
And I just think the direction that this,
this game,

91
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:52.801
when we got rid of too many Sean Thorton's and too many fucking Adam McQuaids

92
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.360
because those are the guys that we're missing right now,
when we would easily,

93
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.720
easily be able to handle St Louis and we would easily beat them.

94
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.010
But considering what,

95
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:09.011
just sort of a speed finesse team and the way the officials I guess,

96
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.220
cause it's the playoffs are calling it,
which once again,

97
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:15.230
I don't really have a problem with it.
I didn't have a problem with,

98
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:17.000
I have a problem with the fact that there's no

99
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.633
<v 3>mmm.</v>

100
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.500
<v 1>That there's no,
uh,
there's no fighting.
I just,
you know,</v>

101
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.920
we should have a guy up go out there and go kick the fuck out of one of the

102
00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:31.150
blues.
So they calm the fuck down and we just haven't,
so why would they stop?

103
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.470
It's been working for them.
So this is what I think if Saint Louis wins this,

104
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.050
then
I,

105
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.220
and they're not,
you know,
reprimanded for the way that they're playing.

106
00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:50.221
Then that just sends the message that this is the direction to go in and what's

107
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:52.540
going to be,
I don't know.

108
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:57.440
It's fucked because the people that are gonna suffer our,

109
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.140
are not going to be the fucking dirt bags skating around with their fucking

110
00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:05.050
sticks up crosscheck and people in the fucking teeth.

111
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.540
The people who are going to suffer are the stars of the leaks,

112
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:10.900
the terrorists Sankoh's they're going to pay for it.
And I,

113
00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:11.890
that goes all the way back to,

114
00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:14.800
I remember back in the day when I'm the Tennessee titans,

115
00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:19.150
when there was still the Houston Oilers and they got Jerry Glanville,

116
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.640
you know,
and Jerry's big thing is any,
any football team that he coached,

117
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:27.430
you know,
he wanted to,
he wanted to wear black,
you know,

118
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:28.790
like the Falcons were like,
you know,

119
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.720
they were like red with gray pants and white or whatever.

120
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:36.010
And he came there and he changed the black jerseys because he wanted to be tough

121
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.940
or whatever.
Right.
And then when you went to,
you know,
so he did that there,

122
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.470
didn't win.
And then he went to fucking,

123
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.123
<v 3>uh,</v>

124
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.950
<v 1>Houston and he's like,
let's change this one to black.
It's like,
Jerry,</v>

125
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.340
you're already stole the fucking Raiders colors kind of once.

126
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:54.260
We can't do it with two different franchises.

127
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.910
So he went out and he got a black satin fucking Oilers jacket that you would

128
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.600
wear with like the blue,
red and white logo.
So anyway,

129
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.910
his team took on his personality and they started calling the astrodome the

130
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.900
house of pain,

131
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.790
meaning you were going to go in there and obviously the defense was going to

132
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:17.180
kick the shit out of you and you were just going to have a painful fucking

133
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:21.830
afternoon playing the Houston Oilers.
And they did that for,
I don't know,

134
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.950
five,
six,
seven Games before Warren Moon,

135
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:31.270
CFL and NFL hall of Famer had a meeting with the defense and said,

136
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.070
listen,
stop saying that shit.

137
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.480
Stop calling this place to house of pain because you know who has to answer to

138
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:42.080
that?
Me,
I do.
I have the ball,

139
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:45.410
every offensive fucking plate and I'm going to get my ass kicked for your

140
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.280
shit-talking.

141
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.880
So shut the fuck up if you want to inflict some plain just fucking flake plane.

142
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:50.714
Right?

143
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.433
<v 3>MMM.</v>

144
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.130
<v 1>So anyway,
good.
And back to what the St Louis</v>

145
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.880
<v 3>Blues are doing.
I think that anybody watching this shit,
if they,
if Saint Louis,</v>

146
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.740
when's this?
It's going to change hockey.

147
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.990
It's going to start going in this direction of like,
Oh okay,

148
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.800
this is what the fuck we need to do.
We need,
you know,

149
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.860
there's no more goons to really police shit or not enough of them,

150
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:14.550
so we'll just start taking runs at people.
Uh,

151
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.630
<v 1>I dunno,
it's a very,
it's a fucking really bizarre</v>

152
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.980
series.
I can't really get my head around it.

153
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:28.010
It's like we absolutely dominated them in game one and they absolutely dominated

154
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:33.630
us and game too.
And then game three,
as far as the score went,

155
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:38.400
we absolutely dominated them,
but we played 80% in our end.

156
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.463
<v 3>And then</v>

157
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.130
<v 1>game for like,
when I say they dot.
Like physically dominated us.</v>

158
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.200
Like I,
I honestly thought that the way the,

159
00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:55.840
the fucking liberties that they were taking and the piece of shit way that they

160
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.120
were playing that after they scored the empty net goal and there was no chance

161
00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:01.540
of us winning,
I was literally like,
well,

162
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.480
we should go out and just go crosscheck one of their players right in the

163
00:10:04.481 --> 00:10:07.030
fucking mouth.
Which is something that I never say,

164
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.520
but I was so infuriated watching that happen to everybody on the Bruins.

165
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.660
I Dunno.
It's weird.
So this is what I,

166
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.320
I think we need to win game five and games six if it goes to game seven.
I just,

167
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.183
I,
you know,

168
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.670
I think we're going to be looking like San Jose where half our teams in a

169
00:10:24.671 --> 00:10:29.440
fucking mash unit.
I hope I'm wrong.
Granted,
like I said,
I'm just,
you know,

170
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.480
I'm a stand up comedian who fucking skates at a public rink,
you know,

171
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.480
one way counterclockwise should go the other way.

172
00:10:37.481 --> 00:10:41.540
All of a sudden I started having problems.
So,
um,
remember I said that,

173
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.940
that the St Louis Blues when this thing you're going to see their style of play

174
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.460
is going to become the prototype.

175
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.243
<v 3>MMM.</v>

176
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:50.530
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.210
And the last time that I think we saw this was the flyers when the flyers were

178
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:55.050
not the best team.

179
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.900
And then they went out back when you could fight and they just dropped the

180
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:01.650
gloves and just beat the shit out of people.
And they started,

181
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.050
they went back to back cups.

182
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.043
<v 3>MMM.</v>

183
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.510
<v 1>I mean,
I don't know.
You can't really compare anybody to the flyers.
I mean,</v>

184
00:11:10.511 --> 00:11:12.580
they would just fucking animals.
They weren't even playing hockey.

185
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.510
But I don't hate those flyer teams.

186
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.650
And I don't hate what they did because what they did,
the,

187
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:28.270
the golden age of their style of play was in the 80s where you had the perfect

188
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:31.720
balance of just some of the greatest goal scores of all time and some of the

189
00:11:31.721 --> 00:11:34.530
greatest fighters of all times.
So I don't get mad at it.

190
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.960
And also if the flyers didn't do what they did in [inaudible] 74 and 75,

191
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.420
Paul Newman,
one of my favorite actors of all time,

192
00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.430
never signs on to make the movie slapshot so I don't have a problem with it and

193
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:47.230
I really don't have a problem with the Saint Louis Blues.

194
00:11:47.231 --> 00:11:50.890
It's just a hard thing to watch as a Bruins fan to watch us get physically

195
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.750
dominated and to try to continue to play a game.
I've,
uh,
I just,
I don't know,

196
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.220
I think I got to get used to that,

197
00:11:57.221 --> 00:12:01.960
but all of my die hard Bruin fans and back home are keep telling me like,

198
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:06.280
just,
you know,
this is like a boxing match.
We're boxing there,
brawling,

199
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.170
don't get drawn into it.
And I'm like,
okay,
I don't like it.

200
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.520
I don't like it.
So we shall see.
But unfortunately,
um,

201
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.070
I mean I can't complain about working on a movie,
but I'm,

202
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.340
I'm working tonight so I'm actually going to miss the game,

203
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.100
so I'm going to have to watch some of the highlights.
But,
uh,
oh boy.

204
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.040
Um,
I dunno.
I Dunno if this has been a,

205
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:35.400
this has been a fuck.
I,
there's,
there's no way.
There's no,

206
00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:37.990
nobody who's watching this series can actually say who's going to win.

207
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.920
It's so fucking crazy.
Um,
so here we go.

208
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.610
You know what would be crazy as if Saint Louis wins this and then Toronto wins

209
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.010
in both of them.
And um,

210
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.080
I guess Toronto ends a championship drought while St Louis Ends a,
uh,

211
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.410
you know,
wins their first Stanley Cup.
So either way,

212
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:59.980
that'll be fun as far as sports histories go.

213
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:04.660
So I mean the St Louis Blues one but suck cause my team would lose,
but you know,

214
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.900
what are you gonna do?
Things happen.
Okay.
You win some,
you lose some.
All right.

215
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:10.480
But having said that,
go Bruins,

216
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.610
which got to fucking win five and went six.
That's it.

217
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.520
Take before they take this sickles out in game seven,
you know,
and chop,

218
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:25.030
literally chop a Bruins head off and get called from matching penalties.

219
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.890
All right.
Um,
anyway,
uh,
rumor has it,
I might be off tomorrow on,
if that's true.

220
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:35.380
I'm going to try to do some standup this weekend here in New York City.

221
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:38.080
So visit your local comedy club.
Who knows?

222
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.400
You might see old freckles fucking come around.
Um,

223
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.760
you know what,
it is great though.
I told you when I go to the,
when I go to these,

224
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.760
um,
um,
when I,
whenever I do these acting gigs,

225
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.030
how I get through it.
Yeah.

226
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.653
<v 3>MMM.</v>

227
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.090
<v 1>The bus,
the weirdness of it where like as a comedian,</v>

228
00:13:58.091 --> 00:14:01.720
if somebody tells me to do 20 minutes,
I'd do 20 minutes and it takes 20 minutes.

229
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.900
As an actor,
if I'm in something that's going to be 20 minutes,
six,

230
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:09.580
it's going to take like a month,
three weeks or whatever the shoot it.
Um,
I just,

231
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:14.440
when I go down,
when I go on set,
am I speaking?

232
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.190
That's a,
that's a good one right now on set,
on set.

233
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:22.660
You want to jump on the podcast at all?
I know you're busy.
Um,

234
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.850
what I do is I just,
uh,
I don't bring a Wa I don't bring a watch.
I don't bring a,

235
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.640
uh,
I don't bring a phone.
I have no fucking idea.

236
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.340
Like what time it is or anything.
And,
um,

237
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.320
I'm able to just sort of fucking plow through it.
But today when I go down there,

238
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:41.980
it's like a,
the Bruins games on.
So I don't know what I'm going to do.

239
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.700
You know,
I'm still not going to bring one,

240
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.770
cause I'm not going to see the fucking game anyways.

241
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.760
Do I need to get all my texts and my Massachusetts friends?
Oh,
what the fuck?

242
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.720
Yes.
Here we go,
dude.
That's bullshit.

243
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:59.270
And then I don't even know what's going on that's going to drive me up the

244
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:01.130
fucking wall.
So,
uh,

245
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.330
but what is cool about not bringing my phone is just not being on the phone.

246
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.730
And uh,
yesterday we had a long day.

247
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.620
We had,
we had a scene at a dinner table and uh,

248
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.020
anytime you see a scene at a dinner table in a movie,
uh,

249
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.220
I'm telling you it takes all day because there's just so many angles they have

250
00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:25.460
to get in all that.
So it took a long time to shoot.

251
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:27.410
So in a good way,

252
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:31.070
I wasn't on my phone at all for like the whole day.

253
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.900
And I'll tell you what's hilarious.
If you don't text people,

254
00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:34.070
nobody really texts you.

255
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.700
And I came out and I had like I think 10 text messages and I was able to handle

256
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:41.924
all of them

257
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.520
with either Lolz or write some business thing back in like fucking eight minutes

258
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.860
and I was done.
Um,

259
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.150
so I kind of learned something that I'm not going to apply,

260
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:58.370
but I would love to apply that in my everyday life.

261
00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:00.500
And speaking of my everyday life,

262
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.600
here's my every day love

263
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.700
making her triumphant return her triumphant return.
Ever since you've been a mom,

264
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:15.530
you know,
we've just been,
we've been two ships passing in the night.
Yeah,
exactly.

265
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.140
So how you been,
what have you been up to?
I think good is Nia,
right?
Yeah.

266
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.270
Bill William,
William,
William,
William,
William.
I've been great.

267
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.113
William,

268
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.830
this is you guys being here though is making my,
my date,
uh,
my,

269
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.830
my workout in and I said Nice and easy.
You guys should do that all the time.

270
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.380
Like if I get stand up gigs and like Dayton on the quad cities,

271
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:46.240
you know,
we've talked about this.
Yeah,
I know you support me in the fun city.

272
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.250
Just not a curiosity.
If we,
if this thing was two months in Jacksonville,
Florida,

273
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:57.020
would you be here Jackson?
No.
Jacksonville.
You know what?

274
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.060
Maybe because I have a friend out there.
That's what I thought.
Nothing about me.

275
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.900
Why are you so mean?
But I would definitely,

276
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.640
we would definitely come out for like three weeks.
Oh,
all right.

277
00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:15.500
Pay.
Did you see in Boston they're going to have a straight pride March?
Yes.

278
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:20.630
I saw that.
Fucking ridiculous.
Of course.

279
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:25.250
Boston of course.
I fucking course like what is the point?

280
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.190
What is the point of that?
I don't know.
This is my,
this is my thing.

281
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.680
Are they trolling?
Is it,
that's my thing.

282
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:36.070
My thing is is if they're doing it because it's all going to be like to just

283
00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:39.770
guys,
right?
It's all going to be like white guys out there being like,

284
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.030
what about US law?
I think what the,

285
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.710
they're also petitioning that
the Lgbtq Xyz,

286
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:52.620
whatever the fuck it is that they add an s to it for straight.

287
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:57.510
No.
Yeah,
that must factual show.
I'm waiting for that.
So what I,
I'm waiting

288
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.130
<v 4>them to be like this was a social experiment to see how blah,
blah blah,</v>

289
00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.080
which would be really fucking stupid.

290
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.480
Cause what do you need a social experiment in this to be,

291
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.840
they're just doing it to be like,
honestly,
when stuff like this happens,

292
00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.750
you have to ignore it.
But it's just impossible.

293
00:18:11.751 --> 00:18:15.110
Media will always pick it up and they know that.
But you got to ignore that shit.

294
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.140
It's like it's nothing.
It's not,

295
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.020
it's not even worth getting upset over.

296
00:18:21.021 --> 00:18:22.690
Although I understand why some people might,

297
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:27.450
<v 1>you'll get a little heat now.
You're a little heated,
so fucking stupid.</v>

298
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.780
Why don't you take your own advice?
It's just fucking stupid.

299
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.880
Why don't you just take your own advice?
I mean I am,
but I mean I,

300
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.460
I had a buddy of mine text me today about it.
I am so busted me,
text me today.

301
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.120
He goes,
dude,
it's just a real fucking day.
He texted me.

302
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.550
Cause if so I'm going,
yeah.

303
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.240
Any texts me this fucking thing where with some flag for people who are asexual

304
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:57.120
or don't feel feelings about people,
but sometimes do and bubble and Ron Lewis,

305
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.880
you know,
and he's just sitting there.
I was just,

306
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.640
I was laughing because you know,

307
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:07.060
I've been on this booby thing so I don't fucking look at my phone.
So it's fun.

308
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.990
You get disconnected that quickly from everybody else.
Yeah.

309
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.240
Like when you're in and I'm looking at my phone,

310
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.060
then I'm running around to acting like the sky is falling,

311
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:17.850
but when you don't look at your phone literally for fucking 12 hours,

312
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.600
you're coming out like I'm on Staten Island.
It's beautiful.
Yeah.
Perfect.

313
00:19:21.601 --> 00:19:22.380
Fucking weather.

314
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.680
And that we were sitting on the stairs in between takes and I was saying to one

315
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:26.610
of the other actors that go,

316
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:29.880
this minds me when I was a kid and she was mean like,
yeah,
I know,
right?
Yeah.

317
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:30.691
You just come out here.

318
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:35.150
You just sit down on a perfect summer day and people would come out,

319
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.150
you talk,
and then we kids playing in the street and just hanging out.

320
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.120
You didn't realize you had your whole life ahead of you,
how awesome it was.

321
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.900
And then the second I pick up my phone and shit,
don't have your say this,

322
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.960
what the fuck

323
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.020
<v 4>it is?
Isn't there flag like black and white.
So it's that.</v>

324
00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.770
That seems very sort of like symbolic good black and white.

325
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.530
It's like straight or not.
Whereas you know they're,
they're flagged.

326
00:19:57.531 --> 00:20:01.250
The LGBTQ is like the rainbow,
all inclusive.

327
00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:03.460
Like however you're feeling,
doesn't it?

328
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.500
I thought that was more of a fashion thing.

329
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.050
It's not like I'm going to need more colors than that,
honey.
No,

330
00:20:09.051 --> 00:20:12.050
I think it's symbolic of,
you know what?
And I don't even know.

331
00:20:12.051 --> 00:20:13.310
So I might be talking out of my ass,

332
00:20:13.311 --> 00:20:17.090
but I just felt like I saw that black and white one.
I was like,
oh,
I get it.

333
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.700
It's very black and white over over here and straight Advil.

334
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.720
<v 1>Yeah,
come on.
There we go.
Yeah.
Images,</v>

335
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.830
heterosexual flags.
Oh your first thing that comes up.

336
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.100
Somebody said the things to just,
oh,
of course.

337
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:34.300
It's on some Janky ass fucking website.

338
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.580
That's the one put together like black,
five minutes,
a white stripe flag.

339
00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.620
Oh my God.
I have seen pose for sexuals.

340
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:47.930
I believe the design was six for dental stripe.
Northwestern.
What

341
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.230
<v 4>obvious references to the rainbow flag essentially moved of its color.
Yeah.</v>

342
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:58.120
I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh wait.
Somebody wrote that?
February,
2001 yeah.

343
00:20:58.121 --> 00:21:02.470
Look at this fucking,
you know,
clip art fucking website.

344
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.030
<v 1>Well,
that's just one of those ones where the,</v>

345
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:06.490
what did they talk where people just talking to each other.
Oh,

346
00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:10.930
like a threat or something?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Wow.

347
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.430
US straight sparking plans that march into controversy.

348
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.050
Super Happy,
Fun America,
which has applied to the city.

349
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.250
<v 4>Whatever I don't need.</v>

350
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.010
I'm going to take my own advice and I don't even want to give this any air time.

351
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.260
<v 1>Boston planning a straight pride.
Yeah.</v>

352
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.670
<v 4>Boston fucking but,
oh wait,
wait,
wait.
Okay.
Read this headline.</v>

353
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.450
It's LG.
Wait,
wait.
Put the,
it's LGBT pride month,

354
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.530
but three guys in Boston.
When a permit for a straight pride parade.

355
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.930
I know it's not a parade.
Okay.
Three people is not afraid.

356
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.210
[inaudible] we get that right.
You're dumb fucks like mine,

357
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.370
so everybody just relax.
Ridiculous.

358
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.830
<v 1>Nobody's showing up to that pride model.</v>

359
00:21:52.831 --> 00:21:57.090
Kicks off of Boston on Tuesday with a lights event,

360
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.170
a paint night,

361
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:03.830
a preparation for a possible and preparation for possible straight pride parade

362
00:22:04.381 --> 00:22:08.550
this summer.
Well,
why can't I marched down the street?
Let me tell you,

363
00:22:08.551 --> 00:22:11.850
if your boyfriend or husband is participating in this March,

364
00:22:11.851 --> 00:22:14.850
like you really need to reconsider your relationship.

365
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.630
I'll just tell you what I love about you.
You know what I love about you,

366
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.150
we consider is you're giving him your,

367
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.900
you're giving the perfect advice while taking the bait all at the same time.

368
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.860
I know he's just,
he just wrote me into it.

369
00:22:27.861 --> 00:22:30.060
There's only gonna be three fucking people there.

370
00:22:30.061 --> 00:22:33.270
You're getting worked up over three people.
Yeah.
Why do you know what?

371
00:22:33.271 --> 00:22:36.450
I'm more worked up over the fact that this is like news.

372
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.850
What's going to happen next,
Nia?

373
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.590
Are they going to cancel the reboot of will and grace?

374
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.530
Three people are going to have a parade.
I mean,

375
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.670
why is everybody to the event to celebrate the heterosexual reality and one of

376
00:22:47.671 --> 00:22:51.840
the nation's most gay friendly cities?
I didn't know that.
Look at us.

377
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.040
I mean go Boston.
Wait ways.
Matthew Pope,
funny,

378
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:59.880
fun at identity politics or the political left.
Yeah,

379
00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:00.890
he's just making fun of him.

380
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.230
<v 4>Hi Charlie.
He goes,
he's also organize free speech,</v>

381
00:23:05.231 --> 00:23:07.930
quote unquote rallies in gun rights administration.
Oh,

382
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:12.130
so this is a fucking white supremacists again,
it free.

383
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.210
What did you just do?
What did you just do there?
You don't know this guy.

384
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.180
Three straight guys.
I guarantee you they're fucking white.

385
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.040
They're going to do a thing to poke fun at identity politics and he wanted to

386
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:25.750
eat or you sound like a redneck right now.

387
00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:29.270
Free speech and a gun rights demonstration.
Sound like a redneck right now.

388
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.390
Two together.
You suck is behind that.

389
00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.260
You sound like a redneck on his front porch right now.
If I was a redneck,
I'd

390
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:42.820
wait.
Why can't I be,
you know,
missing.
My point is you don't know this guy.

391
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.320
No,
I do and is on,
I'm seeing in this article that was my point.
Yes,

392
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.540
this is what people do,
this,

393
00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:55.210
this and this are also open minded like oh I get it.
C'Mon man.

394
00:23:55.211 --> 00:23:58.280
Like this is what people do man on the right and the left.

395
00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.560
You're both like sitting here and making assumptions.

396
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:04.250
Like you know that there is such that's such bullshit.
Right?

397
00:24:04.251 --> 00:24:07.880
And there's wrong and there are people who are on the wrong side of things and

398
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:11.570
there are people who are at least trying to be on the right side of the bank and

399
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:14.300
making people feel comfortable and making people feel included.

400
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:18.050
Like what do you fucking care of?
Gay people have like a parade.

401
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.820
Why does that mean that you all,

402
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:23.390
you now have to have a parade to like poke fun at identity politics?

403
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:25.370
Like what the fuck does it even have to deal with you?

404
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.540
We'll be right back with Nia takes the bait after these messages.
Care.

405
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.210
If it's considered taking the bait,
I'm standing up for what's right.

406
00:24:32.211 --> 00:24:33.440
Like who the fuck?
Like why?

407
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:38.330
Why does it matter to you that people have a parade?

408
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:42.040
It has nothing to do with you.
Leave it alone.
You're just you gotta.

409
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.460
You just have to now have your own praying.
I'm straight.

410
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.130
It's like you're being an asshole.
That's what it is.
You're being an asshole.

411
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.580
You're not standing up for anything that's different.
Not Making a point.

412
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:57.500
Different things,
hating people.
No,
it is.
It's a very fine line.
It's a very,

413
00:24:57.501 --> 00:24:58.850
but this dude is trying to,

414
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.240
was trying to organize a free speech rally and a gun rights administration.

415
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.980
First of all,
there's a free speech rally need to exist.
You have free speech.

416
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.490
No you don't.
Yes you do.

417
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.810
You're not free of consequences from the things that you say.
You don't.

418
00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.360
Ah,
there it is.
There one.

419
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.850
You can say whatever you want,
but add your right.
You respond to it,

420
00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:22.490
which has now become not just responding to it.

421
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:27.200
I'm going to destroy your ability to now make a fucking living that is not tit

422
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:30.260
for tat.
That is not a debate.
There is one.

423
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:35.290
You can have a respectful debate where people feel differently about various

424
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:39.920
things.
You're allowed to protest where they tell you to protest.

425
00:25:39.921 --> 00:25:41.870
Now you have to get a permit.

426
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.410
They made sure you're down the street and around the block and away from the

427
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.040
cameras doesn't freeze.
They don't rally.
Does that really make sense to you?

428
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:51.860
Is that really something that like you need to have?

429
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.740
We want free speech.
You have it?
Yeah.
Free speech.

430
00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:02.390
You don't need a wrap?
No,
no,
no.
The order Thai would have I,
you know,

431
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.630
you know this,
this is like no fucking Simeon.
Mark Comedians

432
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.750
<v 1>have gotten sued and lost in Canada.
Canada over jokes.</v>

433
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.680
Yeah.
Like this is,
this is like people are in the middle.

434
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.140
People in the middle of standup sets in America had comedy at a,
uh,

435
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.990
colleges and they shut off the mic and take the mic on that they don't even

436
00:26:22.991 --> 00:26:24.670
understand the fucking joke.

437
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.840
It's like people videotape comedians now when they tried to get the,

438
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.600
and all everybody's trying to do is get you in trouble.

439
00:26:33.601 --> 00:26:38.601
And what that does is it instills fear and makes people feel out,

440
00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.460
I don't want to say that,
oh,
I shouldn't say that.

441
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.880
Like there's people literally looking like fucking looking at the office,

442
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:46.380
even the office.
That's silly,

443
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:50.970
absurd show that everybody loved and everybody loved and,
and 10 years later,

444
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:51.870
people all,
we could never,

445
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.900
we could never get away with that dorky white people in the middle of fucking,

446
00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.010
<v 4>I've heard Steve Kerr Pencil.
Yeah.
Like Michael Scott couldn't exist</v>

447
00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.360
<v 1>right now.
Couldn't exist as absurd as that guy.</v>

448
00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.640
<v 4>I don't know if I believe that.
I mean I kind of get his point,</v>

449
00:27:07.641 --> 00:27:09.350
but like the whole,
I don't know,

450
00:27:09.351 --> 00:27:11.220
the point of Michael Scott was that he was thick.

451
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.190
He has credibility as the man have laid that guy.
But I also,

452
00:27:16.191 --> 00:27:19.490
but I also know as someone that's like my favorite show ever,

453
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.330
that the point of Michael Scott was that he was hilariously out of touch,

454
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:26.180
but he had a huge heart and he loved everybody.

455
00:27:26.181 --> 00:27:29.720
But he always said the wrong thing just cause he was like ignorant about stuff.

456
00:27:29.721 --> 00:27:33.200
But he wasn't a bad person.
You know,
he just would say dumb stuff.

457
00:27:33.201 --> 00:27:35.600
And it was funny because he was so clueless.

458
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.550
The thing with Michael Scott was never that he was um,

459
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:43.810
mean or trying to like dig at somebody or trying to poke fun.

460
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:48.560
That identity
[inaudible] down with black people.

461
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.390
What's the gay lingo like?

462
00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:55.620
<v 1>Was trying to an unbelievable infringement on free speech since nine 11.</v>

463
00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.560
Okay.
Okay.
Since nine 11,
there's been an unbelievable infringement.

464
00:28:00.561 --> 00:28:02.150
Like you're like the way,

465
00:28:02.151 --> 00:28:05.720
you're not allowed to discuss our foreign policy other than to just say the

466
00:28:05.721 --> 00:28:07.760
standard,
I support the troops,

467
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.360
my thoughts and prayers go out to the families and the victims.

468
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.990
That's what you're allowed to say if you,

469
00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:17.020
<v 4>if it don't say that,
that don't believe in that at all.</v>

470
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.240
Not that they don't support the people who are serving,

471
00:28:19.241 --> 00:28:23.680
but there are very much against everything that we do in terms of wars and all

472
00:28:23.681 --> 00:28:27.430
that kind of stuff.
So I don't,
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't see it like that.

473
00:28:27.431 --> 00:28:27.860
I don't know.

474
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.280
<v 1>I do because I,</v>

475
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:34.470
what I saw was if you look at the way comedians and performers active during the

476
00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:38.780
Vietnam War,
they were fearless,
said whatever the fuck they wanted.

477
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.900
Right?
There was an,
there was an immediate,

478
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:48.250
like what the people that earn money off of war learned from Vietnam is that if

479
00:28:48.681 --> 00:28:53.160
you,
if the media and the in the public turns on it,
you know,
you're,

480
00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.990
you're going to have to leave this money making fucking war that you're in.

481
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.460
So what they did during it,
I don't know if it's a actual conspiracy to do it,

482
00:29:01.461 --> 00:29:06.461
but what they did since Vietnam was basically all mainstream media got into the

483
00:29:08.061 --> 00:29:12.890
hands of very few people.
Okay?
That's why when you watch Fox are,

484
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:17.690
you watch CNN,
there is no criticism of,

485
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.450
Hey,
wait a minute.
How the fuck are we going to pay?

486
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:23.570
Like now we're talking about starting a war with Iran and we're completely

487
00:29:23.571 --> 00:29:27.260
fucking bankrupt.
Like how exactly are we going?
What is the end game?

488
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.560
Why are we doing this?
You're not allowed to ask any of that.

489
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.720
And if you ask any of that,
that means that you don't appreciate the truth.

490
00:29:34.721 --> 00:29:37.610
They put it all on the fucking truth.
You don't like babies,

491
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.650
you don't think kids should have ice cream,

492
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.960
you're a social should get the fuck outta here.
And,
and everybody,

493
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.280
you know this,
this thing of like the amount of people going like,
you know,

494
00:29:48.281 --> 00:29:50.090
there's no upside.
Don't say anything,
don't say,

495
00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:55.280
and we've all not set anything into like trillions and trillions of dollars of

496
00:29:55.541 --> 00:29:56.374
fucking debt.

497
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.860
And we allowed 3,500 fucking jerk offs on a jungle gym to bankrupt a first world

498
00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:06.100
nation because all of us don't want to get in trouble.

499
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.270
And I'm not saying I don't have,
I don't have a fucking solution for any of this,

500
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.060
but you should be able to be like,
hey man,
just out of curiosity,

501
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.740
how the fuck are we gonna pay for this?

502
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.810
Like I understand what we were trying to achieve here,
but financially,

503
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:24.490
the way we're going about this is,
is there a better way to do this?
If you,

504
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:27.790
if you do any of that,
why don't you get the fuck out of the country,

505
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:31.870
you fucking piece of Shit socials and now in stand up,
you know,
I talked to you,

506
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.050
I was at the fucking danger fails and this woman in the crowd didn't like what I

507
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:38.350
was doing.
She's like,
next subject,
nobody wants to hear this.

508
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.150
And then at this big fucking walking out and that I think is just,
you know,

509
00:30:43.151 --> 00:30:43.811
she was like young,

510
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:47.880
she was in her twenties and just grew up on social media and everybody in it,

511
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:52.480
I'm going to make a comment and everything I say and how I feel in all of my

512
00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:55.250
feelings are so fucking,
it's like you,

513
00:30:55.450 --> 00:31:00.400
she was talking to me like she hired me for her birthday party.
It's like,
no,

514
00:31:00.401 --> 00:31:03.850
you came to the comedy club.
She doesn't get to dictate what you're talking.

515
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:08.560
And sitting there like,
like she was fucking Napoleon.

516
00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:11.320
It's like I'm to talk about what he was,
fuck,
I want to talk about.

517
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.450
I have the microphone.
Yeah.

518
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.170
And she sat there and like I needed to talk about things that only she needed to

519
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.311
hear and then she,

520
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:22.660
I actually sat there and acted as though she spoke for everybody and I think,

521
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:24.670
I don't think it's all this big conspiracy.

522
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:28.840
I also think it has to do with how much content is out there and all of this

523
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.200
shit's so then what it becomes is it becomes like,

524
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.250
like arguing and screaming and yelling is the way to get viewers,

525
00:31:36.251 --> 00:31:41.251
so that's why any little fucking dust up like three fucking jerk offs.

526
00:31:41.801 --> 00:31:46.450
Having a straight pride parade gets everybody all amped up or somebody comes up

527
00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:50.980
with a fucking flag and everybody fucking focuses is on that rather than,

528
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.130
hey man,
we're bankrupt and we're talking about starting another fucking war.

529
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.180
Just out of curiosity,
I think it's at what point,

530
00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:02.470
at what point are we just going to go out of business over here?
I mean,
the way,

531
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:07.060
the way we're running this country right now financially is it's beyond fucking

532
00:32:07.061 --> 00:32:07.511
reckless.

533
00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:11.860
If anybody has as an individual ran our lives the way they're running this

534
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:13.240
country right now,
financially,

535
00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.650
our credit cards would have been caught up fucking 30 years ago.
Well,

536
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:22.651
I didn't feel like you can have multiple things that you are concerned about.

537
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.710
So I don't believe in this whole like why are you concerned about this when we

538
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:30.370
should be concerned about like you can be concerned about a multitude of things.

539
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.000
You don't think there's priority,

540
00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:36.400
but I mean there's your priorities and like my parameters might be different,

541
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:40.130
but I also feel like too,
something like,
I'm starting to think

542
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.671
<v 4>more now,</v>

543
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:45.020
like I think something like a straight pride parade and poking fun at identity

544
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:45.854
politics.

545
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.950
What the concern is that you've got people sort of stirring up this thing where

546
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.450
that that even though it seems so silly and ridiculous and not important,

547
00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.670
that is informing the minds of people who feel more empowered to try to like

548
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.470
hurt people who identify a certain way flower.
Huh?

549
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.130
Who empowered them?
Feel empowered.
Who?
Who empowers those people?

550
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.100
<v 5>Okay.</v>

551
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.860
<v 4>And powers.
What people,
what do you have the straight pride people?</v>

552
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:17.910
It's three fucking people and people are screaming and yelling like it's 3

553
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:21.090
million people.
Right?
Because I think,
you know,
it's a touchy thing.

554
00:33:21.091 --> 00:33:23.930
It's like this is the type of stuff where,
you know,
it's,
it's,

555
00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.960
I feel like it's a fine line between like I should be proud to be straight and

556
00:33:27.961 --> 00:33:29.130
like fuck you,

557
00:33:29.131 --> 00:33:33.960
you afterward or you tranny or some kind of like other slander and that can

558
00:33:33.961 --> 00:33:37.650
often lead to violence and death,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
So that's why,

559
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:42.000
that's why it's concerning the people,
three people applying for permanent,

560
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.280
I just got back together and then you give them everything that they want and

561
00:33:47.341 --> 00:33:48.480
then you know what,
who hears it,

562
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.440
those fucking people who already think those things.
But again,

563
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:58.100
as you guys are handing out flyers to now,

564
00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:58.870
now I have thought,

565
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:03.270
I don't think that people should ever stop speaking up for what they believe in

566
00:34:03.271 --> 00:34:06.960
and what they feel like is harmful to them and when it comes to this type of

567
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.090
stuff.
But again,

568
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.890
I harmful is a million people who wouldn't do it.
Letting know,

569
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.280
announcing to people who didn't even know that it fucking existed,

570
00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.810
that it now exists,

571
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:23.990
but also I'm not going to tell people who are hurt or triggered or offended or

572
00:34:25.201 --> 00:34:27.630
whatever the word is by the very idea this,

573
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.760
that they shouldn't be upset about that.

574
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.900
I'm not going to do that to them because if they are upset about it,

575
00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:35.160
if this drums up feelings like,
oh my God,

576
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:38.640
this is exactly what my grandpa or my dad or whatever said that,

577
00:34:38.641 --> 00:34:41.730
I'm not going to tell them then that that's why we're going to start another

578
00:34:41.731 --> 00:34:46.560
fucking war and be even more bankrupt.
And again,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,

579
00:34:46.561 --> 00:34:49.310
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
You can carry more weight.

580
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.890
It's literally like our house is on fire and you're going,
you know,

581
00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:57.680
we need a new toaster.
I mean,
what are we doing here?

582
00:34:57.681 --> 00:35:01.490
It's like literally we're talking about,
you know,

583
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.820
we're going to go under at some point we're going to go under,
I mean,
how much,

584
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.790
it's some fucking point.
I watched,
I watched Russia,

585
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:12.630
we all watched Russia go bankrupt.
It happens.
Okay.
I know,

586
00:35:12.631 --> 00:35:13.031
but I,

587
00:35:13.031 --> 00:35:18.031
I just don't think that it is your or my place to tell people what they should

588
00:35:18.181 --> 00:35:20.760
be worked up about and you should be more concerned about this.

589
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.360
That's just my opinion,
especially when it comes to this.
I'm not very,

590
00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.050
I've said this before,
I'm not very well versed in any of those issues.
So

591
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.960
[inaudible] warming will not be solved because people are going to be sitting

592
00:35:33.961 --> 00:35:37.980
around talking about gender neutral bathrooms when they're going to have a place

593
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.180
<v 1>to fucking put him is,
is like there are priorities.</v>

594
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.350
Okay.
And I would say,
I mean that's like saying you don't,

595
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.270
do you have priorities in your personal life is just like,
well,
uh,

596
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.950
getting toothpaste is just as much as just as important as uh,

597
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.920
paying the life insurance bill this month.
No,

598
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:58.290
I don't really think you can simplify it like that.

599
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.770
You're such a straight pride flag.
You so black and white

600
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.450
because what you're arguing,
what you're arguing exists within this thing,

601
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.990
this large thing that's going to go under.

602
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:16.890
I,
so it's like you're,
you're,

603
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:20.820
you're on a boat that's sinking and you're talking about what color we should

604
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:24.900
paint one of the cabins rather than trying to plug up the fucking,

605
00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:28.230
we're not going to have a boat.
Do you understand?

606
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:33.650
I'm trying to be as sensitive and open minded to people as I can and my own

607
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:39.350
personal,
okay.
I give up.
I absolutely,
I give up.
I can't,
I,
I don't,

608
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:42.060
I give up with fucking people in like,

609
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.370
I just don't understand.
Like me,
I have problems,

610
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.050
I've got problems in my fucking life,

611
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:51.510
but nothing is more important right now to me.

612
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.250
Then I would say global warming and the financial fucking situation in this

613
00:36:56.251 --> 00:37:00.150
country and that's fine.
Like I'm not,
because all of this shit,

614
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.360
all of this shit.
And how would you feel if I was like,

615
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.730
that's not what's important.
That's what you've been saying

616
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.160
<v 4>as human beings,
riots and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
No,</v>

617
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:12.300
I'm letting you have that thing that's important to you and not telling you.

618
00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.330
<v 1>I know,
but I'm not,
but I'm not saying what you're saying is wrong.</v>

619
00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.370
I'm saying what you're saying is just circle that exists in this giant circle

620
00:37:21.371 --> 00:37:24.850
that's going to pop and then it's just going to be tethered to nothing.

621
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.920
So there's no reason to fix the fucking roof if the foundation is going to

622
00:37:31.921 --> 00:37:32.790
collapse.

623
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.013
<v 4>Like I said,</v>

624
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:40.020
I feel like there's people who are probably more uh,

625
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:41.403
what do you call it?

626
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:45.610
I don't know what the word is better at figuring that stuff out.

627
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:50.660
<v 1>I Dunno what I'm saying.
I lost my train of thought.
No,</v>

628
00:37:50.661 --> 00:37:54.960
only because what is happening is we're all screaming and yelling like they'll,

629
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.330
there'll be more arguments in the world in this country,

630
00:37:59.331 --> 00:38:04.331
about three fucking people wanting to have a straight pride parade and versus

631
00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.780
when was the last time you saw Twitter blow up about how much debt we're in

632
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.890
<v 4>but also ways it gets back to the environmental thing are they're not like</v>

633
00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.140
hardcore environmentalist and like,

634
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.230
you know the Paris accord and all these things that people have been working on

635
00:38:18.231 --> 00:38:19.280
about saving the invite.

636
00:38:19.281 --> 00:38:23.570
It's not like it's not being tended to by people who are in charge are

637
00:38:23.571 --> 00:38:25.970
knowledgeable about that stuff.
Is it not?

638
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.400
<v 1>So is it not your responsibility to try to use less water bottles?</v>

639
00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.060
They're trapped,
but nobody's doing that.
Nobody's doing that note.

640
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:35.980
P Pick the same fucking people.
You'll go a gay pride parade

641
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.430
<v 4>in the fucking thing ends and there's like a zillion fucking water bottles on</v>

642
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:42.580
the fucking ground.
It's hilarious.
It's like there's not going to be,

643
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:44.590
there's not going to need to be any pride,
if anything,

644
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.180
cause we're not going to fucking be here anymore.

645
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.330
But if that's what you're getting from like the Gay Pride Parade,

646
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:52.660
then you've completely missed the point.
No,
I'm seeing the irony in it,

647
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.400
but like again,
what does that have to do with the Gay Pride Parade?
See,

648
00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.470
you guys are sitting here and having a parade about gay rights.

649
00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.320
<v 1>I'm not saying everyone with them.
I'm,</v>

650
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:07.120
what I'm saying is that we're just so up our own fucking ashes about,

651
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.780
about bathrooms and,
and,
and,

652
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.170
and support the troops and fucking America and all of this shit.

653
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.020
We're bankrupt near,
we're fucking bankrupt.

654
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.940
And we're talking about starting another fucking war.

655
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.360
So all of this shit that we're fucking sitting here losing her fucking mind

656
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:24.190
about it doesn't exist.

657
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:29.430
It's okay if he just viewed this country is a big fucking house and were yelling

658
00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:32.980
about the wallpaper in the carpeting and all that and meanwhile the fucking

659
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:34.810
thing on the other side of the house is on fire.

660
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:38.260
Although other foundations is going to collapse to sit there and say that that

661
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.620
you know like if we don't,
if this global warming thing,

662
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:45.010
okay he's not a fucking hoax is an absolute truth,

663
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.870
then all of these issues that we have are going to be non issues.

664
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:52.350
When the ocean rises up and swallows us all.

665
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:55.360
<v 4>If you were a part of that community,</v>

666
00:39:55.361 --> 00:39:59.200
I think he would feel very differently but you're not so it's very easy for you

667
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:03.400
to sit back and tell people what they should and should not focus on it.
I am not

668
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.970
<v 1>saying that you shouldn't focus on it.
You're missing my point.</v>

669
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:13.150
My fucking point is there's not even remotely the same level of passion for how

670
00:40:13.221 --> 00:40:15.500
much fucking debt we're in and what the fuck are we doing?

671
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.730
<v 4>Maybe you just haven't found like your tribe in that or something.</v>

672
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.840
Maybe you need to be on like environmental,
Twitter

673
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.950
<v 1>when that's kind of what all they talk about.
I Dunno.</v>

674
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:34.300
Why are you staring like that?
Cause I,
I,
I because,
yeah.
What time?

675
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:34.901
What time is it?

676
00:40:34.901 --> 00:40:38.500
What's you're talking about is a subset of a subset of fucking people.

677
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.330
I'm saying the mainstream media,

678
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.400
the mainstream people who are fucking looking at memes and doing all of this

679
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:50.390
shit where the ones,
I dunno,
I give up.
I,
you know,
I,

680
00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.240
I,
you know something,
I don't even know where the fuck this thing even went.

681
00:40:53.241 --> 00:40:58.241
All I know is that our ability as Hugh of every different human being to live on

682
00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:04.331
this planet is equally as in like just to survive is equally as important as I

683
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.720
don't know what
I don't know.

684
00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.490
And I never said that those other issues were not important.

685
00:41:13.491 --> 00:41:17.150
I'm just saying I just wished that there was the same level of fucking passion

686
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:22.000
existed.
Like,
like I don't understand how in 2019 I don't understand how far,

687
00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.240
how was war legal?

688
00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.980
We're all sitting have run around with that flat screen t cause it's saying all

689
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.530
this shit do if you actually looked at the fucking footage that they don't show

690
00:41:30.531 --> 00:41:34.400
over here about what the fuck happens in war and you see these fucking people

691
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:37.640
who didn't do anything,
pull all their children out of rubble dead.

692
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:41.060
You know they don't,
they this the type of shit they used to show on the news.

693
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.600
They don't show that anymore.
They don't show it anymore.

694
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:49.070
<v 6>Right.
Um,
I have to run.</v>

695
00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.380
<v 1>Okay.
All right.
Now before you leave,</v>

696
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:55.560
K K K K can I make a video view of throwing a water ball and haven't landing on

697
00:41:55.561 --> 00:41:58.410
top?
You know,
upright moral starts screaming and that's what the fuck we'll do.

698
00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:03.180
Okay.
Right.
That's great to be back.
All right,

699
00:42:03.181 --> 00:42:07.820
that's the podcast.
Everybody on that note.
Well I have to,
uh,
I,

700
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:11.790
I got it.
They're going to pick me up there.
So all right,
42 minutes.

701
00:42:11.791 --> 00:42:16.290
You guys got extra fucking that turned into fucking meet the press.
All right.

702
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.320
Listen to the music and enjoy the rest of the greatest hits podcast is Christ.

703
00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:25.740
I got so fucking heated,
I forgot to read the advertisements.
You know,

704
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:26.431
you think I was,

705
00:42:26.431 --> 00:42:29.610
I would be old enough to just realize when someone is just not going to agree

706
00:42:29.611 --> 00:42:32.610
with me to just fucking stop.
I don't know if I'll ever fucking figure that out.

707
00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:33.443
But you know what?

708
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.160
Me figuring that out is not more important than us fiscally and fucking

709
00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:43.830
environmentally.
Everything's a priority frame.
Bridge.

710
00:42:43.831 --> 00:42:48.540
Everybody father's day is around the corner and dad doesn't want another pair of

711
00:42:48.541 --> 00:42:51.630
socks.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
You know,
when you see mother's Day,

712
00:42:51.631 --> 00:42:54.330
all this shit that they want you to buy him.
You know,

713
00:42:54.331 --> 00:42:58.740
I fucking go into whole foods.
All right?
What?

714
00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:02.430
They're genetically altered horse shit that they try to pass off as organic
food.

715
00:43:02.431 --> 00:43:05.640
Right?
I go in there because what else am I going to go?
Huh?

716
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.740
There's no other fucking game in town anymore.

717
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.700
So I fucking go in there and they got this side advertising father's day and it

718
00:43:11.701 --> 00:43:16.590
literally says,
uh,
it's a picture of a chicken Kebab and it just says,

719
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.790
Hey,
uh,
nothing says father's day like meat on a stick.

720
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:30.030
I go to buy your jewels and all you gotta do is get me a fucking Kebab.

Hey,
what's going on?
It's Belper and it is a Monday morning podcast for

776
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.100
June 6th,
2011 how the hell

777
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.240
<v 8>are you?
How was your day going?
Are you on vacation like I am?</v>

778
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.810
Yes sir.
I am on vacation,

779
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:42.811
but before I get to talking about what a great fun ass fucking time I've been

780
00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:45.430
having for the last few days,
uh,

781
00:47:45.431 --> 00:47:49.540
I need to address the Boston Bruins for half a second.

782
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.890
All right.
Do you know what the Bruins need?
Okay.

783
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:58.900
They need Larry Bird or someone of his ilk.

784
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:03.160
God knows is not a lot of them to walk into that fucking locker room.

785
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:06.103
Okay?

786
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:11.170
And He needs to give that speech that he gave way back in the day when we will

787
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.660
get getting fucking our asses kicked by the Lakers and Larry Bird,

788
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:17.390
what's fucking went on TV or whatever.

789
00:48:17.391 --> 00:48:21.170
He's getting interviewed and he's sitting there with his fucking pasty torso and

790
00:48:21.171 --> 00:48:24.770
his little prepubescent and fucking mustache,
you know,

791
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:28.340
it's cleft palate,
upper lip,
whatever.
He's covering up.
I don't know,

792
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.350
every man's got some secrets,

793
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.220
but he said he sat there after getting his ass kicked by the fucking Lakers,

794
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:37.850
the Celtics.
He said,
we played like a bunch of damn sissies out there.

795
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:42.320
We played like a bunch of sissies.
He just kept saying it.

796
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.430
We played like a bunch of sissies.

797
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:51.860
But what happened the next game?
What happens the next day?
Oh,

798
00:48:51.861 --> 00:48:56.090
fucking Kurt Rambis comes down the damn court.

799
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:59.780
He gets fucking clothesline by Kevin Mchale and I believe Larry Bird.

800
00:48:59.781 --> 00:49:02.840
I can't remember.
I don't have the highlight in front of me.
I'm on vacation.

801
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:06.680
I don't have time to do that shit.
And that turned the whole series around.

802
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.123
All right.

803
00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:14.550
Now I was watching that game fucking too.
And the people commentating,

804
00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:18.300
they're all great.
They're all great.
Milbury I like all those guys,

805
00:49:18.301 --> 00:49:18.991
but they kept saying,

806
00:49:18.991 --> 00:49:22.140
I'll tell you a Boston feds gotta be mad to what the fuck's his name?
Burroughs.

807
00:49:22.141 --> 00:49:23.990
I didn't know the guy's Goddamn name.
I've never heard of him.

808
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:25.950
Didn't get suspended.

809
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:32.700
Cause in the first game he bit Patrice Bergeron finger.
Okay.

810
00:49:32.701 --> 00:49:35.000
And they just kept going.
I'll tell you,
Boston fans,
I'll tell you,

811
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:39.720
it ain't gotta be upset right now.
They really got to be upset.
You know,

812
00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.750
they gotta be upset that this guy didn't get suspended.

813
00:49:42.751 --> 00:49:46.950
And you know what happens?
I guarantee you on Boston sports radio,

814
00:49:46.951 --> 00:49:48.630
there's a bunch of Bruins fans go.
You know,

815
00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.480
I'm upset because fuck face wasn't suspended.

816
00:49:51.481 --> 00:49:53.670
They literally tell you what to think.

817
00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:58.350
That fucking guy,
he shouldn't have got suspended.

818
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:03.630
What he did was not suspendable but was just sort of bizarre.

819
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.850
It was something like a six year old or rock a toddler would do.

820
00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.780
That's why.
That's why there was no huge response after he did.

821
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.960
You know if your car,
you fucking slam someone face first into the boards,

822
00:50:18.961 --> 00:50:20.850
you take a cheap shot.
The whole team's pile on.

823
00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:23.130
He trying to kick the shit out of you,
bite somebody.

824
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:25.860
People would just stand around like,
dude,
what the fuck?

825
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.050
That's what Patrice version.
Woman's

826
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.290
<v 10>doing his skate and off the ice.
He looks at a friend of visit,</v>

827
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.070
the friend of his TV and he goes,
you fucking bit me.

828
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:38.450
I don't think it was suspendable.

829
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:42.920
Maybe you would make the guy wear a dress for the first period of the,
of,
of,

830
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:46.580
of game to maybe that.
All right,

831
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:51.450
but that does not address the issues that the Bruins have right now.
The,

832
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.500
the fucking issue is that they're playing,

833
00:50:56.330 --> 00:51:00.860
they're playing soft.
They make in Vancouver,

834
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:04.250
look like this tough physical team.
Now I totally respect Vancouver.

835
00:51:04.251 --> 00:51:08.600
They're a beast of a team with gold scores.
Snipers.
Okay.

836
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:10.520
Lou Longo,
I will give,
you know,

837
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:14.930
I'll give them eight out of 10 stars because that guy can't get rattled.

838
00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.140
All right,
but they're not a physical team.

839
00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:20.720
When I looked down their bench,

840
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:23.270
there's nobody there that looks intimidating.

841
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.780
It's a bunch of red beer to Douche bags like me.

842
00:51:26.781 --> 00:51:29.450
Every other guy in their team looks like me.
I'm not intimidating,

843
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.730
but the way the Bruins are playing,
I don't get it.

844
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:37.790
Chara is getting pushed all over the fucking ice.
I'm getting sick of it.

845
00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:41.270
So
I'm hoping that that's what

846
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:44.700
<v 8>is going on right now.
And again,
three we come out,</v>

847
00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:48.420
we stopped playing like a bunch of goddamn sissies and we hit these goals.

848
00:51:48.421 --> 00:51:51.270
Scores.
That's all they are.
They're a team of goal scorers.

849
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:53.160
There's nobody tougher on their team.

850
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:55.640
<v 10>Stop getting pushed around.</v>

851
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.980
Did you see what happened when you check fucking what's his face there?
God Damn.

852
00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:01.310
And I'm so bad with the names.

853
00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.250
<v 8>The fuck is his name.
The guy from a Lavonia,</v>

854
00:52:05.251 --> 00:52:09.600
Michigan and he used to play angry and now he doesn't get angry anymore and now

855
00:52:09.601 --> 00:52:12.150
he's having a career year.
Fucking

856
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:17.160
<v 10>ah,
he's not one of the said deeds,
he's fucking raw.
I can never remember names.</v>

857
00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:22.150
I'm the worst.
That fucking guy,
he got hit and all of a sudden he gets up slowly,

858
00:52:22.151 --> 00:52:24.760
skates off the ice.
That's what you do.
That's what you do to gold scores.

859
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.900
You Slam them into the boards legally.
That's what you do.

860
00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:33.490
You don't just stand there,
give up the Blue Line.
Oh Wow.
Look at them.

861
00:52:33.491 --> 00:52:38.290
They're so good at pathing.
I'm getting sick of it.
All right.

862
00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.150
You're making the will make Vancouver look like they're the fucking fliers.

863
00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:45.970
They're not.
All right.

864
00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.330
This is exactly what we did against Montreal.

865
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:54.390
We made Kerry price look like the second coming of fucking Patrick Walk Cause we

866
00:52:55.151 --> 00:52:58.300
kept taking slap shots from the fucking red line with nobody in front,

867
00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:02.880
right in his goddamn pancreas.
Another save by Carey price.
I'll tell you the pro,

868
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:07.090
it's gotta be buckled little shut up.
And where do we do?
We went down out to,

869
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:11.890
do we have it in us again?
I don't fucking know.

870
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:13.301
I don't,

871
00:53:13.301 --> 00:53:17.260
but I would like if we would actually return a couple of checks every once in

872
00:53:17.261 --> 00:53:18.094
awhile.

873
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:22.630
They've actually been too great fucking games and I'd be way more excited about

874
00:53:22.631 --> 00:53:26.610
it if,
uh,
if we weren't down [inaudible] you know,

875
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:30.150
all these fucking Douche conduct fans who haven't said Shit to me all year.

876
00:53:30.151 --> 00:53:33.840
My Twitter's blowing up after they win games,
by the way.
No,
no shit.

877
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:38.010
Talk before the game,
you know.
Then they give me a bunch of Shit,

878
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:39.623
you know,

879
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:43.770
walking around with their chest puffed out because they want to one to nothing

880
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:46.560
game.
It's fucking annoying.

881
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.040
Then they've given me shit cause I'm not texting during the finals.
I'm sorry,

882
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:51.510
my team hasn't been there in 20 years.

883
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:55.170
I don't want to come up with clever shit during the fucking game.
All right.
Okay.

884
00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:00.690
Enough of that shit.
Um,
so anyways,
I'm on a vacation and a,

885
00:54:00.691 --> 00:54:03.150
you know a lot of people when they go on vacation,
Nia,

886
00:54:03.151 --> 00:54:05.820
could you not put away the plates so loudly please?

887
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:09.930
I don't know if you guys can hear that.
That's very disturbing.
I'm taking,

888
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:14.130
I'm taping the podcast right now.
Hey,
how nice is it to be in like a house?

889
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.940
Huh?
It's very nice.
Thank you.
You know what?

890
00:54:17.941 --> 00:54:21.930
Sometimes I call her over and she wants to talk.
Other times she doesn't,

891
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.830
I think she's annoyed with me.
Even on vacation,

892
00:54:25.831 --> 00:54:29.580
I can only get like six hours sleep because halfway through like the night,

893
00:54:29.581 --> 00:54:30.690
all of a sudden my brain's like,

894
00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:33.180
how come you didn't sign up for crab soccer in seventh grade?

895
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:37.500
And then I got to walk around and think about that shit.
Uh,
what's crab?
Soccer,

896
00:54:37.501 --> 00:54:42.170
I don't know.
Vacation in New England.
Someone will explain it to you.
Um,

897
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.540
just reminded me of a fucked up story.
We used to have this gym coach.

898
00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:53.190
This guy was the shit and you know,
he drank a little bit

899
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:58.120
<v 8>and he gambled a little bit and it was the 80s.
So you didn't really hide it.</v>

900
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.660
He come in with this red nose and I remember we would play,

901
00:55:01.661 --> 00:55:03.010
it was fucking awesome.
We would play

902
00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:07.330
<v 10>football and we had gym class on Mondays,</v>

903
00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.770
<v 8>so there was always Monday night football.
So basically what he would do,</v>

904
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.830
whoever's playing Monday night football,
let's say it was the Brown's verse,

905
00:55:13.831 --> 00:55:16.710
the Lions,
He'd divide up the gym class and he'd go,

906
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:20.970
you guys are the browns and you guys are the alliance and whoever wins,

907
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.590
I'm going to bet this on the game.

908
00:55:22.591 --> 00:55:26.520
And he'd flashed this big wad of cash and we thought he was filthy,

909
00:55:26.521 --> 00:55:31.440
stinking rich.
So anyways,
we'll play and crabs saga.

910
00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:37.360
<v 10>And uh,
this kid scores a goal,
right?</v>

911
00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.710
And this guy used to like the guy was the shit he used to like announce the

912
00:55:41.711 --> 00:55:43.120
games as you applying them.

913
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.930
<v 8>He'd be like,
Oh shit.
Look at Barrack Day fans.</v>

914
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:50.390
He's all over the place and it just gets you amped up.

915
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:53.540
The Guy was the greatest gym teacher slash human beings

916
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:57.250
<v 10>ever.
So anyways,
this kid scores a goal.</v>

917
00:55:58.220 --> 00:55:59.053
All right,

918
00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:01.020
<v 8>Danny scores another goal and he's like,</v>

919
00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:05.850
he's flipping out all the shit and then he yells,
if you score another goal,

920
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.680
I'm gonna buy you on a tare.

921
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:12.510
<v 10>Which in our world is seventh graders costs like nine zillion dollars.</v>

922
00:56:12.511 --> 00:56:16.020
So needless to say that the kids' scores,
the fucking goal,

923
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.330
and he starts flipping out because the gym coach is just hyping him up.

924
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:25.390
Just kept screaming over and over again,
I'm going to buy,
you want to tare?

925
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.690
I've got a buy.
You want Atari and we're all going nuts.

926
00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:30.370
He's going to buy him an Atari

927
00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:36.140
<v 8>next week.
Hey duty by the Atari?
Nah,
no,
not yet.
Not yet.</v>

928
00:56:36.141 --> 00:56:40.570
But he's a week after that he ever gets you to get down a tire and I hadn't

929
00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:43.700
gotten to me.
Yeah,
he never got it for,
you know,

930
00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.770
typical gambler is all great.
It's all great.

931
00:56:48.771 --> 00:56:50.900
He builds you all up and then right when you need them,

932
00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:55.490
a fucking walks away from you.
But the Best God damn gym coach I ever had,

933
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:58.990
<v 10>um,
was that even remotely interesting?
Well,
you know what,</v>

934
00:56:58.991 --> 00:57:01.780
I don't give a shit cause I'm on vacation.
Technically.

935
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.870
I'm not even supposed to be doing this.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.

936
00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.750
What'd you guys do?
You called me back to the office.

937
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:09.940
Now I'm shuffling around looking for those papers.

938
00:57:09.941 --> 00:57:12.220
I forgot my wife and kids are out in the car.

939
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:16.960
I swear to God he just can't leave his job for more than three days.
Um,

940
00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:22.470
<v 8>anyways,
you probably wondering where I'm at.
I'm actually at a,</v>

941
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.220
I dunno,
I travel all the fucking time.
Okay.

942
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:32.570
I travel all the time and I'm always going to airports and you guys know how I

943
00:57:32.571 --> 00:57:33.351
feel about that.

944
00:57:33.351 --> 00:57:37.730
And I always get on a plane and I'm always sitting next to some fatty.

945
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.480
Right.
And they always look at me a little,

946
00:57:41.481 --> 00:57:45.950
you'll make at least smaller every year.
No,
no sir.
No.

947
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:50.240
Well maybe a little bit,
but in general you keep getting fatter

948
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.600
<v 10>and I know it's a disease.</v>

949
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.013
<v 0>Okay.</v>

950
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:59.410
<v 8>Anyways.
Yeah,
there's always some fatty spilling into my goddamn seat.
Okay.</v>

951
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:03.730
Or I get the island in the,
some fucking Douche with a weak bladder.

952
00:58:03.731 --> 00:58:08.080
And every time I start to nod off with my heavy head and it starts to find,

953
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.740
you know,
I just start nodding off in is my heavy heads going forward.

954
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:19.240
I started having dreams about being slapped in the back of the neck.
Oh,

955
00:58:19.241 --> 00:58:20.560
that's how I should have done that joke.

956
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:24.040
And I didn't realize it's actually just the weight of my head.
See what I did.

957
00:58:24.041 --> 00:58:25.960
I front end loaded that one with the punchline.

958
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:28.780
Do you guys just learned a little something for all you people who send me

959
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:31.780
emails about how to do stand up comedy?
Here's rule number one.

960
00:58:31.781 --> 00:58:36.510
Don't put the punchline before the setup.
Oh Geez.
Um,

961
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:39.550
anyways,
so I decided I don't want to go to the Goddamn airport,

962
00:58:39.551 --> 00:58:41.350
but I'd like to get away from my apartment.

963
00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:46.350
So after years of living out here and everybody telling me how great big bear,

964
00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:52.780
um,
mountain or big bear summit or big bear fucking polo grounds in lake,

965
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.790
whatever the fuck you call this place,
um,
I decided to come up here,

966
00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:04.140
rented a little fucking cabin slash house and I feel like I'm in New Hampshire

967
00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:08.440
right now.
It's awesome.
It's fucking cold out.

968
00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:13.750
The water is freezing.
I went on a hike yesterday.

969
00:59:13.751 --> 00:59:15.760
I felt like I was going to get hypothermia.

970
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:19.780
This ladies and gentlemen is the vacation of a redhead,

971
00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:24.140
you know,
and fellow red heads out there.

972
00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:29.300
Freckled face fuckers Ginger's whatever the hell you want to call us.

973
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:33.600
Stop trying to be like regular people.
You know,

974
00:59:33.601 --> 00:59:36.030
everybody wants to go someplace warm,
right?

975
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:40.710
They go down in the Caribbean and then you show up just blistering in the

976
00:59:40.711 --> 00:59:44.610
goddamn son.
Why are you doing that to yourself?
You know,

977
00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:47.500
and then people just sitting there going,
you,
yeah,
that's them.

978
00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:52.380
You can't get any color at all?
No.
I mean I'm like white,

979
00:59:52.381 --> 00:59:57.210
but you're just wow,
look at your legs.
I'm sorry.
That was just,

980
00:59:57.330 --> 01:00:02.130
he just standing there like a fucking freak.
Don't do that to yourself.

981
01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:04.620
That's not the vacation of redhead.

982
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:08.610
Redhead goes from mild climate too.

983
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.490
Severely cold climate.
That's,
that's how I feel.

984
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:16.650
My next vacation is going to be in the Yukon territories,
you know,

985
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.830
and I'm going to get some snow shoes and get one of those Eskimo jackets.

986
01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.540
All right.
And I'm going to walk across the Tundra,
my little red nose.

987
01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.920
So anyways,
we're up here and a big bear fucking lake.

988
01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:36.690
And I decided I want to go.
I wanted to go on this hike two days ago.
And uh,

989
01:00:36.691 --> 01:00:41.340
you know,
Nias the exact opposite of me.
She can sleep until the cows come home.

990
01:00:41.341 --> 01:00:43.020
She's a relaxed,
beautiful person.

991
01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.590
I am a psychopath who's totally wound up.

992
01:00:46.591 --> 01:00:50.340
So I'm up at like five in the morning and I want to go on a hike.

993
01:00:50.341 --> 01:00:52.650
She doesn't want to go.
So I say,
fuck it.
I'm going right.

994
01:00:52.651 --> 01:00:53.970
It was more like nine in the morning,
right?

995
01:00:53.971 --> 01:00:55.740
Which is five in the morning when you're on vacation.

996
01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:00.450
So I walked into the Goddamn Woods and uh,

997
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.810
this isn't like hiking in La.
This is the real deal.

998
01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:08.880
Like they have bears,
they have mountain lions and a,

999
01:01:08.881 --> 01:01:12.460
and I'm by myself and I wasn't really thinking,

1000
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.880
I go hiking in La by myself all the fucking time.

1001
01:01:14.881 --> 01:01:17.490
So I wasn't thinking about anything.
But I got to tell you,

1002
01:01:17.491 --> 01:01:21.600
the second I got into the forest,
this isn't the woods,

1003
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.890
this is the forest.

1004
01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.820
This overwhelming feeling of being watched

1005
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.290
just fucking came over me.
You know,

1006
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.980
this is what it's like walking in a forest.
Okay?

1007
01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:39.510
If first you recognize the animals,
when you first get in,
you're like,
oh yeah,

1008
01:01:39.511 --> 01:01:44.280
look at,
look at the pile.
And Ah,
that's a squirrel.
Hey,
look,
a little chipmunk,

1009
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:46.770
right?
Then you get about a quarter mile in,

1010
01:01:46.771 --> 01:01:48.990
and then that's the first time you see something move.
You're like,
dude,

1011
01:01:48.991 --> 01:01:52.530
what the fuck was that?
Is that a dog?
A little bit,

1012
01:01:52.531 --> 01:01:57.270
a little dog with a fat tail.
And then you get this failing you like,

1013
01:01:57.271 --> 01:02:01.620
wow,
that thing was running around like it's nervous.

1014
01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.520
That means somebody,
yet something else is bigger than eats that.

1015
01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.380
And then there's something bigger than that that eats that.

1016
01:02:07.381 --> 01:02:11.130
And you know the deal.
And I started hearing Bill Curtis,
his voice in my head,

1017
01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.800
you know,
his girlfriend didn't get up,

1018
01:02:13.801 --> 01:02:18.801
so he decided to go hiking alone around seven 30 that evening when bill didn't,

1019
01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.150
Nia started getting worried

1020
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.410
and that's where they use horrific words like remains,
you know,

1021
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.230
they find my torn jacket,
one of my legs just laying on the fucking path.

1022
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.820
That's when I started.
So I overrode my ego

1023
01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:44.750
and I said,
fuck this.
And I turned back around and I immediately was like,

1024
01:02:44.751 --> 01:02:47.850
I'm going to get a knife.
I,
if I'm going to go on here by myself,

1025
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:48.890
I at least need a knife.

1026
01:02:48.891 --> 01:02:53.891
I'm going to get one of those big fucking Daniel Boone stab a grizzly bear right

1027
01:02:54.981 --> 01:02:56.150
in the fucking throat.
Right?

1028
01:02:57.410 --> 01:03:01.610
So I go to the fish and tackle place down there or whatever the hell it is,

1029
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:04.310
the sporting good place.
And I say,
yeah listen,
I'm going on a hike.

1030
01:03:04.311 --> 01:03:06.620
I want a knife just getting freaked out.

1031
01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:09.770
Then I'm going to get eaten by a mountain lion.
And the guy's like,
Nah,

1032
01:03:09.771 --> 01:03:12.890
you don't want a knife.
You don't want to get in.
Do you want a knife to get,

1033
01:03:12.891 --> 01:03:14.810
you're going to,
you got to get in close with the knife.

1034
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.880
And I was thinking about that.
How hard a grizzly bear cans,

1035
01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.180
you know that by an bitch slap that they have.

1036
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.030
Will Your fucking head spins around you break your neck.

1037
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:27.330
Just imagine me still being able to hold onto the knife.

1038
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.150
You know the average NFL running back,

1039
01:03:30.151 --> 01:03:32.790
if he gets stuck by Ray Lewis fumbles the football,

1040
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:34.830
I'm going to be able to hang onto this knife.

1041
01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:37.350
Taken a fucking bitch slap from a grizzly bear.

1042
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:40.620
It's gonna fall on the ground and that's going to rip my face off.

1043
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.700
And then I'm going to be on Oprah talking about how I feel blessed that it rip

1044
01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:48.480
my face off.
Cause now I know what's important in life,
right?
Isn't what,

1045
01:03:48.481 --> 01:03:53.481
isn't that what they always do after somebody gets their face ripped off or they

1046
01:03:54.161 --> 01:03:56.650
get burnt to a crisp and then they just sit there,
Yay.

1047
01:03:56.651 --> 01:04:00.700
Realize what's important in life is actually the best thing that ever happened

1048
01:04:00.701 --> 01:04:03.190
to me.
I took everything for granted.
It's just like,
whoa.

1049
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:08.910
It's amazing that,
that,
that's how they feel.
Because I would not feel that way.

1050
01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:10.660
I would fucking be like,
Nah,

1051
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.610
I would be lying to everybody in the hospital that I felt great and I felt

1052
01:04:14.611 --> 01:04:19.230
blessed and I would then climb onto the top of the hospital and I would just

1053
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:20.064
roll off.

1054
01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:29.150
Yeah.
What I'm saying people I would not do well with that challenge.
You know,

1055
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.080
the,
all the religious people say that,
that the Lord only challenges those,

1056
01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:36.800
that he feels are strong enough.
I'll tell you right now,

1057
01:04:36.801 --> 01:04:41.310
that's why I still have a face because he knows I'm a big fag.
Um,

1058
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:44.510
anyways,
so the guy goes,
listen,
you don't,
you don't want a knife.

1059
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:50.270
What you want is some pepper spray.
I go,
pepper spray.
He goes,
no.
He goes,
this is,

1060
01:04:50.271 --> 01:04:54.350
this is,
this is like bear pepper spray and I'm looking,

1061
01:04:54.351 --> 01:04:57.890
I got the package right here.
It says Grizzly,
tough pepper spray,

1062
01:04:57.891 --> 01:05:02.891
and there's a picture of a bear counter assault bear deterrent c.

1063
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:07.740
So they're already given in what this product that you're going to get
assaulted.

1064
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.790
It's not assault preventer,
it's counter assault.

1065
01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:15.800
Because basically the Goddamn bear is going to be coming at you so fast,

1066
01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:20.440
you know,
and those things can't stop on a dime.
They're like a giant SUV.

1067
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:21.363
They're going to,

1068
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:24.700
you're going to hit him with that fucking pepper spray and it's going to do a

1069
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:28.630
barrel roll right over you.
And they feel lucky.
It's going to keep fucking going.

1070
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:31.083
So anyways,

1071
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:36.840
he says this shit is actually strong enough to blind a fucking human being,

1072
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:45.280
but evidently not a bear,
which doesn't make sense to me because like I said,

1073
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:48.700
as much as I can understand that a bear can bitch slapped me down off a fucking

1074
01:05:48.701 --> 01:05:53.260
mountain,
you know,
and eyeballs and eyeball,
right?
You poke a bear in the eye,

1075
01:05:53.261 --> 01:05:57.220
he's going to do that little fucking,
you know,
that little dance,

1076
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:01.510
you know the,
I got poked in the eye dance.
Even a bear's going to do that.

1077
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:05.950
So anyway,
so I got this shit cost me 50 bucks,
right?

1078
01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:12.340
So I got this shit and then I went on a hike yesterday with Nia.
Um,

1079
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.360
up to,
what was it?
Bertha summit.
Bertha peak.

1080
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.660
Leah.
Yeah.
Bertha peak,

1081
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.850
which was like a two and a half hour goddamn hike.
At least for us.

1082
01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:27.400
I know some Douche from big bear's going to write it and do,

1083
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:32.170
actually I can do it in 45 minutes.
Can,
yeah.
Well go ahead.

1084
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.500
They're fucking Tonto.
Have a good time.
Um,

1085
01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:41.290
so I buy this shit right?
And what do I do?
I forget it like an asshole.

1086
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:46.600
So then I just,
you know,
I said [inaudible] fuck it.
There's two of us,
you know,

1087
01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:49.390
he is a lot more curvier than I am.

1088
01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:52.690
She probably looked like a better cut of meat.
I'll be fine.

1089
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:58.960
What?
Come here,
India,
come over here.

1090
01:06:58.961 --> 01:07:02.840
Let's talk about the hike real quick and then I'll dismiss you coming into the

1091
01:07:02.841 --> 01:07:06.880
studio.
Dude,
I'll tell you,
this is how much this is how much of a of a,

1092
01:07:06.881 --> 01:07:11.881
of a fucking red head I am is that not only do I want to come up here to this

1093
01:07:12.191 --> 01:07:13.270
freezing cold lake,

1094
01:07:13.271 --> 01:07:17.500
we actually have a Jacuzzi here on I and Nia convinced me to get into this shit,

1095
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:22.870
uh,
two nights ago and even that was too hot for me.
It wasn't even that hot.

1096
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:28.240
Oh,
I can't handle that.
I can't fucking breathe.
I can't,
I hate that.

1097
01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:32.290
I hate her.
I ain't having a hot shower.
I hate all that.
I hate the sun.

1098
01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:37.330
I don't like heat in general.
I like being up here where it's fucking cold.
Okay.

1099
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.280
I like how you just said that like,
like I'm acting like you were challenging me.

1100
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:45.700
It's okay.
It's okay to like cold things.

1101
01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:49.120
You know what I don't like about this place?

1102
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.910
I don't like how every cabin you ever rent has like,

1103
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:59.590
it's like whenever you go into the bathroom,
there's no heat whatsoever.
You know?

1104
01:07:59.591 --> 01:08:01.780
Now that I've bitched about how I like,
you know,
hate the heat,

1105
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.490
but I don't like that.
You go in there,

1106
01:08:03.491 --> 01:08:05.950
right to relieve yourself and you're like your shirt.

1107
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:10.510
Your shirt is blowing in the breeze and every one of these fucking cabins.

1108
01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.010
It's always like a story.
Dude.

1109
01:08:12.011 --> 01:08:16.070
My grandfather built it back in the twenties this even a cabin.

1110
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:21.530
What is it?
This is a full on house.
This is a house.
No,
it isn't.
No,
it isn't.
Look,

1111
01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:25.640
it's got wood on the ceilings.
It's got a moose head above us.
This is a cabin.

1112
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:31.190
It's got a sled hanging from the ceiling.
It's got two fireplaces.
Yeah,

1113
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.990
within sight of each other.
This is a cabin,
but it's a house.
It's on ground.

1114
01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:38.600
There's a backyard.
Look,

1115
01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:42.830
I'm not saying there's dirt floors in the remains of Abe Lincoln in the corner.

1116
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:47.360
All right,
but if we went to look at this God damn thing,

1117
01:08:47.361 --> 01:08:50.570
would you call this thing a house?
Like if people are looking for a house,

1118
01:08:50.690 --> 01:08:55.250
would you be like a seasonal?
I like a cabin.
I see what you're saying,
but

1119
01:08:55.870 --> 01:09:00.130
<v 10>oh Jesus.
Trying to get a woman to agree with you.</v>

1120
01:09:00.131 --> 01:09:03.160
If you want to hear something that this guy wrote in,
this guy wrote it in,

1121
01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:05.320
wrote in all the way from Afghanistan.

1122
01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:11.140
Let me see if I can find this here.
Is overrated.

1123
01:09:11.141 --> 01:09:15.580
Underrated.
This is a classic here,
right?
Overrated.
All right brother.

1124
01:09:15.581 --> 01:09:17.020
I got one for you.
Overrated.

1125
01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:22.240
Trying to have a logical argument with a woman you're dating that.

1126
01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:25.030
Just wait.
Do I need to be here for this?
Yeah.
Yeah,

1127
01:09:25.031 --> 01:09:28.120
because you need to balance it out so this doesn't come off as totally massage.

1128
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:30.250
Monistic all right.
What?

1129
01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:33.190
<v 8>You don't have to be here.
No,
go ahead.</v>

1130
01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:38.720
<v 10>All right.
Just come on here.
Beef.
Be Fun.
Have Fun.
All right.
Overrated.</v>

1131
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.970
Try to have a logical argument with a woman you're dating.

1132
01:09:40.971 --> 01:09:45.740
It never ceases to amaze me every time I overhear some retard complaining about

1133
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:50.741
some chick that won't listen and won't listen to them and argues with them all

1134
01:09:50.961 --> 01:09:51.680
the time.

1135
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:56.060
Any veteran dude who's been with the check over 48 hours knows that they don't

1136
01:09:56.061 --> 01:10:01.061
stay on topic and they don't think logically they aren't trying to fix shit.

1137
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:02.720
It's an emotional thing with them.

1138
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:07.010
So why anyone thinks they can talk to a chicken?
That mindset is beyond me.

1139
01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.000
The way I see it.

1140
01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:11.720
Most guys go one of two routes when presented with an angry bitch.

1141
01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.520
This guy seems enlightened,
right?

1142
01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:17.520
<v 8>Yeah,
exactly.
Why should I listen to anything in this fucking apple has to say,</v>

1143
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:21.120
<v 10>don't let them make you mad.
He's throwing you off your game anyways.</v>

1144
01:10:21.121 --> 01:10:24.990
Either they choose the path of least resistance saying yeah.

1145
01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:28.860
Over and over again and nodding and gazing into oblivion.
Lot of guys do that.

1146
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:33.540
Those are the hen peck guys.
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay,
fine.
Yeah.
Yup.
Um,

1147
01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:37.080
cause they know whatever they say won't make a difference or they pander to

1148
01:10:37.081 --> 01:10:40.950
their petty weak emotions and sensitivities by talking slowly,

1149
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.180
uh,
at adult whisper trying to come and appease them.

1150
01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.640
Both methods have their benefits.
However,

1151
01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:51.270
I'd like to offer a third avenue if I may.

1152
01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.600
I've been faithfully married seven years now and it works so far.

1153
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.590
Not that I'm an expert,
but here you go.
Here's his,
his third one.
All right.

1154
01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.300
First,
like any competitive dude,
you beat them at their own game.

1155
01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:06.990
When they come at you saying something like,
why is this stock on the ground?

1156
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:10.290
And I told you to put it,
blah,
blah blah.
And that Bitchy,
whiny.

1157
01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:15.291
I wanna fight voice wagging their finger and cocking their head sideways with

1158
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.760
this guy on a reality show.
Or is this I was wife reacts.
Um,
anyways,

1159
01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:22.260
you just reply in your loudest tone,

1160
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:28.050
whatever the fuck the last thing that pissed you off was.
Um,

1161
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:32.100
and as you say it,
you keep eye contact and walk straight up to them.

1162
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.830
So basically if you said,
why is it,
why are these socks on the ground?

1163
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:41.610
I'm supposed to in my loudest voice,
go and not break it.
Contact,

1164
01:11:41.611 --> 01:11:42.720
walk right up to you and be like,

1165
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:43.653
<v 4>what did you do</v>

1166
01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.810
<v 10>and not,
and he's not done yet.
This is the beginning.
This is the first quarter.</v>

1167
01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.360
Okay,
let's let the game plan unfold here.

1168
01:11:55.970 --> 01:12:00.380
Um,
all right,
what the hell am I lost my place?
Uh,
usually this will startle them,

1169
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:04.740
um,
as they come back.
No,
come on here.
You've got to listen to as they come back.

1170
01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:09.110
Can you tie this is like they tell you what to do when approaching a bear or

1171
01:12:09.111 --> 01:12:12.980
something like that.
Okay.
Make a lot of noise.

1172
01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:18.260
Just let me finish Douche bag.
Let me finish.
Yeah,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm here.

1173
01:12:18.261 --> 01:12:23.210
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'll be all right as they come back with what?
Uh,

1174
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:25.340
as they come back with,

1175
01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.620
what does that have to do with whatever we're arguing about?

1176
01:12:27.621 --> 01:12:31.670
You just pulled down your pants and start jacking your dick while they stand

1177
01:12:31.671 --> 01:12:35.130
there with that dumb,
confused look on their face and C'mon,

1178
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:39.520
you gotta be back here for the reactions.
All right,
so

1179
01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.280
and while they try and know,
this is obviously Joe,
okay,

1180
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:46.310
maybe this is forward thinking.
Let me,
let me finish here.

1181
01:12:46.311 --> 01:12:50.210
This is a new strategy and while they try to regain whatever thought they had in

1182
01:12:50.211 --> 01:12:54.890
that scanner breaks skill,
you just keep going to town,
not saying a word.

1183
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:58.580
If they talk to you till completion,
you just say thank you.

1184
01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:03.950
That's about what that argument was worth.
And you walk away as you leave,

1185
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:09.070
pick up the sock or whatever and tossed it in the hamper.
There you go.
That's,

1186
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:13.340
that's his thing.
Well at least he still puts it away.
Yeah.
Yes.
Everybody's happy

1187
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:14.623
<v 4>now.
He's joking.</v>

1188
01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:19.780
Obviously somebody who's pandering to your over the top completely ridiculous

1189
01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:24.620
misogynistic statements now today on a weekly basis on this fucking podcast

1190
01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:28.960
trying to impress you by coming up with,
I've seen this time.
It's one or two.

1191
01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.060
Wait a minute,
let me just wait a sec.
No,
this is just some copycat fan.

1192
01:13:35.061 --> 01:13:38.410
I'm supposed to take this seriously.
Like this is a real thing.
I don't,
I don't,

1193
01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:40.910
I'm not giving this thought next.

1194
01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:44.310
<v 10>Anyways,
so he said,
Bill,</v>

1195
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:48.300
you're way with dealing with women is pretty good,
but it's passive aggressive.

1196
01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:49.560
I don't even know what he's talking about.

1197
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:54.480
And I know how you feel about that shit about being passive aggressive.
Uh,

1198
01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.990
even if you're doing it to maintain the high road for your future breakup,

1199
01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:01.890
why does it matter if the re what does it matter if the relationship is over?

1200
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:04.200
I don't know what he thinks my strategy is.
Anyways,
he said,

1201
01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:07.770
you might as well say fuck it and go out in a blaze of glory.
Granted,

1202
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.930
I know about losing your cool and shit like that,

1203
01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.020
but in the end it just builds up and leads to a bigger blow up.
You end up,
uh,

1204
01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:17.680
staring at the ceiling or yelling as you drive in the car thinking,
damn,

1205
01:14:17.681 --> 01:14:21.820
I should've come back with this or that.
No,
fuck that.
Uh,
no matter how,

1206
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:23.500
where do your snap your comeback is,

1207
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:26.260
it wouldn't have made any difference cause that bitch isn't going to listen.

1208
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:28.960
The only thing you wouldn't know that this guy's happily married.

1209
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:31.830
The only thing you don't sound happily married letting it,

1210
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:34.780
you're letting this guy get to you.
He's totally winning right now.

1211
01:14:34.781 --> 01:14:37.940
You're getting mad.
He said to pull out his dick and jacket until completion.

1212
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:43.540
This is bullshit.
Why am I listening to this?
Just trying to be funny.

1213
01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:45.760
Yeah,
that's,
that's what,
and you know,

1214
01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:50.320
what you're doing is you're being a fun sponge.
You just soak it all the fucking,

1215
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:52.840
that totally isn't really taking it seriously.

1216
01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:57.160
Like that lady on NPR lady who I talked to the other day to hype this Gig,

1217
01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:01.030
and I was talking about Arnold Schwartzenegger and she just goes,

1218
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:04.120
I don't think that situation is funny at all.

1219
01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:09.850
So of course that really,
that doesn't think it's funny at all.
Well,

1220
01:15:09.851 --> 01:15:10.810
it doesn't divert me.

1221
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:15.670
So I just plow into my fucking material and it's just dead silence.

1222
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.120
And the other two comics are laughing.
So she goes,

1223
01:15:19.121 --> 01:15:22.570
I don't find that funny at all.
I go,
well,
you know,
I always all my jokes,

1224
01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:26.430
I usually end up losing half the,
I mean,
wait a minute.
She goes,
I always,

1225
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.370
I always end up losing half the crowd.
And this is the NPR egg head response.

1226
01:15:30.371 --> 01:15:35.050
She goes,
actually,
I'm a third of the crowd.
But it was,
I was hyping a better fit.

1227
01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.270
Yeah.
So I didn't say anything.
I want him to be like,
oh to share.

1228
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.290
She did the math,
she ended the interview when we,
when we ended the interview,

1229
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:45.460
she goes,
okay.
And that's,

1230
01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:49.960
I'm so and so and this has been how to build a birdhouse with the special comedy

1231
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.860
addition,
whatever the stupid NPR story was.
And then she,
and she goes,
okay guys,

1232
01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:57.280
thanks a lot.
She goes,
yeah,
that wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.

1233
01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:02.200
She actually said that to us.
Yeah,
totally cool.
I'm being the NPR lady right now.

1234
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:02.830
Yeah.

1235
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:07.210
Cause you're actually thinking that this guy is going to like is happily married

1236
01:16:07.211 --> 01:16:11.520
for seven years and he goes up and he screams in his wife's face while like

1237
01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:14.920
she's a grizzly bear and then takes his dick out in Jackson occasionally to

1238
01:16:14.921 --> 01:16:18.910
completion.
See,
you know what it is?

1239
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:22.670
What is what it really is,
is that I annoy the shit out of you and I,

1240
01:16:22.671 --> 01:16:26.800
my views about women are so fucking annoying to you that the second this guy

1241
01:16:26.801 --> 01:16:30.340
started talking,
you were,
you weren't yelling at him.
You were yelling at me.

1242
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:34.340
I'll fucking yell at you too.
So get it off your chest.
Um,

1243
01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:38.350
I'll tell you what's on my chest.
What is your problem?

1244
01:16:38.370 --> 01:16:40.840
You want this great guy,
all tired,

1245
01:16:40.841 --> 01:16:45.010
fucking rented out a cabin by the lake to house.
It's a house.

1246
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.450
I'll go with that.
Really?

1247
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.350
What the Shag rugs do you tell them how amazing our meal was last night start?

1248
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.430
No,
no,
no.
Don't,
don't get off topic here.
Oh,

1249
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.150
I want to know what is your goddamn problem with me?

1250
01:16:59.530 --> 01:17:03.620
Nothing.
I just want to sleep longer.
You come in there and you're like,
Ooh,
Ooh,

1251
01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:06.850
what's going on?
So your fucking nose and my ear.

1252
01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:10.490
I want to sleep well because it's the Monday morning podcast.

1253
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:14.120
<v 8>I have to do it Monday morning or else the title doesn't make any sense.</v>

1254
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:19.130
My Monday morning listeners,
by the way,
not yours.
You're selfish.
Cons my morning.

1255
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:23.660
Go ahead.
So that's what I was saying.
I know you want it to be on the podcast.

1256
01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.340
So I was saying,
you know it's going to get a little loud out there.
Yeah.

1257
01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:34.010
All right,
fine.
Yeah,
yeah.
One of these days,

1258
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:37.340
the day you realize that you don't have a leg to stand on in this relationship,

1259
01:17:37.341 --> 01:17:40.580
we're going to get along so much better.
That doesn't make any sense.
Yeah,

1260
01:17:40.581 --> 01:17:45.290
it does.
How great was the cowboy steak house down the street.
Oh,
delicious.

1261
01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.160
Yeah.
Huh?
The fucking ribs.
Yeah.
I'm going to hype it.
You know what?

1262
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:53.060
I don't have any advertising this week,
but I'm going to fucking hate this place.

1263
01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:55.010
It's called the cabinet.
A cowboy steak house.

1264
01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:00.260
The cowboys take us on a,
I forget the street.

1265
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:02.810
I don't know what the fuck is his big bear lake.
Yeah.
Big Bear.

1266
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:05.180
Like you can't miss it.
It's one of the three restaurants up here.

1267
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:08.990
So we come walking in right immediately.
You know.

1268
01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:12.840
You know they got like the country music just to get,
oh boy.

1269
01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.970
Never meaning no harm but laid above the blue.
They got all this country,

1270
01:18:16.971 --> 01:18:20.990
fucking songs played.
So Nia obviously gets nervous,
right?

1271
01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:24.890
Places like that.
Yeah.
I get a little concerned that you get nervous.

1272
01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.550
You know it's going to be like rude and everyone's going to stop and look at me.

1273
01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.490
What in tarnation she doing in here?
Yeah.
Even though we're in,

1274
01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:34.040
we're in California.
Yeah.
But,
no,
but no,

1275
01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:38.690
but that's the thing though is the second you get outside the cities is it gets

1276
01:18:38.691 --> 01:18:42.950
a very,
it can get very Macon,
Georgia quickly.

1277
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.950
And sometimes it doesn't like up here.
It doesn't.
These people are all cool.

1278
01:18:46.190 --> 01:18:49.340
Thanks everybody is very cool.
But we went in there and you were like,

1279
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:52.550
you were asking me if you thought,
you know,
if this second I smelled that food,

1280
01:18:52.551 --> 01:18:55.960
I was like,
this,
this is going to be good.
That was delicious.
Yeah.

1281
01:18:56.030 --> 01:19:00.350
I saw that big fat guy eating the ribs.
I was like,
this is how fat was that guy.

1282
01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.260
He was pretty fan.
He had a whole thing to himself.
We split it.

1283
01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:06.260
He's had those guys.
He's one of those guys who's so fatty.

1284
01:19:06.261 --> 01:19:10.190
Wears shorts all year round
pans or to castrate.

1285
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.320
Dude,
I don't get cold.
Why wouldn't you?
You're fucking Walrus.

1286
01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:18.680
What gets you your biggest prop,
Mike?
That's easy.

1287
01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:22.730
Only gap here and get attacked by a polar bear.
Thank you.
All right,

1288
01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:28.130
so anyways,
so this guy actually asked me what my strategy is with women.
Well,

1289
01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:29.960
I'm going to tell you this,
I actually a,

1290
01:19:29.961 --> 01:19:33.950
I'm doing a giant chunk of material on this.
Um,

1291
01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:38.660
I disagree with you.
Women argue,
stay on topic if they're right.

1292
01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:41.210
All right.
If they're wrong,

1293
01:19:41.211 --> 01:19:45.110
that's when they do all the diversionary tactics and they try to make it about

1294
01:19:45.111 --> 01:19:47.690
something else.
And if you're not going for it,

1295
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:50.540
if you don't fall for their diversionary tactics,

1296
01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:54.230
then their last ditch effort is trying to just to try to make you mad.

1297
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:57.980
Like what you did to me yesterday when he kept saying I was acting like a baby.

1298
01:19:58.790 --> 01:20:01.580
Cause you knew I was right.
You're right.
It's like you're acting like a baby.

1299
01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:04.820
I said once he said it more than once.
No,
I did not know.

1300
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:07.620
Then you came in the bedroom and you said,
why are you acting like a bay?

1301
01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:12.000
You're throwing a temper tantrum.
Slammed the door.
I walked away.

1302
01:20:12.001 --> 01:20:15.080
Calm and cool.
Then why did I hear the door close?

1303
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:20.490
Because it's a fucking solid object.
It because it's a door.

1304
01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:25.230
Doors make noise when you open and close.
I didn't slam it.
Wow.

1305
01:20:25.231 --> 01:20:28.050
What happened is slamming the door now.
I didn't send the door.

1306
01:20:28.051 --> 01:20:31.710
I didn't slam the door.
And you said that's not okay.

1307
01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.980
That wouldn't work in a debating class.
We're not in a debating class.

1308
01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:39.790
We're on your,
on my podcast.
A podcast.
All right.

1309
01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:44.310
All right.
You know what?
You don't have to be here.
I don't.

1310
01:20:44.311 --> 01:20:46.260
I don't need to take that on my vacation.

1311
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:49.260
How fucked up was that hike we went on yesterday?
We went,

1312
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:53.820
thank God that hike was your exit.

1313
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.531
Yeah.
And you know what?

1314
01:20:55.531 --> 01:21:00.300
You are great for the first 90% that last 10% I don't want to go.

1315
01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:04.500
And you started doing that toddler thing where you make in your arms go limp and

1316
01:21:04.501 --> 01:21:08.840
your head was going back.
I was,
I was frustrated.
I hadn't met.
Yeah,

1317
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:13.650
it was a long,
tiring,
difficult hike.
Beautiful.
But you know,

1318
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:15.890
and you know what?
I realized there three hours,
whatever,

1319
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:17.730
in a plan crash and we survived.

1320
01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.570
I'm going to have to be the guy that makes something happen.

1321
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:22.703
What are you talking about?

1322
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:25.590
I'm talking about that last 10% of the hike when you tapped out,

1323
01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:30.310
you're tapped out.
Yeah,
but I kept going.
I just kept quiet.
Why?

1324
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:35.280
Cause I kept urging you on like a fucking team leader.
Wow.

1325
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:38.130
I didn't expect to go on some like ridiculous hike.

1326
01:21:38.131 --> 01:21:40.320
I told you we should do like a little moderate.

1327
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:42.960
There was nothing particularly about it.
Oh please.

1328
01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:46.800
My feet were killing me by the end of it.
Yeah.
I wear those.
You watch a middle,

1329
01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:49.020
a middle aged white guys wear the new,

1330
01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:54.260
the gray new balance with the inserts and we had to get you one of those.

1331
01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:57.900
What are those things that people put on their foot and they look like the foot

1332
01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:00.350
and it's supposed to be really good for your yeah.

1333
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:05.370
What are those sneakers but their feet fuck things creepy.
You live there.

1334
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:07.710
I was going to say a primate.
We're all fucking premise.

1335
01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:11.850
But you look like a fucking ape.
Yeah.
All you need is your big toe to be bad.

1336
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.310
And some of you with hammertoes gets one of those on,

1337
01:22:14.311 --> 01:22:18.520
on a reverse hammertoes with a fucking the big toe sticking out.

1338
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:21.490
They're gonna look like a goddamn chimp.
Anyways,

1339
01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:24.840
let me plow ahead with the podcast.
All right,
cause your exit done.

1340
01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:29.760
I just heard them eggs and making bacon.
All right.

1341
01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:35.320
I know I'm arguing for arguments.
Yeah.
He argued for it and I'm saying all right,

1342
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:38.220
all right,
I'll see you.
I'll see you on the other side of the cabin.

1343
01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.490
See that people,
that's how you handle them right there.

1344
01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:45.570
Ready to say walking away.
You Talk Shit about.
So getting back to that guy,
um,

1345
01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:49.890
my strategy yet is you don't,
you don't lose your cool.

1346
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:53.940
You stay on target,
right?
Like that dude and star wars.

1347
01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:56.940
You stay on target and um,

1348
01:22:56.941 --> 01:22:59.010
when they're saying over the top mean Shit,

1349
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:02.590
you don't respond to it because that's just them.
Um,

1350
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.150
you ever see a goat get choked to death by a python?
Anybody else?

1351
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:08.860
Watch those fucked up youtube videos.

1352
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:13.810
You know this stunned at first they fight and then there's that middle part
like,

1353
01:23:13.811 --> 01:23:16.090
dude,
what the fuck?
What is this?

1354
01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:19.100
And then the very end when they only have a little bit of air left,

1355
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:21.910
they fucking kicking their legs like a maniac before they die.

1356
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:25.360
That's the female version.
That's the goat version,

1357
01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:30.280
getting getting killed by a python Jesus Christ of,
of women.

1358
01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.780
When they start saying that means shit,

1359
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:35.080
that's that last little kick of the legs before it's over.

1360
01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:39.880
So I don't respond to that shit anymore.
Actually,
I do a little bit,

1361
01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:43.690
but I've got myself to the point where I know that it's happening.

1362
01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:44.920
And then that's what I did yesterday.

1363
01:23:44.921 --> 01:23:48.310
She started doing that shit and I just took my plate of food and I walked in the

1364
01:23:48.311 --> 01:23:52.480
other room and,
uh,
I'm telling you,

1365
01:23:52.481 --> 01:23:54.760
but the big thing is,
is if you're wrong,

1366
01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:58.720
you have to admit it because that gives you credibility in the future.

1367
01:23:58.721 --> 01:23:59.590
So there you go,
sir.

1368
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:03.010
And that was an absolutely fucking hilarious email and it made it even funnier

1369
01:24:03.011 --> 01:24:07.640
with Nia sitting here taking it seriously.
That's ridiculous.
He would,

1370
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:11.660
he wouldn't do that.
I don't,
I'm calling bullshit.

1371
01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:16.340
He didn't jerk off till he came
like his wife.

1372
01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:21.260
I got it.
Tell you though,
uh,
that would be,
uh,

1373
01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:24.110
that would be fucking hilarious to do that.
I mean,

1374
01:24:24.111 --> 01:24:27.350
I could stand there and rub my dick,
but it would just be so funny to me.

1375
01:24:27.351 --> 01:24:30.080
I don't think I could get a hard on.
I gotta be honest with you.

1376
01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:35.490
Oh,
that's disgusting.
All right.
I have a dentist.

1377
01:24:35.491 --> 01:24:38.310
I've been going off on the French lightly,
so some,
uh,

1378
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:42.060
American born person who,
uh,
went over to France,

1379
01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:43.290
which I don't know if I'm buying,

1380
01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.860
I think they just want to hear my opinions on what French people are really
like,

1381
01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:48.960
you know,
and I'm from America,

1382
01:24:48.961 --> 01:24:53.490
so you can trust me like that shit I always talk about on the,
uh,

1383
01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.920
whenever there's some sort of political debate.

1384
01:24:56.490 --> 01:25:01.170
The Obama is a moron and I'm a democrat.
All right,
here we go.

1385
01:25:01.171 --> 01:25:01.941
Hello Mr. Berger.

1386
01:25:01.941 --> 01:25:05.430
I enjoy your podcast very much and I'm also a fan of your standup power.

1387
01:25:07.090 --> 01:25:09.780
Um,
I don't mind you poking fun at the French people too much.

1388
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:14.700
I don't give a fuck with your mind and not you condescending comment.
Um,

1389
01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:19.530
even though I am French,
I just wanted to inform you about the stereotypes.

1390
01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.453
That's funny.

1391
01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:24.360
How come you don't inform me about other stereotypes that I do on this podcast?

1392
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:28.290
Oh,
because it came around to you.
Now you give a shit.
Okay.

1393
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:33.470
Mainly the stereotypes about the French are assholes who hate America.

1394
01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:38.610
Um,
okay.
Okay.
And this person's gonna debunk all these.
Okay.

1395
01:25:38.611 --> 01:25:41.430
Or give me more information.
All right.
Number one,

1396
01:25:41.610 --> 01:25:44.910
Europeans generally hate Americans because,

1397
01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:50.010
and I was born and raised here so I can say this Ma'am or mister,

1398
01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:53.910
whoever wrote this shit,
you could say it anyways.
All right.

1399
01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:58.770
Stop trying to get some sort of credibility by saying you're from here.

1400
01:25:58.771 --> 01:26:02.640
I don't give a fuck where you're from.
All I know is you live in France,

1401
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:06.770
so you've got information and just,
just give it to me.
All right.
All right.

1402
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.160
Europeans generally hate Americans because Americans go to different countries

1403
01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:13.700
and behave rudely.
Uh,

1404
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.550
they expect things to be like in the US,

1405
01:26:17.610 --> 01:26:22.100
such as portion size and the ability for everyone to speak English.

1406
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:24.620
Whenever I go to France and see American tourists,

1407
01:26:24.621 --> 01:26:29.210
I get so embarrassed because they are noxious and expect everyone to suck their

1408
01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:32.190
superior American cock.
All right,

1409
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:36.230
let's stop right there.
First of all,

1410
01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:41.210
when Europeans come to America,
you guys act like assholes too.

1411
01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.680
Yeah.
And Nia just goes and you don't tip.

1412
01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:49.550
You don't give a fuck about our customs with tipping.
You don't fucking tip.

1413
01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:53.300
And then all you do is you come to America and you trash it.

1414
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.380
And I gotta be honest with you,
I,
when I go to other countries,

1415
01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.030
I'm not a rude prick and I would never go to another country and then tell

1416
01:27:02.031 --> 01:27:06.170
people who live there,
why their country sucks.
That's what Europeans do.

1417
01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:10.460
Okay.
And you kind of beat me to the punch here where you say,

1418
01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:13.370
cause they expect everyone to suck this superior American cock.

1419
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.480
I was going to say,
wow,
you sound a little insecure.
And she says,
or he says,

1420
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:21.890
Europeans also have inferiority issues.
Another reason they don't like Americans.

1421
01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:25.160
I don't know how many times I've been told by Swedes,
uh,

1422
01:27:25.161 --> 01:27:28.310
the English Germans and so on that America sucks.

1423
01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.590
And is making the world a worse place.

1424
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:35.330
This makes me extremely patriotic and wanting to defend the u s but I digress

1425
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:38.420
from the French dude.
I actually feel these.
I got agree with you on that one.

1426
01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:39.470
That makes me want to defend it.

1427
01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:42.770
And it's really funny if the English or the Germans

1428
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:47.690
ever talk about a country making the world a worse place.
Okay.

1429
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.420
Cause you guys passed the baton to us.

1430
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:55.230
We're standing on the shoulders of your work of evil.
Um,

1431
01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:57.290
Swedes,
I don't know anything about you.

1432
01:27:57.291 --> 01:27:59.540
You weren't in any of my American history classes.

1433
01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:02.990
The only first sweet I saw him was on the muppet show.
Remember that?

1434
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:07.340
Borghi Borghi Org ed board.
Orgeave,

1435
01:28:07.341 --> 01:28:11.620
Orgeave keyboard.
Bork Bork Bork.
Here we hear you hear me?
Should he be?
Um,

1436
01:28:11.690 --> 01:28:13.280
but I addressed with Fred's number two a,

1437
01:28:13.281 --> 01:28:18.080
the French are not assholes per regions are assholes.

1438
01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:22.520
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
I wasn't born yesterday.
Really?

1439
01:28:22.521 --> 01:28:25.670
You have all your assholes quarantine just in Paris.

1440
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:31.040
There's not one asshole up near the beaches of Normandy.

1441
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:35.750
Huh?
Or down in Nice.
You're telling me I go to Cannes film festival.

1442
01:28:35.751 --> 01:28:38.630
There's not going to be some local asshole.
There is going to be a cunt.

1443
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:44.060
The French Riviera.
C'Mon.
Okay.
Evidently Nia,

1444
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:48.200
all the asshole French people are just in Paris.
Um,
so Mary,

1445
01:28:48.230 --> 01:28:51.740
many Americans go to France and only stay in Paris and then assume that all of

1446
01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:56.030
France is like Paris.
This is so ignorant.
Um,

1447
01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:00.110
it infuriates me.
Um,
well,
you know,

1448
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:05.160
it's the fucking jewel of your country.
Those are the smartest people you got.

1449
01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:08.160
And when they're rude comments,
they are urine.

1450
01:29:08.161 --> 01:29:12.500
Basadur who goes to fucking Paris to go to see a farm?
I mean,

1451
01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.660
goes to France to go see a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere.

1452
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.700
Let me ask you this,
sir.
Or ma'am,

1453
01:29:17.701 --> 01:29:22.380
if you weren't lived in France and you came to America,
where would you go?

1454
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:23.730
Would you go to Nebraska?

1455
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:29.310
God knows you wouldn't find any intelligence out there.
Fuck you buddy.

1456
01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:31.830
You tried growing some corn.
Um,

1457
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:34.500
that is like a,

1458
01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:37.680
going to New York city and assuming that all Americans are like New Yorkers.

1459
01:29:37.681 --> 01:29:41.460
Paris is like New York full of unfriendly people who want you to get out of

1460
01:29:41.461 --> 01:29:45.420
their way.
Big cities are like that.
Small towns are populated by nicer people.

1461
01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:48.960
Uh,
a trait common in all countries.
Well,

1462
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:53.040
I'll definitely say they're much polite or I will agree with that in smaller

1463
01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:53.610
towns,

1464
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:57.870
but they also tend to be a little more fearful and a lot more racist and a lot

1465
01:29:57.871 --> 01:30:02.871
more easier to sway into putting Saran wrap around their outhouse because they

1466
01:30:04.261 --> 01:30:07.500
believe that they're going to be the next victims of a terrorist attack.

1467
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:12.330
Like logically that works in their mind that the terrorist attacks going to be

1468
01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.260
World Trade Center,

1469
01:30:13.261 --> 01:30:18.030
one to the Pentagon and then you're out house in the middle of fucking nowhere.

1470
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:22.710
Like that's the next logical military strategic target.

1471
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.910
Jesus Christ.
Is this podcast even funny anymore?
Sometimes.

1472
01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:31.800
Sometimes I just lose myself in the sentences are number three French women

1473
01:30:31.890 --> 01:30:36.180
shave the only woman in France who don't shave or the elderly,

1474
01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:39.060
Middle Eastern immigrants.
Last time I went to France,

1475
01:30:39.061 --> 01:30:42.300
I told my aunts that Americans don't think they shave and they were very upset

1476
01:30:42.301 --> 01:30:43.890
by this.
When I went to camp,

1477
01:30:43.891 --> 01:30:47.940
all the girls shaved at the beach and went to the beach.
They were all shaved.

1478
01:30:47.941 --> 01:30:51.090
In fact,
the French say Scandinavians don't shave.

1479
01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:55.770
See stereotypes about people in different lands exist everywhere.

1480
01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.880
Wow.
I think I learned something.
Um,

1481
01:30:59.881 --> 01:31:03.120
why the need to put down the women of foreign countries?

1482
01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:07.440
Because it's funny because that's what guys do.

1483
01:31:07.441 --> 01:31:10.950
We break balls and we say,
your women are ugly.
They're hairy,

1484
01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:15.310
their vaginas are horizontal and they're not good leis and we got bigger dicks

1485
01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:17.550
than we can fuck them better.
It's basic shit.

1486
01:31:17.551 --> 01:31:21.600
Talk Page one chapter one of talking shit about another country.

1487
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:25.500
And um,
I dunno,

1488
01:31:25.501 --> 01:31:27.480
I find that all of this to be very condescending.

1489
01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:29.773
<v 3>You know,</v>

1490
01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:33.300
<v 8>as you're sitting there saying stereotypes exist everywhere.</v>

1491
01:31:33.301 --> 01:31:36.870
And I love how the French are getting offended by what we think of them.

1492
01:31:36.871 --> 01:31:41.070
While they think we're all illiterate,
fat fuck's going to a,
to a Carl's Jr.

1493
01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.720
I mean,
it goes both ways.

1494
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:48.290
And I'll tell you why we think that French women don't shave is because there

1495
01:31:48.601 --> 01:31:51.810
was a pop song over here a long time ago,

1496
01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:57.180
a long time ago called 99 red balloons.
No,

1497
01:31:57.181 --> 01:32:00.970
I do not own red balloons,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1498
01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:06.520
Babba,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam.
Yeah,
that's shit.
Right?

1499
01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:12.160
And in the end of the video,
she puts her arms up and add a Harry fucking armpit.

1500
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:15.880
And that was it.
And she was from Germany,

1501
01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:20.650
but it didn't matter to us all know European women shaved.
That was at,

1502
01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:23.680
it was over.
And plus when you look at your continent in,

1503
01:32:23.681 --> 01:32:26.680
realize that it's basically,
for the most part,

1504
01:32:26.681 --> 01:32:28.930
the meat of it all right?

1505
01:32:28.931 --> 01:32:33.931
The countries that we give a shit about is actually smaller than our entire

1506
01:32:34.031 --> 01:32:37.180
country.
Like your countries.
So the size of states over there.

1507
01:32:37.181 --> 01:32:40.840
So we figure if they're not shave and in Germany,
why wouldn't,

1508
01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:43.930
why would they shave and fucking,
uh,
France?

1509
01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:49.240
I mean,
if people in Massachusetts are drunk morons,

1510
01:32:49.241 --> 01:32:51.130
do you think that in Rhode Island they're reading?

1511
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:52.710
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1512
01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:54.090
<v 8>I don't know.
Does that make any sense?</v>

1513
01:32:54.091 --> 01:32:57.870
I just feel like I'm coming off dumber and dumber with each fucking podcast and

1514
01:32:57.871 --> 01:32:59.550
a,
you know what?
There's something freeing about it.

1515
01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:04.440
A number four older Frenchmen smells.
Not all the French back in the day.

1516
01:33:04.441 --> 01:33:09.240
And I mean way back,
people didn't wear deodorant.
My grandmother does.

1517
01:33:09.241 --> 01:33:11.040
And all the other women.
You know what I'm realizing,

1518
01:33:11.190 --> 01:33:13.080
I think a lot of the French stereotypes came,

1519
01:33:13.081 --> 01:33:16.620
came around our World War One and World War II.
Uh,

1520
01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:20.670
you guys haven't needed us to come over there and fight a fucking battle.

1521
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:23.100
I'm joking.

1522
01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:27.390
I understand that world war two was our pay payback for a you guys helping us

1523
01:33:27.391 --> 01:33:30.090
out in the revolutionary way or understand that right?
Most it,

1524
01:33:30.091 --> 01:33:32.820
the revolutionary war,
the French and Indian war.
I can't fucking remember.

1525
01:33:33.810 --> 01:33:36.540
I have no idea.
I don't even remember anymore.
They just all,

1526
01:33:36.541 --> 01:33:38.940
I hated that part of history.
Any sort of powdered wigs,

1527
01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:44.430
anything pre cowboys and Indians I just could give a fuck about.
And even then,

1528
01:33:44.431 --> 01:33:47.310
that was very sketchy.
I liked reading about the younger brothers,

1529
01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:52.530
Jessie and frank.
James Cole younger.
I like reading about that shit.

1530
01:33:54.150 --> 01:33:57.450
Um,
and I liked reading about adventures at sea,
you know,

1531
01:33:57.451 --> 01:33:59.880
pirate ships in that type of stuff,
you know,

1532
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:05.010
but anything with powdered wigs are those American presidents with the big bushy

1533
01:34:05.011 --> 01:34:08.700
beards and no mustaches.
It absolutely put me to sleep,
so I can't remember.

1534
01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.370
Um,
so there's a stereotype for you.

1535
01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.420
Not only do we not know about other countries,
we don't even know about our,
um,

1536
01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.940
uh,
number five French girls are slutty.
Well,
I'll give you that one.

1537
01:34:17.941 --> 01:34:22.830
But the French on a whole artist puritanical as Americans.
Um,
yeah,

1538
01:34:23.010 --> 01:34:25.820
we're just all into getting STDs.
Um,

1539
01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.040
and see sex as a private means of pleasure.

1540
01:34:29.041 --> 01:34:31.080
That one shouldn't be too ashamed of.

1541
01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:36.270
I think it's healthier than keep your legs closed because sex is evil.

1542
01:34:36.271 --> 01:34:41.010
You whore view.
Um,
I definitely think,
yeah,
we take it too far in this country.

1543
01:34:41.011 --> 01:34:45.090
But uh,
last I saw the first AIDS patient caught it in France.

1544
01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:51.390
Oh,
I pulled that one out of my ass.
No Pun intended.
Right.

1545
01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.980
Nia is looking at me that,
that's not true.

1546
01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:58.100
The first guy who got it was that was over in France was a flight attendant

1547
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:04.880
patient number one.
Ground Zero isn't that right now?
Oh Jesus.

1548
01:35:04.881 --> 01:35:06.800
You know something.
Someday when I run for office,

1549
01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:11.000
I think that's the one that's going to come back to haunt me
anyways.
You know,

1550
01:35:11.001 --> 01:35:14.780
I was just fucking with you.
They have Frenchie or former American person,

1551
01:35:14.781 --> 01:35:17.300
whatever.
Um,
yeah,
I don't give a shit.

1552
01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:20.750
What am I dreams is to go to Paris and I think that's going to be happening

1553
01:35:20.751 --> 01:35:24.110
later on this year.
Why you ask?
Well,
I'll tell you why.

1554
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:29.590
If you go to billboard.com you'll notice that all of a sudden Mr Fancy pants

1555
01:35:30.051 --> 01:35:32.390
here has a uh,

1556
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:37.450
a run of dates throughout Scandinavia and a in October.

1557
01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.260
Go to [inaudible] dot com be,

1558
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:43.250
you are our go to the left hand in the left hand corner.

1559
01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.460
You'll see all my dates and scroll down to October.

1560
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:52.570
I am doing a Helsinki Oslow Copenhagen and Stockholm,

1561
01:35:54.921 --> 01:35:58.340
Sweden,
so I always get confused.

1562
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.590
Oslow is Finland,
Helsinki is Norway,
Stockholm,
Sweden.

1563
01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.160
I've been that.
Copenhagen,
Denmark.
How fucking awesome is that.

1564
01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:12.161
So I'm tossing a one night in London before that.

1565
01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.530
And at the end of that,
I think I'm going to go to Paris.

1566
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:18.050
Why the fuck not right?

1567
01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:23.660
That is if the American dollar doesn't collapse in August and we're all in

1568
01:36:23.661 --> 01:36:26.150
worker camps.
Speaking of that Shit,

1569
01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:32.210
have you guys seen this stuff about the uh,
oh,
the suicides at the,
uh,

1570
01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:36.860
the apple plant,
you know,
that really cunty commercial where they go,
uh,
you know,

1571
01:36:36.861 --> 01:36:40.940
if you don't have an iPhone then you don't have the iPhone.
You know,

1572
01:36:40.941 --> 01:36:44.030
and I wanted to get an iPhone until I saw those goddamn commercials and they

1573
01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:46.300
kept like,
uh,
just,

1574
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:49.730
it's the most bizarre advertising.

1575
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.530
It makes me angry at the IFA.

1576
01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:55.580
I never had any anger towards the iPhone or the people who had one.

1577
01:36:55.581 --> 01:37:00.260
I never gave a shit.
I was like,
I phones to shit.
I heard it.
It drops calls.

1578
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:01.760
I'll wait till it's on Verizon.

1579
01:37:02.210 --> 01:37:06.290
And then right when it gets on Verizon and I'm all ready to jump on board,

1580
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.480
they come up with this Nananana fucking cunty shit going.
You know,

1581
01:37:11.481 --> 01:37:12.710
if you had an iPhone right now,

1582
01:37:12.711 --> 01:37:16.010
you could be looking at the inside he a fucking throat and uh,

1583
01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:20.300
diagnosing your fucking throat cancer before it even happens.
You know?

1584
01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.430
But if you don't have the iPhone,
you don't have the iPhone.
It's like,

1585
01:37:22.431 --> 01:37:27.350
well fuck you on cute and sticking with the droid.
So anyways,

1586
01:37:27.351 --> 01:37:31.250
now I read they just had the 10th suicide

1587
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:34.760
at the apple plant.
Now who's kitten heel?

1588
01:37:34.761 --> 01:37:36.620
We all know that everything that we're wearing,

1589
01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:41.480
everything that we're using is made by some four year old making 6 cents an hour

1590
01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:45.650
somewhere we'll ever deadly.
They,
these people have had enough.

1591
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:50.690
They've had 10 suicides at the apple plant.
Here we go.

1592
01:37:50.691 --> 01:37:53.870
On the same day that apple,
Dell,

1593
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:58.870
Hewlett Packard promised to look working conditions at China's Foxconn plant,

1594
01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:01.500
a 10th worker committed suicide.

1595
01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:06.030
The death of a 19 year old male male worker.
Uh,
it's too bad.

1596
01:38:06.031 --> 01:38:10.590
He was like one year away from getting his fucking severance pay or is ah,
shit,

1597
01:38:10.591 --> 01:38:15.430
I fucked it up.
What the hell do you get it when you do 20 years on the force?
Ah,

1598
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:18.600
I'm sorry everybody.
I'm on my fucking vacation mode.

1599
01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:21.630
What the Hell I get my pension.
What does that,

1600
01:38:21.631 --> 01:38:26.450
when you work 20 years on the force
and he's only 19,
you get it.

1601
01:38:26.630 --> 01:38:30.020
Cause he's been working since he was two.
Oh Jesus.
Um,

1602
01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:33.650
the death of a 19 year old male worker also came just after the company's

1603
01:38:33.651 --> 01:38:38.651
billionaire founder took the media on tour of the sprawling complex in response

1604
01:38:39.861 --> 01:38:44.000
to accusations from Labor groups that workers toiled and sweatshop like

1605
01:38:44.001 --> 01:38:47.480
conditions.
Oh,
hilarious.
So then the billionaire shows up,

1606
01:38:47.690 --> 01:38:51.680
they cleaned the place up,
stick in a water bubbler and go say,
it's great.

1607
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:56.600
Um,
and I know what a lot of you fucking heartless [inaudible] gonna say,

1608
01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.930
you're gonna say,
well,
sweatshop labor is necessary.

1609
01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:04.940
Do you want to pay $8,000 for a laptop where here's my rebuttal.

1610
01:39:05.630 --> 01:39:10.630
You know what if the content that top didn't have to make $1 billion a year,

1611
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:15.950
you know,
kind of like when they were talking to the oil companies and they go,

1612
01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:20.240
you're projected to make 350 billion.
How about you just make 340 billion?

1613
01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.800
Do you have to make that much money?
That's the thing.

1614
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:26.920
The people at the top are taken way too much fucking money.

1615
01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:30.790
There's no fucking way that the only,

1616
01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:37.260
a reasonable way to make a laptop is to give people such shitty wages that

1617
01:39:39.491 --> 01:39:41.830
suicide is a better fucking option.

1618
01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:46.720
And you do it at the fucking plant to make some sort of political statement.

1619
01:39:47.650 --> 01:39:51.700
There's just no fucking way.
How about the people at the top?
You mean

1620
01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:55.570
once you got $100 million to over what,

1621
01:39:55.571 --> 01:39:58.960
what do you do you ever need to get another paycheck?
I don't understand that.

1622
01:39:59.830 --> 01:40:00.760
I don't understand that.

1623
01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:04.000
And I'm not saying that the people at the top shouldn't be filthy,

1624
01:40:04.001 --> 01:40:07.510
stinking rich because they came up with it.

1625
01:40:07.511 --> 01:40:11.350
But you shouldn't be paying people.
This shouldn't be sweatshops,
everybody.

1626
01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:13.473
That's all I'm saying.

1627
01:40:14.770 --> 01:40:19.770
And what sucks is that we actually came up with unions in this country because

1628
01:40:19.781 --> 01:40:23.200
of sweatshop like conditions.
And uh,

1629
01:40:23.230 --> 01:40:27.100
but what ended up happening was the people in the unions took advantage of it.

1630
01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:28.900
And with their strength,

1631
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:32.830
they became a bunch of slothy Douche bags to the point that there's a lot of

1632
01:40:32.831 --> 01:40:35.260
people who actually have negative views about unions.

1633
01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:36.880
That's how bad it is in this country.

1634
01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:40.750
And they're actually excited that they're going to do away with unions.

1635
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:44.530
A lot of people want to do away with fucking unions rather than reform them.

1636
01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:48.810
But to do away with them is we're going to end up like these poor bastards in

1637
01:40:48.850 --> 01:40:52.540
fucking China,
you know,
so and shit together and go and you know what?

1638
01:40:52.541 --> 01:40:56.050
I think I'd rather out of fucking window then make another God damn iPhone.

1639
01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:58.181
Um,
so anyways,

1640
01:40:58.181 --> 01:41:01.990
it says the company is bought psychiatrist and Buddhist monks to the factory,

1641
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:07.830
to the factory complex to support workers and now plans now play soothing music

1642
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:11.170
along production lines.
Why don't you just fucking pay them?

1643
01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:13.200
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1644
01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.370
<v 8>Um,
it plans to install 10 foot tall,</v>

1645
01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:20.500
tall fences to stop workers jumping from buildings and may give workers a 20%

1646
01:41:24.741 --> 01:41:29.210
pay raise.
This is how tight these fucking rich cuts are.

1647
01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:32.750
Let's play soothing music and put a fence up.
We'll try.

1648
01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:37.370
We'll try that first rather than just giving them more money.
What is it?

1649
01:41:37.371 --> 01:41:41.870
What is it 20% pay raise when you make an 8 cents an hour?
Um,

1650
01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:44.293
and anyways,

1651
01:41:44.570 --> 01:41:48.170
Foxconn representatives maintained that the increase would not be in response to

1652
01:41:48.171 --> 01:41:52.310
the suicides,
but is being considered because business has been good.

1653
01:41:52.311 --> 01:41:54.190
Give me a fucking break.
Did you hear that?

1654
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:56.960
Near the 10th suicide at one of those apple plants,

1655
01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:00.050
the sweatshops that killed themselves over there,

1656
01:42:00.051 --> 01:42:03.560
so they decided to put up a 10 foot wall so they can't jump and they're playing

1657
01:42:03.561 --> 01:42:08.140
soothing music and they're considering giving them a 20% pay raise.
Ah,

1658
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:12.800
there you go.
Yeah,
exactly.
All right.
Let's,
uh,

1659
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:16.070
let's move on here.
A lot of interesting,
a great emails.
By the way,

1660
01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:20.750
this week people sent me some really interesting stuff here.
Um,

1661
01:42:20.751 --> 01:42:24.770
and shit that I can actually help people out on here.
Um,

1662
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:29.390
if I could just get to the goddamn thing,
people put your feet up.

1663
01:42:29.391 --> 01:42:34.340
Here's a little fucking commercial here.
Um,
God damn you.

1664
01:42:34.341 --> 01:42:37.160
You fucking whore.
Where the hell is it?

1665
01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:40.381
I,
you know,

1666
01:42:40.381 --> 01:42:44.070
some days I just really fucking hate myself and this is one of these fucking

1667
01:42:44.071 --> 01:42:44.904
moments.

1668
01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:49.320
This guy sent me this great email asking if maybe it was under advice.

1669
01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:53.210
Here it is.
Here it is.

1670
01:42:54.650 --> 01:42:56.540
This was a professional podcast.

1671
01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:01.640
I would have fucking edited this part out.
All right,

1672
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:07.340
advice bill.
Uh,
this is going to sound a little gay,
but I'm gay,

1673
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:08.210
so fuck you.

1674
01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:13.010
One of the great sentences ever written on this podcast.
All right.

1675
01:43:13.011 --> 01:43:17.930
I'm a 2128 year old guy who's hair is thinning.
Oh,
geesh.

1676
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.870
Um,

1677
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:22.910
I always told myself that I wouldn't be one of those guys who was obsessed over

1678
01:43:22.911 --> 01:43:27.080
this and I just shave it off when it comes to it.
Um,

1679
01:43:27.170 --> 01:43:31.790
but in recent years I've gotten lots of compliments on my hair and I don't

1680
01:43:32.210 --> 01:43:37.210
really ever hear any compliments about anything else regarding my appearance or

1681
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:39.110
my amazing personality.

1682
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:44.990
I kind of hate to be just another dude with a shaved head walking around getting

1683
01:43:44.991 --> 01:43:49.070
fatter.
Uh,
I'm considering taking medication for hair growth.

1684
01:43:49.071 --> 01:43:51.050
But the side effects include everything.

1685
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:56.290
Impotence to making the early stages of prostate cancer to masking the early

1686
01:43:56.991 --> 01:44:00.650
stages of prostate cancer.
Should it develop?
What would you do?

1687
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.880
Do you risk impotence and potential cancer in order to keep the only thing about

1688
01:44:04.881 --> 01:44:08.330
yourself that receives compliments from others?
Um,

1689
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.940
I've noticed you've shaved your head in the past,
but well,

1690
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:15.350
I don't want to look like that.
Nah,
I'm just fucking with you.

1691
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:19.910
Uh,
hey,
maybe I should just work out and get ripped then it wouldn't matter.

1692
01:44:19.911 --> 01:44:24.290
Right.
Well,
the thing about going to the gym is fuck that thoughts.

1693
01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:28.700
All right.
Well,
coming from another balding fucking mail,
um,

1694
01:44:28.701 --> 01:44:31.590
I said the exact same things you said.
I wear my s hey,
you know,

1695
01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:34.810
when I used to watch those commercials and then watching these people dumping

1696
01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:37.340
shit on their head,
they'd be like,
Dude,
you shave your fucking head.

1697
01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.840
People make funny for a week.

1698
01:44:39.110 --> 01:44:42.230
And then they used to it and then they eventually see pictures with you with

1699
01:44:42.231 --> 01:44:45.350
hair and they go,
dude,
you look weird with hair.
I like it better without it.

1700
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:50.480
And then I started losing my hair and I freaked the fuck out.

1701
01:44:50.481 --> 01:44:54.890
I couldn't fucking believe it.
Um,
you know,
I was like,

1702
01:44:54.891 --> 01:44:59.450
I was like that guy in the full 48 hours.
Gans when he finally gets shot,

1703
01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.470
I got shot.
I can't believe I got hit.

1704
01:45:03.490 --> 01:45:06.500
I remember that I was that guy.
Um,

1705
01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:11.450
so I went out and I got the Rogaine in that shit.

1706
01:45:11.451 --> 01:45:14.810
I dumped that shit on my head and I felt my heart rate increase.

1707
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:18.650
It has different effects on other people.
I know another guy took it.
He said,

1708
01:45:18.651 --> 01:45:23.090
dude,
I was taking a piss and chunks of something was in my urine.

1709
01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:28.170
So,
um,
I dunno,

1710
01:45:28.190 --> 01:45:30.050
I couldn't do it.
I did,

1711
01:45:30.051 --> 01:45:33.110
I think I did it full a couple of months and one point he just saw myself in the

1712
01:45:33.111 --> 01:45:35.810
mirror dumping that shit on my head.
I was like,
what the fuck am I doing?

1713
01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:40.010
Fuck this.
You know,
I can't do this shit.
So I said,
fuck it.

1714
01:45:40.011 --> 01:45:42.950
And I stopped using it and uh,

1715
01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:48.170
and then I just shaved my head and I said,
fuck it.
And,
uh,
and I got to admit,

1716
01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:50.180
I haven't,
a shaved head is fucking awesome.

1717
01:45:50.630 --> 01:45:54.500
But what ended up happening was I booked that movie date night.
They go,

1718
01:45:54.501 --> 01:45:57.620
we want you to grow your hair out a little bit.
So I grew it out.

1719
01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:03.920
Um,
and then I started booking other shit.
By the way,
what I booked,
I,

1720
01:46:04.090 --> 01:46:04.740
I've been joking around,

1721
01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:07.070
I got to set the record straight here cause people are really starting to

1722
01:46:07.071 --> 01:46:11.330
believe that I'm on glee.
Yeah.
I got to tell them because they're like,

1723
01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:14.930
people are like twittering,
then I'm on glee and they're gonna miss the show.

1724
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:17.000
I'm actually,
I'm not on glee.
I actually,

1725
01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:22.040
I booked a of two episodes of my favorite show on fucking TV,

1726
01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:26.120
uh,
breaking bad.
And,
uh,

1727
01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:29.210
the only reason why I said that was because they're super top secret about their

1728
01:46:29.211 --> 01:46:31.640
scripts.
They don't want anybody to know anything.

1729
01:46:31.670 --> 01:46:36.140
And I wasn't even sure if it was okay to say you even booked a roll on it.

1730
01:46:36.170 --> 01:46:38.540
I didn't know.
I didn't know if they were that top secret about it.

1731
01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:43.010
So I just started joking around saying I was on glee.
And,
um,

1732
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:45.650
then I did the show a couple of times and ask them.
They're like,
no,
no,
no,

1733
01:46:45.651 --> 01:46:49.140
it's fine.
But I was so far down the road with that lie.
So I just kept saying,

1734
01:46:49.141 --> 01:46:51.810
so I am not on glee and shame on you.

1735
01:46:51.811 --> 01:46:54.990
People actually believed that I was flying to New Mexico to do an episode of

1736
01:46:54.991 --> 01:46:58.290
Glee and that we were doing the peewee Herman Mexican hat

1737
01:46:58.330 --> 01:47:02.980
<v 10>dance.
Really?
Really?
You really fell for that one.
Um,</v>

1738
01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:08.740
but anyways,
yeah.
So,
uh,
so I grew my hair back out and,
and um,

1739
01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:12.690
<v 8>but I'm still not using anything and I'm starting to get the friar tuck thing in</v>

1740
01:47:12.691 --> 01:47:16.860
the back of my head.
And,
um,
but you know,
once you shave your head,

1741
01:47:16.861 --> 01:47:21.830
you don't give a shit about going bald.
You just kind of keep it short.
And,
uh,

1742
01:47:21.850 --> 01:47:26.700
I,
I,
if I was you fucking gay,
dude,

1743
01:47:26.730 --> 01:47:31.110
I,
you gotta do it.
Shave your head because you're trying to attract other guys.

1744
01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:36.860
And guys were superficial assholes and we were 100% about looks.

1745
01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:41.070
I think if you shave your head that says a lot about you,
you got confidence,

1746
01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:45.750
you're not trying to hide anything.
And you deal with,
uh,
you deal with,

1747
01:47:45.930 --> 01:47:46.830
with the shit in your life.

1748
01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:50.070
You don't try to hide it and stick some magic goop on top of your head.

1749
01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:55.000
<v 10>Not to mention,
I think they're going to cure it one day.
You know,</v>

1750
01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:59.010
when,
when I'm in my eighties and urine,
like your seventies Isam,
shit,

1751
01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:03.250
they're going to cure.
It
will just pop a pill,

1752
01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:07.360
you know,
don't have a full head of jet black fucking hair,
you know,

1753
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:11.740
and we won't have the fucking ass cancer,
right?
So that's what I would say,

1754
01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:16.270
Shavia head,
right?
And Go to the gym and get shredded.
All right.

1755
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:18.130
And as far as your attitude towards the gym,

1756
01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:22.470
if you don't want to go to the gym and you just going to become a fat fuck,
ah,

1757
01:48:22.630 --> 01:48:23.470
it's not going to matter.

1758
01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:27.100
I don't even think you're going to live long enough to even go bald.
All right?

1759
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:31.360
So go to the,
shave your head,
go to the fucking gym.
I'm telling you,

1760
01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:34.880
having a shaved head is the shit and uh,
I,

1761
01:48:35.290 --> 01:48:36.880
I really want to fucking do it again

1762
01:48:38.590 --> 01:48:40.390
and I will in the future at some point.

1763
01:48:40.391 --> 01:48:44.680
I'm just going to be when I have to nature's gradually doing it for me.

1764
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:49.540
<v 8>So Dude,
you should try it.
You never had a shape that it's</v>

1765
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:52.490
<v 10>fucking awesome.
It's awesome.
You just wake up,
you're ready to go.</v>

1766
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.350
You fucking ready to go.
And A and who gives a fuck?
Right?

1767
01:48:58.190 --> 01:48:58.820
Think about it.

1768
01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:01.850
Don't you think if you are going to be Brad Pitt and would've happened by now,

1769
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:03.750
<v 8>what are you really worried about?</v>

1770
01:49:03.751 --> 01:49:07.140
Are you worried that your ranking on the world,

1771
01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.880
people magazine's 50 most beautiful people is now in jeopardy that you're not

1772
01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:16.530
going to make it?
Have you ever made it before?
You know,
actually,

1773
01:49:16.531 --> 01:49:17.520
I shouldn't make these jokes that you,

1774
01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.070
cause you kind of seem like you have low self esteem.
All right?

1775
01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.450
You know what your problem is,
dude,

1776
01:49:21.690 --> 01:49:26.690
I think that you're a little shy and you sitting around eating cupcakes and a

1777
01:49:26.971 --> 01:49:30.900
feather in your fucking hair.
All right?
You need to start eating more protein.

1778
01:49:30.901 --> 01:49:34.260
And some vegetables,
go to the fucking gym and shaved your head.
Bam.

1779
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:39.390
Gavel hits a fucking next case.
Next case.
That's it.
It's over.
All right.

1780
01:49:39.391 --> 01:49:42.510
Moving on.
Oh,
I asked people last week about a coaching,

1781
01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:48.280
talking about crazy,
uh,
stories with coaches,
that type of thing.
And,

1782
01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:52.840
uh,
I had a crazy coach and I can't even fucking tell you this shit this guy did

1783
01:49:52.841 --> 01:49:56.290
just because,
uh,
people I know from my childhood listened to this thing,

1784
01:49:56.291 --> 01:50:00.880
so I really have to fucking watch it sometimes.
So,
um,
all right,

1785
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:04.360
here's some,
here's one.
I don't know.
I don't know what I did with the email.

1786
01:50:04.361 --> 01:50:07.660
I'm going to paraphrase.
I just remember this guy said he,
uh,

1787
01:50:07.661 --> 01:50:12.550
he was playing on a baseball team.
He was like in the fifth grade I think.
And um,

1788
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:18.070
he was the kid who played right field,
he wasn't good or whatever.
So they're,

1789
01:50:18.071 --> 01:50:20.680
they're playing the game that's before the game,

1790
01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:22.570
that's before the game for the championship.

1791
01:50:22.571 --> 01:50:27.571
So I guess they're in the fucking semis and there's a guy on second and let down

1792
01:50:28.241 --> 01:50:32.680
by a run and they getting down to the final inning and he's coming up to bat and

1793
01:50:32.681 --> 01:50:35.950
he sucks.
So He's already nervous.
And he said his coach went up,

1794
01:50:35.951 --> 01:50:39.760
grabbed him by the arm and looked him in the face and said,
hey,

1795
01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:43.300
if you don't get a hit,
I'm going to punch you right in the face.

1796
01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:47.830
And he said at first he laughed because he thought the coach was joking,

1797
01:50:47.831 --> 01:50:49.090
trying to break the tension.

1798
01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:53.800
And then he realized that the dude was serious and he just sort of walked up to

1799
01:50:53.801 --> 01:50:55.120
the plate and he was standing up,

1800
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:59.230
they're shitting his pants and he looked back at his coach and his coach is

1801
01:50:59.231 --> 01:51:00.400
staring right at him.
I'm like,

1802
01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:03.880
I'm going to punch you in the fucking face if you don't get a fucking hit.

1803
01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:10.110
So this kid throws the bad out there and he somehow slaps a fucking Derek Jeters

1804
01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:13.600
opposite field,
single drives in the run.

1805
01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:17.440
Instead at the end of the inning,
he went back to the bench.
He said,

1806
01:51:17.441 --> 01:51:20.920
the coach never said anything to him,
never address it again.

1807
01:51:21.070 --> 01:51:25.930
And he says he's hated that son of a bitch from uh,
to this day.
So he said,

1808
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:28.780
his question was,
what is this guy?
Is he a,

1809
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:34.660
is he a good motivator or z or horrific human being?
I mean,
this is the thing.

1810
01:51:34.661 --> 01:51:39.550
It's because you got a hit.
I think,
um,

1811
01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:45.730
that's a weird one that,
that one is that guy is both right and wrong.

1812
01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:48.910
He's wrong for taking the game so seriously.

1813
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:54.330
And I'm injecting that sort of reality into your childhood,

1814
01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:58.690
which I think kids should get a dose of reality in their childhood,

1815
01:51:58.691 --> 01:52:00.610
but I think it should come from the parents,

1816
01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:05.620
or at least the parents should be supporting another adult.

1817
01:52:05.621 --> 01:52:08.050
Like say you fuck up in school when your parents go there.

1818
01:52:08.110 --> 01:52:11.050
Old School parents would go to school and whatever the teacher said you were

1819
01:52:11.051 --> 01:52:15.100
doing,
the parent would then look at,
look at the kid and be like,
yeah,

1820
01:52:15.101 --> 01:52:19.360
why the fuck are you doing that?
Um,
but something like this,
I dunno,

1821
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:24.700
he did motivate you.
He did let you know what the real world is like.

1822
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:28.900
He basically gave you an a nutshell.
Yeah.
In life.

1823
01:52:30.190 --> 01:52:34.090
You know,
when,
when,
when society needs you to produce,
if you don't produce,

1824
01:52:34.330 --> 01:52:38.320
it kicks you in the balls and you,
you,
you don't get the position.
You don't get,

1825
01:52:38.321 --> 01:52:41.260
you don't get a fucking race or whatever the fuck it is.

1826
01:52:41.261 --> 01:52:43.720
I'm trying to say I got damn and I can't talk this fucking week.

1827
01:52:43.721 --> 01:52:46.130
You know what I'm saying?
Here's another story from

1828
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:50.540
<v 10>coaching a bill loved the podcast,
but,
but,
uh,
I am co I'm a coach.</v>

1829
01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:51.441
Uh,

1830
01:52:51.441 --> 01:52:56.441
I coach a team ages nine to 10 and I'm the assistant for Aau travel team.

1831
01:52:58.490 --> 01:53:00.360
Is that ninth to 10th grade that traveling?

1832
01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:04.580
There's gotta be that the travel teams coach or my son around my nine 10 team,

1833
01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:11.730
that's gotta be nine to 10 years old and they travel at a Vietnamese.

1834
01:53:12.150 --> 01:53:13.740
I didn't know they let American kids do that.

1835
01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:18.720
Both are very good players and are two of the four best players on my team.

1836
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:22.830
I have three slots for the all star team.
Oh,

1837
01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:27.240
Jesus.
Oh God.
So you're the coach,

1838
01:53:29.010 --> 01:53:34.010
you got two kids on your team and there are two out of the four best players on

1839
01:53:34.391 --> 01:53:37.390
my team,
I have three slots for the all star team.
All right,

1840
01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:43.320
so two slots are taken and now it's down to my son and the travels coach's son.

1841
01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:46.530
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:53:46.530 --> 01:53:49.080
<v 10>Well why did you give away those first two slots</v>

1843
01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:54.850
with I guess if those kids were better than than your son and your buddy's kid.

1844
01:53:57.250 --> 01:54:01.980
Um,
okay.
So his son is hitting 600 place,
third,

1845
01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:03.900
third base,
shortstop,

1846
01:54:03.901 --> 01:54:07.800
and second and his pitch five good innings in six games.

1847
01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:13.390
He is only field it about six balls,
but that's not his fault.
Um,

1848
01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:17.480
my son is hitting six 12.
Hey,
you know what?

1849
01:54:17.481 --> 01:54:21.060
The podcast listeners,
I want you guys to vote for this.
Like this is the MLB.

1850
01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:25.500
All right?
So the first guy's kids hitting 600 he's play third,
short and second.

1851
01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:28.860
He's pitched five good endings in six games and he's field and only about six

1852
01:54:28.861 --> 01:54:32.910
balls.
But that's not his fault cause he can't control who hits it to him.
I'm,

1853
01:54:32.911 --> 01:54:36.180
his son is hitting six 12 has caught every,

1854
01:54:36.770 --> 01:54:39.840
is caught every inning except the three innings he pitched.

1855
01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:42.780
He's thrown out eight people in six games.

1856
01:54:43.170 --> 01:54:47.760
And in four of the five games we won,
the other team's catchers sucked.

1857
01:54:47.970 --> 01:54:52.740
And we just stole our way around the bases.
Even without pass balls.

1858
01:54:54.450 --> 01:54:59.340
Uh,
we have not,
we have not had an a player thrown out stealing.

1859
01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.980
Well,
this has to do with the rest of your team.
The game.

1860
01:55:01.981 --> 01:55:05.280
We lost their pitchers shut us down in short,
in the six games,

1861
01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:09.910
he is hands down the best patch catcher.
I've seen the travel coach.

1862
01:55:09.911 --> 01:55:12.600
His son has a little higher level fielding,

1863
01:55:12.601 --> 01:55:16.500
but I feel my son had a bigger impact on our team.
Uh,

1864
01:55:16.530 --> 01:55:20.370
batting is a push.
Oh,
because he's 686 two.
Oh,

1865
01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:25.200
who do I pick for the all star team?
Ah,
fuck.
All right dude,

1866
01:55:25.201 --> 01:55:28.890
if you weren't related to your kid,
you gotta,
you gotta uh,

1867
01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.600
you got to pick your kid.
He's,
um,

1868
01:55:34.630 --> 01:55:38.140
he's batting 12 points higher and he's gunning down the other team's runners,

1869
01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:42.120
you know,
so after the pitcher fucks up,

1870
01:55:42.121 --> 01:55:46.890
he's correcting pitchers fuck up while not fucking up himself and hitting six,

1871
01:55:46.891 --> 01:55:50.580
12.
But it's your son,

1872
01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:57.570
God,
Jesus.
Well,
I mean,
you can give it to your son.

1873
01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:02.160
I think he's worthy of it,
but you know,
you're going to jeopardize the,
uh,

1874
01:56:02.161 --> 01:56:04.350
your friendship with the other person if you're fine with that,

1875
01:56:04.351 --> 01:56:06.990
I give it to your kid.
Um,
but you know,

1876
01:56:07.050 --> 01:56:10.770
if you want to teach your kid a little bit of something about being humble and

1877
01:56:10.771 --> 01:56:15.210
about handling a position of power properly,
I'd give it to the friend.

1878
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:19.080
I think that that's what I do.
But I would sit down and I would,

1879
01:56:19.081 --> 01:56:24.081
I would have a talk with your son and try to explain that the position of power

1880
01:56:24.691 --> 01:56:28.810
that you're in and how it would look.
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

1881
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:30.660
This sounds like a Mcdonald's commercial,
doesn't it?

1882
01:56:30.661 --> 01:56:34.230
Back in the day when they'd sing some sad song and the kid wouldn't get it at

1883
01:56:34.231 --> 01:56:39.060
first,
then you buy and some French fries in a fucking vanilla shake.
You know,

1884
01:56:39.061 --> 01:56:43.320
it's times like these,
I'm glad I'm not a parent dude.
Wow.
That's a,
that's a,
uh,

1885
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:46.950
that's a tough one.
That is a tough one.
All right,

1886
01:56:46.951 --> 01:56:49.890
well I've got time for one last one here.
Um,
hey bill.

1887
01:56:49.891 --> 01:56:54.030
I'm a 27 year old graphic web designer and I've been unemployed for a few months

1888
01:56:54.031 --> 01:56:54.450
now.

1889
01:56:54.450 --> 01:56:58.500
The job I had a few months back was a web development job at a company I thought

1890
01:56:58.501 --> 01:57:01.490
was awesome before I worked there,
but turned out to be real,

1891
01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:06.250
a really shady place that had a really bad history,
uh,
of having um,

1892
01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:09.510
high turnover with their employees.
In any case,

1893
01:57:09.511 --> 01:57:13.380
I've been living back with my parents now for two years because I lost the job

1894
01:57:13.381 --> 01:57:14.880
back then and it just,

1895
01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:18.330
enough money saved up to live out the 13 month lease that I had signed on my

1896
01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:23.130
previous apartment.
Ever since I've been struggling to find work.
Like,

1897
01:57:23.131 --> 01:57:25.050
I'm sure a lot of people are,
however,

1898
01:57:25.170 --> 01:57:30.170
almost all of my friends have jobs or been able to find jobs fairly easy easily

1899
01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:31.200
when they didn't have one.

1900
01:57:31.230 --> 01:57:33.570
I attribute this mainly to the fact that they are most,

1901
01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.880
that they mostly have jobs,
not careers.

1902
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:39.000
Like I've been trying to build over the last half a decade or so,

1903
01:57:39.330 --> 01:57:41.220
but with it being so hard to find a job,

1904
01:57:41.221 --> 01:57:43.290
I'm wondering if I should take up a new career.

1905
01:57:43.470 --> 01:57:47.460
I love graphic and web design and uh,
and I'm damn good at it too.

1906
01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:48.781
Uh,

1907
01:57:48.781 --> 01:57:53.010
I've even been looking for jobs out in California area because Florida sucks and

1908
01:57:53.011 --> 01:57:56.400
I'm not a fan of a hundred degree weather with tons of humidity,
but it's,

1909
01:57:56.770 --> 01:58:00.330
it's been more difficult to find work out there because most places won't even

1910
01:58:00.331 --> 01:58:02.160
consider me since I'm not living out the yet,

1911
01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:06.420
I have no money to just up and move without any concrete employer employment on

1912
01:58:06.421 --> 01:58:10.680
the line.
What should I do?
All right.
Yeah,
Dude,

1913
01:58:10.681 --> 01:58:12.240
you're getting your stories right now.

1914
01:58:12.330 --> 01:58:16.290
Every successful man has his stories about sleeping on a Futon,

1915
01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:19.260
eating fucking Eggo waffles.
Those are the years you're in.

1916
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:22.440
So what I would do is I would get a job,

1917
01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:27.120
get a fucking job.
Anything you got to do,
get a fucking job,

1918
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:31.770
get some money coming in and then save up your money.
Okay.
During the day,

1919
01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:33.960
that's your day job.
Just like I had,

1920
01:58:33.961 --> 01:58:37.860
I had a day job working in a warehouse and the nights I did comedy for free.

1921
01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:42.250
At night,
you come home,
you do your graphic designing for free.
Okay.

1922
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:44.140
<v 8>Get a job where you meet other people.</v>

1923
01:58:44.170 --> 01:58:46.570
Maybe the company needs some sort of graphic designing.

1924
01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:49.540
You can offer up your services,
you know,

1925
01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:53.050
and then you can add that to your resume and then there's other people maybe

1926
01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:57.820
have side businesses.
I'd get a business card.
I put that up all around town,

1927
01:58:57.850 --> 01:59:01.030
cheap graphic designing.
Just happy to be here.

1928
01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:04.030
Graphic and web designing.
That's what I would do.

1929
01:59:04.031 --> 01:59:08.380
I'd get that business going and while I kept working my day job and eventually

1930
01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:12.490
you will have enough fucking money or your,
your graphic design,

1931
01:59:12.610 --> 01:59:15.610
we'll be making enough fucking money where you can either move out to California

1932
01:59:15.850 --> 01:59:19.120
or fuck California,
run your own God damn business.
All right.

1933
01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:21.220
I'd say what's your problem is

1934
01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:26.910
<v 10>here's your be in too damn picky.
All right,
you got to do whatever you gotta do.</v>

1935
01:59:26.911 --> 01:59:28.760
Fake it till you make it right now.
And uh,

1936
01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:32.220
I'm basing that on the fact that you've stuck with looking for a career rather

1937
01:59:32.221 --> 01:59:35.370
than a job.
That's a good thing.
Sometimes I can shoot you in the foot.

1938
01:59:35.610 --> 01:59:38.400
And also how you want to leave Florida because you don't like the weather.

1939
01:59:38.670 --> 01:59:43.050
All right?
Right now is not the time to be a diva.
Deal with the fucking humidity.

1940
01:59:43.290 --> 01:59:46.080
Bust your fucking ass.
All right?

1941
01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:49.800
Don't get into a relationship with some woman.
You don't need it right now.

1942
01:59:49.890 --> 01:59:54.420
What you need to do is to rub one out in the morning.
Go to that fucking job.

1943
01:59:54.810 --> 01:59:59.630
No.
And as you're at the job,
try to network with people.
If you're fucking you,

1944
02:00:00.010 --> 02:00:03.360
I'm just gonna say everything that I just said.
Just do all that shit.

1945
02:00:04.290 --> 02:00:07.140
Bust your fucking ass and you'll get there and you have all these great stories.

1946
02:00:07.710 --> 02:00:08.490
All right?

1947
02:00:08.490 --> 02:00:11.250
Then you get a good look and broad at the end of it because God knows they like

1948
02:00:11.251 --> 02:00:11.990
money.

1949
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:16.700
<v 8>All right.
That's the,
that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody.</v>

1950
02:00:16.701 --> 02:00:19.310
I hope you enjoyed it.
Uh,
I've got another couple of days up here.

1951
02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:21.740
I'm gonna enjoy my fucking vacation,

1952
02:00:21.741 --> 02:00:25.040
going to go jet ski and I'm going to have some stories about that.
And,
uh,

1953
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.410
I'm gonna bring my bear mace on another hike today.

1954
02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.740
Hope you guys all have a good week and a,
let's go,
Bro.
It's,

1955
02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:34.310
I'm looking for them to turn it around.
No disrespect to the Vancouver Canucks.

1956
02:00:34.311 --> 02:00:35.600
I got a beast of a fucking team.

1957
02:00:35.601 --> 02:00:37.400
I just don't think there's anybody tough on your team,

1958
02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:41.120
which is a evident when you're going around biting people's fingers,

1959
02:00:41.121 --> 02:00:44.810
like fucking a goddamn toddler who just got his fucking toy taken away from him.

1960
02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:47.630
All right,
that's a podcast for this week.
I'll talk to you later.

1961
02:00:47.631 --> 02:00:48.620
Go Fuck Yourself.

1962
02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:54.473
<v 5>Awesome.</v>

1963
02:01:42.590 --> 02:01:42.590
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
