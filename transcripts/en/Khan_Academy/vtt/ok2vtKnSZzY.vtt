00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:01.772
- [Voiceover] Hello, everyone, Grant here.

00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:03.261
So I'd like to talk to you today

00:00:03.261 --> 00:00:06.159
about the various functions of money.

00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:08.369
Functions of money.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:09.792
Now money, of course, is something

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:11.243
that we all use every day

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.302
and we kind of have a
general feel for what it is,

00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:14.432
but it's interesting to step back

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:16.592
and actually contemplate what is money.

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:17.862
What gives it its value?

00:00:17.862 --> 00:00:19.261
What is it that we use it for?

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.091
Why is it that you can
use some things for money

00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:22.740
throughout history, you
know, people have used

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.573
not just gold and silver

00:00:23.573 --> 00:00:26.458
but things like salt
or cigarettes as money,

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:28.518
and why other things can't be used.

00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:31.963
And economists generally
divide the functions of money,

00:00:31.963 --> 00:00:33.493
the things that it does for us

00:00:33.493 --> 00:00:35.393
into three different categories.

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:38.232
And sometimes people
add a fourth in there.

00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:39.482
I won't get to that in this video,

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:41.042
I'll talk about it in a different one,

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.372
but there's kind of three main ones

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:43.872
that people usually talk about.

00:00:43.872 --> 00:00:44.942
So if you were an economist,

00:00:44.942 --> 00:00:46.331
just kind of philosophizing

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:48.000
about what the functions of money are,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.290
you might start by thinking,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.252
well, what does the world
look like without money?

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:52.922
Like, for example, let's say that you

00:00:52.922 --> 00:00:56.992
were a lawyer and you provide
legal counsel to people

00:00:56.992 --> 00:00:59.222
and this is the service that you provide

00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:01.582
and this is the way you
add value to the economy,

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:04.240
and let's say it's the case
that you're refurnishing

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.579
and you want a chair, you
want to go out into the world

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.209
and you want to buy a chair.

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.182
Well, what that would require
is that you find someone

00:01:11.182 --> 00:01:13.233
who happens to produce chairs.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:14.962
You find some person out there,

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:17.242
and his way of adding value to society

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:19.301
is to produce chairs,
and this is what he does,

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:21.860
and he's specialized at
it and he's very good.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.828
Now the issue here, because
money doesn't exist,

00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:26.710
you basically have to trade with him,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.552
you have to barter in some way.

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:30.703
And this is what's
called a barter economy.

00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:31.612
And in order to do that,

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:33.452
given that you've specialized in law,

00:01:33.452 --> 00:01:35.952
is the thing that you
provide and add value with,

00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:39.522
you kind of have to hope
that he wants legal services.

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:41.312
If he happens to be in a situation

00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:43.291
where he wants the thing that you provide,

00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.220
which in this case is legal services,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.382
and if that were true and
you had that good fortune,

00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:49.632
then you would be able to trade

00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:51.322
some legal services over to him

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:53.232
and he would trade you
some number of chairs,

00:01:53.232 --> 00:01:54.672
and all would be well.

00:01:54.672 --> 00:01:56.882
But of course, this is kind of rare,

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:58.852
especially given how specialized you are.

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:00.592
And this idea where you want something

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:02.651
and he wants something and
those line up with each other

00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:04.210
actually has a name.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.810
This is called the double
coincidence of wants.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.622
Double coincidence, and
it's worth writing down

00:02:10.622 --> 00:02:12.402
because people kind of reference this

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:16.682
when we're talking about
barter economies of wants.

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:18.592
And by barter economy I just mean

00:02:18.592 --> 00:02:20.251
you know, this kind of set-up,

00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:22.350
but scaled up to the scale of society

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.669
where everybody's trading
based on their specialty

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.498
and what someone else needs.

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:29.831
And in a world of money this seems absurd,

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.432
because in reality what you do,

00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:32.873
is you would be over here,

00:02:32.873 --> 00:02:35.032
and sure you would provide
your legal services,

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:37.602
you'd kind of provide
legal services to someone

00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:39.532
as your way of adding value,

00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:41.592
but it would be for just
anyone who wants it,

00:02:41.592 --> 00:02:43.552
not based on what they produce,

00:02:43.552 --> 00:02:45.792
and in response, in exchange for that,

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:48.942
they give you cash, they
just give you money,

00:02:48.942 --> 00:02:50.381
something that you can then use,

00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:53.271
that everybody accepts for
whatever it is that you want.

00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:56.252
So in this case, if you want chairs,

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:58.332
then you bring it over to
the guy who produces chairs

00:02:58.332 --> 00:03:02.952
and that's what he gives
you, you know, a chair.

00:03:02.952 --> 00:03:05.961
And in so far as money
serves this function,

00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:08.600
where it is kind of the
universal thing to trade,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.767
it's called a medium of
exchange, medium of exchange.

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:20.453
And what that means is anytime
that you want to exchange

00:03:20.453 --> 00:03:23.043
for something, this is
the common thing of value

00:03:23.043 --> 00:03:26.112
that you use to actually
trade with the world.

00:03:26.112 --> 00:03:27.572
But that's not the only thing money does.

00:03:27.572 --> 00:03:28.572
That's a really big part,

00:03:28.572 --> 00:03:30.541
that kind of allows the
entire economy to exist,

00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:31.760
and it allows you to specialize

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.602
in something like legal services.

00:03:33.602 --> 00:03:34.634
But what else does money do?

00:03:34.634 --> 00:03:37.832
What else would be harder to
do in a world without money?

00:03:37.832 --> 00:03:40.082
Let's say you produce, as a lawyer,

00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:41.672
you know, producing legal services,

00:03:41.672 --> 00:03:43.572
a little bit more that you
actually wanted to consume,

00:03:43.572 --> 00:03:46.152
and you're hoping to kind
of save up some value,

00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:48.192
so that maybe later on
you can buy a house,

00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:50.511
or you can pay for your kid's education

00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:51.740
or something like that.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.232
You want to actually start
storing value and saving it up.

00:03:54.232 --> 00:03:55.943
Well, in this barter economy,

00:03:55.943 --> 00:03:57.273
you would have to find something,

00:03:57.273 --> 00:03:58.683
since money doesn't exist,

00:03:58.683 --> 00:04:00.422
you would have to find something of value

00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:01.592
and start storing that.

00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:03.422
Maybe, you know, chairs
might hold their value

00:04:03.422 --> 00:04:04.611
so you're hoping to store them

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.611
or maybe you have to buy land or something

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.001
that you think will store it,

00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:10.090
but there's not kind of
a good de facto medium

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.638
that you can do it for.

00:04:11.638 --> 00:04:13.461
So in this sense, since that's something

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:14.942
that we usually do with money,

00:04:14.942 --> 00:04:18.133
it's also called a good store of value.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.002
So this is considered kind
of a second use of money,

00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:24.762
store of value, distinct
from a medium of exchange,

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:26.502
because the idea of needing
something to trade with

00:04:26.502 --> 00:04:30.172
is pretty different from
wanting to kind of save value.

00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:31.711
And for this third function,

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:33.630
think back to this case
where you're hoping to barter

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.842
legal services for chairs.

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:38.193
I mean, once you start
getting into the specifics,

00:04:38.193 --> 00:04:39.563
you can start asking the question,

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:43.272
well, actually, how many
hours of legal services

00:04:43.272 --> 00:04:45.542
correspond to one chair?

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:47.031
And if you want to buy
something different,

00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:48.700
you're going grocery shopping,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.069
how many hours of legal services

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.002
corresponds to buying one apple?

00:04:52.002 --> 00:04:53.442
And similarly the chair guy,

00:04:53.442 --> 00:04:55.663
he has to go off and every
time he's gonna buy an apple,

00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:57.832
he has to think how many
chairs correspond to an apple?

00:04:57.832 --> 00:04:59.612
And trying to relate values like this

00:04:59.612 --> 00:05:01.152
starts getting really complicated

00:05:01.152 --> 00:05:03.912
unless you just have some kind
of actual unit to deal with,

00:05:03.912 --> 00:05:06.301
something that you can use
to actually measure value

00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:08.470
of everything, like a yardstick for value.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.108
And of course in the real economy,

00:05:10.108 --> 00:05:13.252
we just give everything a
dollar value, or a euro value,

00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:15.273
or a peso value, depending
on where you are,

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.683
but you give it a value that
corresponds to the currency,

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:19.402
to the money that you're dealing with.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:23.072
So people will say money
serves as a unit of value,

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:26.252
a unit of value, and basically that means

00:05:26.252 --> 00:05:28.662
that it gives you the starting number,

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:30.360
it gives you the meaning of the number one

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.312
so that you can say, well
if this is worth one dollar,

00:05:32.312 --> 00:05:33.612
then what is worth three dollars?

00:05:33.612 --> 00:05:35.162
Or maybe an hour of this lawyer's time

00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:36.352
is worth a hundred dollars,

00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:38.212
and one of these chairs is worth $50,

00:05:38.212 --> 00:05:40.602
and you can start actually
comparing the values

00:05:40.602 --> 00:05:42.602
of various different goods that way.

00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:44.732
And I actually think this
is a pretty interesting one.

00:05:44.732 --> 00:05:45.572
This is the kind of thing

00:05:45.572 --> 00:05:47.272
that would be easy to underappreciate

00:05:47.272 --> 00:05:49.122
until you realize how important it is

00:05:49.122 --> 00:05:50.542
to have something like this.

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:51.862
And in the next video or two

00:05:51.862 --> 00:05:53.711
I'm going to talk about
a certain historical case

00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:56.742
of hyperinflation in Brazil
where basically what happens

00:05:56.742 --> 00:05:59.323
is money loses some of these functions,

00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:02.072
and you can see just how much
a society actually breaks down

00:06:02.072 --> 00:06:03.842
if what is supposed to be money

00:06:03.842 --> 00:06:05.952
stops serving these functions.

00:06:05.952 --> 00:06:09.285
So with that, I will see you next video.
