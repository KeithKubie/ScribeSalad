00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.600
Researchers at Vanderbilt University developed
an app that analyzes shockwaves from bullets

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.849
to determine the location of snipers.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.269
And a belgian designer has created smart, polymer
furniture that's self-assembling, and grows

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.299
like popcorn.

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.530
Vsauce! Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.160
SOINN is an artificial brain that can now
use the internet to learn new things. Developed

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.390
at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, the
machine learning algorithm can learn about

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.500
objects using image searches. It also has
the ability to take aspects of other objects

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.010
and combine them to make guesses about things
that it doesn't recognize. By storing characteristics

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.310
of objects like pens and knives being stick-shaped
, it can then further differentiate them and

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.210
determine, for instance, what a box cutter
is. And it can pick out features from audio

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.210
and video data, and its in development for
autonomous mental development robots.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.939
Intel and Carnegie Mellon University are creating
headlights that make raindrops disappear.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.740
Each headlight is actually a projector instead
of a lamp - and it has a camera which picks

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.439
up the raindrops - and then a processor predicts
their path, darkens those pixels - making

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.009
the raindrops invisible. But unfortunately
they say this technology probably won't be

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.579
commercially available for a decade.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.759
Triangle Tree has created edible spoons. With
disposable plastic spoons taking more than

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.829
20 years to decompose, this eco-friendly alternative
is made from all-organic ingredients and comes

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:40.109
in three flavors. It also has weakened lines
on the back so its easer it break off and

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.679
eat.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.279
Ultimate Bloody Mary!

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:48.469
Wool&amp;Prince are making wool button down shirts
that last six times longer than cotton, are

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.819
naturally anti-wrinkly and odor-fighting.
Founder Mac Bishop demonstrated the longevity

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.520
of the fine grade wool fabric by wearing the
same shirt for a hundred days straight without

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.679
washing it. For more information find the

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.679
This bright green robot mecha suit was built
by Japanese robotics company Sakakibara Kikai.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.610
It's called the Kid's Walker Cyclops and comes
equipped with one arm for grabbing and the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.379
other has a drill. It's about 6'9" tall and
3'6" wide and weighs 750 lbs. It costs $20,500

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.250
to own but is also available to rent.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.159
This robot can tell what a human
is so it doesn't crush them. Roboticists from

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.099
Georgia Tech and San Francisco based Meka
robots built a robot arm with sensitive skin

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.519
giving it the ability to reach through cluttered
areas carefully, as well as gently touch a

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.670
human - shown here lifting a blanket for a
disabled man who claims that the arm never

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.349
pressed hard against him, and he felt safe
using it.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.530
Finally "lightspin" by Eric Pare and Timecode
Lab has dancers illuminated combining bullet

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.530
time photography, stop motion, and light painting.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:18.439
I'm gonna leave you with a laser shooting
through 100 balloons, and, as always - thanks

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.780
for watching.
