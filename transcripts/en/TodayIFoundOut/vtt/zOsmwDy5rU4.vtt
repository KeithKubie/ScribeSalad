00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.750
How Much are Olympic Gold medals Worth?

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.270
As far as the value of the raw materials in
them, this varies from Olympiad to Olympiad.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.460
For the recent 2012 Olympics in London, the
medals were the largest of any in Summer Olympic

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.220
history up to that point, weighing in at 400g
for the gold medal. Of this 400g, 394g was

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:38.690
sterling silver (364.45g silver / 29.55g copper)
with 6g of 24 karat gold plating. At the price

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.260
of gold and silver when these medals were
won by various Olympians, this means a gold

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.100
medal in the London Olympics was worth about
$624, with $304 of the value coming from the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.000
gold plating and about $320 coming from the
sterling silver. Since then, the price of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.190
gold has dropped about 18% and the price of
silver has dropped about 39%.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.379
For the current 2016 Rio Olympics, the gold
medals are one-upping the London Games, weighing

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.880
in at a a half a kilogram, with about 462g
of it silver, 6g gold, and the rest copper.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.920
So by current gold and silver prices as of
July 13, 2016, these medals are worth about

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.380
$561 total, with approximately $301 of the
value from silver and $260 from gold. So,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.079
despite being 1/5 more massive than the London
Games Olympics medals, and having the same

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.420
amount of gold and much more silver, due to
the significant drop in gold and silver prices

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.869
since 2012, the Rio gold medals are worth
less at their awarding than the London Games

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.090
medals were worth when they were awarded.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.890
Of course, athletes can often get much more
than this selling the medals on the open market,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.079
particularly for momentous medals, like the
“Miracle on Ice” 1980 men’s U.S. hockey

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.659
team gold medal. Mark Wells, a member of that
team, auctioned his medal off in 2012 and

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.030
received $310,700 for it, which he needed
to help pay for medical treatment.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.310
Most auctioned medals don’t go for nearly
this much, though. For instance, Anthony Ervin’s

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.080
50 meter freestyle gold medal won in 2000,
even with all proceeds going to the victims

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.650
of the Indian Ocean tsunami, only sold for
$17,100. John Konrads’ 1500 meter freestyle

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.330
gold medal won in 1960 only sold for $11,250
in 2011. This is a great return in terms of

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.890
what the raw value of the materials are worth,
but certainly nowhere close to Mark Wells’

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.890
medal.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.520
Gold medals in the Olympics weren’t always
made mostly of silver. Before the 1912 Olympics,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.080
they were made of solid gold. However, they
tended to be much smaller than modern medals.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.130
For instance, the 1900 Paris gold medals were
only 3.2 mm thick, with a 59 mm diameter,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.480
weighing just 53g. For perspective, the London
2012 medals were 7 mm thick, with a diameter

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.980
of 85 mm and, as mentioned, weighed 400g.
The 1900 Paris gold medals at today’s value

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.260
of gold are worth about $2300. For the 1912
games in Stockholm, the last year the gold

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.332
medals were made of solid gold, the value
of the gold medals at current prices of gold

00:03:17.332 --> 00:03:19.510
would be around $870.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.420
If the current 2016 Olympic gold medals were
made out of solid gold, they’d be worth

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.600
about $21,625 each. This may seem feasible,
considering how much money the Olympics brings

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.010
in, until you consider just how many medals
are awarded during each summer Olympics. For

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.930
instance, in these 2016 Olympics, about 2,488
medals have been produced, including 812 gold

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.961
medals. At $21,625 each, that would be just
shy of $18 million dollars for the gold medal

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:53.540
materials alone.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.260
As it is, with the current gold medals having
about $561 worth of materials, then $305 for

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.650
the silver medals, and about $5 for the bronze
(which are mostly made of copper, with a very

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.420
small amount of zinc and tin), about $708,000
is still being spent on the raw materials

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:27.790
alone for these medals, not to mention the
cost of having them minted.
