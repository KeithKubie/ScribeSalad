00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.580
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, as Android adoption has
skyrocketed, people have been taking these

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.680
devices to work.
And we've heard loud and clear from the enterprise

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.560
that they need very specific features.
Well, in Froyo, we introduce over 20 new features

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.500
designed to meet the needs of enterprise.
Let me touch on two of them.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.449
Number one, we become Microsoft exchange friendly.
That means --

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.390
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yes, thank you.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.480
That means things like auto-discovery, integration
with the global address book, the security

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.660
policies that are available in Exchange can
be forced upon the device.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.510
Number two, we've added new APIs for device
management.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.829
So you can build software that does critically
important things, like remote wipe of the

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.899
device if necessary.
And there's many, many other things that we've

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.040
added that you'll see in the documentation.
Let's talk about new services available for

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.239
developers in the SDK.
Now, one of the first services I want to talk

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.640
about is the application data backup API.
Now, if you use Android and you've gone to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.610
another device, you know that Android will
automatically back up your applications.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.320
In other words, you get a new device, you
log in, and your applications come along with

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.850
that.
However, what Android has not done is backed

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.900
up the data associated with those applications.
So, for example, I have a particularly favorite

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.909
application that helps me monitor my exercise
and my weight.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.040
But when I move to a new Android device, the
application moves, but all my personal data

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.790
and history doesn't.
Starting with Froyo, we'll provide an application

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.390
data backup API that ISVs can take advantage
of and move the data along with the application.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.979
We think that's a great feature.
In addition to that, we have a brand-new API,

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.710
a cloud-to-device messaging API.
Let me be clear, this is not a push notification

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.970
API designed to compensate for the lack of
basic functionality like multitasking in the

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.450
operating system.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.590
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Okay?
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.620
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We've done something very
clever I think you're going to love.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.909
As a developer, you can send a message to
our servers which will do very smart things,

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.269
like collapse similar messages, our servers,
which will optimize for the latency of mobile

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.950
networks and make sure that that message gets
down to the device.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.659
But that's only the first step.
We've done deep integration with Android such

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.419
that when you send a message, that message
can trigger an Android intent.

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:43.900
Let me show you how powerful this is.
Let's go to a demo.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.430
Now, what Matt has on the screen here on his
laptop is Google Maps.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.430
He's -- in Google Maps -- and he's using the
Chrome browser.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.749
And he's added a Chrome extension.
The Chrome extension is in the upper right-hand

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.349
corner.
That sends it to his phone.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.999
In the map, he has directions, he has directions
from the Moscone Center to Google headquarters.

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.400
And he wants to send that to the phone.
What do you think happens?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.150
Do you think we send a text message that says,
"This is the address"?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.559
Do you think we send an e-mail?
No.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.430
We send Android intent.
In other words, when he says send to phone,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.260
the message gets sent to our server, gets
pushed down to the device.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.029
The device kicks into navigation mode automatically.
Keep your eye when he clicks on "send to phone,"

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:31.049
keep your eye on the Android device.
So send it to phone.

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.010
And on the Android device, boom, right into
navigation.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.920
How hot is that?
[ Applause ]

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.200
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That's how you do a device,
cloud-to-device API.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.010
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let me show you another example.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.349
You're reading an article on the desktop.
You think it's awesome, but you're out of

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.499
time and you need to run.
You want to keep reading that on the Android

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:00.469
phone.
Why don't you send that to the device, Matt.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:08.089
To the device.
Opens up the browser, takes you right to that

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.609
article, not ever having to press any other
keys.

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.769
Isn't that great?
[ Applause ]

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:21.139
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We can't wait to see what
you're going to go do with this API.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:28.139
All right.
Let's go back to slides.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.289
You're going to love this.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:41.810
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I mean, come on.
If you're like me, you have a plethora of

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.110
devices you carry around with you.
And that -- all those devices shouldn't mean

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.639
added complexity and yet another bill.
Right?

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.810
You should be able to, at the platform level,
enable tethering.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.650
And so now your Android device can in fact
become a portable hot spot and really serve

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.050
the needs of these other devices that you
might have with you.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.930
In fact, let's show you a demo of this working.
Matt has a Nexus One running Froyo.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.840
He'll go right into tethering and portable
hot spot.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.120
He'll enable the hot spot.
He'll give it a name.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.759
In fact, I think he's already named this as
Android AP.

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:23.229
And that hot spot will turn on.
We'll give it a second there.

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.419
There we go.
Tethering hot spot is now active.

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.199
Now he'll go to another device that doesn't
have connectivity.

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.759
How about that iPad?
[ Laughter ]

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:38.069
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And there you go.

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.120
One bill.
Isn't that beautiful?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.490
All right.
Let's go back to slides.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:55.710
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, it turns out, do you

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.139
know what the most popular thing people do
with these smartphones?

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.800
What do you think it is?
It's fairly obvious.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.789
Is they actually use the phone.
Number two thing they do is, they do text

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.699
messaging.
And the third most-used application is the

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.389
browser.
And so it's critically important for us to

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:21.080
make the Android browser rock.
And we're going to constantly improve that

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.099
browser.
And Froyo is a major step in that direction.

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.310
What have we done in Froyo?
Well, I think you're going to love this.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.900
We have a two to three X performance in the
browser?

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.599
How?
We took the same JavaScript interpreter that

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:40.540
we had in Chrome that made Chrome so fast,
V8, and we brought that into Froyo.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.530
Now, the best way to show you how much of
an advance we've made is to do a demo.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.490
So let's go and show you this fantastic performance
boost.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.080
Now, we're going to do this demo with a number
of devices.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.340
We're going to do it --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Two devices.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.611
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We're going to do this demo
 -- three devices.

00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:02.510
We're going to do this demo with Froyo, Eclair,
and an iPad.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.069
Now, here's the demo we're going to do.
There's an industry-standard test, in fact,

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:15.389
there's -- it's a suite of 26 tests, the SunSpider
test, that really exercise JavaScript performance

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:19.560
of all kinds.
And when Matt presses "start" across these

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.009
three devices, we're going to exercise each
one of these 26 tests.

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:29.699
As we complete one test, that little Android
robot will take one breast stroke forward.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.860
And as all 26 tests are complete, we're going
to complete an entire lap.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.970
How are we going to go do here?
Let's go ahead and start this test.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.220
Let's what happens.
Oh, you started the iPad first, trying to

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.430
give it a little bit of a lead here, huh?
[ Laughter ]

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:49.309
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You can cheer.

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:55.740
It's great.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:03.580
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I really wonder if we'll be
able to get that in the app store.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:09.590
It's a Web app, how great is that?
All right.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:21.059
Let's go back to slides.
We think with the performance improvements

00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:26.279
that we just showed you that we can claim
that Froyo has the world's fastest mobile

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:33.510
browser. And that's a pretty great accomplishment,
one we are extremely proud of. We're not done.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.870
I showed you what's in Froyo, but make no
mistake about our commitment to maintain leadership

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:44.029
in the browser on Android. And one of the
ways we are doing that is to have standards

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:51.320
bodies to enable Web developers to get capabilities
that were formerly only limited to the native

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.620
access to the platform.
What kind of capabilities? Think about the

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.410
kinds of things you can access on a device,
things like the magnetometer, the accelerometer.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.870
Think about things like the camera or being
able to access speech. Wouldn't this be great

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.940
if you could access this from the browser.
We are going to show you a sneak peek at something

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.190
beyond Froyo, an early development build that
will give you a flavor of where we're going

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.250
next.
Let's go back to demos.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.880
Now, remember, we already got some of this
work under way. Last year we worked with the

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.260
standards committees to introduce geo location
into the browser, and today almost in all

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.921
major modern platforms, you can make an API
call from the browser, get location with the

00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:37.100
user's permission, and then do a feature like
My Location right within the browser.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:45.410
But we want to do more. How about the accelerometer.
What about access to tilt in the direction

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:50.120
of the device?
Watch this.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.250
Isn't that great? Right within the browser.
[ Applause ]

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.300
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right.
