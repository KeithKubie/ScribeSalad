00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Big
History. Today we're gonna be talking about

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:10.489
the formation of the solar system, approximately
4.567 billion years ago. Four, five, six,

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:14.360
seven.. Could that possibly be a coincidence?
Yes.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.140
So if you weren't asleep during like, every
minute of grade school, you're probably familiar

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.170
with the basic layout of the solar system
and the eight -- formerly nine -- planets.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.170
What you may not know is how the planets fit between
the stars, and life as the linchpin of rising complexity.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.439
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! What about Pluto?

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.690
Oh, Me From the Past! I know people like to
root for the underdog, particularly when the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.270
underdog shares a name with Mickey Mouse's
dog. Off topic, but how come Mickey Mouse

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.260
has a dog who is a dog, and also a friend,
Goofy, who is a dog? But just remember that

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.079
Pluto also shares a name with the Roman god
of the underworld, who was very unlikable.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.520
But regardless, the word "planet" is a man-made
classification for a natural phenomenon. We

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.539
use it because it makes it easier to do science.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.969
Pluto hasn't cleared the rocks within its
neighborhood orbit, like planets usually do,

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.859
and there's even a dwarf planet on the edge
of our solar system, Eris, that's bigger

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.740
than Pluto, and there are hundreds of others
that are comparable to Pluto. The nature of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.990
the universe has not changed, it's just that
we learned that Pluto was not acting like

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.330
a planet, so can we please just drop the
Pluto thing!?

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:29.250
[Theme Music]

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.420
So we're now moving from the scale of galaxies,
which involve millions of light years, to

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.239
a neighborhood that's only a few light hours
from the sun, to Neptune - the farthest planet

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:45.079
- or at most, a light year or two to the distant Oort cloud
of billions of comets held by the gravity of our sun.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.979
So last episode we talked about how the stars
are like our great-great-great-many-many-times-over

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.049
grandparents. Well, our sun actually had stars
as its parents, too. It's most likely a second

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.939
generation star, which means that the sun
was formed from the wreckage of previous dead

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.499
stars, and that it contains elements other
than just hydrogen and helium -- heavier elements

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:07.739
that are forged in the bellies of stars and
some of which are, like, flung out by supernovae.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.180
When our star formed, its immense gravitational
pull sucked in 99.99% of all the matter in

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.810
the solar system, so in this case we are all
the 0.01%. But essentially, the rest of the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.610
solar system is made up of the debris, like the crumbs,
the dregs in the bottom of your coffee cup.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.620
Our sun formed over the course of about 100,000
years in what's called a solar nebula, which

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.750
is like a fiery cradle of wisps of dust and
gas. Then the solar nebula began to compress

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.510
into a star, probably triggered by a nearby
supernova that also, usefully, peppered the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.730
solar system with even more heavy elements.
And then, as the sun slurped up like almost

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.939
all of the matter of the solar system, pressure made the
core of the sun heat up and it came to life.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.540
The usual fusion of hydrogen and helium began
to happen and continues to happen, which is

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.230
nice because otherwise the Earth would be
extremely cold, and- and also very dead. So

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.050
how do we know all of this is true? Well,
let's talk to Emily, from The Brain Scoop.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.240
Well, a good piece of evidence is the construction
site rubble from that time. Meteorites form

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.489
a sort of fossil record. Meteorites fall to
Earth and some of them are primitive clumps

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.680
of nebular dust. Careful investigation reveals
them to be around 4.568 billion years old.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.189
The point is there can only be two environments
where Iron-60 came from. One is inside of

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.459
a very old giant red star, and the other is
within a supernova. Elderly red giants move

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.280
away from star forming regions in the galaxy;
chances are, the sun wasn't formed near one

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.820
of those. So it's much more likely that our sun's 
formation was triggered by a supernova blast.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.099
So in the early days, the heat from the sun
blasted lots of gassy materials away from

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.249
the inner regions of the solar system, encompassing
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, further out

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:51.939
in the vicinity of where Jupiter is now; it
was cold enough for volatile gasses to hang

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.829
around and even become liquids or solids.

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.769
That's why the inner planets like us are rocky,
and the outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.859
and Neptune are all these humongous gas giants.
So what happened to the remaining 0.01% of

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.170
our solar system, and what does this have
to do with the rise of complexity? Well, the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.019
dust floating around the baby solar system
wasn't just elements; like, heating in the

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.239
stellar nebula allowed this dust to sometimes
form more complex configurations of elements,

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.479
like, for one thing, around 60 different kinds
of minerals.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.839
So then the dust began to stick together.
Why do I have balloons, by the way? Well,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.490
obviously I'm going to tell you shortly.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.300
So you may have noticed that if you rub a
balloon onto your head for long enough, it

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.690
will stick. That's because of electrostatic
forces, precisely the same forces that allowed

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.710
the dust in the solar system to gently collide
and stick together.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.800
And then as those clumps of dust got bigger
and bigger, the collisions ceased to be so

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.300
gentle. So within 100,000 years there were
many objects of up to 10 kilometers in diameter

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.030
in the solar system and the force and heat
of those violent collisions allowed the formation

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.850
of still more celestial bodies.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.830
Objects continued to collide, the larger objects
sucking in the smaller ones with their gravitational

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.050
nets, and then the largest in each orbit began
bulldozing its way through the remaining material.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.820
So after about a million years, the solar
system consisted of a few dozen or so protoplanets.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.180
They were roughly between the size of Mars
and our moon, and then, over the next 10 to

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.460
100 million years, the game of pool continued,
each collision being something terrifying

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.069
to behold, until we wound up with the eight
massive planets we are familiar with today.

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.759
But, of course, there's more than just planets
in our solar system. There's an asteroid-belt

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.090
between Mars and Jupiter, for instance, which
may be a failed planet, messed-up by Jupiter's

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.409
gigantic gravitational pull. And then on the
edge of the solar system, there's the Kuiper-belt,

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:43.139
a region of planetary shrapnel, like poor
old Pluto, and even further out, in the boonies,

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.330
there is the Oort cloud - it's like this huge
borderland teaming with billions of comets,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.270
but it's still within the sun's gravitational
pull, and the Oort cloud is a light year away.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.330
That's how massive our sun is, and it's a
pretty modest-sized star.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.480
So this was a pretty intense time, in terms
of energy transference -- like, all those

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.940
protoplanets smashing together converted huge
amounts of kinetic energy to heat. In fact,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.330
it was so much heat that when combined with
the heat put off by radioactive materials

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.590
in the early solar system, the Earth was a
molten ball of lava. Basically, the entire

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:23.240
planet was as hot as Houston, Texas. What's that?
Apparently it was much hotter than Houston, Texas.

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:28.569
Anyway, the Earth underwent a process of 
differentiation, whereby heavy elements sank to the

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.659
center, and many lighter elements floated to the
surface. A lot of the metallic elements, like iron

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:38.800
and nickel sank through the hot sludge to
the core, where they still are, and the lighter

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.129
silicates floated upward, forming the Earth's
mantle, a region about 3,000 kilometers thick.

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:48.610
The even lighter silicates floated to the
surface, where they eventually cooled into

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.470
the Earth's crust, about 35 kilometers thick
in some places, and at the bottom of the deepest

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.300
oceans, about as thin as 7 kilometers.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.700
You can think of the crust as like the thin
layer of skin that forms on a bowl of hot

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.560
clam chowder, and you wouldn't be far from
the truth. By the way, I could use some delicious

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.700
geological clam chowder right now, just like
my mom used to make, but with more nickel.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.160
The lightest materials of all, including gases
like hydrogen, helium, methane, water vapor,

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:20.710
nitrogen, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide -- they
bubbled to the surface, and were kinda belched

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.449
out of volcanoes, to form the early atmosphere
of the Earth, the steam off the soup. And

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:30.949
then even more water vapor was brought in
by comets falling to Earth, which we appreciate,

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:35.020
comets, but even though we do have a water
shortage, we don't need you to come back.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.680
Much of the methane and the hydrogen sulfide
in the early atmosphere was converted into

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.780
carbon dioxide, which turned the sky into like a
terrifying red, rather than our friendly blue of today.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.200
So basically, you've got an Earth with a red
sky, volcanoes that are thousands of feet

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:55.349
high, a black, barren rocky surface, the foul
smell of sulfur everywhere, scolding hot steam,

00:07:55.349 --> 00:08:00.150
constant collisions of fire and brimstone
from above, occasionally splitting the crust

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:05.439
open and creating entire oceans of lava. That's
why we call this period in Earth's history

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:09.300
"The Hadean Era," after Hades, the Greek god
of the underworld.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.439
But a couple of nice things about this crazy,
terrifying ball of fire: one, we weren't there,

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:18.330
so it's not bothering us. Two, all of this
intense heat and pressure allowed mineral

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.699
combinations to increase dramatically. In
fact, there were a whopping 1,500 different

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:28.019
combinations and that would only increase
as plate tectonics and life got involved.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.800
So during this terrible toddler phase for
the Earth, a Mars-size object dubbed Theia

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.220
collided with the newly-formed Earth in a vigorous
kind of body-check, or I guess more of a planet-check.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.840
This knocked out a huge chunk of the Earth's
materials, and then, over time, those materials

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.710
accreted into, you guessed it, the moon. The
moon, of course, is best-known today for inspiring

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.890
the moons over-my-hammy sandwich at Denny's,
but it also inspired the space race and millions

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.200
of poems and paintings and it also created
tides. But putting aside the tides, which

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.420
are admittedly a pretty big deal, without the moon,
what would wolves howl at in all of those T-shirts?

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.900
All right, so as the Earth cooled, the water
vapor that had accumulated in the atmosphere

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.630
fell in torrential rains. Like, downpours
that lasted millions of years. It was like

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.470
Seattle, but instead of like, coffee and grunge
music, there was just ammonia. These downpours

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.820
created the first oceans, like as the Earth's
surface cooled below 100 degrees Celsius, water

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:29.940
vapor was able to stay in liquid form and somewhere
between 3.8 and 4 billion years ago, we had oceans.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.860
Let's talk about food again! This time, though,
instead of Earth-chowder, let's imagine the

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:40.110
Earth as an egg. The crust is as thin as the
eggshell. It's also brittle and fractured

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.550
into segments called "plates". Essentially,
these plates float on top of squishy, goopy

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.320
rocks that are close to their melting point.
As a result, the surface of the Earth has

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.940
a history of its own, including the creation
of mountains, the explosion of volcanoes,

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.690
the forging of mighty super-continents like
Rodinia and Pangaea.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.270
Plate tectonics affects everything from the
movement of continents to the distribution

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.520
and evolution of species, and is one of the
most vital principles of modern geology. It's

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.660
also responsible for less fun things, like
massive earthquakes and super volcanic eruptions

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.210
that have caused the deaths and even total
extinction of millions of species.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.640
Finally, the point should be raised that of
all the possible scenarios that might kill

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.670
off the human race -- provided we don't kill
off ourselves -- a super volcanic eruption

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.320
is among the foremost of them. In fact, on
the scale of millions of years, a devastating

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.420
eruption is almost guaranteed to happen. And
unlike an asteroid, one can't go all Bruce

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.220
Willis and blow up a super eruption with a nuke. If we're
still around, it'll be interesting to see how we cope.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.900
Throughout the birth of the Sun and the origins
of the Earth, there was the chance formation

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.220
of Goldilocks conditions for life.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.210
Like with the porridge and beds that a fairy-tale
sociopathic blonde pilfered from a baby bear

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:51.330
in a break-and-enter job, the conditions for
life on Earth were just right. This includes

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.400
the placement of the planet relative to the
Sun. The right chemicals were present on Earth

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.040
to produce the first building blocks for life
-- more on that next time.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.860
Even plate tectonics were hugely important.
First, they suck biotic waste -- dead things,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.730
excrement -- underground instead of remaining
on the surface. If not for plate tectonics,

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.230
we'd be more more-or-less swimming in our
own you-know-what. Over millions of years,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.860
this biotic waste could be transformed into
coal, or even diamonds.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.020
Plate tectonics - we turn your poo into diamonds.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.020
And if it wasn't for oceans and plate tectonics,
there's a good chance that we'd have the same

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:27.810
runaway greenhouse effect that Venus has - where
the surface is hot enough to melt lead.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.700
Plate tectonics were also crucial to human
history. The gigantic land-mass of Afro-Eurasia

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.440
made trade networks possible, which facilitated
the exchange of knowledge and technologies,

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.200
along with sharing diseases to gradually build
immunities -- something that would be grave

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.350
news for the isolated inhabitants of North
and South America.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.730
The distribution of copper, iron, silver and
gold influenced the growth and prosperity

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.990
of countless societies, even the distribution
of coal-beds in Wales was a major ingredient

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.450
for the industrial revolution kicking off
in Great Britain.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.620
All these things, formed within the slimmest
of margins of probability, were Goldilocks

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.790
conditions for the rise of complexity in the
later story -- the sustenance of life, the

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.860
distribution of resources, and even the coal
needed for the industrial revolution, which

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.740
exploded into the tremendous rise of
complexity in modern times.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.200
It's a transformation that continues to this very day.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.360
So speaking of Goldilocks conditions, knowing
about the formation of our solar system, and

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.380
the conditions on Earth that were necessary
for life, is crucial to thinking about the

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.700
possibility of life elsewhere. The first so-called
exoplanet was discovered by Swiss astronomers

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:38.740
in 1995, and in 2002 alone, 31 new exoplanets
were discovered by independent astronomers.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.720
NASA has taken this several steps further. 
In 2009 they launched the Kepler probe

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.680
to look at about 150,000 solar systems in
the nearby galaxy.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.880
As of now, they've found hundreds and hundreds
of confirmed planets with thousands more potential

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.310
candidates. And estimates are that in the
entire Milky Way galaxy, there could be as

00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:02.850
many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting
their stars in the Goldilocks zones for life,

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:07.720
and that's just in our galaxy! There are hundreds
of billions of galaxies in the universe.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.520
Now I'm not gonna tell you that creating life
is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel, but

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.040
if you put a hundred trillion bullets in that
barrel, you are bound to hit a fish. But given

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.130
the vast amount of space between solar systems
and the fraction of time in which life -- to

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:26.290
speak nothing of the sliver of time so-called
"intelligent life" -- has existed on our planet,

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.500
we may never encounter other life forms.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.890
But I find it tremendously exciting, as well
as kind of comforting, knowing that there

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:38.350
may well be other forms of life out there,
even if we never run into them, from microbes

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:44.890
to multi-celled organisms, like, you know...us! 
Maybe they're as astonished by their existence

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:50.200
as we are by ours, and thinking about that,
one begins to feel a little bit better about

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.860
our tiny role in the cosmic play. We may never
meet, but we're comrades in the strange phenomenon

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.160
of rising complexity in the universe. More
on that next time. I'll see you then.
