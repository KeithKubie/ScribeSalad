00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So in our original version of the grammar, only 4 strings were derivable.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's our grammar from before.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm going to add just 1 rule, and that one itty bitty rule

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is going to give me phenomenal cosmic power.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here I've added a rule to allow us to make compound subjects.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This rule is super special awesome.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let me show you a new derivation that uses this new rule.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Starting from sentence, we go to subject verb,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
subject and subject verb, students and subject verb,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
students and subject think, students and teachers think.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Here, right here when we turned this subject into subject and subject,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that's when we were using this starred rule.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And notice that now, rather than a 2-word sentence,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we've produced a 4-word sentence.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Amazing. Do students and teachers think?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That beggars belief.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Both of us think? Teachers certainly don't think.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Let's see how this plays out.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This new power that we've discussed

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is called recursion in grammar.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You're already familiar with recursion in programming

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
where a function calls itself.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Here we can replace a non-terminal subject

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
with that same non-terminal and some other stuff,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
so just as we might define factorial in terms of factorial of x - 1,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we can define subject in terms of subject and subject.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This is a recursive rewrite rule, and thus the whole thing

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is now recursive grammar.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Recursive grammars, that's where all the real power is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
because in essence, it allows a bit of a loop,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and this gives us some room for creativity.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This is how we can have a finite structure

00:01:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that admits infinite utterances but not all utterances.
