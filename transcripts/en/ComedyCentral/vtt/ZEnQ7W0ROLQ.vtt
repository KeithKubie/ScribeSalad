00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.069
&gt;&gt; This is that painful point
in every Dolphins season

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:04.971
used around mid November

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:09.742
when all hope is lost and I turn
to the NFL official oddsmaker

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:11.411
A for four or five.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:15.115
&gt;&gt; Years. Daniel what is mine.
Thanks for having me on Doug.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:19.519
&gt;&gt; Seen being is about this
whole Super Bowl bullshit

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.855
and how the teams will midseason
and all those of us who.

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:24.891
Let's keep it real here.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.026
Well we already know who's going
to win the Super Bowl

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.928
is going to be in New England

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:31.831
might give you a smokescreen
with New England

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:35.168
and the Rams and New England
in mother in New Orleans.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.171
But. New England's going
to win the Super Bowl

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.840
and that's my locker all week.
The Patriots.

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.242
&gt;&gt; That flew 16 year
run is over there

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:44.577
goes to Aaron Hernandez

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.212
is going to curse
that franchise.
