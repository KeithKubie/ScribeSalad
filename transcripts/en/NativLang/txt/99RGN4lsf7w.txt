Speaker 1:          00:00          We've been digging into the decipherment of ancient scripts, but what is a script

Speaker 1:          00:08          I'm convinced we'll miss a lot along our journey into decipherment if we don't pack an understanding of writing systems to take along with us. So at this point, I plan to spend a few minutes racing over the basics of writing with you, but however hard I tried to condense it and pack it in, it's scratched for more scratched. The old Greek root for writing graph meant scratch like scratching symbols into rock or clay graph. Femes are written units like the Letter v, a Semicolon, the hung character for fire. The actual marks that get written down are glyphs. Here are some glyphs for the Grapheme v and here are some glyphs for fire. Little marks called diacritics can modify those glyphs. Here's an o with the nasal mark telling you to pronounce it through the nose. Oh, here's that same diacritic above the letter. A diacritics are often simplified or miniature versions of other glyphs.

Speaker 1:          01:14          So that little nasal mark comes from the letter n put a top on other character. Notice that a single grapheme can be written with various glyphs. These glyphs are all allographs other scratches of the Grapheme v. These glyphs are all allographs of fire. Very roughly. A set of graphemes that get used together in writing makeup. A script, a script together with the weighting codes or represents language is a writing system. Graph. Phoenix wonders about writing system, things like the use of certain symbols for certain sounds or certain meanings or the differences between different writing systems. Then there's gruff FedEx, which wants to know about things like the shape and composition of letters or the mechanics of human handwriting. The word writing can mean any of these. I really want to put some art in thought into this separate voyage through writing so that we can make the most of decipherment tune in for both and subscribed for language.
