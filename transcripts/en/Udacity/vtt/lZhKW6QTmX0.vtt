00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.840
So for the next step, we knew to think about

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.413
this problem rent into web cycles. We don't want to crawl

00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:09.630
pages that we have already crawled. So what we need is

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.690
someway of testing whether the page was crawled. If it was

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.710
crawled, we don't want to crawl it again. If it hasn't

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.790
been crawled, then we want to do something. So the way

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.520
to make a decision like that is to use if. So

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.300
we need a test condition for the if so that will

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.850
only do the stuff that we do to crawl a page if we have not already crawled

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.240
that page. So see if you can figure out

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.120
what the test condition for the if should be.
