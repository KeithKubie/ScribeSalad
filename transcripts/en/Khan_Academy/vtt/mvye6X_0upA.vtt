00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.810
In the last video, our
null hypothesis was

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.920
the drug had no effect.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.100
And our alternative hypothesis
was that the

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.300
drug just has an effect.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.990
We didn't say whether the drug
would lower the response time

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.090
or raise the response time.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.320
We just said the drug had an
effect, that the mean when you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.290
have the drug will not
be the same thing as

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.440
the population mean.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.580
And then the null hypothesis
says no, your mean with the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.517
drug's going to be the same
thing as the population mean,

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:28.910
it has no effect.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.420
In this situation where we're
really just testing to see if

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.750
it had an effect, whether an
extreme positive effect, or an

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.380
extreme negative effect,
would have both been

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.620
considered an effect.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.170
We did something called a
two-tailed test. This is

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:52.950
called eight two-tailed test.
Because frankly, a super high

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.700
response time, if you had a
response time that was more

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.510
than 3 standard deviations,
that would've also made us

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.410
likely to reject the
null hypothesis.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.010
So we were dealing with
kind of both tails.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.330
You could have done a similar
type of hypothesis test with

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.590
the same experiment where you
only had a one-tailed test.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.110
And the way we could have done
that is we still could have

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.075
had the null hypothesis be that
the drug has no effect.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.670
Or that the mean with the drug--
the mean, and maybe I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.320
could say the mean with the
drug-- is still going to be

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.520
1.2 seconds, our mean
response time.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.030
Now if we wanted to do a
one-tailed test, but for some

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.060
reason we already had maybe a
view that this drug would

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.050
lower response times, then our
alternative hypothesis-- and

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.220
just so you get familiar with
different types of notation,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.390
some books or teachers will
write the alternative

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.170
hypothesis as H1, sometimes
they write it as H

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.320
alternative, either
one is fine.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.090
If you want to do one-tailed
test, you could say that the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.509
drug lowers response time.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.340
Or that the mean with the drug
is less than 1.2 seconds.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.790
Now if you do a one-tailed test
like this, what we're

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.040
thinking about is, what we want
to look at is, all right,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.290
we have our sampling
distribution.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.960
Actually, I can just use the
drawing that I had up here.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.250
You had your sampling
distribution

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.610
of the sample mean.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.360
We know what the mean of that
was, it's 1.2 seconds, same as

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.500
the population mean.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.060
We were able to estimate its
standard deviation using our

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.260
sample standard deviation, and
that was reasonable because it

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.250
had a sample size of greater
than 30, so we can still kind

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.530
of deal with a normal
distribution for the sampling

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.540
distribution.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.250
And using that we saw that the
result, the sample mean that

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.960
we got, the 1.05 seconds,
is 3 standard

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.025
deviations below the mean.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.780
So if we look at it-- let me
just re-draw it with our new

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.490
hypothesis test. So this is
the sampling distribution.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.920
It has a mean right over
here at 1.2 seconds.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.890
And the result we got
was 3 standard

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.810
deviations below the mean.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.480
1, 2, 3 standard deviations
below the mean.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.910
That was what our 1.05
seconds were.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.870
So when you set it up like this
where you're not just

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.890
saying that the drug has an
effect-- in that case, and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.460
that was the last view, you'd
look at both tails.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.400
But here we're saying we only
care is does the drug lower

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.740
our response time?

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.590
And just like we did before, you
say OK, let's say the drug

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.040
doesn't lower our
response time.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.170
If the drug doesn't lower our
response time, what was the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.730
probability or what is the
probability of getting a

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.980
lowering this extreme
or more extreme?

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.120
So here it will only be one
of the tails that we could

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.810
consider when we set our
alternative hypothesis like

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.320
that, that we think it lowers.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:22.410
So if our null hypothesis is
true, the probability of

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:35.900
getting a result more extreme
than 1.05 seconds, now we are

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.140
only considering this tail
right over here.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.050
Let me just put it this way.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.850
More extreme than 1.05 seconds,
or let me say, lower.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.030
Because in the last video we
cared about more extreme

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.140
because even a really high
result would have said, OK,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.450
the mean's definitely
not 1.2 seconds.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.110
But in this case we care about
means that are lower.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.480
So now we care about the
probability of a result lower

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.550
than 1.05 seconds.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.960
That's the same thing as
sampling-- of getting a sample

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.270
from the sampling distribution
that's more than 3 standard

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.270
deviations below the mean.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.610
And in this case, we're only
going to consider the area in

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.790
this one tail.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.310
So this right here would be a
one-tailed test where we only

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.290
care about one direction
below the mean.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.980
If you look at the one-tailed
test-- this area over here--

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.680
we saw last time that both of
these areas combined are 0.3%.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.760
But if you're only considering
one of these areas, if you're

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.680
only considering this one over
here it's going to be half of

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.910
that, because the normal
distribution is symmetric.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.790
So it's going to the 0.13%.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.920
So this one right here is going
to be 0.15%, or if you

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:55.440
express it as a decimal, this
is going to be 0.0015.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.733
So once again, if you set up
your hypotheses like this, you

00:05:59.733 --> 00:06:04.020
would have said, if your null
hypothesis is correct, there

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.990
would have only been a 0.15%
chance of getting a result

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.440
lower than the result we got.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:20.200
So that would be very unlikely,
so we will reject

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.470
the null hypothesis and go
with the alternative.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.910
And in this situation
your P-value is

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.850
going to be the 0.0015.
