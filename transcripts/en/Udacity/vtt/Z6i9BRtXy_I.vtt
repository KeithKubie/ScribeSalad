00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.620
Another possible solution to the IP address space

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.540
exhaustion problem is to simply add more bits. This

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.480
is the gist of the contribution of the

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.590
IPv6 protocol. Here's a picture of the IPv4 protocol

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.510
header, and all of the fields shown in

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.750
red have basically been removed in IPv6, resulting in

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.590
both a much simpler header and addresses that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.030
are much larger. By contrast, here's the IPv6 header.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.110
The IPv6 header provides 128 bits for

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.840
both the source and destination IP addresses. Now

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.160
the format of these addresses are as follows. Of the 128 bits, the top 48

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.450
bits are for the public routing topology,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.520
and we have a 16-bit site identifier. And

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.990
finally, a 64-bit interface ID, which effectively

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.940
has the 48-bit ethernet address of the interface

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.621
plus 16 more bits. Now, the top 48 bits can be broken down further. They include

00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.570
3 bits for aggregation, 13 bits for a

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.820
top level provider, something like a tier one

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.810
ISP, 8 reserve bits, and 24 additional bits. Now, note that there are 13 bits in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.480
the top 48 that directly map to the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.130
tier one ISP, meaning that addresses are purely provider-based,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.770
thus changing ISPs would require renumbering.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.200
IPv4 has many claimed benefits. There are

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.510
more addresses, the header is simpler,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.020
multihoming is supposedly easier, various aspects of

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.840
security are built in, such as the IPv6 crypto extensions. Now despite

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.980
all of these benefits, we have yet to see the huge deployment of IPv6 yet.
