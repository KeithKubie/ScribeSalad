00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.168
A woman who could crack
your back with her feet.

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:05.071
Yes, I'm just gonna say yeah.
Like a rub and tug.

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:06.439
Yes.
Yes.

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:07.640
But like the madam.

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:08.874
Or wack shack if you will.

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.877
Or one of the ladies eating
something weird on the train.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.280
Yes. Yeah it looks like
big pieces of green paper.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.350
Or picking her nose.

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.686
You go Miss, I'm sorry,
are you chewing bark?

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:23.756
Dude, an old Asian lady
when they go at their nose too.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.460
They go finger, this is hard
to describe, it goes in

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.862
and they get really up
and they try to like-

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.964
Reverse dunk?

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.000
The reverse dunk.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.169
Throw it up, I'll knock it down.
Kaboom.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.470
It's a triple double ...

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:39.773
Here we go, turn two.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:43.276
They almost get their thumb
up there

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.877
too like they're trying
to pull one off the roof.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.680
They literally are the Harlem
Globetrotters on nose picking.

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:48.981
White
people are the Generals.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:51.851
We're just like ...
jamming it in.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.553
Do, do do do.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:59.258
It's the Bonfire Comedy
Central radio Sirius XM 95.

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:00.893
I'm Big Jay Oakerson.
That's Dan Soder.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:02.295
It's weapons day.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.863
Weapons, karate day
on the Bonfire.

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:05.231
It's weapons
and cookie day, sorry.

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.432
Weapons
and delicious cookie day.

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.168
They are delicious cookies.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.670
Our guest joining us
in the studio right now.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.372
You know him as the co-host of
The Anthony Cumia show on

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.341
Compound Media
it's Dave Landau.

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:16.576
How you doing?

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:17.844
What's up buddy?
It's good to see you man.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.812
I got weapons and a cookie
just walking in the door.

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.047
Yeah dude,
welcome to the Bonfire.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.281
Thanks for having me.

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:23.515
That's what we do.
We hand out-

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.718
It's like a baseball game in
the 80s, nunchucks and cookies.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.053
Sure just come in.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.722
We try to represent a little
sweet side, a little danger.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.524
I like it. I feel dangerous
and sweet.

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:33.993
Dan got me a full
blown attack bow staff.

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:35.261
That's nice.

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.897
Yeah before we broke
for Christmas

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.466
Break, we've had conversations
on the show before

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:44.103
about post-apocalyptic weaponry.
What you'd want to use.

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:46.606
Jay wanted a bow staff.
I wanted a hatchet.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.574
So he got me
an all purpose hatchet,

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.009
like heavy duty
one before Christmas.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:51.244
That's nice.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.478
[crosstalk 00:01:51] hatchet.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:53.679
That is nice.
That's attachet.

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:54.914
What's that?

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.482
It's an attachet,
attack hatchet.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:58.451
What do you attach it to,
just a lot longer hatchet?

00:01:58.484 --> 00:01:59.685
Yeah I wish.

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:00.987
I'm gonna look for that.
I want to get-

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.788
It's got a cool side holster.

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.090
Oh that's sweet.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.825
So you could really carry it
Walking Dead style.

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.026
Yeah that's awesome.

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.095
Yeah so we went through
all of our weapons

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.663
and then since he got me
that hatchet,

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.398
I had to get him
a fucking real deal bow staff.

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:13.599
Of course.

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:15.868
I mean this is a real,
I think probably-

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:17.203
Let Dave fell the weight
of that.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:18.971
I think this is a legit
legal problem.

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.640
I like that it's refracting
though.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.441
You rarely see
a retractable bow,

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.076
actually I rarely see
a bow staff.

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.344
Yeah, outside of a karate dojo.

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:27.647
Retractable, even less
if you could imagine.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.081
I'm afraid I'm gonna
hurt someone.

00:02:29.114 --> 00:02:30.883
All right, no I'm not
because I'm a pussy.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.818
No, you're not, come on don't
say that while holding sith.

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:34.153
Aim it directly at Jacob.

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:36.022
Aim it at him?

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.323
Break that man.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.592
You just, that. Oh dude.

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:41.661
That is riot police gear
right there.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.829
And then the bottom comes out
and it's a whole thing.

00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:45.064
That's a double sided ...

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.832
Wow, it's a double sided one.

00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:48.901
Like the end of Requiem
for a Dream.

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.636
You scream ass to ass
when you flick it out too.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:56.409
Yeah, ass to ass. Ass to ass.
Ass to ass.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:03:00.112
Ass to ass. Ass to ass.
Would you say that's how you

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:01.614
Requiem for a Dream?

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:03.516
I feel like if I was using this
I would have been killed

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.218
already,
just trying to figure it out.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.320
Yeah you'd be like bad guys
give me more time.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.989
The beauty is once it's extended
you can spin it in a way,

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:11.657
I'll show you one day
Dave.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.492
You and I should train.

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.228
We can block bullets with ...

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:18.030
Jay lives in the shadows.
He blocks bullets.

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:19.565
It's a while
different lifestyle.

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:22.068
I'm a leader in an underworld.
I mean it doesn't matter.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.270
Are you caught up in the R.
Kelly scandal?

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:25.538
Is there a new one?

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.273
No, I mean just you know
his whole existence.

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.375
Well they just put
this documentary series out.

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:32.345
I missed the show yesterday
and Jay went in on it.

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:37.083
The documentary series
is just mind blowing.

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:40.319
Like how he paid for a family
to go to Paris

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:42.021
so they didn't
show up in court?

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:44.590
I haven't even gotten to that
in the documentary.

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.325
As I'm going
through it normally

00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:48.427
but I watched a lot
of pieces of it

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.629
over the course
of the weekend.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:51.597
I'm just blown away
by the whole thing.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.068
And then realized that I think
I did check out on him

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.371
because I think when
the whole piss tape came out

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.640
I was like yeah, he's just done.
That's it, he's gone.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.008
That was like 20 years ago,
right?

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.209
And then he just kept-

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:04.443
That was Chapelle Show.

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:05.711
Not 20 but it was a while back.

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:09.015
I want to say it's like 2002?
16 years ago.

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.850
Yeah, I wanna piss on you.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.318
It's pretty early for sure.

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:15.355
I wanna poop poop,
I wanna pee pee.

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:17.189
That was a great parody.

00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:19.091
That was so funny.

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:20.359
When that whole thing happened

00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:22.261
I just assumed
he was kinda like done.

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:24.430
But he just kept releasing stuff
and paying people off

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:25.698
but I didn't know that.

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:27.300
I just was like every time
he'd pop back up-

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.601
This guy is resilient.

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:29.802
I'm like isn't this guy ...

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:32.138
But then you kinda assume
look, listen,

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:34.540
the retraction is always
the little blurb

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:35.941
and the accusation's
the headline.

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:37.143
You know what I mean?

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:39.412
So I'm like maybe they figure
out he didn't do stuff.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:43.482
And he was by the way acquitted
of all charges of child

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:44.684
pornography somehow.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.553
It's like 14 counts
he gets acquitted on.

00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:49.488
Yo, he's like fucking Al Capone
with kids and piss.

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:52.091
I think he's been brought up
on several more than that.

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:55.127
Well he did do one where he got
basically off on a technicality

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.331
because the family was just gone
on vacation over the trial.

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:00.032
So he just paid them off.

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:01.334
What a vacation to schedule.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:02.535
But a lot of them
he did that to.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:03.736
Whoops-a-daisy.

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:05.137
Oh no we're going to Florida?

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.640
We're supposed to sue
an iconic R&amp;B star.

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:10.843
Honey, I'll tell you what.
I really need this trip.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.913
I mean everything bearing
down with the trial.

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:17.016
Oh fuck. What's today?

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:18.384
Jenise, what is today?

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:20.586
Well these plane tickets
aren't refundable.

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:24.123
Egg on my face
like the piss from his dick.

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:25.758
R. Kelly's
gonna walk

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:28.494
Just like our kid
all over the face.

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:31.931
I say the most jarring thing
about that video to me

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:34.266
was that he took a full
length toilet piss on her.

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:35.468
He did, he really ...

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.103
It wasn't squirts.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:40.139
Oh he gave her a League
of Their Own Tom Hanks' piss.

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:41.941
Before he did it, he should have
come into the picture

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:44.443
like jump in like oh, oh, oh.
Ah.

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:47.547
Oh thank God, oh thank God.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.150
It was almost a Naked Gun
Leslie Nielsen piss really.

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:52.785
It was really breathtaking.

00:05:52.818 --> 00:05:54.120
Is this in the new Airplane?

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:59.024
When I'm watching it ...

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:01.260
Basically this documentary
is just revealing

00:06:01.293 --> 00:06:03.496
how much of a sick piece
of shit this guy really is.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.331
Yeah but in sequence
that I'm watching it now,

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:06.599
I started the first episode.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:10.403
Getting into the whole
Aliyah thing, she was 15.

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:12.505
Didn't he have her family
marry her.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:13.939
Well she was 15.

00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:15.574
I think they said
she got pregnant

00:06:15.607 --> 00:06:17.309
and he was looking
to marry her.

00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:18.911
The marriage certificate
said she was 18.

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:20.179
He was 27 for sure
at the time.

00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:21.414
Oh buddy.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.749
Is the documentary have
his music in it playing through,

00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:25.485
just to make it fun?

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:27.453
Yeah, when they talk
about the songs.

00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:29.021
Well I say, this is
the biggest thing to me

00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:30.456
that I think
you'll find interesting,

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:32.591
but I did bring it up
yesterday.

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:35.661
Is just that the lady
who started the Me Too Movement,

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:38.464
describes why he's going
through the cracks

00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:41.333
so much with things
is every time an allegation

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:44.570
came out it's like lined up
with the release of a song

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:46.272
that just changed shit again.

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:47.540
Oh I Believe I

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:50.075
Can Fly, he was like taking
a dump on a kid's chest.

00:06:50.108 --> 00:06:52.111
I swear to you, I think
they said that they use

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:53.846
Ignition Remix as a thing.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.148
It made everybody forget
and then Step in the Name of

00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:57.950
Love made everybody
forget again.

00:06:57.983 --> 00:07:00.119
Oh man, can you believe
this guy fucks kids?

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:02.221
This made Black Lou
shake his head yesterday,

00:07:02.254 --> 00:07:03.956
it made me laugh.
Black Lou shaking his head

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:07.059
'cause I go, she says basically
you know how black people are

00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:09.862
when it's a song
that you at the barbecue

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:11.931
you want to hear,
at the family reunion

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.800
or that's your jam
at the club.

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:16.435
Black people just you
don't want to believe it.

00:07:16.468 --> 00:07:18.537
You're like holy shit.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.740
Well nobody's pissing on a kid
right then.

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:23.843
You got to drink
the beers first.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:25.377
And I don't know
your background enough

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.914
Dave to know but I'll tell you,
if you'd like to know, that R.

00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:31.217
Kelly music oddly good
to piss on kids to.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.955
I'll tell you this, it is a very
calming stream-like music,

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:37.690
you can relax.

00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:41.393
It is much like running water
in the sense ...

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:42.962
I go whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm a little stopped up,

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:45.998
can you guys get some R. Kelly
real quick. I go there we go.

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.933
Dude is he asleep, is he asleep?

00:07:47.966 --> 00:07:50.135
He goes, put on R. Kelly,
watch him piss himself.

00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:52.137
Dude, put his hand in warm water
and put on some R. Kelly.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.405
Put it half on a baby.

00:07:53.438 --> 00:07:55.140
Dude you wanna see him?
He'll piss his PJ's.

00:07:55.173 --> 00:07:57.143
I swear to God
that kid will just leak.

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:00.312
Put on R. Kelly,
put his hand in warm water.

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:02.681
It's kinda like Elvis, Elvis ...

00:08:02.714 --> 00:08:03.949
Loved piss.

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:06.852
Well he didn't like piss
but he liked kids,

00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:08.053
he liked young ...

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:10.589
He also like karate
that it's weapons day.

00:08:10.622 --> 00:08:12.458
Basically the last
five years of his life

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.627
was just him in Vegas
doing karate.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.362
I had no problem with that.

00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:18.163
I'm on the last five
of my career.

00:08:18.196 --> 00:08:19.397
Mine hasn't started yet.

00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:23.736
Dave I know we just met each
other but watch the talk dude.

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.871
No I'm serious,
I'm not insulting ...

00:08:25.904 --> 00:08:27.273
I got hooo.

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:28.507
Dave you're new here.

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:32.311
I'm gonna cut you some slack ...
'cause I liked you off mic.

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:33.712
I completely forgot then
I noticed

00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:35.748
your black belt, my mistake.

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:37.016
What you guys can't see is

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.185
I'm wearing a karategi
from the waste down.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.787
Dan's gi pants
and just whatever shirt.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.723
Dude I wear a wrestling shirt
and karategi pants

00:08:44.756 --> 00:08:47.359
with patches from various
tournaments I've competed in.

00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:48.761
I did not see them
under the kimono.

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.195
I didn't [crosstalk 00:08:49]

00:08:50.228 --> 00:08:51.964
Ah you're in full
Samurai gear Dan.

00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:54.567
Yeah so I'm watching
the Aliyah thing.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.702
They say with Aliyah part,

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:58.404
they're talking everyone
around him going hey

00:08:58.437 --> 00:08:59.605
you're not fucking
Aliyah are you?

00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:01.974
He's like I'm just producing
her guys relax

00:09:02.007 --> 00:09:03.242
Jesus.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:06.345
But they're like no seriously
she's 15 you know you really ...

00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:10.049
and they go, the more you keep
asking the weirder it is.

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:11.717
What's his actual first name?

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.952
Robert.
Robert.

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:14.820
So they go, there's just some
fucking Chicago cop

00:09:14.853 --> 00:09:16.088
that works a security detail

00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:18.123
and goes Robert
I'm not gonna lie to you,

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:20.993
if you are having sex with
Aliyah it is highly illegal.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.431
I worked murder police north
Chicago for damn near 20 years,

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.433
if you're fucking a kid
you gotta tell me about it

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:28.867
or they're gonna rain
down on us bud.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.135
Do you know how many times-

00:09:30.168 --> 00:09:32.705
Speaking of rain down, what was
it you were doing to this girl.

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.708
Hey what are you doing with the
shower tarp in your hotel room?

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.344
It is technically
sex acts still.

00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:41.714
The best thing is how many times
there's screen shots

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:45.784
on the documentary show
that goes Robert Kelly

00:09:45.817 --> 00:09:48.887
then was brought up on
22 counts of child pornography.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.089
I'm like ...

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:51.690
Did you take a picture
and send it to Bobby?

00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:52.891
Yes.

00:09:52.924 --> 00:09:55.995
Hell yeah.
He's like dude that's not funny.

00:09:57.062 --> 00:09:59.031
Dude.
Why would you do that dude.

00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:01.968
You know if the fucking feds
read that it looks different.

00:10:02.934 --> 00:10:05.838
It's the only unfortunate

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:07.272
just because
this documentary came out

00:10:07.305 --> 00:10:08.574
so now everybody
calls him Robert.

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:09.808
I know.

00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:11.543
That's my problem for the last
20 years of my career.

00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:12.845
He was always R.
I call him Bobby.

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:14.079
I had to ask what it was.

00:10:14.112 --> 00:10:15.314
Yeah, it's always R.

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:16.515
I know, now he's Robert Kelly.

00:10:16.548 --> 00:10:17.750
It's back to Bobby baby.

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:18.984
That's so hilarious.

00:10:19.017 --> 00:10:20.185
Got to go back to Bobby.

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:21.921
Bobby Kelly.

00:10:22.554 --> 00:10:24.023
So the Aliyah thing
they're saying he's like

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:27.059
no you guys are nuts,
stop even asking, it's stupid.

00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:29.928
Then they start doing all kinds
of weird things like going on

00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:33.465
TV a lot together,
dressed in the same thing.

00:10:33.498 --> 00:10:36.702
But not the same thing
like stylishly the same thing,

00:10:36.735 --> 00:10:39.571
like they just got off
a plane from Disney World

00:10:39.604 --> 00:10:41.640
and bought the same merch.

00:10:41.673 --> 00:10:43.475
So wait they're all in like
airport shirts?

00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:44.677
But the same airport shirts?

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.412
No it was like Mickey Mouse

00:10:47.312 --> 00:10:50.282
green with part flannel
part regular sweatshirts

00:10:50.315 --> 00:10:51.617
and shit,
it's ridiculous looking.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.153
Yeah unfortunately
Aliyah got on the wrong flight.

00:10:55.954 --> 00:10:57.456
It's so funny when you're
a pedophile

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:58.657
and you dress
like your victim.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.892
Oh I know well look at-

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:01.126
You go yeah
Mickey Mouse is cool.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:02.995
Or your victimizer,
like look at Cory

00:11:03.028 --> 00:11:04.863
Feldman who dresses
like Michael Jackson.

00:11:04.896 --> 00:11:07.700
Dude you're stepping
into a Cory Feldman hole.

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:09.001
We've gone deep.

00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:10.569
I don't mind.
I'm not knocking the guy.

00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:11.770
Oh we have.
We are.

00:11:11.803 --> 00:11:13.005
Destroyed him. He hates us.

00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:14.440
We are all blocked.
No, we're blocked.

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:15.641
From Feldman?
Yeah.

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:18.911
And we've fucking stacked
his live concert

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:20.546
and started chants
that him all goosed up

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:21.914
and he still blocked us.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.148
Really?

00:11:23.181 --> 00:11:24.783
Yeah, but don't worry.
We found a way around it.

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:26.085
We're gonna buy
a cameo from him.

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:27.286
Oh there you go.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:29.955
We'll buy an apology.
The American way.

00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:30.990
Sure he'll do it.

00:11:31.156 --> 00:11:34.026
Stay tuned. For whenever part 2
comes.

00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:35.060
Don't move!

00:11:35.093 --> 00:11:38.530
Don't move! Sit down.

00:11:38.563 --> 00:11:39.932
And watch another episode of the
Bonfire.

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:43.702
Sit. Sit. Sit. Down.

00:11:43.735 --> 00:11:45.337
Sit. No!

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.839
Packleader.

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:47.540
No.
