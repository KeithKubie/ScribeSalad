00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:09.200
VRINDA SINGH: Perfect.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.330
So what we're going
to do today is

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.580
have a discussion
with both of you

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.650
on what it takes to be Careem,
lessons from entrepreneurs

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.870
who have truly made
it big in the region,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.456
and your personal stories.

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:24.080
So I have a lot of
questions around how

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.360
you both deal with each other.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.710
Because no press interview
ever answers that.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.659
And obviously Google
has an amazing culture,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.010
but Careem has an
amazing culture as well.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.050
And I think there are
always lessons to learn.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.424
So that's something we would
like to understand from you.

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:41.840
And the last thing
we want to talk

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.940
about today is humility is a
big focus for culture at Careem.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.770
And you've spoken
a lot about it.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.710
And we'd like to understand
what that's all about.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.470
And the format, so
we have 40 minutes.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.300
So I'll give you
a few questions,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.910
but it really is all up to you.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.530
And then we'll open
up in the last 15

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.140
minutes for the audience
to take questions.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.810
Sounds good?

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.490
Perfect.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.150
And I will set it
on with this mic,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.500
and hopefully it doesn't fall.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.220
All right, so where do we start?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.760
So Careem, it's
been five years now.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.920
Where did it all begin
and what triggered it?

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.160
MAGNUS OLSSON: So as some
of you might have heard,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.180
it started a bit more
than five years ago.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.780
For me, the journey was I
was happily consulting away

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.710
in the region, enjoying myself.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.150
I had been in the Middle East.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.110
Now it's been 11 years.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.260
I've been here since
2006 and really enjoyed

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.490
what I was doing.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.990
But my life took
a bit of a turn.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.170
I had a brain bleeding
out of nowhere.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.800
And a very long story short,
I survived, which was great.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.650
But it really gave me an
opportunity to reflect on life.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.512
And what's life?

00:02:05.512 --> 00:02:06.220
Why are you here?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.030
And what's your purpose?

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.750
Why are we all running around?

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.130
And what are we going to do
with the time we have here?

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.160
And while I was very
happy at McKinsey,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.020
I realized that this is
not my ultimate purpose.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.040
I need to do something
really meaningful and big.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.240
So I quit and went
looking for that purpose.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.920
And in the process, me and
Mudassir started chatting,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.720
and one thing led to another.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.210
VRINDA SINGH: And
what for you was the--

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.680
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA:
So one was just

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.920
meeting Magnus and hearing his
mission was a big part of it.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.780
But there were two
things that happened

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.740
in 2011, which is the year
before we started Careem,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.610
that sort of triggered it.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.180
One was I was part of a
start up in the valley that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.810
got acquired.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.630
So I just had more
financial freedom

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.880
to consider doing
something else.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.840
And second, in the
last year at McKinsey,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.050
we were looking to open
an office in Pakistan

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.890
where I'm from.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.770
And since I was thinking
of leaving anyways,

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.915
I volunteered to go
in and explore it.

00:03:11.915 --> 00:03:13.540
And one of the things
that we had to do

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.210
was to make a list of
clients that McKinsey

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.810
could serve in Pakistan.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.140
McKinsey typically works
with larger organizations.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.280
So we looked for
larger companies.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.420
And I was quite surprised to
see that there was only one

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.300
company in Pakistan at that
time, which was worth more

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.430
than a billion dollars.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.112
Pakistan is a nation
of 200 million people.

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:37.570
And there was only
one company that

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.153
was worth more than
a billion dollars.

00:03:39.153 --> 00:03:40.900
And forget about the
billion dollar mark.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.400
That's irrelevant.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.750
But the fact that such
a large nation of people

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.650
has only produced one
large corporate institution

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.280
is a bit sad, a bit
embarrassing as well.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.700
Why have we not been
able to produce it?

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.530
And I would joke with Magnus
that he's from Sweden.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.684
And in Sweden, out of four
or five million people--

00:04:01.684 --> 00:04:02.600
MAGNUS OLSSON: 10 now.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.510
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: 10 million?

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.320
They've produced an
Ericsson, a Volvo, an IKEA,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.420
and the list goes on.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.930
So there was some desire to go
out and build something really

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.610
big to prove to ourselves
that we can do it

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.050
and also hopefully to make an
impact in the lives of people

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.870
in the region.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.380
So the fact that I had some
financial independence,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.780
there was this thing that
was lurking in the back,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.030
and then met Magnus
was the final push.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.970
VRINDA SINGH: So the jump
into entrepreneurship--

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.890
a lot of people are
budding entrepreneurs.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.720
One day I'm going
to do something.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.610
Everyone says that.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.360
Did you have this idea?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.120
Or did you go through
a list of 100 ideas?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.474
How did you hit upon the
idea of Careem as such?

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:47.390
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: Yes.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.490
So we left what we were
doing before we had the idea.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.160
So we said we want to do
something else, and we left.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.200
And there were
two basic criteria

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.910
that we put on ourselves.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.930
Whatever we end up doing
should have huge potential,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.960
should have the
opportunity or the ability

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.640
to become very, very big.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.300
Because we wanted to make
a big impact in the region

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.720
and on the world.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.290
And second, it was
very important for us

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.950
for that to be meaningful.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.580
So should not just
be about money

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.080
or bringing
something big, but it

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.290
should have a more
social element

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.860
of improving the region,
improving the lives of people

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.180
as well.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.680
And that's when the
process started.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.480
And along the way,
Magnus can tell us

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.890
some of the ideas we looked at.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.610
We looked at many before
we ended up on Careem.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.465
But I'll let Magnus--

00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:46.090
MAGNUS OLSSON: So
the code name of this

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.520
was actually Project Bamboo.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.150
And I think the idea
was that bamboo--

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.247
you put it in the ground,
and then you water it.

00:05:54.247 --> 00:05:56.080
For a very long time
you don't see anything,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.749
and then it just goes up.

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:59.290
So we looked at many
different ideas.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.010
And as typical consultants,
we could not really even

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.620
have a coffee chat
without slides.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.810
We have these slides--

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.770
we still have them--

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.480
that have meaningful on one
axis and big on the other axis.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.150
And we had plotted
different things.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.217
Among the shortlist was to
do something in health care.

00:06:16.217 --> 00:06:18.050
We felt that health
care was very important.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.250
And the region could need
improvements in that area.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.010
We looked at education.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.440
And we also looked
at a bunch of stuff,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.760
but one favorite was fish farms.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.380
Food is super important.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.190
Rising population, rising middle
class, people need protein.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.600
Fish is one of the best
sources of protein.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.390
And you can put the fish farm
in the middle of the desert.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.950
It doesn't even have to
be close to the ocean.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.074
And you just add some fish,
and you add some water,

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.040
and then you get it.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.330
And it's perfect!

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.670
And we even have this
sort of the fish version

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.450
of peak pricing, which is if
market price for fish is low,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.075
you just keep them
for two days longer.

00:06:58.075 --> 00:06:59.324
VRINDA SINGH: Keep them alive.

00:06:59.324 --> 00:07:00.650
MAGNUS OLSSON: Exactly.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.500
So we were quite excited
about this for a little while.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.830
And then we realized
that we were

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.246
going to smell like fish every
day we came home from work.

00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:08.880
So we said maybe not.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.350
And when we first had the
idea of transportation,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.750
it was from our jobs as
consultants traveling around

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.370
in the region.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:23.220
And for the business traveler,
transportation was a pinpoint.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.962
You land in Riyadh, you
land in Kuwait and Qatar,

00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:28.170
and you call this one guy
that you have on the phone.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.720
Because everyone has a guy.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.780
And I had Nurr in
Kuwait, Naushad

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.796
in Doha, Adeeb in Abu Dhabi.

00:07:35.796 --> 00:07:37.670
And you call this guy
and say, hey, I'm here.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.670
Can you come pick me up?

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.700
This was how
transportation was working.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.460
And you never showed up on time.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.529
You got lost on the way
to your client meeting.

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:46.570
You had to pay with cash.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:47.861
You had to haggle on the price.

00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:50.300
It was just not great.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.540
So there were people
telling us if you do this,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.550
we might be interested to
be your first customer.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.010
And at first we were
not super excited,

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.420
because this did not look
big, and it definitely

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.610
did not look meaningful.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.120
So you get a second
chance in life.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.860
You are a survivor
of brain surgery.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.304
And then you're going to go
and do a transportation app.

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:13.720
It did not feel
meaningful at all.

00:08:18.451 --> 00:08:20.700
It has gotten more and more
meaningful over the years.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.430
But already from
the beginning, we

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.971
realized that there
is an opportunity

00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:26.750
here to really improve
the lives of people.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.150
On the one hand,
customers that don't have

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.850
an easy way to move
around, particularly

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.030
women, but also men.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.230
In the UE, it's easy.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.880
But in countries like Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.940
it's more tricky.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.887
And on the other hand, there is
an opportunity to create jobs.

00:08:43.887 --> 00:08:44.970
Unemployment is very high.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.460
Youth unemployment
is super high.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.210
And at the same time, we don't
have any public transport

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.539
infrastructure in most places.

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:54.080
So this was an opportunity to
actually build public transport

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.050
infrastructure, create jobs,
and enable people to go and live

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.017
their lives.

00:08:58.017 --> 00:09:00.350
So we said, oh, maybe this
is actually quite meaningful,

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.210
and it can actually
be quite big.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.240
And then to be sure, we renamed
it Careem, which obviously,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.640
in Arabic means generous,
so that we would always

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.090
remember that the core value
was one of doing something

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.014
generous for the region.

00:09:14.014 --> 00:09:17.000
VRINDA SINGH: And when you
dreamt of making an impact,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.680
did you ever quantify
this is where

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.150
we want to be five
years from now,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.010
this is what big looks like?

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.220
What was the early
vision for Careem?

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.330
Mudassir, you can talk about
how the vision expanded.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.640
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: So we have
been positively surprised

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.320
on the pace at which
things have moved.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.420
And from the beginning we
said, let's do something big.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.890
So we did the math on how big
this opportunity could be.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.440
So we knew that we were
getting into something big.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.840
But I remember when we did
our first business plan

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.850
and presented to investors,
we put a mark for 2017--

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.120
this year-- so 2012 to 2017.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:06.230
We are eight times bigger
than we expected us to be now.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.265
So we really had
no idea this would

00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:11.840
happen so quickly and so big.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:17.810
And over time, we have become
more ambitious as well.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.920
We knew this was
a big opportunity.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.130
But in the first version
of the business plan,

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.570
we said, let's focus on the GCC.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.860
So we said GCC, it's
a big enough market.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.190
We are based here.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.584
We can tackle it.

00:10:29.584 --> 00:10:31.250
And then we realize
after the first year

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.540
that this business can
be a lot more scalable.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.540
So we said, why limit
ourselves to GCC?

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.050
People in Egypt, people in
Pakistan, people in Morocco

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.410
need the service as well.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.770
And we can create
jobs, and we can

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.884
provide mobility to people
in these markets as well.

00:10:45.884 --> 00:10:47.300
So we said, let's
expand the scope

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.730
to become the
broader Middle East.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.680
Then we said what we're doing
is not just movement of people,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.870
but we can start
moving things as well.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.520
So deliveries and
those kind of things.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.360
So that added another big
opportunity to the mix.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.270
And then lastly we realized
that the cities that we are in,

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.030
the Cairos, and the Karachis,
and the Lahores of the world,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.470
there is absolutely no public
transport in these markets.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.770
And we saw ourselves becoming
the transportation system

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.440
for the cities.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.060
So then we basically
said, look, our job

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.530
is to crowdsource or crowd
fund public transport

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.776
infrastructure.

00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:31.275
And we will do this
in a way that it

00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:33.610
will create a lot of jobs
and income opportunities

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.110
for people.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.240
VRINDA SINGH: And is that
on the map right now?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.281
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: It is
on the map at the moment.

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:42.220
So our aspiration is to
basically for the cities

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.910
that we are in, become
the most affordable,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.050
the most accessible
transportation option.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.987
So if even someone
is taking a bus,

00:11:49.987 --> 00:11:52.320
we need to make sure that we
make that experience better

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.070
for that person.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.230
If someone is using
bikes, we want

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.000
to be part of that
journey as well.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.500
We really literally
want to build

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.280
an efficient and reliable
mobility solution

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.140
for people in our cities.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.240
And the opportunity
is, of course, massive.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.630
This is not anything that we
had imagined five years ago.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:14.160
So every year the opportunity
somehow looks bigger.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.547
We're just waiting to see
what will be next year.

00:12:17.547 --> 00:12:20.130
Because every year we think this
is the maximum we can get to.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.510
And then somehow it
becomes even bigger.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.135
VRINDA SINGH: So from
the time that you

00:12:23.135 --> 00:12:25.650
got your first
funding, you got valued

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.820
as the unique camel
of the Middle East,

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.970
and you were valued
at over a billion.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.230
Was there a difference in
reaction by the end of it?

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.438
You were like, yeah, of
course, it's going to happen.

00:12:34.438 --> 00:12:37.290
How has the emotional
quotient and the relationship

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.320
between both of you changed
one success after the other?

00:12:44.169 --> 00:12:46.210
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: It all
happens a bit gradually.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.050
So it doesn't happen abruptly.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.570
So you're going through
it one step at a time.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.902
And you're always
very busy as well.

00:12:59.902 --> 00:13:01.120
VRINDA SINGH: You both, yes.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.382
Absolutely.

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:03.840
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA:
I think you don't

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.600
get enough time to celebrate,
enough time to reflect.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.230
So it's been gradual.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:16.080
We still feel the same
that we did five years ago.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.230
We're not necessarily
worried about the day

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.300
to day anymore like we
were until last year.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.860
Now we at least
have the opportunity

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.185
and the mental capacity
to think a bit long term.

00:13:27.185 --> 00:13:28.550
MAGNUS OLSSON: Two weeks.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.920
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: Yeah.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.787
We monitor our growth
at every 15 minutes.

00:13:34.787 --> 00:13:36.620
VRINDA SINGH: Yeah,
I've been part of your--

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.180
I think reaching 500,000
trips or something.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.260
It was a big thing.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.180
And everyone was awake
at 3:00 in the morning.

00:13:44.704 --> 00:13:46.620
So was there any part
in this journey that you

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.240
both fundamentally disagreed?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.044
And then how did
you deal with that?

00:13:52.044 --> 00:13:55.330
MAGNUS OLSSON: So I was
thinking about this.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.308
I would definitely
have disagreements.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.370
They happen quite
often, actually.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:10.010
But I think the beautiful thing,
and why I feel so blessed,

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.370
and I can speak for
Mudassir as well--

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.170
it's fascinating
that while we are

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.920
quite different
from our backgrounds

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.990
and where we come from,
we have a value system

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.600
that is very aligned.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.160
So while we might have opinions
or views or a pet project

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.220
that one of us wants to pursue
or a professional vision

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.380
this way or that way, on
values we were always aligned.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:42.320
So what happens is that even if
we have a strong disagreement

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:50.090
on a content topic, I always
value Mudassir's view,

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.090
because I know that it
comes from a point of values

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.210
and ethics.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.320
So I think we hear
each other out.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.790
Sometimes we have to say,
OK, let's take a break

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.562
and sleep on this.

00:15:00.562 --> 00:15:04.610
I think sleep on something
is good advice in general.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:12.200
But there's so much basic trust
and respect for the human being

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.290
and for the value set
that disagreements

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:23.559
on content topics, they don't
seem as big or as important.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:25.100
VRINDA SINGH: And
then when you speak

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.920
of values, that's something
that really defines Careem.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.900
And obviously, I
think everyone's

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.270
had a chat with
Careem drivers, Careem

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.070
captains at some point of time.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.130
And they all say that
you've changed their lives.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.400
And that's like Spider
Man, with great authority

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.140
comes great responsibility.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.570
How does that shape
your vision of Careem,

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.630
the future of Careem?

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.770
How does that play in?

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.390
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: I think
it's a good question.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.960
And as we were celebrating
our five years,

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.000
the one word that kept coming
back was responsibility.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.060
There are approximately 300,000
captains and their families

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.230
dependent on Careem today.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:13.820
So it's a big burden
on our shoulders.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:19.110
And we hear this from the
captains from time to time.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.970
So oftentimes when I get in the
car, and they know who I am.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.840
They pray for me and my family
that we are so grateful,

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.940
that there are so many
families, my family,

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.420
my kids are going to school as
a result of what you have done.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.970
So just as a good
reminder that there's

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:42.620
a big responsibility
towards these people who

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.780
literally have built Careem.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.500
Careem would not be
here if they had not

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.600
joined and given their
full heart and effort

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.990
to make it happen.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.080
And if you were always the
underdog in the region,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:02.150
and we have been
competing against 10 times

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.530
our balance sheet.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.480
And even on the
technology front,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.760
we have been relatively humbled.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.819
And the thing that has
really pulled us through

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.130
is the devotion
of these captains.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.660
They have given you, our
customers, a better service

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.589
compared to what the same
captains give to competition

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:24.890
because of the bond
and the emotional link

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.089
that they have with us.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:30.830
So we are super, super grateful
for their contributions

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.940
and efforts.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.060
And we want to make sure that
we can recognize it and fulfill

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.135
that responsibility
towards them.

00:17:37.135 --> 00:17:38.510
But we also have
a responsibility

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.080
towards the region we feel.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.260
Careem's mission is to build
an awesome organization that

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.850
inspires in the region.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.420
So the full mission
is, by the way,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.794
simplifying and
improve the lives

00:17:50.794 --> 00:17:53.120
of people and to build an
awesome organization that

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.470
inspires.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.430
And given how far we have come--

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.250
and it's a bit sad
that we've already

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.770
become one of the largest
platforms, internet platforms

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.400
in the region.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.500
Because I wish there
were many more.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.130
But it has happened as a result
of the whole ecosystem support

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.840
in bringing us this far.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.090
And now we have a
responsibility to the region

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:18.210
and to the ecosystem as well
to give back in some shape.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.620
So for example, I
remember a year ago

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.550
when the refugee crisis
was at its peak--

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.680
and this is such
a regional topic.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.439
There are more refugees in
this region than any other part

00:18:30.439 --> 00:18:30.980
of the world.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.890
We are the largest
contributor of refugees

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.900
and the largest
host of refugees.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.600
We actually felt that
this is a local problem

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.300
that we need to own up to
and do something about.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.290
So we partnered up
with a refugee agency,

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.500
and we launched a car
pack in all of our markets

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.330
where people could
take those trips.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.840
And then some part of that
money plus some matching

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.270
goes to the refugees.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.010
So we want to make sure that
we use our platform, our reach,

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.090
our brand to also tackle some
of the region's biggest issues.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.350
Because this is our region.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.310
We need to improve it.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.720
If you're not going to take
this on, who else will?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.970
So there is a responsibility
towards making the region

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.064
better as well.

00:19:10.064 --> 00:19:12.230
VRINDA SINGH: And then what
is the future of Careem?

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.580
And this is going to
be my last question,

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.663
and then we'll open it up.

00:19:14.663 --> 00:19:18.890
But we've heard reports of
Careem prototypes coming out,

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.680
partnerships with the
idea of you getting

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.860
into beyond the Uber
Eats type stuff,

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.530
but into more advanced stuff.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.460
So what is the vision of Careem?

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.975
Where do you see yourself
five years from now?

00:19:30.975 --> 00:19:32.850
And obviously, it's
going to be eight x that.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.090
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: So
we are thinking 2030.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.930
That's a magic
number in the region.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.590
MAGNUS OLSSON:
Everyone has a 2030.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.560
VRINDA SINGH: So
there's Expo 2020,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.419
and then there's Careem 2030.

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:48.460
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: We have
a 2020 version as well,

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.370
but it's a bit more incremental.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.730
So it's not as
crystal clear yet,

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.760
because we're still in the
process of drafting it.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:05.050
But we have a big
opportunity in the region.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.790
And there is a big handicap.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.240
And the opportunity is
one to use the internet

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.650
to leapfrog into
a better future.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:18.040
The internet is one of the best
instruments for leapfrogging.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.270
We have done this with
transportation a little bit

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.420
where it's actually more
efficient to transport people

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.740
through our type of systems
than with buses and metros.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.380
Mobile phones did that
for text telephony.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.470
E-commerce is doing this for
shopping malls and commerce

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.680
infrastructure.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.790
So we believe that
internet can be

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.975
a huge savior, can be a huge
instrument of leapfrogging

00:20:40.975 --> 00:20:41.600
for the region.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.490
And the region
needs to catch up.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.260
We have 700 million people
that live in the region.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.390
This is 10% of the
world's population.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.460
And we have not built
the infrastructure

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.876
that other parts
of the world were

00:20:51.876 --> 00:20:54.630
able to build to provide the
quality of life for the people.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.650
So we want to make
sure in some shape

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.417
or form that we take full
advantage of the internet

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:01.500
as a leapfrogging mechanism
to leapfrog the region

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.500
into a better future.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.710
So that's the opportunity.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.480
Now the bottleneck
is the following.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.450
The region is not one.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.820
It's not the United
States of America.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.420
This region is made up
of 20, 30 countries.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:22.000
And it's quite
challenging to operate

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.830
in the region in a seamless way.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.720
So you guys know this.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.800
To build internet
services like Careem,

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.490
you need certain
building blocks.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.630
You need credit cards.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.530
You need payments.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.480
You need last mile delivery.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.520
You need messaging
infrastructure.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.360
You need good maps.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.090
You need all these building
blocks that don't necessarily

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:44.330
exist in our region at the same
level of quality as needed.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.850
So what we had to
do in many cases,

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.470
we had to build
this infrastructure.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.370
We built our own places database
on top of Google, of course.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.850
We have integrated with a lot
of operators in the region

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.810
to just be able to send a
message to our customers.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.277
We've done payment integrations
with Fawry in Egypt, OneCard

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:01.735
in Saudi, someone
else in Pakistan.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.680
So the building
blocks are missing,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.660
which ends up creating
a lot more work

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.740
to build the services.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.600
And with that more work comes
more resource requirements.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.470
You need more engineers, more
product managers, more funding,

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.130
but that's not available.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.610
So there's a huge
opportunity to leapfrog.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.440
But the region, the
way it's structured,

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.898
the lack of building blocks
and the lack of building blocks

00:22:28.898 --> 00:22:31.652
that tie across the region
is hampering the growth.

00:22:31.652 --> 00:22:33.610
So we are trying to figure
out what role can we

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.540
play in bringing the cost of
launching these services down.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.170
Just like let's say Google
has done it for marketing.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.950
Start-ups can market a lot
more efficiently using Google.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:49.570
Google Cloud is doing
for infrastructure--

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:54.430
what can we do to enable
more internet commerce

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.570
to happen in the region
and over time leapfrog us

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.938
into a better future?

00:23:00.938 --> 00:23:04.126
VRINDA SINGH: Questions?

00:23:04.126 --> 00:23:07.584
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:23:07.584 --> 00:23:10.054
It's great to hear from
captains that they're

00:23:10.054 --> 00:23:14.994
very grateful for the thing
you've enabled for them.

00:23:14.994 --> 00:23:16.857
And I don't want to
ruin that in any way.

00:23:16.857 --> 00:23:19.440
What I find interesting is that
you say they're very grateful.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.910
In my experience, I see
them with two phones--

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.730
Uber and Careem.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.642
So one is, what do you think
is happening with loyalty

00:23:27.642 --> 00:23:29.109
indicating the economy?

00:23:29.109 --> 00:23:33.510
And what are you trying to do
to get people to use Careem

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.955
or captains to use Careem more?

00:23:35.955 --> 00:23:37.422
And third, do you care?

00:23:37.422 --> 00:23:39.867
Because potentially it doesn't
matter-- as long as you

00:23:39.867 --> 00:23:41.791
get enough demand
on your platform,

00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:43.290
then the captains
will automatically

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.268
steer towards Careem.

00:23:44.268 --> 00:23:47.860
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: I think
this is a good question.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.310
And I think mostly in Dubai--

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.210
Dubai is a demand
constrained market.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.560
There's not a
shortage of supply.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.950
So from a captain's
perspective, it's

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:02.490
a rational choice
to have both devices

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.530
so that it can get more work.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:09.600
So if I wear the
captain's hat, and if I

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.220
want what's best
for the captain,

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.370
then we should allow them
to have both devices.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:17.540
Over time, when we
have so much work

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.450
that they can't afford not
to have a second device,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.130
we are happy to try
and encourage them

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.130
to just have one device.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:28.660
But for now it is the
reality of the market.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.860
And I've had some captains--
this is actually very beginning

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.960
when competition was
coming to market--

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.780
this is 2013, and we have been
working with some captains

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.030
for some time.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:43.290
When competition came in, they
invited a lot of our captains.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.380
And they offered them
insane amounts of money

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.240
not to work with us.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.820
And many captains of course--
we had built that relationship

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.540
with them--

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.385
turned them down.

00:24:52.385 --> 00:24:53.760
But there were
some captains that

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.010
called me personally
and said, look,

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.539
I want to let you know
that I really appreciate

00:24:58.539 --> 00:25:00.330
working with you and
everything that you've

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.850
done for me and my family, but
I need to look out for my family

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:04.350
as well.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.330
And this is a great offer.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.060
So they were
basically grudgingly--

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.020
they didn't want to, but there
was so much money at stake.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.500
And these guys have
such low buffers

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.590
on the financial freedom
that they have to do it.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.498
And we understand
and respect it.

00:25:24.844 --> 00:25:25.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.816
So my question is
about work culture.

00:25:28.816 --> 00:25:32.696
So as you've gone through
this phase of crazy growth,

00:25:32.696 --> 00:25:36.664
many new offices,
new people, how

00:25:36.664 --> 00:25:41.376
do you or how have you made sure
that the core values of Careem

00:25:41.376 --> 00:25:43.773
live in each and
every office with each

00:25:43.773 --> 00:25:47.080
and every new employee?

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.450
MAGNUS OLSSON: It's
a great question.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.230
And it's something that
I think we are struggling

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.520
with every single day.

00:25:56.965 --> 00:25:58.590
First of all, it's
hard to just capture

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.790
the culture in something
that you can easily share.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.230
And then it's hard to spread it.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.950
Maybe a bit of a
history or context.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.920
The first thing we did on the
first day of starting Careem,

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.870
which was the first of Ramadan,
Mudassir came to my place

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.135
in Abu Dhabi.

00:26:17.135 --> 00:26:18.760
The first thing we
did was we sat down,

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.410
and we wrote our values.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:22.080
So that was the
first thing we did.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.690
And then those values
have evolved a little bit

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.370
and so has the culture.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.240
But I think at the
core of the culture

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.530
are these elements of
essentially three elements.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.230
The first element
is that we really

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.240
want to do something
meaningful, and we really

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.472
want to be of service.

00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:40.680
That is of service to our
customers, to our captains,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.040
to our fellow colleagues.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.550
The second is this sort of
crazy ambitious let's shoot

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:52.832
for the moon type of
notion that if you're

00:26:52.832 --> 00:26:54.540
going to do something,
why do it smaller?

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.500
And the third one is
the idea of ownership.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.330
We want everyone to
feel like a co-founder.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.954
We want everyone to
feel like this is--

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:03.960
Careem is theirs.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.150
You're not an employee.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.084
So we talk about this.

00:27:08.084 --> 00:27:09.250
We have our values codified.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.374
And we're going through a
values refresh right now.

00:27:11.374 --> 00:27:13.800
Because I think that as
the organization evolves,

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.680
we probably need to
polish them a little bit

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.530
or adapt them a little bit.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:23.160
We try to celebrate our values.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.210
We try as much as possible
to talk about our values

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.640
and embed them in
how we do things.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.710
I think values needs to become
part of the process as you do--

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:36.900
you want to care for the
captain first and make sure

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.420
that someone is raising
that flag every time you

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.910
meet to talk about anything.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:46.050
It gets increasingly harder
with multiple locations.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.660
I think for a relatively
young organization--

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.020
we're five years old, and we
are in 13 countries, 80 cities.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.502
We don't have
offices everywhere,

00:27:53.502 --> 00:27:54.960
I don't even know
how many offices.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.340
We have a lot of offices.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:06.340
And making sure that sort of
goes everywhere, it's tricky.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.727
We have-- I think you guys
probably do all the same--

00:28:08.727 --> 00:28:10.560
but we have weekly all
hands where we really

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.160
try to get everyone
together so that everyone

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.940
hears the same story
and the same values.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.010
But yeah, it's a
work in progress.

00:28:23.394 --> 00:28:25.560
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: This is
one of those things that's

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.987
harder than people think it
is, but it's super important.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.454
AUDIENCE: What's your view
on autonomous transport?

00:28:36.454 --> 00:28:39.816
And how is that going to affect
your captains in the long term?

00:28:39.816 --> 00:28:43.086
What's your story to them?

00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:44.669
AUDIENCE: We can't
hear your question.

00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:46.295
Sorry.

00:28:46.295 --> 00:28:47.670
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA:
So the question

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.270
was on autonomous transport
and its potential impact

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.460
on our captains.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:29:01.500
So our view is that other than
some parts of the region--

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.840
Dubai and maybe Saudi--

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.260
it's going to take a
while for it to happen,

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.280
both from the perspective
of labor is relatively cheap

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.780
and the cost of the autonomous
will be high at the beginning.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.130
And second, the traffic maybe
is a bit more unpredictable

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.580
in some cities.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.090
So the technology will
have to evolve a bit for it

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.600
to be functional.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.300
So we have a bit more time,
maybe other than one or two

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.980
markets.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.000
And for now, there is
such a huge problem

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.580
of youth unemployment
in the region

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.140
that we want to
get as many people

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.500
behind the wheel making
money as possible so

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.600
that we take them away from
other non productive pursuits.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.840
So we are purely focused on
let's create as many jobs

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.030
as we can as fast as we can.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.280
And then in parallel,
we have recently

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.700
started a social impact
and sustainability

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.190
unit which is looking
at how do we make sure

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:05.250
that the families of our
captains and the captains

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:09.420
themselves get the required
education they need so

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.040
that over time they
don't just depend

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.140
on this as a form of living.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.130
So we have done
some things already,

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.660
but some border
initiatives will come out

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.460
on the education
front for our captains

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.150
and their families
in the near future

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.432
so that they're not
dependent on it.

00:30:26.432 --> 00:30:28.432
VRINDA SINGH: So talking
about behind the wheel,

00:30:28.432 --> 00:30:32.300
does the Saudi women driving,
how does that affect you?

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.705
Is that going to affect you?

00:30:33.705 --> 00:30:36.350
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA:
This is great news.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.240
This is great news.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.370
We are all very excited.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:44.010
Despite many people feeling that
we will be negatively impacted,

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.340
we just believe that, one,
this is the right thing to do.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.280
And we should just always
be on the right side.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.380
And second, more
practically, this

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.480
is just going to create a more
open and more mobile society.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:03.190
And this will benefit us
tremendously in the long run.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.745
But we have celebrated
that announcement.

00:31:05.745 --> 00:31:09.000
MAGNUS OLSSON: We hope that the
first woman driving in Saudi

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.320
would be a captain.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.202
VRINDA SINGH: That
would be amazing!

00:31:13.202 --> 00:31:15.640
MAGNUS OLSSON: But
the numbers are huge.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.690
There's estimates that about
somewhere between 2 and 1/2

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.080
and 3 million women
in Saudi today

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.360
would want to be part
of the workforce,

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.460
but they are not because
they don't have a way

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.404
to get to and from work.

00:31:28.404 --> 00:31:29.820
We are trying to
do our bit there,

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.520
but this is going
to be a huge step.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.274
VRINDA SINGH: Game changing.

00:31:35.274 --> 00:31:38.004
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question with respect

00:31:38.004 --> 00:31:40.434
to the Emirates here.

00:31:40.434 --> 00:31:42.864
Do you have Emirates drivers?

00:31:42.864 --> 00:31:46.020
MAGNUS OLSSON: So
in the Emirates,

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.880
I would say all our captains
are ex-pat captains.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:58.030
We have one friend, Emirates
pilot, who drove for a day

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.310
to show that this is
actually something great.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:05.120
But I think, obviously, in
other countries it's different.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.200
But one example that
is quite remarkable

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:13.770
is about a year and
a half ago in Saudi,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.540
all our captains in Saudi, they
were ex-pat captains as well.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.210
And the idea that a
Saudi would be a captain

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.300
was almost unthinkable.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.150
And I think it was
unthinkable both

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:31.800
for there was some stigma
around driving as a profession.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.070
And there was also some
cultural considerations

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:38.460
about having a Saudi man in the
same car as a Saudi woman who

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.650
was our primary customer.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:45.960
So that was an almost
unthinkable thought.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.000
And then a few things happened.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.690
We realized that if we
wanted to continue growing,

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.290
we needed to get more captains.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:33:01.110
And there were a lot of Saudis
that were prime candidates.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:06.250
Economic times
with low oil prices

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.280
also created a need
for a lot of people

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.460
to have additional income.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:17.820
And then our sort of continuing
spreading the message that you

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.020
can be your own entrepreneur.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.470
So we finally started
getting a few Saudi captains.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.100
But we saw in the beginning
that it was not really

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:26.940
socially acceptable.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.830
Cancellation rates
was higher when

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.270
customers got a Saudi captain.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:36.120
And so this experiment, we were
like, let's see how this works.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.430
And now a year
and a half later--

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:42.850
I don't know the latest number,
but 95% of our customers-- so

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.100
basically all our growth
over the last year and a half

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.650
has been Saudi captains.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:54.460
So witnessing that social
change over a year and a half,

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.530
it's just completely remarkable.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.775
So we have to push a
bit on this in the UE.

00:34:00.775 --> 00:34:02.650
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: And
I think in some markets

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.770
we've also seen it's a
relatively conservative part

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:06.980
of the world.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:12.159
So a lot of men have
never been in such close

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:16.414
proximity with a girl that
was not their mother, wife,

00:34:16.414 --> 00:34:17.770
or sister.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:22.370
So it is creating some
interesting dynamics as well.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.389
They get in the car,
and some of these guys

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:28.179
don't know how to react.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:33.580
And sometimes, very
non-intentional gestures

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.710
can be seen as threatening.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:40.139
So because of this
social change that

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.500
is unraveling, as
a result of it,

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.690
we're having to change
the more basic things.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:49.000
These are the words that
you use to address a female.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.100
This is something
that you cannot do.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.159
And it's only they are
doing this out of malintent.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.114
They don't know.

00:34:55.114 --> 00:34:59.170
They've never been in that
position, in that situation.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.690
It's fascinating the
kind of social change

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.655
that is happening to society.

00:35:03.655 --> 00:35:06.160
MAGNUS OLSSON: And then just
as recently as today, we

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.380
have this week the all hands.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.520
And in every all hands we try
to have a captain be part of it,

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.180
either in the office
or as some other part.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.790
And today we had two
female captains who

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.850
joined us from Tanta in Egypt.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.152
And it was mother and daughter.

00:35:22.152 --> 00:35:25.300
And they were both driving for
Careem, using the same car,

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.654
doing different shifts.

00:35:26.654 --> 00:35:27.820
And they were super excited!

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:36.280
And they spoke to us about how
this is changing perception.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:42.834
And that it's a great way for
people to enter the workplace.

00:35:42.834 --> 00:35:44.500
And because it's
flexible, you can do it

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.430
at your own time and
your own boundary.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:50.410
So it's exciting
what's happening.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:52.580
AUDIENCE: Were they
driving in Egypt?

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.121
MAGNUS OLSSON: Yeah,
in Tanta in Egypt.

00:35:55.121 --> 00:35:56.775
VRINDA SINGH: You
had a question?

00:35:56.775 --> 00:36:00.735
AUDIENCE: It all looks
to me like smooth sailing

00:36:00.735 --> 00:36:05.190
after almost five years,
very rosy and beautiful.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.170
I'd be interested to
hear about the toughest

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.150
moments in the past five years.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.120
At what point maybe you
thought about quitting?

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.810
Or maybe you don't
have such moments,

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.185
but what were the toughest
moments for each of you?

00:36:21.437 --> 00:36:23.020
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: I
think the question

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.423
is which ones to start with?

00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:25.660
MAGNUS OLSSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:26.870
It's never a smooth ride.

00:36:31.985 --> 00:36:33.390
There's been many tough moments.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:45.310
I think the obvious ones are
raising money in the region.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:46.205
It's not easy.

00:36:46.205 --> 00:36:47.690
It's still not easy.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:52.910
But I think every round of
funding we have raised, A,

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.434
it took a very long time.

00:36:54.434 --> 00:36:58.210
And we were so out of
money, at the brink

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:00.670
of survival, every single time.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.440
And in the early
days, we could maybe

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.773
plug it by putting a little
bit of our savings in there.

00:37:04.773 --> 00:37:07.960
But then as you grow bigger,
you don't have enough savings

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.850
to plug the hole.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.160
And the feeling
of responsibility

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.940
for our colleagues, for our
captains, for our customers,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.110
and realizing that, man,
what's going to happen?

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.720
That's been tough, stressful.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.740
But not necessarily
feeling, hey,

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.270
we're going to quit doing this.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:29.980
But that stress has been
intense over the years.

00:37:35.005 --> 00:37:37.590
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: I
think that's funding.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:42.011
I had more funding
related stresses as well.

00:37:42.011 --> 00:37:43.800
MAGNUS OLSSON: I also think--

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.770
if I may continue--

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:51.180
think the first time we
had a fatal accident in one

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:51.750
of our cars.

00:37:55.582 --> 00:37:57.290
The first time was
actually a captain who

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.970
was not on a ride with Careem.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.520
But he was a Careem captain who
he was doing something else.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.740
But he had an accident, and
unfortunately he passed away.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.380
And then it just gets very real.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.550
We look at all these
growth dashboards--

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.330
and we care a lot
for our captains.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.705
We spend a lot of
time with them.

00:38:14.705 --> 00:38:18.950
But that was a moment of,
wow, this is really real.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:24.530
And are we doing everything
we can to keep our customers

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.970
and captains safe?

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.815
So yeah, that was
a tough moment.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.600
VRINDA SINGH: Any
other questions?

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.265
Yes, please?

00:38:36.265 --> 00:38:37.889
AUDIENCE: I just want
to know, starting

00:38:37.889 --> 00:38:39.790
from UAE, what's
your relationship

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.870
with the government, RTA?

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:42.623
Where is it going?

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:52.310
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA:
Overall, our relationship

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.640
with most governments
is very healthy.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.580
It doesn't always
start healthy, but I

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.070
think after we explain to
them the benefits that we

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.410
can bring to the cities
and the countries,

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:07.540
it becomes much better.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.560
But at the very
fundamental level,

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.840
as we discussed
a bit earlier, we

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.600
are building the
public transport system

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.930
in the cities, which in
most cases doesn't exist.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.450
And there's a big need to
build that infrastructure.

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:23.300
And the governments don't
have the physical space

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.650
in many cases to build it.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.740
So they recognize the
value that's being added.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.412
And second, unemployment is
a huge issue in most markets.

00:39:31.412 --> 00:39:32.870
And when they start
looking at some

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.300
of the numbers that
have been done already

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.360
or some of the numbers
that can be done,

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.770
then they turn around
that perspective.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.740
Now, of course, there are some
vested interest in every city.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:49.740
In some cities there are larger
vested interest than others.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:53.630
But for the most part, we're
not disrupting anything.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.760
If you think of it,
we are filling a void

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.840
that existed in our markets.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.820
So in most of our markets,
there weren't buses, metros,

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.760
or even big taxi systems before
we entered those markets.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.970
So we're really enabling
it for the first time

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.180
versus disrupting.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:14.540
So in the UAE, we have a good
relationship with the RTA.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:19.040
We were the first ones to
sign up to be regulated.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.570
We've done the same in Saudi.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.750
We're doing the same in
Egypt, Pakistan, Jordan.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:27.770
So we do recognize
that what we are doing

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:31.280
is important enough that
it needs to be regulated.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.340
And we just want to make sure
that the regulation does not

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.217
stifle innovation
and does not stifle

00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:39.550
growth of this platform and
the impact that we can make.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.190
AUDIENCE: Have you considered
having a loyalty program?

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.676
And if yes, why don't
you yet have it?

00:40:53.084 --> 00:40:55.250
MAGNUS OLSSON: Have we
considered a loyalty program?

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.525
Yes!

00:40:55.525 --> 00:40:56.983
AUDIENCE: Just a
little background,

00:40:56.983 --> 00:40:59.776
because I use Careem, like,
three times a day maybe.

00:40:59.776 --> 00:41:02.261
And every time I ask
myself why the users

00:41:02.261 --> 00:41:03.752
don't have a loyalty program.

00:41:07.602 --> 00:41:11.170
MAGNUS OLSSON: I think
it's a great question.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.740
I think it's a matter of
having the resources to make

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.350
it happen.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:21.984
As you guys know, it takes a lot
of great minds to build stuff.

00:41:21.984 --> 00:41:23.400
And there's so
many things we need

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.000
to build, even in the core.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.700
Like our captain app needs
to get so much better.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.480
Our customer app
needs some polish,

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.577
our core sort of
marketplace engine

00:41:32.577 --> 00:41:33.660
that does the dispatching.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.320
So it's definitely
something that we

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.970
would love to look at and do.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:42.090
We recognize the value
of loyal customers.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.737
I think this sort of stop
gap that we have been doing,

00:41:44.737 --> 00:41:46.320
as you know, is that
we have partnered

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.940
with a few other
loyalty programs.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.954
So that you can both
earn points with them,

00:41:50.954 --> 00:41:52.620
or if you have points
with someone else,

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:56.100
convert it into Careem,
put it into your wallet

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.630
and use Careem.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.354
But yes, it's on the long list.

00:42:01.354 --> 00:42:02.270
VRINDA SINGH: Perfect.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.780
One last question?

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.740
AUDIENCE: So you
talked about building

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.190
an awesome
organization, but you've

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.640
had some challenges and
some very public challenges

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.110
with certain hires.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.560
What have you learned
from that, and how do you

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.030
maintain at the top?

00:42:31.989 --> 00:42:33.780
MAGNUS OLSSON: When we
think about building

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.170
an awesome organization,
what does that mean?

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:40.020
And I think Mudassir has
this inspirational vision

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.220
of building an institution--
an institution that actually

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.120
produces world class parts and
services, an institution that

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.530
cares for the community, an
institution that will outlast

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:53.812
us and everybody else.

00:42:53.812 --> 00:42:55.270
And there's a fourth
dimension of--

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.905
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA:
Leadership factory.

00:42:55.905 --> 00:42:56.300
MAGNUS OLSSON: Yeah.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.680
An institution is a company
that actually produces leaders.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.500
So people will come
to Careem for a while,

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.610
whether they stay for
a year or 10 years,

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:05.870
or they will graduate and go
out and do other amazing stuff.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:06.480
Like Google.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.479
We look up to Google being
a leadership factory.

00:43:08.479 --> 00:43:10.907
Now, how do you
make that happen?

00:43:10.907 --> 00:43:12.490
And I think it's all
about the people.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:17.250
And it's about
making sure that you

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.520
have a 100% alignment
on the values of what

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.020
you're trying to do.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.060
I think that's the
biggest learning.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.460
And that you have
it particularly

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.636
with the leaders that are going
to influence a lot of people,

00:43:30.636 --> 00:43:32.760
that you have an alignment
on what's the culture we

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.410
are aspiring to create here.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:35.250
What does that mean?

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.570
What does what it not mean?

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.400
And there's no rights
and wrongs on culture,

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.670
but I think we are starting
to have a pretty strong view

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.890
of this is the culture we want.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:49.772
And it will not
work for everyone.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.506
AUDIENCE: If you think about
creating another business,

00:44:00.506 --> 00:44:01.994
which one would it be?

00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:13.884
VRINDA SINGH: 2040.

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:15.300
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA:
Let me go first.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.880
For me, it would be
a school, education.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.082
It's what the region needs most.

00:44:22.082 --> 00:44:23.790
And I think we'd love
to figure out a way

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:27.330
that we can educate more and
more people in the region

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:31.155
to go out and realize
their full potential.

00:44:31.155 --> 00:44:33.630
There are a lot of
intrinsic abilities

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:38.130
that are not getting the
right polish and impact.

00:44:41.118 --> 00:44:43.530
VRINDA SINGH: Magnus,
are you still thinking?

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.120
MAGNUS OLSSON: Yeah.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:50.340
I think if I knew that I
wanted to do something else,

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.400
then I would not be
at Careem anymore.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.960
Because then I would
go pursue that.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.019
Because I am of the
belief that if you

00:44:58.019 --> 00:45:00.060
know what your purpose
is, you have to follow it.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.440
You cannot waste your
time doing something else.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.550
So for now, I feel
what we're doing--

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.050
and we're just
starting-- but I feel

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:11.280
that using the
platform of Careem

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.675
to continue to improve
people's lives.

00:45:13.675 --> 00:45:15.300
And transportation
is one where there's

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.091
a lot of adjacencies
that we are looking at

00:45:17.091 --> 00:45:18.510
and that we'll follow.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:27.630
So it's still on the path
of online to offline.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:30.600
We're creating income,
generating opportunities

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.130
for people.

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.630
That's amazing.

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:35.880
We're not entertaining people.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.250
We're allowing people
to make a living.

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:42.090
And I'm super
excited about that.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:45.810
VRINDA SINGH: Thank you so much
for taking time out and talking

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.652
with us.

00:45:47.652 --> 00:45:50.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.440
We have a small
something for you.

00:46:05.545 --> 00:46:06.920
MAGNUS OLSSON:
Thank you so much.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.700
MUDASSIR SHEIKHA: Thank you.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.100
Thank you very much.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.446
SPEAKER: I was really hoping
that they were giving us

00:46:10.446 --> 00:46:11.910
the next business ideas.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:14.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:16.940
MAGNUS OLSSON:
And I think also--

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.100
I know Neil was
traveling, I think,

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.130
from the very early days.

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:25.310
We have had a lot of support
from you guys as well.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.830
There were early days
when we might have used--

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.730
this should probably
be off record--

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.600
where we might have had
some slightly hacked version

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.600
of some API key.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.820
And we always got the
support to make sure

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.466
that we could be up and
running and continue to run.

00:46:40.466 --> 00:46:42.590
Even when we had to call
in the middle of the night

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.020
to wake up people
and get support.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.915
