hi the three greatest threats to the

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689
hi the three greatest threats to the
 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.230
hi the three greatest threats to the
recovery of the economies around the

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240
recovery of the economies around the
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.299
recovery of the economies around the
world and hollering the first one is

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309
world and hollering the first one is
 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.339
world and hollering the first one is
trade protectionism and its impact

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
trade protectionism and its impact
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.740
trade protectionism and its impact
around the world whether the fit for the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
around the world whether the fit for the
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.780
around the world whether the fit for the
production of them for countries around

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790
production of them for countries around
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.790
production of them for countries around
the world is going to lead to more and

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
the world is going to lead to more and
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.250
the world is going to lead to more and
more trade wars that's number one the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
more trade wars that's number one the
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.160
more trade wars that's number one the
second one is are the key economies

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
second one is are the key economies
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.220
second one is are the key economies
around the world doing enough pause the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
around the world doing enough pause the
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.050
around the world doing enough pause the
financial crisis how we take an

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
financial crisis how we take an
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.070
financial crisis how we take an
effective and sufficient steps to

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080
effective and sufficient steps to
 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.269
effective and sufficient steps to
counterbalance the negative effects of

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
counterbalance the negative effects of
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.970
counterbalance the negative effects of
the of the recent financial downturn the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980
the of the recent financial downturn the
 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.620
the of the recent financial downturn the
third point that I would raise is the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
third point that I would raise is the
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.290
third point that I would raise is the
increase in commodity prices especially

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
increase in commodity prices especially
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.930
increase in commodity prices especially
oil and gas that can have an effect

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
oil and gas that can have an effect
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090
oil and gas that can have an effect
effect and the last point that I want to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
effect and the last point that I want to
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.790
effect and the last point that I want to
highlight is that while gdp growth and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
highlight is that while gdp growth and
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400
highlight is that while gdp growth and
emerging markets are much much higher

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
emerging markets are much much higher
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.889
emerging markets are much much higher
than developed economies capital flows

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
than developed economies capital flows
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.170
than developed economies capital flows
are still flowing from the East the West

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
are still flowing from the East the West
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.900
are still flowing from the East the West
so I'd say these are both key points

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
so I'd say these are both key points
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.110
so I'd say these are both key points
that hinder the recovery of economies

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
that hinder the recovery of economies
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.510
that hinder the recovery of economies
around the world
