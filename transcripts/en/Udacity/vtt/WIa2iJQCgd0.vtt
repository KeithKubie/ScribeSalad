00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.410
In distance vector routing, each node sends

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.730
multiple distance vectors to each of its neighbors,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.400
essentially amounting to copies of its own routing

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.490
table. Routers then compute costs to each destination

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.950
in the topology, based on shortest available path.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.704
Distance vector routing protocols are based on the

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:22.060
Bellman-Ford algorithm. A node x's forwarding table is

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.120
based on the solution to the following equation.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.440
Suppose that node x is trying to find a shortest cost route

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.820
to node y. In this case note X is trying to find a path through

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.550
some intermediate node, V, that minimizes the cost between X and

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.430
V, and the already known shortest cost path

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.440
between V and Y. Again the solution to this equation for all

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.950
destinations, Y, in the topology is X's forwarding table. Let's now

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.800
take a look at distance vector routing by way of example.
