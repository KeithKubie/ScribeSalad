00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.040
A crucial aspect of advancing medical science is the use of the clinical trial.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.880
&gt;&gt; Now a clinical trial is a series

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.220
of tests that's used to determine the safety and

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.690
efficacy of any kind of medical intervention. Like a,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.310
a drug, a diagnostic test or a therapy protocol.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.050
&gt;&gt; You know, genetics, including personal genetics really has shaped

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.750
the way that we design and carry out clinical trials.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.170
&gt;&gt; And designing clinical trials is a new and emerging field as medical

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.360
genetics moves forward and expands. And you don't even need

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.259
an advanced degree or a degree in genetics to do it.
