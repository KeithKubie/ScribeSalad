00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.100
The base unit for distance in
the metric system is the meter.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.340
And to get a sense of how long
a meter is, the average human

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.010
being is between 1.5
and 2 meters tall.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.340
So 1.5 meters would be
a not-so-tall person,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.220
but 2 meters would
be quite tall.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.100
In fact, if you're 2 meters
tall or above 2 meters tall,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.080
you might want to
consider basketball.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560
So, for example, in this
drawing right over here

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.620
by Leonardo da Vinci, if this is
an average-sized male, a meter,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.470
it would be more than half
way across his wingspan.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.390
So it might be about that much.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.610
And obviously, I am just
roughly drawing this,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.280
just to give you a sense of
how far a meter might be.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.470
And I just wrote
a lowercase m here

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.640
as really just a short
way of writing meter.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.790
So you could imagine
that the smaller

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.150
things you might want to
measure with the meter

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.570
are things like a human
being-- a human being's

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.117
height or a human
being's wingspan.

00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:04.700
If you wanted to say, well, what
are some of the larger things

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.533
that you would want to
measure with a meter,

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.100
you might imagine something
like the height of a skyscraper.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.690
So this right over here is
the Empire State Building,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.390
at one time the tallest
building in the world, now just

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.180
a tall building in the world.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.580
And this is 443 meters tall.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.130
So this is starting to be on
the larger scale of things

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.000
that you would want to
measure with a meter.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.100
Now you're probably
asking, well,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.766
what happens if I
want to measure things

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.960
that are even larger than that?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.970
Well the metric
system provides us

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.140
prefixes to essentially
say multiples of meters.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.020
And the unit of distance that
is larger than the meter that

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.800
is most typically
used is the kilometer.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.735
I've heard a few people say
"kill-O-meter," but kilometer,

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:52.580
I'll pronounce is
"kuh-LAW-me-ter,"

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.290
which is equivalent
to 1,000 meters.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.550
And so when you're
thinking about kilometers,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.220
this is thinking about the
distance within a city.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.490
This would be even the distance
from one city to another city.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.260
Even the radius of the planet
is often measured in kilometers.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.040
And to once again get a sense
of that, this right over here

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.660
is a map of New York City.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.690
And right over here
they give us the scale.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.410
This distance right over
here is 5 kilometers.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.230
So 5 kilometers just to
give us a sense of things--

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.890
and they wrote km
for short so 5 km.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.070
This lowercase k, lowercase m is
just shorthand for kilometers,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.040
this would be equal to-- well
if 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.220
5 kilometers is going
to be 5 times as many.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.641
It's going to be 5,000 meters is
this distance right over here.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.390
If you were to try to
imagine 1 kilometer,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.760
it would be 1/5 of that.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.600
So 1 kilometer on this map
might look something like that.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.340
Now there's other units
in the metric system that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.259
allow us to describe distances
less than a kilometer but more

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.800
than a meter.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.300
But they're not
as typically used.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.530
But I'll list them here, just
so that you see that they exist.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.722
You have the "hect-O-meter,"
or "heck-TOM-eter"--

00:03:19.722 --> 00:03:22.180
it's so infrequently used that
I really haven't heard a lot

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.430
of people say it-- which
is equal to 100 meters.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.410
And you have the "DECK-a-meter"
or "deck-AM-eter,"

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.600
and I actually think
it's "DECK-a-meter."

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.627
Dekameter, which is 10 meters.

00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:37.210
And I'm going to
write these in orange

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.830
because they're not
that frequently used.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.540
For example, it's
not typical to hear

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.140
someone say that the Empire
State Building is 4.43

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.750
hectometers or for them to say
that this is 44.3 dekameters.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.360
They would typically say
that this is 443 meters.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.830
Now you're probably saying,
OK, well, this is fine.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.830
Using these prefixes
on the meter,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.740
I'm able to describe
distances that

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.020
are larger than a meter,
that are multiples

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.570
of tens of the meter
or a multiple of 100

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.120
or a multiple of
1,000 of the meter.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.750
But what if I want
to go smaller?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.680
Well, the metric system
has units for that.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.730
And if we go just
1/10 of a meter,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.490
this is not used as
typically, but I'll

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.640
write it here-- the decimeter.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.040
The decimeter is
1/10 of a meter.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.090
Or another way of
saying it is 1 meter

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.010
is equal to 10 decimeters,
lowercase dm for short.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.300
Once again, this is
not so typically used.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.010
But if we go one
scale even below that,

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.865
we get to the centimeter,
which is a heavily used unit.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.490
And here, the prefix
centi means 1/100.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.250
So this is 1/100 of a meter.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.540
Another way of thinking
about it-- 1 meter

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.100
is equal to 100 centimeters.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.500
And if you wanted to imagine
the scale of a centimeter,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.350
you could imagine this
frog right over here

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.790
on this person's hand might
be several centimeters long.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.730
So a centimeter on this drawing
might be around that distance.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.130
Now if you want to measure
things even smaller than that,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.085
we have another
fairly common unit,

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:21.210
and that is the millimeter.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.670
And the prefix milli
here refers to 1/1,000.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.970
So it's 1/1,000 of a meter.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.980
Or another way of thinking
about it is 1 meter

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.650
is equal to 1,000 millimeter.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.569
Actually, let me just
write m for short,

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.360
just so we used to also
seeing it that way.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.640
1 meter is equal to
1,000 millimeters.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.550
And if you wanted
to imagine how long

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.570
or how far a millimeter
is, you could go down

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.861
the scale of things that are
smaller than a centimeter.

00:05:56.861 --> 00:05:58.330
So these ants,
for example, might

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.990
be 3 or 4 millimeters long.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.310
So a millimeter in this
drawing right over here

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.370
might be something like that.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.940
The important thing to realize
or just to conceptualize

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.190
is you might want to use
different units depending

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.840
on the scale that
you're measuring.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.150
And it's also useful
to just realize

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.300
what these typical prefixes
refer to because we're

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.160
seeing it used in distance here.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.430
They're all based on the
base unit of distance.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.970
But when we're measuring volume
or we're measuring other things

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.984
in the metric system, these
same prefixes also show up.

00:06:30.984 --> 00:06:32.900
So you see here when
we're measuring distance,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.570
kilo refers to 1,000.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.290
A kilometer is
literally 1,000 meters.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.820
Hecto refers to 100.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.880
A hectometer-- 100 meters.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.650
Deka refers to 10.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.060
Deci refers to 1/10.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.810
So decimeter, literally
1/10 of a meter.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.390
Centimeter-- 1/100,
1/100 of a meter.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.532
Milli refers to 1/1,000.
