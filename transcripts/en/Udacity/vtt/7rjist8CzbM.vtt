00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yes, so that was one thing that was interesting that we learned on Reddit over the years.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the beginning it just had a small amount of content,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but as we grew the content kind of turned into two flavors.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Not just hot versus saved but was kind of new versus old.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If you go to your profile page, that content isn't accessed very often.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Before we did the precomputing thing, the hot pages were highly optimized.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The queries were fast. Everything worked nicely. It was cached perfectly.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But somebody will hit a user page that hadn't been accessed in a month.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
All of a sudden it's just stale, cold data, it's not in the cache and the whole system just like chugs to bring that out.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's when we started precomputing those and you guys are taking it to the next level. &gt;&gt;Right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
One thing that we actually do there is there's a special-- comment is the really bad one.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There's just so many comments, so much data and those databases get overloaded,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
especially when you pull up an old comment page from two years ago,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and nobody's seen it in like 3 months and it has to load

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
500 comments and that's a disk hit for every one of those.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We actually have a dedicated comment slave that is just for the likes of Google.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This a whole separate stack for Google, right? &gt;&gt;Yeah, and it's read-only.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Yeah. I would draw a picture, but basically--I think we started adding this just as I was leaving.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There's a whole separate set of databases and app servers, maybe one app server-- &gt;&gt;Two or three.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
A couple of app servers that's just for Google,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
because Google will come through and index everything.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Reddit gets a lot of traffic these days from Google.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You can take any two or more combination of the front page of Reddit.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Do a Google search for it and it will be in the top 10.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And enough of those, Google is just murdering Reddit.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So we had to build a whole separate infrastructure just for Google,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
because they hit the site in a completely different way from users

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
in a way that it's really hard to cache for.
