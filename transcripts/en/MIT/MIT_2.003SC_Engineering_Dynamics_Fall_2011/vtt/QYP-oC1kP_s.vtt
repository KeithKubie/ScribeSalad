00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:23.670
PROFESSOR: In a
minute, we're going

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.430
to go through this exercise
of key concepts for the week.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.220
But for you early
birds, I'll offer,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.070
and we may get to some of this.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.130
Is there just something from
the weak or the problem set?

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.820
Just some topic that's
still bugging you

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.420
that you just
don't get and you'd

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.170
like me to put on a little
list and I might get to it?

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:50.436
AUDIENCE: So if we
solve for velocity,

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:51.882
is it enough to
just take the time

00:00:51.882 --> 00:00:53.810
derivative of that velocity.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.410
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.770
So if you have all of the
terms, the full velocity

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.110
expression in vector
notation, and you

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.520
want to know the
acceleration of that point,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.560
just take the derivatives taking
care of all the rotating unit

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.929
vectors and all that stuff.

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:14.429
Yeah?

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.720
AUDIENCE: When you take the
derivative of the velocity,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.057
where does the Coriolis
term drop from?

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:21.790
PROFESSOR: Where
does it fall out of?

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.410
PROFESSOR: I can't
answer it in words.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.070
I can't remember exactly.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.610
But Coriolis term--
curiously, it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.370
comes from two different places.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.380
It's two omega v
rel kind of term.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.720
And actually, it comes
from two different places

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.916
when you grind out the
derivatives of the velocity.

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:49.862
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:54.592 --> 00:02:01.930
PROFESSOR: So in terms of using
the general-- so I remember.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.980
Now what I want you
to do and, partly,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.820
what this session
is going to do is

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.930
get you to use the
acceleration formulas enough

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.380
that you have those just
committed to memory.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.620
Now we're going to let
you have crib sheets when

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.450
you go into quizzes.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.658
And I would always have the
velocity and acceleration

00:02:16.658 --> 00:02:21.320
formulas in polar coordinates
and in full vector form.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.260
If you identify each
of the terms correctly,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.880
that formula will
work just fine.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.020
Getting the right
components of rotation rates

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.560
can be a little
tricky, as you might

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.920
have found in that homework
problem from this week.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.440
In that time derivative
of a rotating vector,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.360
the omega cross the vector.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.250
What omega is that?

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.390
That's tricky.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.170
That you have to
be careful with.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.537
But really remember.

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:50.870
If you remember the velocity
and acceleration equations,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.050
you can trust them.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.490
They will work.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.270
So OK, we can start now.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.015
And I'll go back to here.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.440
So take that minute,
like we did last time.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.700
Write down on a piece of
paper two, three, four.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.200
What you think are
the key concepts

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.030
that were important
in the past week.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.290
By important, you need to
know them to do a good job

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.340
on the quiz coming up.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.750
Important concepts.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.546
OK, let's make a list.

00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:31.212
AUDIENCE: Did you say
polar coordinates?

00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:33.296
PROFESSOR: Polar coordinates.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.340
And I'm going to
generalize that to call

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:47.050
it choosing coordinate systems.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.030
There's an art to that.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.639
So when you to use them.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.930
It's [INAUDIBLE] of that, yeah.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.305
AUDIENCE: The equation
for some of the parts?

00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.400
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.720
The torque equation.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.897
Some of the external
torques vectors is dh/dt.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.144
And torques are always
with respect to some point.

00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:20.690
So dh/dt.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.680
Angular momentum is with
respect to some point.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.220
And there's a second
term to this, though.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.580
And it is velocity of the
point in the inertial frame

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.570
cross the linear momentum
in the inertial frame.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.020
That one, you haven't
had to use much yet.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.561
But that's one of the two
really important Newton law kind

00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:49.060
of things that we
use in the course.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.350
Sum of forces equals
mass times acceleration.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.800
Sum of torques equals that.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.574
OK, I have another one.

00:04:55.574 --> 00:04:57.562
AUDIENCE: Derivative of
rotating unit vectors.

00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:59.550
PROFESSOR: Derivative
rotating vectors.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.260
And taking derivatives rotating
vectors always boils down to,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.040
eventually, it's down to you
got to do the unit vector.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.130
So that's part of it.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.046
How about another one?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.020
PROFESSOR: OK, so I'll
generalize that to,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:45.740
essentially, being able to
find equations of motion.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:06:05.410
So from sum of forces
and-- all right.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.580
OK, anything else?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:26.615
I'll tell you one really
important one that you've been.

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:29.930
Maybe you think we
did it last week.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.620
I'd say being able
to find accelerations

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.500
and moving coordinate systems.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.410
We did mostly
velocities last week.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.650
But finding velocities
and accelerations

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.555
in rotating and moving frames.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.540
OK, so that's a
pretty good list.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.370
[INAUDIBLE] ask me what I
thought the important things

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.350
from the week were?

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.065
That hits the important stuff.

00:07:17.065 --> 00:07:17.565
OK.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.140
What we were talking about
as people were arriving is

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.410
and I might not get this
today if we run out of time.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.243
But does anybody just
got a burning question

00:07:30.243 --> 00:07:33.902
about some concept that
just didn't work out for you

00:07:33.902 --> 00:07:36.310
or a problem set that came up?

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:36.810
Yeah?

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.792
AUDIENCE: The derivatives
for [INAUDIBLE] vectors

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:43.271
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:47.831
PROFESSOR: So that's really
the derivative of rotation rate

00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:48.330
vector.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:48.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.840
PROFESSOR: That was,
kind of, a nasty problem

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.280
the first time you hit that.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.300
That was new, right?

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.510
Let me write that one down.

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:08.920
And rotating frames
and all that.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.420
I get it.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.747
Does somebody else
have another one?

00:08:10.747 --> 00:08:12.496
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
of that. [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:12.496 --> 00:08:15.494
just like which omega is it
when you're looking [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:16.202
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:08:16.202 --> 00:08:17.150
Oh, yeah.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.100
Right.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.300
OK, anybody else a
burning question?

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.160
I think I'm actually
going to start there.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.040
We're going to spend just
a minute on this one.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:37.039
And as an example problem
yesterday in the lecture,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.450
I basically did the same.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.970
I had a rotor here.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.789
It could have a disk on
it just to make it clear.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.360
So this thing is
rotating at some omega 2.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.790
And it was on a merry go
round going at some omega 1.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.400
And I'll pick at
coordinate system here.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:05.020
I think it was yxz that I
wrote in the lecture notes.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.440
And that's the rotating one.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.660
So you have an o and an a here.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:17.875
And you have a fixed
frame that but the y

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:19.980
ones, the little ones,
attach to the platform.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.330
It's going around.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.410
OK?

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:29.060
So the rotation rate of
the platform here is what?

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.670
In magnitude and unit vector.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.470
Pardon?

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.750
Mega 1 k hat.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.760
And does it matter which k
because they're parallel.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.460
So the little k and the big k.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:10:01.190
OK, what's the rotation
rate of this shift,

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.740
in terms of a magnitude
and a unit vector?

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.324
AUDIENCE: Omega 2
lower case y dot.

00:10:07.324 --> 00:10:08.282
PROFESSOR: OK, omega 2.

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:14.310
And I'll call it at j1 here.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.710
It's hard to distinguish
my handwriting on the board

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.050
between uppers lowers.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.590
So with z1's, x1's.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.565
OK, so it's in the
J1 direction, right?

00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:26.440
And I've just intentionally
made it positive.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.810
If it were in the other
direction, have a minus there.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:37.290
OK, so now at the
end, the problem

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:43.520
asked for the time
derivative of the rotation

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:50.320
rate of the spinning.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.510
The problem that
in the homework,

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.000
this thing was actually
inclined, basically.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:09.090
It's easy to just say the total
rotation rate of the shaft.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.590
Let's get that settled first.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:15.770
In the fixed inertial frame,
the total rotation rate of this

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.102
is what?

00:11:17.102 --> 00:11:19.026
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:19.026 --> 00:11:21.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and you
can sum rotation rates.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:30.100
So it's omega 1 k
hat plus omega 2 j1.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.540
And I want to take the time
derivative of this omega chafed

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.040
total.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.430
So it's d by dt of these things.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.210
So I can start to do that.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.990
So d by by dt is, in this
case, is k change a direction.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.260
No problem.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.610
Could that change?

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.230
Could it?

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.284
Yeah, sure.

00:11:55.284 --> 00:11:56.950
I mean, it could be
accelerating, right.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.990
If it is, then you
get a term here

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:04.530
that comes from this one that
would be an omega 1 dot k hat

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.030
plus.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.036
And now we need to take the
derivative of this piece.

00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:09.012
All right.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.600
And that's now a
rotating vector.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.040
And we've said that the
derivative of any rotating

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:28.180
vector dq dt is the derivative
of t as if the rotation is 0.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.200
It's its magnitude increasing,
not its direction changing.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.670
Plus omega cross q.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.790
And I've intentionally left
sub-scripts and server scripts

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.540
off here because
that's the issue here.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.270
Which ones go where?

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.650
All right, so this is
what we need to apply

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.430
to taking that derivative.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.790
We took this derivative
and found this term

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.370
was what gave us the omega 1.k.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.687
And when taking derivative of
this, what was the answer here?

00:13:04.687 --> 00:13:05.312
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:13:05.312 --> 00:13:08.649
PROFESSOR: Zero because the
rotation rate is omega 1.

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:09.440
You're crossing it.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.785
Well omega 1k crossed
with omega 1k.

00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:12.760
That goes with zero.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.520
There's no change in direction.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.680
So we applied this
formula once to this.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.140
Now we're going to
apply this formula here.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.910
So I'll do it this way.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.170
So this is term one.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.250
Term one gave us this.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.560
Term two is going
to give us this.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.820
So take this.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.270
Take the derivative of--
where we go here-- this guy.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.430
Now when I say
this is the-- it's

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.520
the partial derivative
of this thing,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.990
ignoring the contribution
from the change of direction.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.610
So it's as if some
rotation were zero.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.785
Which rotation?

00:13:57.785 --> 00:13:58.284
Right.

00:13:58.284 --> 00:13:59.188
AUDIENCE: Omega 1?

00:13:59.188 --> 00:14:01.090
PROFESSOR: Omega 1.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.350
Good.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.538
So what is the answer to this
piece of that derivative?

00:14:07.538 --> 00:14:08.442
AUDIENCE: Omega 2.

00:14:08.442 --> 00:14:14.980
PROFESSOR: Omega 2
dot what direction?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.110
Same direction, right.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.300
Now we want to apply this piece.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.050
So now the question comes
down plus some omega

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.622
cross with the q.

00:14:23.622 --> 00:14:25.600
And what's the q in this case?

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.270
Two.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.620
So this is omega 2 j1 hat.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.560
That's coming from here.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.410
That's what this piece is.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.200
So now we need what's
crossed with it.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.042
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:45.042 --> 00:14:45.625
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:47.080
AUDIENCE: Omega [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:57.415 --> 00:15:03.290
PROFESSOR: I'm trying to think
of a clear way to help you.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.780
What is causing its
direction to change?

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.470
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.130
That's the one you care about.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.500
What's causing its
direction to change?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.320
What's causing this
thing to come up?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.920
And its direction is changing
because the platforms

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.040
are moving.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.110
So it's omega 1.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.740
K cross j.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.323
So k cross j gives you?

00:15:31.323 --> 00:15:33.207
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:33.207 --> 00:15:39.320
PROFESSOR: K cross j negative i
1 in the rotating frame, right.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.650
So this whole thing.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:50.180
Omega 1 dot k plus
omega 2 dot j1 plus.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.680
No, this is a minus, actually.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.160
We said, minus omega 1.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.320
Omega 2.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.690
K cross j is i 1 hat.

00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:03.330
OK?

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.360
And finally, how do
you deal with the fact

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.760
if this rotor had been
on an inclined angle?

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.740
Some phi, which now this
is the exact problem

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.570
that was on homework.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:23.630
So propose a way
of attacking that.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.984
Changes this problem
just a little bit.

00:16:26.984 --> 00:16:29.604
AUDIENCE: Can you change the
reference frame [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:29.604 --> 00:16:31.770
PROFESSOR: No, you don't
change the reference frame.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.330
You still have a
coordinate system.

00:16:35.914 --> 00:16:37.330
Work with the
coordinates you got.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
to its components?

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.672
PROFESSOR: In which
reference frame?

00:16:44.672 --> 00:16:45.604
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.090
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
moving [? one. ?]

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.798
That makes it easy
because this thing now

00:16:48.798 --> 00:16:53.260
has a vector omega 2 like that.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.310
And you can break it up
into a piece like that

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:56.660
and a piece like that.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.590
So now this is phi.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.480
Omega 2 cosine phi
is the side, right.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.900
Omega 2 sine phi is that side.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.369
What direction is it?

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.069
What's its unit
vector direction?

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.020
This piece.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.740
AUDIENCE: K?

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.099
PROFESSOR: K, OK.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:18.191
And we're going to end up
crossing it with this term,

00:17:18.191 --> 00:17:18.690
right.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.540
So k cross k.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.160
Nothing.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.250
So in fact, this bit
doesn't change in direction

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.020
as it's rotating.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.690
Does it?

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.660
So it isn't going to
contribute to that second term.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.070
Only piece you have to be
concerned with is this one.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:38.350
So down in here in this
part of it, all you would do

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.370
is say omega 1 k cross.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.440
And now you just put
in the q full omega

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:54.630
2, which is omega 2 sine
k plus omega 2 cosine.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.410
Sorry about the writing here.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.534
And do the cross product.

00:17:58.534 --> 00:17:59.950
You find out that
term disappears.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.830
And you get an omega
1 omega 2 cosine.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.480
And this term here
is still the answer.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.560
But you end up with
a cosine phi in here

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.330
because it's just the
component of omega 2 that's

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.730
in the j1 direction
now that contributes.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.140
OK, great.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.260
Good.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:22.800
That help?

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.570
I'll leave this.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.320
Let's get on to the
problem for the day.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:39.180
The problem for the day is
you've got a rotating arm.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.230
You have a mass sitting on it.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:46.190
The arm is rotating at
some rotation rate omega.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:52.220
You might have an acceleration
omega dot theta double dot.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.950
This mask can slide.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:08.190
So the problem is this
thing is-- I'll start here.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.430
So it's rotating like this.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.670
And eventually, the
thing begins to slide.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.590
And in fact, if I
do it, this actually

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.580
works a little better
here because I have

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.950
a little tiny groove in this.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.030
It helps a little bit.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.320
So it's rotating like that.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.570
It eventually begins to slide.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.630
And if the rotation rate
is slow, it slides down.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:33.710
If I made the rotation rate
fast enough, it slides up.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.740
And the angle at which
it happens clearly

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.920
depends on rotation rates,
accelerations, the angle,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.570
friction coefficients,
and things of that sort.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.520
So what I want you to
start with is here's,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.490
basically, a drawing of it.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:57.060
And I don't want to give
you any excess information.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.710
But what I want you to do
is each, by yourselves,

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.180
take just a minute,
and draw a free body

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.126
diagram of this problem.

00:20:05.126 --> 00:20:07.500
And then, after that, I'm
going to have you get in groups

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.280
and improve on it.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.270
But start yourself.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.990
Draw a free body diagram
that will describe

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:17.755
this mask on this thing, plank.

00:20:17.755 --> 00:20:25.537
OK, we've got a sketch with a
little free body diagram on it.

00:20:25.537 --> 00:20:27.120
What I want you to
do now, we're going

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.630
to do this two or
three times today.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.640
Get in groups of four five here.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.040
Compare notes, and come up
with a group free body diagram.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.795
So you're pretty close.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.100
Let me look.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.890
Where was your guys
solution again?

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.890
There is maybe about
as good as it gets.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:02.590
So here's our mass.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.630
I think everybody had an mg.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.340
Almost everybody
had a normal force.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.120
Everybody had a friction force.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.770
Some discussion about what
direction the friction force

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.330
ought to be in.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.980
I'll draw it uphill here.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.100
And I'll call it ft
for tangential, here.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.900
So some had about that much.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.690
There's a very important
missing piece, which

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.340
actually several groups had.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.670
What is that?

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.281
Can anybody guess what I'm--
three of your groups had

00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:47.280
something on here that I
don't have up here yet.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.756
I hear coordinates.

00:21:52.756 --> 00:21:54.130
This one, you can
almost get away

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.254
with not putting it in the
coordinate system first.

00:21:56.254 --> 00:21:59.330
But you, usually, need to have
a coordinate system in order

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.455
to determine the
direction of the forces.

00:22:01.455 --> 00:22:02.560
OK?

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.660
And we'll get to
that in a second.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.505
So everybody that I saw
had written down, I saw,

00:22:09.505 --> 00:22:12.380
a number of the little x,
y, z frames sitting out here

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.160
like that.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.270
Maybe one was lined up.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:16.820
Not sure.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:17.460
Most not.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.780
Most like this.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.720
Is polar coordinates a good
choice for this problem?

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.076
Why not?

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:25.022
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:32.840
PROFESSOR: So the question is
whether or not r theta and z

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.920
can completely describe
the motion in the problem.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.560
AUDIENCE: You have
tangential forces,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.634
so it's better if
you use rectangular.

00:22:42.479 --> 00:22:43.895
PROFESSOR: The
radius is changing.

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:46.490
But that's known as r dot.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.790
r dot can handle the
motion to this this way.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.880
r double dot can handle
acceleration this way.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.320
Theta dot can
handle this motion.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.690
Theta double dot can
handle that acceleration.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.350
Actually, is there any
z motion or z-forces?

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.000
No.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.875
Actually, the polar
coordinates will actually

00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:04.550
work here just fine.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.430
So you definitely have to
pick a coordinate system.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:13.490
So we're going to have an
that system and theta hat

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.850
in this direction
because in this problem,

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:23.910
whether you use x and y as a
rotating frame here or r theta,

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:29.050
you want to pick your coordinate
system so that these things

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.620
break down easily.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.950
In this case, the
normal equation

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.680
will be in the
theta hat direction.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.400
The sliding direction will be in
just one unit vector direction.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.280
So you don't have multiple
components in this direction.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.490
If you use that coordinate
system to describe this motion,

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:46.660
you have x and y terms.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.500
It makes it harder.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.610
So this is a pretty good
coordinate system to use.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.060
So that's a really
important missing piece

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.460
is the coordinate system,
if you don't have it.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:03.400
And as an aside about free body
diagrams-- free body diagrams,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:09.870
except my d is
turned around-- how

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.375
do you know that the friction
force is in that direction.

00:24:13.375 --> 00:24:14.770
You had to assume something.

00:24:18.126 --> 00:24:20.500
This is such a trivial problem
you can kind of figure out

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:20.832
in your head.

00:24:20.832 --> 00:24:21.970
I gave the demonstration.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:22.690
It slid down.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.460
But also, I said , you do
it fast enough, it goes up.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.840
So you don't really know.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.530
So you have to have made
an assumption about it.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:45.590
So the general rule
is to assign or assume

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:59.170
positive values for all motions.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:08.105
And then, you deduce
the direction of forces.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.420
And I'll take another
quick aside here

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.070
to illustrate this in a
problem that works better

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.530
than the current one for this.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.330
An obvious coordinate system
for this little mass on rollers

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.170
inertial frame.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.820
Here's an x.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.360
And I asked you to do a
free body diagram of that.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.390
Well you would show
me a normal force.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.510
You'd show me an mg.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.290
But now I ask you to
tell me the direction

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.530
to draw the spring force.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.450
So if you adopt the
rule that for each body

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.770
you're working with, you
assume that it has positive x,

00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.000
positive x dot, positive
y, positive y dot

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.139
then you can deduce what
direction of the forces

00:26:03.139 --> 00:26:04.180
would result [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:08.900
So in this case, the only motion
that generates a force up here

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.966
is what?

00:26:10.966 --> 00:26:12.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.990
PROFESSOR: Is x. x
dot. x double dot.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:19.890
The only motion that
will generate a force

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.470
is displacement because it
generates a force where?

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.464
In the spring.

00:26:24.464 --> 00:26:25.880
If they add a dash
[? pod ?] here,

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.570
them velocity
generates a force, too.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:34.840
But displacement, if you assume
the displacement is positive,

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.670
then which direction
is the spring force?

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.100
OK, so then you have
spring force this way.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.691
And that's value kx.

00:26:43.691 --> 00:26:45.690
And when you write it in
the equation of motion,

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.750
you put a minus sign to
account for the direction

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.780
of that error.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.130
OK.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.280
So in this problem we
kind of-- and if you ever

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.376
do it wrong, if you pick
this direction wrong,

00:26:57.376 --> 00:26:58.500
what happens in the answer?

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.500
Will you still get
the right answer?

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.020
If you're consistent, you'll
get another negative sign

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.370
popping up to fix it.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.870
OK.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.060
Next.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.060
So I think we're
in good shape now.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.010
I'm going to draw the
friction force uphill

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.610
because I'm going to assume this
thing's going to slide down.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.070
And I'm going to simplify the
problem a little bit for you.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.450
And I'm going to
say that there's

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.260
no angular acceleration.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.250
Constant angular rate.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:31.820
The distance that the mass
starts off up the slope

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.190
is at one and a half feet.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.440
So it's going up like this.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.290
And it, eventually,
reaches 50 degrees.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.210
And at 50 degrees, it
begins to slide downhill.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.660
So it's going up a constant
rate and starts to slide.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.160
So there must be some
friction coefficient

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.430
that provides a system
with a property such

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.540
that it slides at 50 degrees.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.220
So the problem here is define
the coefficient of friction.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.840
So now you're in your groups.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.070
Solve the problem.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.840
And what I really want you to do
is come up with an expression.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:13.562
mu equals in variables
and constants.

00:28:13.562 --> 00:28:15.270
Don't bother plugging
in numbers in that.

00:28:18.825 --> 00:28:20.950
Well if you're comfortable
using polar coordinates,

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.074
that'd be the way to do it.

00:28:22.074 --> 00:28:23.890
But you need to write
some equations now.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.800
And I suggest you need to
think in terms of equations

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.700
[? in ?] motion.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:33.420
I think it's time to come back
together here and work on this.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.040
Two, three, or four groups are,
sort of, struggling with this.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.340
And it's because
you're not really

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:51.440
going to first principles and
doing the problem step by step.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.530
You're, sort of,
jumping to the answer

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.350
because it's a trivial, simple,
Mickey Mouse problem that you

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.030
did in high school.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.674
So I'm, kind of, pounding
on you a little bit.

00:29:03.674 --> 00:29:05.590
We give you a simple
problem so we can do them

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.330
in a short period of time.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.980
But you need to learn to
do them in the rigorous way

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.030
so that you learn the real
fundamental stuff that you

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.860
have to know.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.750
So none of you-- you all
are sort of thinking about,

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.250
well, we got sum
of the forces here.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.080
We've got an acceleration there.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.180
But nobody is just
sitting down and saying

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:31.370
that some of the forces
is equal to the mass

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.490
times the acceleration and
working the problem out.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.550
OK, bad dog.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.960
Just because this problem is
almost the statics problem

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.870
doesn't mean you-- when
things are statics problem,

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.620
it just means that
acceleration goes to 0.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.270
And the sum of the
forces is now 0.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.350
And you solve the problem.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:59.410
Start with Newtons, in this
case, it's Newtons second law.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.640
It helps to know an
expression for acceleration,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.410
so you don't have
to grind it out.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:08.510
So polar coordinates works
pretty well in this problem.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:14.480
And I want you to commit
to memory two acceleration

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.500
equations.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.430
One in polar coordinates, and
the one the general vector 1.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:22.640
So in polar coordinates,
the one that I memorize

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:32.180
is a with respect to o plus
r double dot minus r theta

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:44.060
dot squared r hat plus r theta
double dot plus 2 omega r

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:48.040
dot theta hat.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:53.500
Coriolis, Eulerian centripetal,
and your linear acceleration.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.780
What's this term?

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.938
What's it doing there?

00:30:58.938 --> 00:31:00.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:04.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but the
reason I remember it is,

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.230
in this course, we break
down every dynamics problem

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.710
we're confronted with
into sub problems that

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:17.240
can be solved as the
sum of a translation

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.210
of a body plus a rotation.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.720
So this expression
allows you to write down

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.090
the acceleration of a
point on a body, which is

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:31.080
both translating and rotating.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.800
What this term accounts for.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.770
The acceleration
contributed by what?

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.430
So I've got this
general-- let's see.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.570
I got a merry go
round that's on wheel

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.970
and is rolling along here.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.235
And I have an inertial frame.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.970
And I got a point a here.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:59.460
But now I've also
got a system in here,

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:04.880
which I'm describing with an
r theta connected to this.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.530
Thing can have
translational acceleration.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.182
That's that term.

00:32:09.182 --> 00:32:10.890
This problem doesn't
happen to have that.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:11.880
It goes to 0.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.090
In this problem, that's a 0.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:21.160
In this problem, we can
now apply this equation

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.510
to that problem.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.665
How many sub equations
are we going to get?

00:32:30.212 --> 00:32:30.920
And why no three.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.735
AUDIENCE: But I said two.

00:32:32.735 --> 00:32:34.270
PROFESSOR: I know you said two.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.978
But I'm asking why not three.

00:32:35.978 --> 00:32:37.730
AUDIENCE: Because
[INAUDIBLE] theta.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:42.670
PROFESSOR: And a z, which you
need because it describes theta

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.100
dot.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.372
So you have a z direction.

00:32:46.372 --> 00:32:48.830
But is there any forces in this
problem in the z direction?

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.710
Are there any accelerations
in the z direction?

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:51.950
No, so you get a
trivial answer there.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.533
So you could just
write that one down.

00:32:53.533 --> 00:32:55.100
Mass times acceleration
equals zero.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.016
And there's no forces.

00:32:56.016 --> 00:32:57.810
So there's three
possible equations.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.590
Only two of them are
meaningful in this problem.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:04.240
And we have one that we can
summon the that component

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.210
and one in the theta hat.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:11.200
So the sum of the forces
in the theta hat direction

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.445
for this problem are what?

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.170
From your free body diagram.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.295
AUDIENCE: The normal force?

00:33:22.295 --> 00:33:24.520
PROFESSOR: The normal
in the positive theta

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.218
hat direction and?

00:33:26.218 --> 00:33:28.658
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:28.658 --> 00:33:32.930
PROFESSOR: Minus mg.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.840
And I think it's
[? percosen ?] theta.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.200
And that's your theta hat.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.580
And what is the acceleration
in that direction?

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.920
Well you go to
acceleration formula.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.550
And now it's inspect the terms.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:51.920
This one is 0 because
the platform is fixed.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.850
r double dot?

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.730
0 because we're just waiting.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.170
It's just trying to calculate
when it begins to slide.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.490
r theta dot squared.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.010
Not 0.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.172
r theta double dot.

00:34:06.172 --> 00:34:06.880
Well it might be.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:11.389
But I said omega
dots 0 constant.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:13.320
So that one's 0
for this problem.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.500
And this term, Coriolis.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.521
0 because our dot is 0.

00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:22.604
We're really treating this
like a statics problem.

00:34:22.604 --> 00:34:24.110
It hasn't started to move yet.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.800
So we're only left
with one term here.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.040
So the sum of the forces in
the normal direction, which is

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.300
the theta hat direction are 0.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.764
And that allows us to
solve for the normal force.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:48.739
So you need Newton's law to find
the normal force to start with.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:51.480
And you need the normal force
to find the friction force.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:57.610
So now let's do the sum of the
forces in the that direction.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:01.200
And maybe, let's do
the acceleration first.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.930
It's the mass times
the acceleration

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:08.090
in the that direction.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.500
And that's the mass.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.210
And now, what's
the acceleration?

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.480
These are the r directed terms.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.430
We have one term, right.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.150
Minus r theta dot squared.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:27.520
No other terms.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.270
And those are going to be
equal to the external forces

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.270
in the radial direction.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.520
And what are they?

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.786
From the [INAUDIBLE] diagram.

00:35:36.786 --> 00:35:39.719
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:39.719 --> 00:35:40.760
PROFESSOR: Plus or minus?

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.752
AUDIENCE: Plus.

00:35:41.752 --> 00:35:44.360
PROFESSOR: Plus mu n.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:49.370
But we know n is
mg cosine theta.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.480
OK, what else?

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.250
Minus mg sine theta.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:58.956
All right.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.060
You know everything
in this expression.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.330
You know given theta dot.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.585
You're given r.

00:36:13.585 --> 00:36:15.580
You know mg.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.130
You know [INAUDIBLE]
given theta.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.950
You could solve this
expression for mu.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.150
All right?

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:31.970
And the mg goes
to the other side.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.710
And you have a minus
r theta squared.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.810
Notice the M's cancel all
the way through, right.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:47.450
So mu would looks
like it equals, to me,

00:36:47.450 --> 00:37:04.860
g sine theta minus r theta dot
squared all divided by what?

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.320
g cosine theta.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.720
Break these two
apart, this gives me

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:29.180
a tan theta minus r theta
dot squared over g QoS theta.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.870
That has units of acceleration.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.540
g has units of acceleration.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.592
This is dimensionless.

00:37:33.592 --> 00:37:36.430
The answer has got
to be dimensionless.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.780
So there's your answer.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.410
But you really had to use
the equations in motion.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.020
OK now there's
another thing I want

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.130
to dress because I heard it
pop up two or three times.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:55.860
Do not confuse
accelerations with forces.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.050
Newtons second law
makes it really clear

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.870
where each one goes.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:04.310
The sum of the external forces
go one side of the equal sign.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:08.610
The mass times the
acceleration goes on the other.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.290
Don't get the two mixed up.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.100
Solve for the
accelerations, if you can.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:15.750
Plug them in.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:16.880
And multiply them by mass.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.620
And now you have that
one side of the equation.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.970
The free body diagram.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:27.760
The only vectors that should
show up on a free body diagram

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.330
are what?

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.180
AUDIENCE: Forces.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.580
PROFESSOR: Forces.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.030
The real forces in the problem.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.540
So in that problem
that free body diagram,

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:42.340
there is no r theta
dot squared term.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.270
It doesn't belong there.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.430
And it'll keep you from
making these sign errors

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:47.370
and things like that.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:50.020
So the business about
this thing comes up minus

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.574
because it's minus right out
of the acceleration equation.

00:38:54.574 --> 00:39:05.825
All right, what would happen
if I had not made the-- we're

00:39:05.825 --> 00:39:06.450
a go?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.615
This term 0.

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:15.190
I allow this to have some
angular acceleration to it.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.720
That's what's got to happen to.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.990
Well you don't have to do it.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.350
I can't do it constant rate.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.910
But if you can make this
constant rate fast enough,

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.750
it goes up.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.100
So even if it's constant
rate fast enough,

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.470
this thing will slide up
the thing, immediately,

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.052
when you start it.

00:39:35.052 --> 00:39:35.760
Almost immediate.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.885
You start down here, the g.

00:39:36.885 --> 00:39:38.360
The friction force
is pretty high.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.190
And the friction
force, of course,

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.564
diminishes as you
get further up.

00:39:40.564 --> 00:39:44.210
And eventually, it
takes off, right.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.750
That's because
that minus r theta

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:50.681
dot squared, that's a
centripetal acceleration

00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:51.180
inwards.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.080
And if you don't
provide the force that

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.720
causes that centripetal
acceleration to happen,

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.600
it says, it says I
want to leave town.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.570
Now how about, though, if I had
angular acceleration, as well?

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.900
If I allow angular
acceleration to this problem,

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.310
how does it change the two
equations that we wrote?

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.020
What does it change?

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.490
Does it change the forces?

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.360
Does it change the
free body diagram?

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:16.910
Not a bit.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:20.530
It changes the acceleration side
of the equation and what term

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:26.340
it now turns up that
you didn't have before.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:26.960
This one.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.100
So now you have a dynamic term
in the theta hat equation.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.620
And it comes into
this expression

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.070
for some of the forces
in this direction.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:42.110
And you would end up equals
to m r theta double dot.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:45.680
Now it's a entirely
different problem.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.650
It gets a little
harder to solve.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:54.450
OK, but really good
fundamental practices.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:55.830
f equals ma.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.780
And write out both
sides carefully.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.810
And then, you won't make
sign mistakes and so forth.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:01.440
Thanks.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.430
Good to see you.
