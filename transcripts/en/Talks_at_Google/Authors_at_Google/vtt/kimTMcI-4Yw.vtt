MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
to "Talks at Google."

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.010
Please join me today in
welcoming Bay Area journalist

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.160
Marina Krakovsky, the author
of "The Middleman Economy."

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.850
Just published.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
Marina's writing has appeared in
"The New York Times Magazine,"

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.960
"The Washington Post,"
the "Stanford Magazine,"

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.730
"Scientific American,"
"Discover," "Psychology Today,"

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.690
and "Slate."

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.690
Marina was also a researcher
for Eric Schmidt and Jonathan's

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.910
book, "How Google Works."

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.650
Marina has earned
a BA in English

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.420
from Stanford University.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.031
Thank you for coming
to Google today.

00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:39.197
MARINA KRAKOVSKY: Thank you.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.970
All right.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.960
So I'm here to tell you
that we are all middlemen.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.950
I'm a middleman.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.780
You guys are middlemen.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.650
And what I will say
is why I say that.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.040
And also, I'll give you
ways to think about how you

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.820
could be a better middleman.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.610
So if we think back to the day
when the internet was still

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.620
in its early years
and people were all

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.220
trying to figure out what's this
going to mean for all of us,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.670
a lot of people were saying that
the internet's radical ability

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.970
to connect everybody would
make middlemen obsolete.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.190
Bill Gates actually wrote in
his 1995 book, "The Road Ahead,"

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.320
that the internet itself would
become the ultimate go-between,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.600
the universal middle man.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.130
He foresaw a time in the
future when we wouldn't

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.680
need to turn to middlemen.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.840
We would be able to do our own
buying and selling directly.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.250
But if you look
around 20 years later,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.730
you see, very clearly, that
that actually has not happened.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.960
In fact, I'll argue that
the opposite has happened.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.610
That the internet has made
middlemen more prevalent

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.430
and more valuable.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.050
So look at the biggest
players on the internet.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.910
eBay and Amazon are
middleman businesses.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.150
Uber and Airbnb are
middleman businesses.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.980
Google is a middleman business.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.610
Right?

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.480
And I'm not just talking
about tech giants.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.790
I'm also talking about
individual middlemen

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.990
who are thriving thanks to
the tools of the internet.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.750
So think about eBay.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.210
Anybody can buy
and sell directly

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.370
through eBay being a middleman
but most of the trade on eBay

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.580
actually flows
through resellers,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.040
through trusted
middlemen on eBay.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.170
And on LinkedIn, something
very similar happens.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.130
It's all about the recruiters.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.730
Recruiters bring in more
of LinkedIn's revenue

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.330
then all the other
LinkedIn users combined.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.640
So the internet clearly
didn't do away with middlemen.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.620
It's actually made them
more efficient, and often,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.760
more effective at what they do.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.720
So I've been thinking
for a very long time

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.500
about what is the deal
with middlemen, basically.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.040
I mean, it's so strange.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.140
Middlemen have been a part of
every society that I know of.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.840
Throughout history
we've had middlemen.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.820
And yet, people have often had
very strong negative feelings

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.930
about middlemen,
feelings of resentment,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.310
anger, contempt,
sometimes even disgust.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.420
And, at the same time,
middlemen are still there.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.490
Or to put it another
way, if people

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.380
are so eager to
eliminate the middlemen,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.360
why have we never
been able to do so?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.885
These are the driving
questions behind my book

00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:57.510
and that those are the questions
that I really tried to answer.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.090
So I talked to economists and
psychologists and sociologists

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.960
who think about such issues.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.960
But also with
ordinary-- or you might

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.020
say extraordinary--
middlemen, people

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.960
who I think do a great job
and are doing just fine--

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.270
thank you very much-- in
the age of the internet.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.290
So it's people that you might
expect, like real estate agents

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.040
and travel agents
and car dealers.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.640
But also people that
it might take you

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.120
a moment to realize that
they are middlemen, too.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.460
So, for example, gosh, a
wedding planner is a middleman.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.840
If you pause to think
about that, right?

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.740
A venture capitalist
is a middleman.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.130
A person who started a two-sided
market, like Open Table,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.770
that's a middleman.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.860
There are middlemen all over.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.680
Gallerists are middlemen.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.350
Anytime you're dealing with any
kind of broker, dealer, anybody

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.430
who's connecting two groups
of people, that's a middleman.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.940
And what's interesting
from talking

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.870
to all these different people
is that even though they're

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.460
from different industries,
you start to see patterns.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.640
You start to see what
they have in common

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.076
that is making them as effective
and successful as they are.

00:05:14.076 --> 00:05:16.200
And that's sort of what I
started to do in my book,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.110
is to tease out those
commonalities that

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.870
are true everywhere.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.670
And although all the examples
that I use throughout the book

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.880
and throughout my
presentation will

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.550
be of professional
middlemen-- people who

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.180
identify as middlemen
in their jobs--

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.130
I do believe that all
of us are middlemen,

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.630
at least in some area of our
work or in our personal lives.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.970
So what do I mean
by a middleman?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.610
I think we all have an
intuition about this.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.750
And we think of a middle
man is the person connecting

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.900
two groups of people or
two individuals, the person

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.070
in-between.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.700
But I want to give you a more
useful definition that explains

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.850
what middlemen actually do.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.770
And this definition
comes from a man

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.400
named Mike Maples, Jr. He's
a venture capitalist here

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.850
in the valley.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.640
Started a fund called Floodgate
that was an early investor

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.540
in Lyft and TaskRabbit--
middleman businesses--

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.960
as well as, of course,
other start-ups.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.350
And he says this.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.700
A middleman is the
person in a network who

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.840
connects nodes in the
network to increase

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.560
the value of the network.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.530
I think it's a
useful definition,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.830
and I'm going to talk a lot
more about what that means.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.620
But I also want to
acknowledge that middleman

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.470
is a sexist word.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.810
I realize it's a sexist word.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.820
And I'm using it despite
that because I really

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.870
think no other word will
capture what I'm trying to do,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.140
which is really push
against these cultural ideas

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.070
about middlemen.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.270
You know, that word has
these strong connotations.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.465
We just don't hear
people saying,

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:07.730
ah, let's cut out
the intermediary.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.670
It's really about the middleman.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.270
So forgive me for
using that word.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.600
There's a reason.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.580
So going back to this
idea that middlemen

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.650
are people who we increase
the value of a network

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.640
by connecting nodes.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.790
I do think it's a
really helpful start,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.150
but it's not a
complete definition.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.870
And the reason it's not complete
is that not all connectors

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.060
are of equal quality.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.560
Right.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.020
We know that.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.150
And if you think
about Metcalfe's law--

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.590
I would guess everybody in
this room knows what that is.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.890
Metcalfe's law, this
provocative claim

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.410
that the value of a
network grows quadratically

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.310
with the number of
connected users.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.080
Well, that may not be true.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.430
It may be true sometimes.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.560
It's certainly not true
for every additional user

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.590
you add to a network.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.266
And if you think about it
in terms of middlemen--

00:08:04.266 --> 00:08:06.390
or if you think of it in
terms of any kind of user,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.960
actually-- if you have a
network that has a certain value

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.730
and you take out
some of those nodes,

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.100
sometimes taking
out a single node

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.060
will just decimate the network.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.250
It'll radically decrease
the value of the network.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.870
And sometimes taking
out a node will

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.240
have almost no effect at all.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.860
And sometimes taking
out a node will actually

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.680
increase the value
of the network

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.539
because some of these
connectors are actually

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.250
having a net negative effect
on the value of a network.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.230
So if you think
about spammers, that

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.700
would be an example of
something like that.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.010
So it is really
important to think

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.850
about connectors' quality.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.820
But how do you think
about connectors' quality?

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.625
What is it that defines
the quality of a connector

00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:55.010
or of a middleman?

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.630
And the way I find it
useful to think about it

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:03.090
is in terms of these
two dimensions.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.760
One is warmth, and the
other is competence.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.890
Warmth and competence.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.670
And these are specialized
terms that social psychologists

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.080
use when they're talking about
how we judge other people.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.370
So this isn't just
true about middlemen.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.570
This is true about human
judgment in general.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.600
When we meet
somebody, we quickly

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.760
evaluate them based
on our perceptions

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.680
of the person's warmth, which
is all about their intentions.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.320
Are they friend or foe?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.590
Are they on my side or not?

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.070
And competence, which
is a separate issue.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.980
And that's really
all about the ability

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.710
to deliver on those intentions.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.340
Those are totally separate.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.260
And if you combine
them, you quickly

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.830
generate this nice
two-by-two matrix

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.430
with four possible combinations.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.910
And I want to talk
through each of these

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.380
so you know what
I'm talking about.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.790
I think that these
labels that I've come up

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.862
with really capture
some of the emotion

00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:02.320
and some of the
ambivalence that we

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.331
have about middlemen because
middlemen are not all created

00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:05.830
equal.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.660
They really vary in quality
across these two dimensions.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.760
So clearly, the
worst type is the one

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.210
I call the parasite
person, who is

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.896
low in warmth and competence.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.470
After the financial crisis
of 2008, a lot of people

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.017
put the bankers on Wall
Street in that quadrant.

00:10:26.017 --> 00:10:27.600
They've actually
done studies on this,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.360
and companies like
Goldman Sachs and AIG

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.940
landed squarely in that
cold, incompetent quadrant.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.220
We don't need to
say much about that.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.970
What's more interesting
is these ambivalent cases.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.710
So, the predator-- the person
who is competent, but really

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.110
doesn't have your
interests at heart--

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.210
this is the person
that we tend to resent.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.280
And I don't know about
you guys, but this is how

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.840
I feel about my cable company.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.850
They're competent.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.990
They're able to deliver high
speed internet and video

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.040
to my home.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.720
But clearly, they don't have
my best interests at heart.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.930
They seem to be taking advantage
of their monopolistic power

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.980
for their personal
gain, not for us.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.900
They have high prices,
terrible customer service.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.240
All of that makes me think that
they're not warm at all, even

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.860
if they're competent.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.050
Now the pet is maybe a little
bit better because they're

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.300
at least on your side.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.270
But unfortunately,
they can't really

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.210
deliver on those
good intentions.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.290
And, to my mind, a
good example would

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:39.370
be the stereotypical
mom-and-pop shop.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.669
So the service might
be really slow.

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:44.960
You might have to place a
special order and wait for it

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.930
to be delivered.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:47.910
The prices are high.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.990
But it's not because
they're trying to gouge you.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.823
They're not trying to
take advantage of you.

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:53.100
They really mean well.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.220
They just can't do any
better, unfortunately.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.730
And this sort of person
evokes feelings of pity.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.280
So you might patronize
a store like that

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.200
because you feel bad for them.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.330
But if the difference
in price, or quality,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.240
speed, and all those
sorts of things--

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.817
if that difference grows
to a certain point,

00:12:12.817 --> 00:12:14.150
you're going to give up on them.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:18.520
You're still going to go with
the retail giant instead.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.580
So clearly, the best type
of middleman to deal with

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.790
is the partner.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.960
Both warm and competent,
they have your best interests

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.750
at heart.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.920
And they're really
able to deliver

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.010
on those good intentions.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.190
So I think everybody wants
to deal with a partner.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.950
And everybody should
want to be a partner.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.650
And way to think
about being a partner

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.490
is going back to this
idea of increasing

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.250
the value of a network
by connecting nodes.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.970
What partners are
able to do is they're

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.710
able to increase
the size of the pie.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.940
And then take as their
slice-- you know,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.760
their markup, their
commission, their fee.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.030
And after they take that slice
for creating that extra value,

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.660
you still feel like you are
way better off than if you

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.250
hadn't partner with them.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.230
And so being a partner puts
you in a very strong position

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.000
because people really want
to do business with you.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.690
They're not just doing
business with you

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.430
because they feel sorry for
you or because they currently

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.270
don't have any alternatives,
but because you really

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.280
are providing a
great value to them.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.680
So this is my foundation
for everything

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.920
I'm going to say today.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.050
We've got this idea of a good
middleman, the admirable kind

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.950
of middleman as a partner.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.410
They create value.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.190
You appreciate them.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.240
And then the question
becomes, well,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.100
how exactly do
they create value?

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.560
This is a very fuzzy
notion of creating value

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.760
by connecting
nodes in a network.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.130
What is it that
they're doing exactly?

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.240
And this is really what
most of my book is about.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.150
I distill it into six problems
that middlemen solve--

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.980
that good middlemen solve.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.760
And I think that you will all
find yourself in a middleman

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.700
position at some point.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.730
And I hope that as I
continue discussing

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.810
what these middlemen
do, you'll see, yeah,

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.990
sometimes I do that in my work.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.880
Or I see somebody
else doing that.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.150
And maybe I should be
doing more of this.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.130
I hadn't thought of that.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.860
And that's the idea anyway.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.430
So what do middlemen
do to create value,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.800
to be a valued partner?

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.720
Well, the very first
problem that they solve

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.420
is what I call the
problem of distance.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.409
Distance can take
many forms-- well,

00:14:39.409 --> 00:14:40.950
three forms that I
talk about anyway.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.130
There's physical, you
know, geographic distance.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.620
That's pretty obvious.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.930
But you can also have temporal
distance and social distance.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.016
So with physical
distance, it's two people

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:55.560
who would both benefit from
doing business together--

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.760
some kind of trade-- but
they're just too far apart.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.270
And the merchant steps in
and connects them that way,

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:02.950
indirectly.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.420
With temporal distance,
we don't usually

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.680
think of middlemen this way.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.376
But that's actually
what a lot of them do.

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:14.540
So my favorite example of
this is an appliance flipper

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.849
on Craigslist.

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:18.640
I'm sure you guys have
all used Craigslist.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.010
What this guy does is he's like
a super user of Craigslist,

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.280
a power user of Craigslist.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.710
He's just constantly
on the site.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.320
He knows all about the prices
for the kinds of products

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.660
that he buys and sells
because he has to.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.980
He lives off of that difference,
that markup between what he

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.920
buys for and what he sells for.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.700
So he'll buy a used
washer or dryer for $50.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.984
That's the price
he's aiming for.

00:15:45.984 --> 00:15:48.025
He'll do that on Saturday,
take the appliance off

00:15:48.025 --> 00:15:49.380
of somebody's hands.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.960
He'll quickly turn around
and post that same listing

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.030
on Craigslist and then sit and
wait and does his other work,

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.300
and sits and waits
until somebody

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.500
can match his
asking price, which

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.710
is typically $250 or $300.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.550
And then when that
person comes back--

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.300
it might be a couple
days later-- he

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.000
sells it to them for
that higher price.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.850
So they're a bridge in time.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.100
They're a bridge between
the seller on a Saturday

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.180
and the buyer on a
Monday or Tuesday.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.620
Social distance, this
is another problem.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.730
And this is really the
biggest problem of all.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.390
And it presents the
most opportunity.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.000
Because, what you
often have-- this

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.470
is a very typical pattern
for social networks--

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:38.650
is that people tend to be
with other people like them.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.400
Birds of a feather flock
together is the saying.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.170
And so if you map
the social structure,

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.620
what you end up having
is a cluster of people

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.140
who all know each other here.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.160
And then another cluster here
and another cluster there.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.830
But then you have these
gaps between the clusters.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.480
The structural holes is
what sociologists call them.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.510
And what structural holes
do is they create problems

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.680
with transferring
information, but they also

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.300
create opportunities
for middlemen

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.210
who can act as bridges.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:16.380
They're bridging these
gaps in the social fabric.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.099
So, an example,
there's an entrepreneur

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.640
I spoke with who, when
she was a college student,

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.800
saw an expectant mother,
a heavily pregnant woman,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.110
putting up fliers in
this young woman's dorm.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.990
She was looking for a nanny.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.380
And she thought, there are
so many college students,

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.250
I'm bound to be able
to find a nanny here.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.230
Now, this is in the Boston
area, and there are just so

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.380
many college students
in the Boston area.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.580
It would be very inefficient
to go and do this.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.560
And it's just silly
for an expectant mother

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.420
to be doing this or for
anybody to be doing this.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.650
And so you've got
for these people.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.140
There's a cluster of college
students, many clusters

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.110
of college students.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.110
And then you have many
clusters of families.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.270
And the families may
talk to each other.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.270
And the college students
may talk to each other.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.900
But they're separated
across social distance.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.950
And so what the
entrepreneur did is

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.880
she saw this
bridging opportunity.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.750
This was in the early
days of e-commerce.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.240
And she started a
service called Sittercity

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.580
that connects these two groups.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.180
And now, we have many,
many such services.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.580
And that doesn't
seem so remarkable.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.910
But I'm just showing
you this as an example

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.950
of how, even within the
same geographic area,

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.350
you might have the
need for a bridge.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:38.670
All right.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.800
So this bridge in
social structure

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.930
is pretty foundational
to solving

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.820
a lot of the other problems
that I'm going to describe.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.990
So let's take the
problem of quality.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.630
This is another problem
that middlemen solve.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.380
Whenever you're
buying something,

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.950
you're kind of at the
mercy of the seller

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.720
because the seller
typically knows more

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.730
about what they're selling
then you, as the buyer, do.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.230
All right.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.170
So classic example
is a used car.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.860
If you're selling
a used car, you

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.160
know how well you've taken
care of the car, what

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.870
problems it has, and so on.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.460
And the buyer doesn't know that.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.190
And this creates a real problem
for both sides, actually.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.040
This is what the whole
market for lemons is about.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.800
It's not just that the seller
is suspicious of the buyer

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.580
and is at a disadvantage.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.050
The buyer ends up
being at a disadvantage

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:40.449
just against other
buyers because-- I

00:19:40.449 --> 00:19:41.490
mean, sorry-- the seller.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.220
How can the seller
prove that the car is in

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.500
as good a condition as
the seller knows it to be?

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.940
How can they justify that price?

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:58.340
So this is where a middleman
can help because a middleman is

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.950
doing trade constantly.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.790
If you're selling a car, you're
doing it once every few years.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.510
But someone who
specializes in selling cars

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.740
is doing it all the time.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.360
So a really clear
demonstration of how

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.100
a middleman can solve
this quality problem

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.090
is apparent on eBay.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.850
Because on eBay,
it's all right there.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.030
You can see who is
doing the selling.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:33.560
You can see a record of
their transactions over time.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.960
What everybody wants is a
high feedback score on eBay

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.560
because it makes buyers
trust that person more.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.730
The problem is, it's
very hard to build up

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.010
that kind of positive score,
that positive reputation

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:53.860
on eBay, if you're only
selling occasionally.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.450
You see?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:59.400
This is why being a middleman
gives you an advantage

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.060
because-- one of many
reasons-- is that you're

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.940
buying and selling a lot.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.000
And so you can much
more quickly build up

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.132
a reputation as someone
who delivers on the quality

00:21:10.132 --> 00:21:11.090
that they're promising.

00:21:14.532 --> 00:21:16.490
So one of the people I
interviewed for the book

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.900
is a woman who is a
PowerSeller on eBay.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.690
PowerSeller is
eBay's designation

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.720
for its most active
and reputable sellers.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.870
She gave up a career
as an appellate lawyer

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.870
to sell luxury
designer goods on eBay

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.330
because, gosh, it
was just a quick way

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.590
to become an entrepreneur.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.432
And she's an expert
on this stuff.

00:21:38.432 --> 00:21:39.390
That's one of the keys.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.780
You have to really be good
at sussing out quality.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.170
And she's staking her
reputation on everything

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.420
that she sells on the site.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.710
She really guards that
average feedback score on eBay

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.460
because she knows that all
her future sales depend on it.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.420
So this is the advantage
that a middleman has.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.070
They're an expert in quality.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.810
And they're really able
to lay their reputation

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.720
on the line with every sale.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.240
So I call this type of
middleman, the certifier.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.590
And, by the way, we often talk
about people saying things

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.850
like, we don't need gatekeepers.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.090
Gatekeepers are evil.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.550
Let's bypass the gatekeepers.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.850
Let's do our own thing.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.310
Well, gatekeepers
are actually very

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.840
valuable for this very reason.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.400
It's in their interest to close
the gates when crap is coming

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.530
through, and to
open them up when

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.280
they see something of quality.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.740
And when we're buying,
as consumers of goods,

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.870
of cultural products,
it's valuable to use

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.540
the services of the gatekeeper
because we know that there's

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.740
a stamp of approval.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.560
You're not going to
see a lot of schlock

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.980
go through a great gatekeeper.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.610
All right.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:53.770
So the third problem is the
problem of accountability.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.630
Accountability is related
to the problem of quality,

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.066
except with quality, you're
just dealing with goods.

00:22:59.066 --> 00:23:01.960
With accountability, you're
dealing with services.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.320
So let's say you need
to hire somebody.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.450
How do you know, regardless
of that person's track

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.740
record or underlying
quality, how

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.600
do you know that
they're going to deliver

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.540
for you, that they're going
to do a good job for you?

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.100
And again, you have
the same problem

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.340
that the infrequent seller
or the infrequent buyer

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.200
does in the certifier scenario.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.890
If you're only
selling something,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.600
a service, occasionally,
how can you

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.850
prove that you really are an
honest, accountable person who

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.520
works hard and so on?

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:41.060
And, as the buyer, how can
you ascertain that as well?

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.870
So again, middlemen
to the rescue.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.370
I'll give you an example.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.540
A modeling agent, an
agent who represents

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.990
models for
photographers or brands

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:54.850
that need to hire models.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.920
This is a person who's
keeping both sides honest.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.690
I'm using that as
an umbrella term,

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.620
keeping both sides
honest, to capture

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.340
that whole notion of
accountability that

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.710
can take many forms.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.570
So in the case of a
model, being accountable

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.054
means that you're
going to show up.

00:24:10.054 --> 00:24:10.970
That's the main thing.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.840
You're going to show up on
time-- which, by the way,

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.070
in the modeling world means
15 minutes-- or at least

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.620
15 minutes-- before
the shoot starts.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.520
And for the other
side, the photographer

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.220
or the brand who's
taking pictures,

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.120
that they stick to the
letter of the contract,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.290
that they uphold
the contract terms.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:34.230
So if they are allowed to
use these images in a catalog

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.090
because that's
what they paid for,

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.290
the agency, the middleman
in this transaction,

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.920
is going to make
sure that they don't

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.210
slap on those pictures
on a big billboard.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.160
So the middleman is able to
keep both sides accountable.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.050
A model might still
flake out, but she'll

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:54.620
be less likely to flake out
when she's being represented

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.590
by the agency.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.050
And the reason is
that the agency's

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.827
in a position to have
her brought in again

00:25:02.827 --> 00:25:03.660
and again and again.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.310
So she's got a
longer future horizon

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.390
when working through the agency
than if she's doing business

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.130
directly with a photographer.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.230
Then she can say, uh,
it's not worth it for me.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.920
Something-- a
better gig came up.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.320
I'll just cancel
on you or whatever.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.210
So that's an example
of accountability.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.710
And it happens everywhere.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.300
So, OK.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.150
We've talked about
these several problems.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:32.350
I'll also present
the problem of risk.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.830
And, of course,
all of these things

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.930
that I've been talking
about-- the problem of quality

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.600
and the problem of
accountability--

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.340
do have to do with risk.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.550
And that is the risk
that what you're buying

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.700
isn't what you
thought you would get.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.850
But, when I talk about the
middleman as a risk bearer,

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.800
I'm really talking about
a different kind of risk.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:01.830
And that is the kind of risk
that neither side can predict.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.260
A lot of services in
the on-demand economy

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.980
actually deal with
this kind of risk.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.240
It's those unpredictable
fluctuations in demand.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.670
When are you going to
need to call up a car?

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.500
When is a car going to
be in this neighborhood?

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.840
None of these services know
when each of these events

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.900
is going to happen,
but because they're

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.840
pooling all these
resources-- they're

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.710
kind of building
a portfolio, you

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.220
might say-- then
in the aggregate,

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.010
they do know that
at this time you're

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.180
going to have somebody
who's going to need

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.510
a car in this neighborhood.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.330
And you're going to
have a driver that's

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.210
within a certain radius
of this neighborhood.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.670
So that's risk pooling.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.320
That's the risk-bearing role.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.740
And often, it has to
work hand-and-hand

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.070
with these other types of
risk, the quality problem

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.100
and the accountability problem.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.820
The clear demonstration
of this is

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.840
with a service called ZocDoc.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.000
It's another one of these
two-sided marketplaces.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.600
It's sort of the OpenTable
for doctor's appointments.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.140
So if you need to see a
doctor on short notice,

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.300
you can go to this website
and find someone in your area,

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.796
in the specialty that
you're looking for.

00:27:18.796 --> 00:27:20.665
And for the doctors--
who are the ones who

00:27:20.665 --> 00:27:23.120
are paying for this
service because it's

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.260
free to the patients--
for the doctors,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.070
this is a great service
just like OpenTable

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.940
is for restaurants
because they often

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.730
have last-minute cancellations.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.950
And they'd rather fill
that appointment slot.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.170
So for each doctor,
it's unpredictable

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.200
when that opening
is going to show up.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:51.770
But for the site, for the
service as a whole, for ZocDoc,

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.600
it's quite
predictable that, yes,

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.180
we can really count
on there being

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.000
a certain number of openings.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.710
And we can count on a certain
amount of demand from patients.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.440
And you have to keep
those in balance.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.680
But here's the interesting
part is that it really

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.090
has to work hand-in-hand with
the work of accountability

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.120
and the work of
sussing out quality.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.900
Because you're going to
run into this problem.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:23.790
Who do you think will be the
doctors with the most openings?

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.720
That's the kind of risk.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.140
Doctors who are not
very good, who have not

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.730
been able to build up
a very good reputation

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.052
in their community.

00:28:32.052 --> 00:28:34.260
So everybody's going to
have, you know, these flukes.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:39.550
Like, you know, very honest
reasons for having an opening.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.340
But doctors who have a
disproportionately high number

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.890
of openings, you have to
wonder about these doctors.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.830
And ZocDoc, as a middleman,
has to protect themselves

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.100
from that kind of risk.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.750
They have to weed
out the bad doctors.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.360
But they have to embrace
the other kind of risk,

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.410
which is that nobody
knows when you're

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.140
going to have an opening.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.230
So this is where these
reputation systems come in.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.430
It's almost an industry standard
now that all of these sites

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:13.000
have a way for users to
evaluate the other side.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.580
At least in this case,
patients evaluate doctors.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.220
And when doctors know that
they're going to be evaluated,

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.567
they're going to be,
presumably, on better behavior.

00:29:20.567 --> 00:29:22.900
So they're not going to,
maybe, keep you waiting as long

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.710
as they would if you
were not transacting

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.210
through the middleman.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.410
At least, that's the theory.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.700
And it's in ZocDoc's
interest to keep

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.230
that system working very well.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.190
So that's the risk bearer role.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:41.050
And again, it comes up
in lots of other places.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.020
There's another problem.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.970
And I would call
this the problem

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.440
of information overload.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.030
I think Google certainly
understands this problem.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.460
It's like the official, you
know, mission of the company

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.130
to organize all the
world's information.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.100
A lot of people don't
appreciate this.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.000
That the more
information you have,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.090
that's not necessarily
a good thing by itself.

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.580
Because then you
have the problem

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.600
of sifting through
this information,

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:13.030
processing the information
to make a good decision.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.637
And Herbert Simon
said, pretty famously--

00:30:16.637 --> 00:30:18.220
you guys might have
heard this quote--

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.740
that a wealth of information
creates a poverty of attention.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.440
And by attention,
he just meant time.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.120
Information consumes time.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.510
If you've ever had to
plan a complex trip,

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.520
you probably can relate to this.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.530
Humans actually have
a much harder time

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.490
than computers in
processing information

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.400
because we get overwhelmed.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.490
We get emotionally overwhelmed.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.990
And so we just get
paralyzed with indecision.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:48.820
And so this is another rationale
for a middleman to step in.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.590
So I call this role
the concierge role.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.060
Just like you could do your
own research on whatever city

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.380
you're going to through
your iPad or whatever,

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.500
or you can go to a
concierge who can just

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.780
cut through all of that
and tell you exactly

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.050
where to go to meet your needs.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.689
So that is the concierge role.

00:31:07.689 --> 00:31:09.230
And I think computers
are going to be

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.860
doing more and more of that,
but we're not there yet.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.120
We still can really benefit
from a good concierge.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.630
By the way, this is where I
think real estate agents can

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:22.470
really step up their game.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.950
We no longer need
real estate agents

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.150
to just tell you
what the listings are

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.790
if we're buying a house.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:34.500
But we need them to guide us
through this long, complex,

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.190
high stakes transaction.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.980
And I think that they could
be doing a better job at that

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.630
if they thought of
their role that way.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:45.390
All right.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.460
Finally, the last problem
that I think middlemen solve

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.990
is a problem that I'll
just call self-advocacy,

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.370
the problem of self-advocacy.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:58.720
Which is the problem of trying
to advocate on your own behalf.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.010
So we, just as humans, we have a
hard time tooting our own horn.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.585
Much easier if somebody
else does that for us,

00:32:06.585 --> 00:32:09.490
if somebody else introduces
us, if somebody else

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.830
says how great we are.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.600
And also the problem of
pushing for what we want.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.680
We're afraid of
rocking the boat.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.370
And one of the middlemen I
interviewed for this book

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.460
really saw this problem
in his industry.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.360
And we already see this
in other industries

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.220
like in sports agents, right.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.180
They advocate on
behalf of the athlete.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.810
So not only does
the athlete not have

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.516
to become an expert
in negotiation,

00:32:35.516 --> 00:32:37.390
but the athlete can just
pretend that they're

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:42.700
just interested in the game,
and let the business sign be

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.940
taken care of by the middleman.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.260
The person that I talked
to does the same thing

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.360
for young doctors.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.130
So he's a doctor himself,
a more seasoned doctor.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.170
And he's seen both sides.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.220
Middlemen often do have
to be able to appreciate

00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.750
the needs of both sides.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.580
And he realized
that young doctors

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.310
are at a disadvantage
in negotiating

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:08.200
for their first job out of
residency or medical school.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.260
And the disadvantages-- well,
there are many disadvantages.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.900
One is they just don't
even have the information.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.280
They don't have
experience negotiating.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.320
But they're also
hamstrung by the fact

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.840
that throughout medical school,
it has been pounded into them

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.130
that medicine is
a higher calling.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.190
It's not about the money.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.660
And you shouldn't show
an interest in money

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.370
when you're talking to
your future employer.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:36.310
But hospitals and clinics
take advantage of that norm.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:40.810
And so they're able to get
these young doctors to just sign

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.020
whatever the first offer is.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.060
So this agent is able
to step in and he's

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.500
able to say things
like, well, I know

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.390
you really need an ER doctor.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:57.480
And I know that the median pay
in Kansas City for an ER doctor

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:02.060
is X. And so, let's
just move toward X

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.022
with this person
who's a young hire.

00:34:04.022 --> 00:34:05.730
We don't know anything
about his quality.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.130
So let's just take the
median salary as our target.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.070
There's just no way that the
doctor-- even if the doctor had

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:15.110
that information-- would
feel comfortable saying

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:18.600
these things on her own behalf.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:23.550
So that's a value that this
role that I call the insulator

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:25.810
provides.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.600
So what's interesting
about all of these is they

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.350
all show-- they're all
able to wield power

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.739
on behalf of their client,
on behalf of their trading

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:36.239
partner.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.860
Going back to this idea of
being an admirable middleman,

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.100
a true partner.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.650
But they're able to
do it without any kind

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:46.560
of a formal authority.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.600
It's not like anybody's
reporting to this person.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.889
But we're all gladly
partnering with these people.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:57.380
We're all happily
using these services

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.410
because these
businesses are providing

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.154
true value to both sides.

00:35:03.154 --> 00:35:05.070
And I want to just leave
you with this thought

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:09.510
about how this might
apply to you and how can

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.480
you start to see yourself
as a middleman as well.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.590
So this diagram shows
somebody's actual map

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.100
of their LinkedIn connections.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.590
LinkedIn no longer offers
this visualization service.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.980
But if you were to manually
map all your connections,

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.050
I would bet that your diagram,
your own personal network

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.890
diagram, would look
much like this.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.680
And this person, right
here in the middle,

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.880
is the user whose connections
are being mapped here.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.490
And all these colors,
they refer to a cluster.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:48.120
Remember, I was talking about
a typical social network having

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.070
clusters and having bridges,
and gaps between clusters

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.370
that can be bridged.

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:59.320
So, the blue cluster are all
employees of one company.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.210
And maybe the orange
cluster is employees

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:08.050
of a previous employer that
this person has worked for.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:13.410
And, I think, the green cluster
refers to some classmates

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.760
from college.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.520
And the smallest cluster is
typically your family members.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.380
Again, all these people know
each other, more or less,

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.400
because they're in the
same social circle.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.320
That's what we would
say, social circle.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.980
But they don't all know
each other across clusters.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.840
And in this case, you sometimes
have people who overlap.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:41.220
But the most prominent bridge
is the user, him or herself.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.200
This is the person who
is a bridge across all

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:45.965
of these clusters.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.500
So the idea here is that
we're all separated,

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.960
but we're all part of
a bunch of networks.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.880
And if we can think
of ourselves as being

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.610
that middleman,
that middle person,

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:09.090
the person who can bridge all
of these different networks,

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.500
then we can increase the
value of our whole network.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.630
And we can do it
through these ways

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:21.040
of being not just a bridge, but
also a certifier or an enforcer

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.580
of the accountability role.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.440
Or, perhaps, an insulator
when you're saying something

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.780
on behalf of a co-worker
that they can't say

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.780
on behalf of themselves.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.231
That's how you can be a more
valuable middleman yourself.

00:37:35.231 --> 00:37:38.598
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.335
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that historically we

00:37:43.335 --> 00:37:49.080
have viewed middlemen as
something that we reviled.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.870
However, clearly,
like you said, most

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.040
of the services
that we work with

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.080
are, essentially, middlemen.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.040
Why do you think the
social perception

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.110
has changed for middlemen?

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:09.576
Why don't we revile, like,
Amazon or Google, as we would,

00:38:09.576 --> 00:38:11.972
I don't know, an
older middleman?

00:38:11.972 --> 00:38:12.930
MARINA KRAKOVSKY: Yeah.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.013
Well, there are a lot of
answers to that question.

00:38:15.013 --> 00:38:18.310
So first of all, middlemen
as a group are still reviled.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.039
I follow this word
on Twitter because I

00:38:20.039 --> 00:38:21.830
want to join conversations
about middlemen.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.271
And people still say things
like, cut out the middleman.

00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:25.770
This service cuts
out the middleman.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.186
And they're not seeing that,
well, this service, actually,

00:38:28.186 --> 00:38:30.480
is a middleman, too.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.270
So, that's one thing.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.760
I'd say, in general,
people still

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.720
don't have this, like,
negative view of middlemen.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.940
A lot of people wouldn't
see Amazon as a middleman.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.770
Another answer is
that Amazon I would

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:47.770
put in that golden quadrant
of being a partner, at least

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:49.020
from the consumer's side.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.360
If you talk to small
manufacturers who

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.140
try to sell through Amazon, you
might hear a different answer.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:59.390
So I think that the ones that
we look to as admirable ones,

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:02.210
we just don't call
them a middleman.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:06.120
AUDIENCE: So middleman is
a more semantic thing then?

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:09.804
We just call things middlemen
that we don't like middlemen,

00:39:09.804 --> 00:39:11.220
but the middlemen
that we like, we

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.804
don't realize that
they are middlemen?

00:39:12.804 --> 00:39:13.761
MARINA KRAKOVSKY: Yeah.

00:39:13.761 --> 00:39:15.750
I do think it's largely
a semantic issue.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.340
Yes, that if we like
them, we call them

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.250
a retailer or my trusted agent.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.200
We don't use the word middleman.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.340
I think so.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.350
AUDIENCE: Can talk a
little bit about the role

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.570
of universities as middlemen?

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:30.082
Because, to some extent, they're
certifiers and networks and--

00:39:30.082 --> 00:39:31.040
MARINA KRAKOVSKY: Yeah.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.180
Universities are, definitely,
middlemen for the reason

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.539
that you identified.

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.080
A lot of people
would say that that's

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.360
actually their main role,
is just to certify you.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.330
You know, like, oh,
you got into MIT.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.130
Well, that's good enough for me.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:46.930
I don't even care
what you learn at MIT.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:50.330
So that certifier role
is really important.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.390
They actually work as
middlemen in other ways,

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.270
too, because there's a real--
at least, a two-sidedness.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.550
You know, the idea
of a two-sided market

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.870
where the buyers want to
be where the sellers are.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.810
The sellers want to be
where the buyers are.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.860
There's a way in which
universities are like that.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.700
So if you think about
a good university,

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.960
they attract good
students because they

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.180
have great faculty.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.770
And then great faculty want
to work at a university that

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:17.950
has smart, motivated students.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:20.960
And there are other
effects like that.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.670
AUDIENCE: So, do you
see any problems?

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.620
I mean, all of this
sounds excellent.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.360
But I'm thinking now of
the physician's metric

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.870
that you mentioned.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:37.340
And do such middleman
services actually create

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.280
behaviors that otherwise
would not be created?

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.042
For example, some
people may think,

00:40:43.042 --> 00:40:44.500
you know, oh, this
is a bad doctor.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.670
He treated me in a certain way.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:53.910
But the doctor is actually--
his cure is performing well,

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.420
but his personal skills
may not be up to par.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:57.920
So--

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:58.576
MARINA KRAKOVSKY: Yes.

00:40:58.576 --> 00:41:00.242
AUDIENCE: --he gets,
like, a bad review.

00:41:00.242 --> 00:41:02.250
And now you have
this network effect

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.650
which may be multiplying this.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:08.472
And suddenly strange
things happen.

00:41:08.472 --> 00:41:09.680
MARINA KRAKOVSKY: Definitely.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.180
Yeah.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.280
That is not a perfect
system with ZocDoc.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.570
I mean, doctors really
think-- and a lot of people

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.140
would say this-- gosh, what
business do patients even

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.860
have evaluating doctors?

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.390
If you were as expert at
medicine as the doctor is,

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:26.140
why would you even
need a doctor?

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.350
And you could say that about
any of these middlemen services.

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:33.640
To a large extent, we turn to
middlemen because we cannot,

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.220
we just don't have that
expertise ourselves.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.580
And so, I would say
that these services

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:43.650
do have-- these
rating systems do

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.130
skew the ratings in
a certain direction

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.610
that they measure certain
things more than others.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:52.230
Clearly, things like the
doctor's bedside manner

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.110
and how long they
kept you waiting

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.250
weigh heavily,
much more heavily,

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:00.470
than other factors that somebody
else would find important.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.970
Yeah.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:02.820
It's not a perfect system.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.070
I was just trying to think
about the role of technology

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:07.272
taking over middlemen roles.

00:42:07.272 --> 00:42:08.230
MARINA KRAKOVSKY: Yeah.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.771
AUDIENCE: And I just
wondering if you

00:42:09.771 --> 00:42:11.520
have thoughts on are
there certain roles

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.600
or characteristics of
these roles of middlemen

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.830
that are inherently human?

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.360
That technology,
maybe, conceivably

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.205
could never take over?

00:42:19.205 --> 00:42:20.580
MARINA KRAKOVSKY:
I really don't.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.760
I thought about this
question as well.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.205
And I actually
posed it to Al Roth.

00:42:29.205 --> 00:42:30.590
You guys know Al Roth.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.110
He's an economist at Stanford.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:34.860
He won the Nobel Prize
a couple years ago.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.650
And he thinks a lot
about middlemen.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:41.440
Anyway, he says no, that really
there's nothing you can say

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.950
that is like that because
there's just no limit.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.200
We don't know what
artificial intelligence

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.552
is going to be able to do.

00:42:47.552 --> 00:42:49.760
I actually talk a little
bit about this in this book.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.400
I mean, in the same
way that we turn

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.020
to Netflix with its
sophisticated collaborative

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.450
filtering system to recommend
movies that we're really

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:01.190
going to love, there is
no reason, in theory,

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.060
in my mind, why we
can't someday turn

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.990
to a sophisticated
piece of software that

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:10.160
will ask us natural language
questions to find out

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.590
about our tastes and ask
us to rate past experiences

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.800
and on the basis
of that construct

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.630
the perfect itinerary for us.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.990
That seems like an
impossible challenge,

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:24.610
but, in theory, I don't
see why it's not possible.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.314
I'll say one other
thing about technology.

00:43:27.314 --> 00:43:29.480
You know, part of the reason
that people were saying

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.490
that middlemen we're
going to go away

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.810
is that the internet would
reduce transaction costs.

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.820
The cost of finding
what you need,

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.710
and finding out about
quality and so on.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:40.280
And it actually has done that.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.930
It's reduced transaction costs.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:46.790
And that's why we're able to
book our own travel so often.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.880
If you're just flying
to LA or New York,

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.960
staying at a hotel
you've stayed at before,

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.010
your transaction costs
for doing that on your own

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.080
is really quite low.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.180
And so it makes no sense to turn
to a travel agent to do that.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.030
But the thing about
transaction cost

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.300
is that the internet has
lowered transaction costs

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.770
for everybody,
including middlemen.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.890
And so middlemen bring whatever
human capital they have.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:11.540
Whatever skills and
knowledge they have,

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.880
they bring it to the task.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.870
And then for them, the
technology is a complement.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.890
So their transaction
costs have actually

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:21.130
fallen faster than our
transaction costs have

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.420
for the kind of special,
complex transactions

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.150
that we can't easily
do ourselves even

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.750
with the aid of technology.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:30.560
MALE SPEAKER: Though
that they can't never

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.512
go to zero marginal
cost for transaction.

00:44:33.512 --> 00:44:34.470
MARINA KRAKOVSKY: Yeah.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.990
I mean, yes.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:35.490
Yes.

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.080
There's always
going to be-- yep.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.490
No free lunch, right?

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.910
MALE SPEAKER: Let's thank
Marina for her visit to Google.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:45.260
[APPLAUSE]
