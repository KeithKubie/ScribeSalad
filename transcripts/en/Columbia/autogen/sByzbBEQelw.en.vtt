00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830
make strategy meet referring to
 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.780
make strategy meet referring to
strategic planning it may be an

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790
strategic planning it may be an
 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.240
strategic planning it may be an
excellent way to cope with fear of the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250
excellent way to cope with fear of the
 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.219
excellent way to cope with fear of the
unknown but fear and discomfort or

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229
unknown but fear and discomfort or

isn't very good true strategy is about

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419
isn't very good true strategy is about
 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.729
isn't very good true strategy is about
placing bets and making hard choices any

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:52.739
placing bets and making hard choices any
 

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:57.989

Quebec well you know I it's interesting

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729

Quebec well you know I it's interesting
I think I I just had our board meeting

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139
I think I I just had our board meeting
 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.589
I think I I just had our board meeting
this week and the purpose of the board

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599
this week and the purpose of the board
 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.079
this week and the purpose of the board
meeting was to hear our three-year

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:10.089
meeting was to hear our three-year
 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.439
meeting was to hear our three-year
strategic plan and so I spent a lot of

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449
strategic plan and so I spent a lot of
 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.019
strategic plan and so I spent a lot of
time on a strategic plan in recent days

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:16.029
time on a strategic plan in recent days
 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.049
time on a strategic plan in recent days
and what it is is it's a way to

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:19.059
and what it is is it's a way to
 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:22.559
and what it is is it's a way to
articulate your vision it's not the plan

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569
articulate your vision it's not the plan
 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.529
articulate your vision it's not the plan
really because you're right you have to

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539
really because you're right you have to
 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.409
really because you're right you have to
keep making changes and and things come

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419
keep making changes and and things come
 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.559
keep making changes and and things come
up and you have to adjust and move on

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569
up and you have to adjust and move on
 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.309
up and you have to adjust and move on
but it is a way to describe in simple

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319
but it is a way to describe in simple
 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.529
but it is a way to describe in simple
terms what the single vision is why does

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539
terms what the single vision is why does
 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.939
terms what the single vision is why does
this matter so you really move away from

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949
this matter so you really move away from
 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.329
this matter so you really move away from
strategy to where are we trying to go

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.339
strategy to where are we trying to go
 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:52.139
strategy to where are we trying to go
and I think it's important to hold on to

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:52.149
and I think it's important to hold on to
 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:53.790
and I think it's important to hold on to
some structure I don't really care what

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800
some structure I don't really care what
 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.189
some structure I don't really care what
we call it but some structure that

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199
we call it but some structure that
 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.359
we call it but some structure that
forces us to say in simple terms what it

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:00.369
forces us to say in simple terms what it
 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:02.369
forces us to say in simple terms what it
is we're doing it why it matters and

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:02.379
is we're doing it why it matters and
 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.759
is we're doing it why it matters and
it's also a way to bring other people in

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:05.769
it's also a way to bring other people in
 

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:09.089
it's also a way to bring other people in
the organization along with you it's so

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099
the organization along with you it's so
 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.519
the organization along with you it's so
important to have a structure for doing

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529
important to have a structure for doing
 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.769
important to have a structure for doing
that and it's a way for people to buy in

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779
that and it's a way for people to buy in
 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:19.559
that and it's a way for people to buy in
I was thinking about what um Josh and

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569
I was thinking about what um Josh and
 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:21.809
I was thinking about what um Josh and
Maura and Dom are just talking about

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819
Maura and Dom are just talking about
 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:25.259
Maura and Dom are just talking about
about software and an emulation and

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:25.269
about software and an emulation and
 

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:27.329
about software and an emulation and
trying to save it and what Joshua's

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:27.339
trying to save it and what Joshua's
 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:28.769
trying to save it and what Joshua's
talking about was that one piece of

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:28.779
talking about was that one piece of
 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:30.359
talking about was that one piece of
software is linked to another or you use

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:30.369
software is linked to another or you use
 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:32.579
software is linked to another or you use
six or seven of them and we were

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:32.589
six or seven of them and we were
 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.889
six or seven of them and we were
thinking about in our strategic thinking

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:34.899
thinking about in our strategic thinking
 

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:38.129
thinking about in our strategic thinking
design process that this is what one we

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139
design process that this is what one we
 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.199
design process that this is what one we
call a wicked problem I mean it's not

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:40.209
call a wicked problem I mean it's not
 

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:42.239
call a wicked problem I mean it's not
something that I think one of the

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:42.249
something that I think one of the
 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.069
something that I think one of the
problems with strategic planning that I

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:44.079
problems with strategic planning that I
 

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:46.799
problems with strategic planning that I
think you were discussing before is a

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:46.809
think you were discussing before is a
 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:49.409
think you were discussing before is a
classic American cultural way to do

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419
classic American cultural way to do
 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:50.999
classic American cultural way to do
things you break it down into 20

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.009
things you break it down into 20
 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:52.350
things you break it down into 20
different parts you name all the

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360
different parts you name all the
 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.959
different parts you name all the
problems and you work on the one at

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:53.969
problems and you work on the one at
 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:55.819
problems and you work on the one at
time which of course doesn't work

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:55.829
time which of course doesn't work
 

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:58.309
time which of course doesn't work
anymore and the other way that you work

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319
anymore and the other way that you work
 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.689
anymore and the other way that you work
on a wicked problem is you come up with

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699
on a wicked problem is you come up with
 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.259
on a wicked problem is you come up with
a magic solution like MOOCs and so what

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:03.269
a magic solution like MOOCs and so what
 

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:07.609
a magic solution like MOOCs and so what
we were trying to do was not go either

00:07:07.609 --> 00:07:07.619
we were trying to do was not go either
 

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:09.439
we were trying to do was not go either
of those ways but but exactly what

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449
of those ways but but exactly what
 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:10.729
of those ways but but exactly what
Deanna was talking about we were trying

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:10.739
Deanna was talking about we were trying
 

00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:12.649
Deanna was talking about we were trying
to say we're what do we want the library

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:12.659
to say we're what do we want the library
 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:15.559
to say we're what do we want the library
of 2033 to be if we were to create that

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:15.569
of 2033 to be if we were to create that
 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.850
of 2033 to be if we were to create that
vision and could we get there by doing a

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860
vision and could we get there by doing a
 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.769
vision and could we get there by doing a
number of different things that would

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:21.779
number of different things that would
 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:24.499
number of different things that would
affect the ecosystem some at a high

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:24.509
affect the ecosystem some at a high
 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:26.299
affect the ecosystem some at a high
level like at the collective collections

00:07:26.299 --> 00:07:26.309
level like at the collective collections
 

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:28.789
level like at the collective collections
level and some of some very smaller

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:28.799
level and some of some very smaller
 

00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:31.729
level and some of some very smaller
levels you know introducing a data

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:31.739
levels you know introducing a data
 

00:07:31.739 --> 00:07:35.059
levels you know introducing a data
curation folks and so what what does

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:35.069
curation folks and so what what does
 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:37.339
curation folks and so what what does
that look like how can you do that and

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:37.349
that look like how can you do that and
 

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:39.949
that look like how can you do that and
how that is isn't that a better way to

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:39.959
how that is isn't that a better way to
 

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.409
how that is isn't that a better way to
try this and to allow ourselves to fail

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419
try this and to allow ourselves to fail
 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.159
try this and to allow ourselves to fail
and to think about the library in all of

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:46.169
and to think about the library in all of
 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:49.669
and to think about the library in all of
its various and different ways of being

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:49.679
its various and different ways of being
 

00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:52.909
its various and different ways of being
inside the university as a partner with

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919
inside the university as a partner with
 

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:55.429
inside the university as a partner with
other libraries outside the university

00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:55.439
other libraries outside the university
 

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:57.889
other libraries outside the university
in the community that all the kinds of

00:07:57.889 --> 00:07:57.899
in the community that all the kinds of
 

00:07:57.899 --> 00:07:59.449
in the community that all the kinds of
things that we talked about today we

00:07:59.449 --> 00:07:59.459
things that we talked about today we
 

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:01.219
things that we talked about today we
actually looked at all of the strategic

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:01.229
actually looked at all of the strategic
 

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:03.639
actually looked at all of the strategic
plans of every hundred and twenty and

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:03.649
plans of every hundred and twenty and
 

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:06.919
plans of every hundred and twenty and
every 125 libraries and all of their

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:06.929
every 125 libraries and all of their
 

00:08:06.929 --> 00:08:09.679
every 125 libraries and all of their
universities to and when we can find

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:09.689
universities to and when we can find
 

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:12.529
universities to and when we can find
them the IT departments and the presses

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539
them the IT departments and the presses
 

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:14.359
them the IT departments and the presses
those are much harder to find that was

00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:14.369
those are much harder to find that was
 

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:18.769
those are much harder to find that was
the work that melon helped us think

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:18.779
the work that melon helped us think
 

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:21.829
the work that melon helped us think
about and found a numbing kind of

00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:21.839
about and found a numbing kind of
 

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:25.549
about and found a numbing kind of
sameness in these plans and and we

00:08:25.549 --> 00:08:25.559
sameness in these plans and and we
 

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:27.529
sameness in these plans and and we
actually ended up not looking at the

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539
actually ended up not looking at the
 

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:30.199
actually ended up not looking at the
plans what they said all the time but

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:30.209
plans what they said all the time but
 

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:33.409
plans what they said all the time but
what they said only a few times and we

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419
what they said only a few times and we
 

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.899
what they said only a few times and we
found that long tail those kinds of

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:35.909
found that long tail those kinds of
 

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.240
found that long tail those kinds of
things that sort of sit on the edges to

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.250
things that sort of sit on the edges to
 

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.429
things that sort of sit on the edges to
be much more interesting so I think we

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:40.439
be much more interesting so I think we
 

00:08:40.439 --> 00:08:43.040
be much more interesting so I think we
need a vision and I need a we need a

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.050
need a vision and I need a we need a
 

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.829
need a vision and I need a we need a
flexible way to get there but it were

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839
flexible way to get there but it were
 

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:47.449
flexible way to get there but it were
but what we're going to do in your one

00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459
but what we're going to do in your one
 

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:49.100
but what we're going to do in your one
year to and your three that's I think

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:49.110
year to and your three that's I think
 

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.819
year to and your three that's I think
the comforting part that doesn't work

00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:51.829
the comforting part that doesn't work
 

00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:54.590
the comforting part that doesn't work
yeah I think when I think strategic plan

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600
yeah I think when I think strategic plan
 

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.269
yeah I think when I think strategic plan
it's it's that idea that we pick

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279
it's it's that idea that we pick
 

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:58.910
it's it's that idea that we pick
something up at one point in time and we

00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920
something up at one point in time and we
 

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.530
something up at one point in time and we
write it all down and then we move

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540
write it all down and then we move
 

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.900
write it all down and then we move
forward with it and it reminds me of one

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:02.910
forward with it and it reminds me of one
 

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.790
forward with it and it reminds me of one
of the the quotes that stayed with me is

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800
of the the quotes that stayed with me is
 

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.129
of the the quotes that stayed with me is
the 21st century is a terrible time to

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:07.139
the 21st century is a terrible time to
 

00:09:07.139 --> 00:09:07.310
the 21st century is a terrible time to
be

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160
control freak and uh Alec Ross who was

control freak and uh Alec Ross who was
the senior adviser to secretary of state

hillary clinton said this and i was in

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300
hillary clinton said this and i was in
 

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.030
hillary clinton said this and i was in
an audience and it's just like that hit

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040
an audience and it's just like that hit
 

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.070
an audience and it's just like that hit
me right in the core because I'm a

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.080
me right in the core because I'm a
 

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.990
me right in the core because I'm a
librarian and that I like control

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000
librarian and that I like control
 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.130
librarian and that I like control
freakiness but it all it it also reminds

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140
freakiness but it all it it also reminds
 

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.610
freakiness but it all it it also reminds
me of those strategic plan ideas and in

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620
me of those strategic plan ideas and in
 

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.670
me of those strategic plan ideas and in
some of the futuring theory that's out

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680
some of the futuring theory that's out
 

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.350
some of the futuring theory that's out
there they talk about this there's

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360
there they talk about this there's
 

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.180
there they talk about this there's
different views of the future there's

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.190
different views of the future there's
 

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.570
different views of the future there's
the expected future which is what

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:37.580
the expected future which is what
 

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.590
the expected future which is what
organizations kind of collectively

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600
organizations kind of collectively
 

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.980
organizations kind of collectively
decide and view and they anticipate it

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:42.990
decide and view and they anticipate it
 

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.990
decide and view and they anticipate it
and futurists say that those almost

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000
and futurists say that those almost
 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.900
and futurists say that those almost
always fail and and that seems to

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:47.910
always fail and and that seems to
 

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.280
always fail and and that seems to
resonate sometimes with strategic

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:49.290
resonate sometimes with strategic
 

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.750
resonate sometimes with strategic
planning I think because it is what we

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760
planning I think because it is what we
 

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.140
planning I think because it is what we
collectively agree upon and instead

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.150
collectively agree upon and instead
 

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.580
collectively agree upon and instead
there's this promotion of this idea of

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:55.590
there's this promotion of this idea of
 

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.990
there's this promotion of this idea of
alternative futures that there are

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000
alternative futures that there are
 

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.610
alternative futures that there are
multiple futures that exist out there

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620
multiple futures that exist out there
 

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.340
multiple futures that exist out there
and there's a cone of plausibility that

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.350
and there's a cone of plausibility that
 

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.040
and there's a cone of plausibility that
we can impose and kind of say from the

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.050
we can impose and kind of say from the
 

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.690
we can impose and kind of say from the
past and the present we can articulate

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700
past and the present we can articulate
 

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.520
past and the present we can articulate
out and see some of the limits of

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.530
out and see some of the limits of
 

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.560
out and see some of the limits of
plausibility that could occur and a

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:09.570
plausibility that could occur and a
 

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.050
plausibility that could occur and a
range of futures that might be within

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060
range of futures that might be within
 

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.990
range of futures that might be within
that space and I think that that's a

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000
that space and I think that that's a
 

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.970
that space and I think that that's a
really important way to think and it

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980
really important way to think and it
 

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.440
really important way to think and it
probably is the opposite of what

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:18.450
probably is the opposite of what
 

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.090
probably is the opposite of what
strategic planning is is because it's

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100
strategic planning is is because it's
 

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.500
strategic planning is is because it's
actually identifying lots of different

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:21.510
actually identifying lots of different
 

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.330
actually identifying lots of different
realms and introducing lots of new

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:23.340
realms and introducing lots of new
 

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.580
realms and introducing lots of new
information i I don't have insight into

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:25.590
information i I don't have insight into
 

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.040
information i I don't have insight into
to how I MLS decided to do this but I

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.050
to how I MLS decided to do this but I
 

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.560
to how I MLS decided to do this but I
think that idea of those conversations

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:29.570
think that idea of those conversations
 

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.660
think that idea of those conversations
year after year it's this collection of

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:32.670
year after year it's this collection of
 

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.940
year after year it's this collection of
information continuing to expand and and

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:34.950
information continuing to expand and and
 

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.160
information continuing to expand and and
refine that cone of plausibility and

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.170
refine that cone of plausibility and
 

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.410
refine that cone of plausibility and
then the last way a lot of people talk

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420
then the last way a lot of people talk
 

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.940
then the last way a lot of people talk
about futures is this idea of preferred

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:40.950
about futures is this idea of preferred
 

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.150
about futures is this idea of preferred
futures that you have a vision that we

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160
futures that you have a vision that we
 

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.920
futures that you have a vision that we
prefer and then that we work to create

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:45.930
prefer and then that we work to create
 

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.750
prefer and then that we work to create
and I think this echoes the first two

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760
and I think this echoes the first two
 

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.550
and I think this echoes the first two
presentations that we heard from Jim and

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560
presentations that we heard from Jim and
 

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.470
presentations that we heard from Jim and
from Carol that it's transforming vision

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480
from Carol that it's transforming vision
 

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.780
from Carol that it's transforming vision
into action that that's perhaps the most

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:53.790
into action that that's perhaps the most
 

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.240
into action that that's perhaps the most
important part rather than the planning

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.250
important part rather than the planning
 

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.330
important part rather than the planning
of a vision or a strategy could I had

00:10:59.330 --> 00:10:59.340
of a vision or a strategy could I had
 

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.850
of a vision or a strategy could I had
something to that because the IMLS

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.860
something to that because the IMLS
 

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.560
something to that because the IMLS
funded us to do those kinds of

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:03.570
funded us to do those kinds of
 

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.480
funded us to do those kinds of
conversations around North America we

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:05.490
conversations around North America we
 

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.030
conversations around North America we
had about 400 people come and what we

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040
had about 400 people come and what we
 

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.880
had about 400 people come and what we
didn't do was look for the lowest common

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:10.890
didn't do was look for the lowest common
 

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.250
didn't do was look for the lowest common
denominator we honored every voice and

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260
denominator we honored every voice and
 

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.410
denominator we honored every voice and
we had an architect and designer I

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:15.420
we had an architect and designer I
 

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.970
we had an architect and designer I
thought well this was great but what are

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:16.980
thought well this was great but what are
 

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.170
thought well this was great but what are
we going to do with all these brilliant

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180
we going to do with all these brilliant
 

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:18.800
we going to do with all these brilliant
ideas

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:18.810
ideas
 

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.690
ideas
and we actually literally had an

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700
and we actually literally had an
 

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.010
and we actually literally had an
architect and designer named am

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:22.020
architect and designer named am
 

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.800

Pendleton Julian who built scaffolding
so we could actually honor all of those

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:26.850
so we could actually honor all of those
 

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.250
so we could actually honor all of those
voices and find the highest level of

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:30.260
voices and find the highest level of
 

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.690
voices and find the highest level of
symmetry and not the lowest common

planning exercises in local institutions
 

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.910
planning exercises in local institutions
is that you're thinking only about what

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920
is that you're thinking only about what
 

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.900
is that you're thinking only about what
you need to do and they become they

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:14.910
you need to do and they become they
 

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.170
you need to do and they become they
become like branding exercises almost

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180
become like branding exercises almost
 

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.390
become like branding exercises almost
you know what is it that we do that's

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:20.400
you know what is it that we do that's
 

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.670
you know what is it that we do that's
different from other people how do we

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680
different from other people how do we
 

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.130
different from other people how do we
distinguish ourselves how do we make our

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:25.140
distinguish ourselves how do we make our
 

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.060
distinguish ourselves how do we make our
mark and instead we need to be figuring

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:29.070
mark and instead we need to be figuring
 

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.210
mark and instead we need to be figuring
out what are the structures

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:31.220
out what are the structures

carol was just so right on saying we

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000
carol was just so right on saying we
 

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.030
carol was just so right on saying we
need to talk about the hard problem so

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040
need to talk about the hard problem so
 

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.999
need to talk about the hard problem so
we need to talk about them together but

00:13:42.999 --> 00:13:43.009
we need to talk about them together but
 

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:45.519
we need to talk about them together but
we don't have the structures for doing

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:45.529
we don't have the structures for doing
 

00:13:45.529 --> 00:13:48.790
we don't have the structures for doing
that so we end up building our own plans

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800
that so we end up building our own plans
 

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.569
that so we end up building our own plans
and then we join initiatives that I

00:13:52.569 --> 00:13:52.579
and then we join initiatives that I
 

00:13:52.579 --> 00:13:54.819
and then we join initiatives that I

everything seems to be twenty thousand

00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:56.389
everything seems to be twenty thousand
 

00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:59.110
everything seems to be twenty thousand
dollars we join those initiatives and

00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120
dollars we join those initiatives and
 

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.429
dollars we join those initiatives and
hand over that part of the problem to

00:14:03.429 --> 00:14:03.439
hand over that part of the problem to
 

00:14:03.439 --> 00:14:07.780
hand over that part of the problem to
these initiatives and yet our our job as

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:07.790
these initiatives and yet our our job as
 

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.920
these initiatives and yet our our job as
leaders is to link the people in our

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:10.930
leaders is to link the people in our
 

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.759
leaders is to link the people in our
organizations to those broader issues so

00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:15.769
organizations to those broader issues so
 

00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:18.879
organizations to those broader issues so
I that's what I'd like us to focus on

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:18.889
I that's what I'd like us to focus on
 

00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:21.040
I that's what I'd like us to focus on
when we talk about planning is how do we

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.050
when we talk about planning is how do we
 

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:25.650
when we talk about planning is how do we
move outside our own institutions and

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:25.660
move outside our own institutions and
 

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.319
move outside our own institutions and
tackle the really hard problems like

00:14:29.319 --> 00:14:29.329
tackle the really hard problems like
 

00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:32.829
tackle the really hard problems like
digital preservation like collective

00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839
digital preservation like collective

collections like storage so one of the
 

00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:40.299
collections like storage so one of the
wicked problems that we thought we had

00:14:40.299 --> 00:14:40.309
wicked problems that we thought we had
 

00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:43.509
wicked problems that we thought we had
to face for example was this this

00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519
to face for example was this this
 

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:45.999

the people who worked around that

00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519
the people who worked around that
 

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:51.850
the people who worked around that
happening and in some ways was a

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:51.860
happening and in some ways was a
 

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.519
happening and in some ways was a
prototype for what we wanted to do which

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:54.529
prototype for what we wanted to do which
 

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:56.980
prototype for what we wanted to do which
was this is not a problem for libraries

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:56.990
was this is not a problem for libraries
 

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.840
was this is not a problem for libraries
this is a possibility for higher

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:58.850
this is a possibility for higher
 

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.189
this is a possibility for higher
education and the and the community and

00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199
education and the and the community and
 

00:15:02.199 --> 00:15:05.049
education and the and the community and
we started a process which has gotten

00:15:05.049 --> 00:15:05.059
we started a process which has gotten
 

00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:08.230
we started a process which has gotten
stronger at ARL which is exactly along

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240
stronger at ARL which is exactly along
 

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.549
stronger at ARL which is exactly along
the lines at the ennis talking about

00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:09.559
the lines at the ennis talking about
 

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:11.889
the lines at the ennis talking about
working with other organizations not

00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:11.899
working with other organizations not
 

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:13.780
working with other organizations not
just sort of thinking about how

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:13.790
just sort of thinking about how
 

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.400
just sort of thinking about how
organization works so we're working with

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:15.410
organization works so we're working with
 

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:20.139
organization works so we're working with
the AAU and the APL you on a project

00:15:20.139 --> 00:15:20.149
the AAU and the APL you on a project
 

00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:22.420
the AAU and the APL you on a project
called chair and we've attracted a

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:22.430
called chair and we've attracted a
 

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.980
called chair and we've attracted a
number of other partners we're

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:23.990
number of other partners we're
 

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.920

entities and we're learning one of the
 

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.189
entities and we're learning one of the
things we had to learn in this process

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199
things we had to learn in this process
 

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:35.740
things we had to learn in this process
is held as an organization partner with

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:35.750
is held as an organization partner with
 

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.230
is held as an organization partner with
another organization and the other thing

that we've had to learn
 

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.090
that we've had to learn
is how can the collective I believe this

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:42.100
is how can the collective I believe this
 

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.400
is how can the collective I believe this
is right and maybe mark and correct me I

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:44.410
is right and maybe mark and correct me I
 

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.010
is right and maybe mark and correct me I
think there are 11,000 people who work

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:47.020
think there are 11,000 people who work
 

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.470
think there are 11,000 people who work
in ARL libraries something along those

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.480
in ARL libraries something along those
 

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.680
in ARL libraries something along those
lines and there is an enormous amount of

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:52.690
lines and there is an enormous amount of
 

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.260
lines and there is an enormous amount of
expertise among those 11 1000 folks is

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:55.270
expertise among those 11 1000 folks is
 

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.139
expertise among those 11 1000 folks is
there a way to marshal that expertise to

00:15:58.139 --> 00:15:58.149
there a way to marshal that expertise to
 

00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:01.530
there a way to marshal that expertise to
to to tackle these wicked problems

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:01.540
to to tackle these wicked problems
 

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.410
to to tackle these wicked problems
together because many of them and you

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:04.420
together because many of them and you
 

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.910
together because many of them and you
heard the last panel and everybody

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920
heard the last panel and everybody
 

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.579
heard the last panel and everybody
talking about these problems are are

00:16:07.579 --> 00:16:07.589
talking about these problems are are
 

00:16:07.589 --> 00:16:11.460
talking about these problems are are
beyond one library we have organizations

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:11.470
beyond one library we have organizations
 

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.130
beyond one library we have organizations
like ARL who actually can do that and

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:14.140
like ARL who actually can do that and
 

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.440
like ARL who actually can do that and
that was the idea so so trying to get

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:16.450
that was the idea so so trying to get
 

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.410
that was the idea so so trying to get
people to do it is it's a it's a

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:19.420
people to do it is it's a it's a
 

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.180
people to do it is it's a it's a
different kind of a question it's

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:21.190
different kind of a question it's
 

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.550
different kind of a question it's
learning how to collaborate and learning

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560
learning how to collaborate and learning
 

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.800
learning how to collaborate and learning
how to be a partner and then how do you

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:25.810
how to be a partner and then how do you
 

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.290
how to be a partner and then how do you
actually translate that into action so

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:28.300
actually translate that into action so
 

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.940
actually translate that into action so
that's that's those are the issues that

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:29.950
that's that's those are the issues that
 

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.310
that's that's those are the issues that
were we're struggling with right now and

if I don't know that I've ever seen the
strategic plan is we're not going to do

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.000
strategic plan is we're not going to do
 

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.700
strategic plan is we're not going to do
this and we did this and it didn't work

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:38.710
this and we did this and it didn't work
 

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.180
this and we did this and it didn't work
and therefore we're going to do this

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:41.190
and therefore we're going to do this
 

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.360
and therefore we're going to do this

just I was thinking about what Miguel

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.050
just I was thinking about what Miguel
 

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.080
just I was thinking about what Miguel
was saying about being a librarian in

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.090
was saying about being a librarian in
 

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.590
was saying about being a librarian in
like control and I I think actually this

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600
like control and I I think actually this
 

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.870
like control and I I think actually this
is a cultural issue that is harder for

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880
is a cultural issue that is harder for
 

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.370
is a cultural issue that is harder for
this group than for other groups to to

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:05.380
this group than for other groups to to
 

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.500
this group than for other groups to to
allow for risk and creativity because I

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:07.510
allow for risk and creativity because I
 

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.370
allow for risk and creativity because I
think the only the only marker of doing

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:11.380
think the only the only marker of doing
 

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.800
think the only the only marker of doing
things well as doing it perfectly and I

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:13.810
things well as doing it perfectly and I
 

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.770
things well as doing it perfectly and I
and I think that that something that we

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:16.780
and I think that that something that we
 

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.810
and I think that that something that we
have to give up and it's very hard to

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:18.820
have to give up and it's very hard to
 

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.370
have to give up and it's very hard to
give up because i think it's baked into

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:20.380
give up because i think it's baked into
 

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.580
give up because i think it's baked into
the DNA of what we do and i'm just

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:23.590
the DNA of what we do and i'm just
 

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.870
the DNA of what we do and i'm just
thinking about the satan the share

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880
thinking about the satan the share
 

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.540
thinking about the satan the share
project you know i'm thinking about sort

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:27.550

our metadata scheme into one or two and
 

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.420
our metadata scheme into one or two and
now we have has done said many of them

now we have has done said many of them

pick your own and the data that we're

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:38.770
pick your own and the data that we're
 

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.550
pick your own and the data that we're
putting together for share now we have

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:40.560
putting together for share now we have
 

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.350
putting together for share now we have
350,000 records that we've gathered in

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360
350,000 records that we've gathered in
 

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.420
350,000 records that we've gathered in
the last few months and trying to make

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:45.430
the last few months and trying to make
 

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.100
the last few months and trying to make
sense of the metadata is really another

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.110
sense of the metadata is really another
 

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.200
sense of the metadata is really another
wicked problem so it seems to me we have

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.210
wicked problem so it seems to me we have
 

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.200
wicked problem so it seems to me we have
to try some things that aren't perfect

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.210
to try some things that aren't perfect
 

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.260
to try some things that aren't perfect
and we have to approximate things and I

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:55.270
and we have to approximate things and I
 

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.270
and we have to approximate things and I
think this is this goes to your point

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280
think this is this goes to your point
 

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.510
think this is this goes to your point
about consensus and also talking to

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520
about consensus and also talking to
 

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.040
about consensus and also talking to
ourselves I think the other thing we

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:02.050
ourselves I think the other thing we
 

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.630
ourselves I think the other thing we
need to do is remember that we're part

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640
need to do is remember that we're part
 

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.240
need to do is remember that we're part
of a larger ecosystem in the case of

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:06.250
of a larger ecosystem in the case of
 

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.780
of a larger ecosystem in the case of
research libraries the higher education

research libraries the higher education
 

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.160
research libraries the higher education
ecosystem and this has to be something

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:11.170
ecosystem and this has to be something
 

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.440
ecosystem and this has to be something
we work out with faculty with students

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:13.450
we work out with faculty with students
 

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.630
we work out with faculty with students
with other administrators so that we

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640
with other administrators so that we
 

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.880
with other administrators so that we
start to approximate answers that that

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:17.890
start to approximate answers that that
 

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.690
start to approximate answers that that
may not that may not be perfect

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:19.700
may not that may not be perfect
 

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.850
may not that may not be perfect
in an old-fashioned library sense of

in an old-fashioned library sense of
 

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.029
in an old-fashioned library sense of

we need to get to so the long-range

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:27.110
we need to get to so the long-range
 

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.379
we need to get to so the long-range
piece and the risk piece and the

00:22:29.379 --> 00:22:29.389
piece and the risk piece and the
 

00:22:29.389 --> 00:22:32.139
piece and the risk piece and the
creativity piece are things that I think

00:22:32.139 --> 00:22:32.149
creativity piece are things that I think
 

00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:34.750
creativity piece are things that I think
we like to think long range but I think

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760
we like to think long range but I think
 

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.549
we like to think long range but I think
risking creativity are going to have to

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559
risking creativity are going to have to
 

00:22:36.559 --> 00:22:38.169
risking creativity are going to have to
play a role in that long range and I

00:22:38.169 --> 00:22:38.179
play a role in that long range and I
 

00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:39.850
play a role in that long range and I
don't know how that's going to work so

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:39.860
don't know how that's going to work so
 

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.200
don't know how that's going to work so
it's a really that's why i think we all

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.210
it's a really that's why i think we all
 

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.690
it's a really that's why i think we all
stopped when you asked that question

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:42.700
stopped when you asked that question
 

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.250
stopped when you asked that question
it's it's a good question but it's not a

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:45.260
it's it's a good question but it's not a
 

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.600
it's it's a good question but it's not a
simple one tan turn and it's a this is

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:49.610
simple one tan turn and it's a this is
 

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.450
simple one tan turn and it's a this is
where leadership become so incredibly

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:51.460
where leadership become so incredibly
 

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:58.000
where leadership become so incredibly
important a lot of leaders will say I I

want this organization to take risks and

00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799
want this organization to take risks and
 

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:03.490
want this organization to take risks and
we're going to celebrate failure and

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:03.500
we're going to celebrate failure and
 

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.340
we're going to celebrate failure and
learn from failure and but the as soon

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:06.350
learn from failure and but the as soon
 

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:10.240

as there's a problem it's a crisis so it

this is in the application of the plan

00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039
this is in the application of the plan
 

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:16.659
this is in the application of the plan
where you see creativity and innovation

00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:16.669
where you see creativity and innovation

where you see creativity and innovation
um and it that's when the leader shows

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760
um and it that's when the leader shows
 

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.769
um and it that's when the leader shows
by example that we're trying to learn

00:23:26.769 --> 00:23:26.779
by example that we're trying to learn
 

00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:31.480
by example that we're trying to learn
things from problems we encounter if we

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:31.490
things from problems we encounter if we
 

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.690
things from problems we encounter if we
aren't successful we admit it and start

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:34.700
aren't successful we admit it and start

over and this is where politics comes in
you know sometimes it's just not

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.090
you know sometimes it's just not
 

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:45.180
you know sometimes it's just not
politically smart to admit failure but

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:45.190
politically smart to admit failure but
 

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:48.129
politically smart to admit failure but
internally we can learn from those

00:23:48.129 --> 00:23:48.139
internally we can learn from those
 

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:50.289
internally we can learn from those
things and actually figure out how to

00:23:50.289 --> 00:23:50.299
things and actually figure out how to
 

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:53.169
things and actually figure out how to

take risks as an organization as an
organization excuse me I think the risk

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600
organization excuse me I think the risk
 

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.360
organization excuse me I think the risk
and creativity question is probably one

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:58.370
and creativity question is probably one
 

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.830
and creativity question is probably one
of the things that drove me a little

00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840
of the things that drove me a little
 

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.330
of the things that drove me a little
crazy about how do you plan the campus

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:01.340
crazy about how do you plan the campus
 

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.610
crazy about how do you plan the campus
of the future and this was the second

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:03.620
of the future and this was the second
 

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.190
of the future and this was the second
time i had read this the first time and

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200
time i had read this the first time and
 

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.049
time i had read this the first time and
the second time i had the same response

00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:08.059
the second time i had the same response
 

00:24:08.059 --> 00:24:11.080
the second time i had the same response
it's really easy to be creative and to

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.090
it's really easy to be creative and to
 

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.639
it's really easy to be creative and to
take risks when you have two billion

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:12.649
take risks when you have two billion
 

00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:14.799
take risks when you have two billion
dollars in a blank slate it just makes

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:14.809
dollars in a blank slate it just makes
 

00:24:14.809 --> 00:24:17.830
dollars in a blank slate it just makes
life a lot easier and and i talked to a

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840
life a lot easier and and i talked to a
 

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.110
life a lot easier and and i talked to a
lot of libraries and they are frightened

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.120
lot of libraries and they are frightened
 

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.909
lot of libraries and they are frightened
i think of taking risk sometimes and i
