one of the problems that we always have

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
one of the problems that we always have
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.540
one of the problems that we always have
is the kind of culture in which say

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
is the kind of culture in which say
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.690
is the kind of culture in which say
children involved it's hard to replicate

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700
children involved it's hard to replicate
 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.109
children involved it's hard to replicate
in our current in our current culture so

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
in our current in our current culture so

I always say sort of ideally what you'd

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
I always say sort of ideally what you'd
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.810
I always say sort of ideally what you'd
have is a 6 to 1 ratio where you could

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
have is a 6 to 1 ratio where you could
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.089
have is a 6 to 1 ratio where you could
have six grown-ups taking care of each

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099
have six grown-ups taking care of each
 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.120
have six grown-ups taking care of each
child and maybe a better way of putting

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130
child and maybe a better way of putting
 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.999
child and maybe a better way of putting
it is that you'd have a community of

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009
it is that you'd have a community of
 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.870
it is that you'd have a community of
parents you'd have a community of

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
parents you'd have a community of
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880
parents you'd have a community of
caregivers the children are there as

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
caregivers the children are there as
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250
caregivers the children are there as
part of that community it's not as if

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
part of that community it's not as if
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.110
part of that community it's not as if
anybody is sitting there and doing a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
anybody is sitting there and doing a
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.549
anybody is sitting there and doing a
bunch of special things that are just

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
bunch of special things that are just
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.740
bunch of special things that are just
directed at the child so the vision that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
directed at the child so the vision that
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.450
directed at the child so the vision that
we have from school there's someone

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
we have from school there's someone
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.549
we have from school there's someone
who's got this special responsibility of

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
who's got this special responsibility of
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.319
who's got this special responsibility of
shaping the education of the child is

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
shaping the education of the child is
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.350
shaping the education of the child is
the vision that is often imported into

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
the vision that is often imported into
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.930
the vision that is often imported into
being a parent so there's some special

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
being a parent so there's some special
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700
being a parent so there's some special
set of things you should do some you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
set of things you should do some you
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.490
set of things you should do some you
know flashcards or video or something

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
know flashcards or video or something
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.319
know flashcards or video or something
other than what you would normally do

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
other than what you would normally do
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000
other than what you would normally do
that's the thing that you are supposed

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010
that's the thing that you are supposed
 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.880
that's the thing that you are supposed
to do to educate the child and what the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
to do to educate the child and what the
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010
to do to educate the child and what the
data the research shows is that children

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
data the research shows is that children
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440
data the research shows is that children
are learning from just observing and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
are learning from just observing and
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060
are learning from just observing and
participating in the everyday things

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
participating in the everyday things
 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.429
participating in the everyday things
that people are doing in an incredibly

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
that people are doing in an incredibly
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.190
that people are doing in an incredibly
subtle and powerful way so all the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
subtle and powerful way so all the
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.100
subtle and powerful way so all the
conscious I mean the irony is that the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
conscious I mean the irony is that the
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.870
conscious I mean the irony is that the
unconscious things that you do when

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
unconscious things that you do when
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.399
unconscious things that you do when
you're in when you're interacting with

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
you're in when you're interacting with
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.140
you're in when you're interacting with
children are much more likely to shape

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
children are much more likely to shape
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880
children are much more likely to shape
and affect the way they think than any

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
and affect the way they think than any
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.690
and affect the way they think than any
of the things that you actually

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
of the things that you actually
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.480
of the things that you actually
consciously decide to do and I think we

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490
consciously decide to do and I think we
 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999
consciously decide to do and I think we
have some lovely models for the way that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
have some lovely models for the way that
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.460
have some lovely models for the way that
for example my personal favorite is

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
for example my personal favorite is
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.880
for example my personal favorite is
cooking so my grandchildren come in and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
cooking so my grandchildren come in and
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.789
cooking so my grandchildren come in and
cook with me children love cooking they

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
cook with me children love cooking they
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.310
cook with me children love cooking they
love being involved in there's nothing

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
love being involved in there's nothing
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.139
love being involved in there's nothing
that seems more interesting to them than

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
that seems more interesting to them than
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.030
that seems more interesting to them than
an adult she's actually trying to do

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
an adult she's actually trying to do
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.350
an adult she's actually trying to do
something actually trying to bring

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
something actually trying to bring
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389
something actually trying to bring
something about and integrating them

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
something about and integrating them
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.899
something about and integrating them
into that work so in a sense in in the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
into that work so in a sense in in the
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.929
into that work so in a sense in in the
village the line between here's work and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
village the line between here's work and
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.679
village the line between here's work and
here's children just wasn't there now

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
here's children just wasn't there now
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.929
here's children just wasn't there now
the question is what do we do now to try

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
the question is what do we do now to try
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.780
the question is what do we do now to try
to when that's no longer true we're no

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
to when that's no longer true we're no
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.340
to when that's no longer true we're no
longer growing up in a village what can

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
longer growing up in a village what can
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.990
longer growing up in a village what can
we do now to kind of recreate that

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
we do now to kind of recreate that
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.940
we do now to kind of recreate that
situation and I think the best

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
situation and I think the best
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.550
situation and I think the best
preschools essentially recreate

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
preschools essentially recreate
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.050
preschools essentially recreate
that village for children so what they

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
that village for children so what they
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.750
that village for children so what they
do is put children in a context with a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
do is put children in a context with a
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.420
do is put children in a context with a
lot of adults who really care about them

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
lot of adults who really care about them
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.360
lot of adults who really care about them
who are who are warm who are supportive

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
who are who are warm who are supportive
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.150
who are who are warm who are supportive
and lots of stuff for them to play with

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160
and lots of stuff for them to play with
 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.559
and lots of stuff for them to play with
another thing another thing I say

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569
another thing another thing I say
 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.940
another thing another thing I say
sometimes it's you really wanted to know

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
sometimes it's you really wanted to know
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.339
sometimes it's you really wanted to know
what children preschool children young

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349
what children preschool children young
 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.080
what children preschool children young
children need to thrive they need mud

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
children need to thrive they need mud
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.110
children need to thrive they need mud
livestock and relatives and those are

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
livestock and relatives and those are
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.790
livestock and relatives and those are
things that are in sort of short supply

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
things that are in sort of short supply
 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.400
things that are in sort of short supply
but we can try and say a a good

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410
but we can try and say a a good
 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.130
but we can try and say a a good
preschool to replace the mud livestock

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140
preschool to replace the mud livestock
 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.090
preschool to replace the mud livestock
in relatives with good teachers and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100
in relatives with good teachers and
 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.250
in relatives with good teachers and
cocoons and caterpillars and sand boxes

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260
cocoons and caterpillars and sand boxes
 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.830
cocoons and caterpillars and sand boxes
but that's much more what young children

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840
but that's much more what young children
 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.930
but that's much more what young children
are learning for then although kind of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
are learning for then although kind of
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.630
are learning for then although kind of
very scholastic academic activities that

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640
very scholastic academic activities that
 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.250
very scholastic academic activities that
parents feel as if they need to engage

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
parents feel as if they need to engage
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.559
parents feel as if they need to engage
in and I think that also makes life as a

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569
in and I think that also makes life as a
 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.600
in and I think that also makes life as a
working parent easier than if you think

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610
working parent easier than if you think
 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.550
working parent easier than if you think
that you have one job and then you have

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560
that you have one job and then you have
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.009
that you have one job and then you have
another job to think that you have a job

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019
another job to think that you have a job
 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.550
another job to think that you have a job
and then you have this relationship this

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560
and then you have this relationship this
 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.190
and then you have this relationship this
kind of form of love that you have with

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
kind of form of love that you have with
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.259
kind of form of love that you have with
these children that you're engaged in

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269
these children that you're engaged in
 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.500
these children that you're engaged in
it's not the same thing as work part of

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510
it's not the same thing as work part of
 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.880
it's not the same thing as work part of
the trouble in our culture in our

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890
the trouble in our culture in our
 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.080
the trouble in our culture in our
society is that we measure everything we

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
society is that we measure everything we
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.640
society is that we measure everything we
treat everything as if it's either a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650
treat everything as if it's either a
 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.199
treat everything as if it's either a
kind of production or a kind of

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209
kind of production or a kind of
 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.300
kind of production or a kind of
consumption so from that perspective

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310
consumption so from that perspective
 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.030
consumption so from that perspective
either having children is an extremely

expensive luxury and caregiving for
 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.319
expensive luxury and caregiving for

make decisions for them to to keep them
alive and the outcome of all that is to

on autonomous enough so they can take
risks and taking risks means the
