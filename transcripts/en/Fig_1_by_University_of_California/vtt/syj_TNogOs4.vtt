00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.200
(Could poop power our cars?)

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.980
DAVID WERNICK: There's a lot of protein waste that we produce

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.219
right now as a society
that are not really used. In 2008, it was

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.559
estimated that there's about 1 billion tons
of manure.

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.269
That is a lot of manure that is not fully
utilized.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.699
A good portion of that is left to aerobically
compost

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.500
and that produces a lot of nitrous oxide and a lot of

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.099
methane emissions, which are green house gases that

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:31.490
325 times more potent than CO2, respectively.
Our laboratory works on applying biology and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.129
biological principles to solve engineering
problems. Anything that comes from a nonrenewable

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.109
source, we're looking to develop a renewable
way to make it.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.510
We're looking at using all sorts of different
waste feed stocks, anything such as agricultural

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.180
waste, like manure, municipal waste, like
sewage, plant matter. And we work with a variety

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.500
of different bacteria, a variety of different
organisms, to get them to produce different

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.329
compounds. And what we're focused on right
now is sort of advanced biofuels. They have

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.270
more favorable properties as a fuel than ethanol.
Ethanol's not an ideal biofuel. It doesn't

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.220
have the exact same burning properties as
any of the other liquid transportation fuels

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.090
that we use. It is not quite as energy dense
and it is corrosive to metal and to the fuel

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.140
infrastructure that we already have in place.
We try to produce branched chain alcohols

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.860
that are a little larger and they're therefor
more energy-dense and they burn more like

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.060
real gasoline. They're therefor compatible
with current fuel infrastructure. You can

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.900
drop it right into your car. You don't need
any modifications. (How do you make biofuel?)

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.820
Bacteria have evolved over billions and billions
of years to find protein in the environment

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.640
and then use that to grow. However, we don't
want them to do that. We try to engineer the

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.430
metabolism of bacteria so that instead of
just growing on this protein, they will now

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.470
take a good portion of it to produce products
for us. So bacillus subtilis is a soil organism.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.030
It's recognized as safe by the FDA, which
is a good step for developing this process

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.490
for industrial deployment. We've engineered
bacillus subtilis to produce alcohol biofuels

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.880
and ammonia, but we don't have the highest
yield. So what we're doing right now is trying

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.730
to further study the metabolism of this organism.
See how we can alter it, adjust it. Once we

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.140
improve our yield of biofuels, then we can
start looking at can we scale production of

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.849
this up. To me, it's important that we come
up with technology for renewable energy. In

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.209
an academic setting, you know, we have a little
more freedom to investigate basic science,

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.129
generate new theories, new hypotheses, that
you might not be able to do in a corporate

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:38.540
setting. And because of this we can be sort
of an engine for generating new ideas. And

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.879
right now we're working with guidance from
a company in industry and well as the U.S.

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:50.849
Department of Energy to make something economically
solvent or viable on an industrial scale.
