1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
[inaudible] the only regret that I have is that we couldn't do more because

2
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.600
guess what?
After America did pull out isis took Ramadi,

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.270
and when they got in Ramadi and we had friends that were there,

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.280
Isis went and found the families that had worked with coalition forces

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.970
prevalently and they murdered about 500 families.

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.900
So that sickens my heart that that's horrible.

7
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.060
So when you hear that politically,
it sort of gets back to,

8
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:31.830
we were talking about earlier that,
you know,
when they say,
all right,

9
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.590
well we're going to get out this day like,
oh,
it's gotta be over.

10
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:36.060
We've got in this thing,
we got to get out this day.

11
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:39.930
And you know that that's counter to what you've learned sort of on the ground.

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.440
That's just gotta be the worst thing you could hear.
Yeah.
One of the words,

13
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:47.160
even if you don't want a conflict to continue,
first of all,

14
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.280
there's no one that wants conflict less than the people that have to go and

15
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:56.790
fight it.
Right.
When we sign up for a war,

16
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.210
it's my friends and not just my friends,

17
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:04.220
but it's the military that's going to go out and die.
When,

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.130
when we sign up,
oh,
there's a conflict we need to take care of.
So yes,
uh,

19
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.380
we don't want to go to war.
If you go to war,
you go to war to win.

20
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.200
In the situation that happened in Iraq,
we pulled out completely.

21
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.390
There was not,
there was no one that had fought in Iraq that thought,
Oh,

22
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.190
good call.
That's a great call there.
There was embers of the inserts.

23
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.080
The insurgency had been,
had been all but crushed,

24
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.060
but it had not been completely extinguished.

25
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:37.260
And there were embers of insurgents that were there.

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.150
And as soon as we pulled out,
they started growing.

27
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:42.750
And that's what turned into Isis.
Yeah.
So that's,
that's around 2008 ish,
right?

28
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.340
Something like that.
Yeah.
So then what,

29
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.540
what is sort of a more sensible way of leaving something?
So you could,

30
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.070
you do a certain amount of cleanup,
let's say,

31
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:53.070
and you freeze some of these cities and,
and good things have happened,

32
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.720
but you don't want to be there forever.
How do you manage that?

33
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.780
That end with the stresses of just the political machinations and all that
stuff?

34
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.561
Yeah,
I mean that's,

35
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:04.500
that's something that you have to look at every situation that you're in and you

36
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.230
have to say,
okay,
well what can we do here?
How,

37
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.870
how much can we draw down our troops?
And it's not,

38
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.550
it's not a certain amount of time.
It's not a certain amount of troops.
You,

39
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.510
you have to look at each situation and do an assessment and figure out the best

40
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:22.250
way to move forward and guess what you won't,
you won't be perfect.
And,

41
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.720
and that's why an absolute thing like,
hey,
we're just gonna,

42
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.410
we're not going to do this anymore,
is a risky move.
So what do you think's go?

43
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:32.220
So like when Obama did that,
what do you think his military leaders who,

44
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.950
I'm sure you probably respect some of them or maybe even know some of them.

45
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.460
What do you think they were telling him that because it's so counter to what

46
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:42.930
you're laying out here.
I'm sure they told them,
this is not a good idea.

47
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.550
This is not a good idea.
There's,
like I said,

48
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.000
there's no one that had spent time on the ground in Iraq that said,
Oh,

49
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:52.980
you know what?
We're good.
Let's leave.

50
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.240
Because it was still a very,

51
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.560
a very fragile situation.
Yeah.
And uh,
it looked good.

52
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.750
It looked good on paper,
but you have to give the,

53
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.840
the civilian populace enough time to really kind of figure out how to live this

54
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:16.600
way because it's a new way to live.
You're oppressed under Saddam,

55
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.990
then you're oppressed under some insurgency.

56
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.980
And to have that be lifted and then say,
okay,
we look around,

57
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.970
it's gonna take some time to figure out how we're going to do this.

58
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.230
And we needed to provide them with enough security and stabilization that they

59
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:36.400
could.
It's not like we were working hard.
The last few Lafe uh,

60
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.410
who wrote the book books with me,

61
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.400
he deployed in 2010 I want to say they had,
so what?

62
00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:44.800
While I was in Ramadi,

63
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.400
there was a guy wounded or killed almost every day for the six months in,

64
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:51.340
we were,
there was a guy wounded or killed almost every day and robotic,

65
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.170
sometimes two,
sometimes five,
sometimes seven,

66
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:57.760
sometimes one when life went back to Al Anbar province.

67
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:01.810
So LMR province that the province that Ramadi is the capital of.

68
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.610
In his six month deployment,

69
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.950
there was one fatality for all of coalition forces money who is from a vehicle

70
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.020
rollover.
Wow.
So it was,

71
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.610
it wasn't like we were over there gutting it out anymore with the insurgence.

72
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.010
The insurgence had been really,

73
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.070
really suppressed and we just needed to give the locals enough time to kind of

74
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.500
put things together and start to move forward and become stable,

75
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.930
politically stable,
economically stable.

76
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.200
And that is what we should have done.

77
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.650
Do you think it's our moral responsibility to do actions like this?
If we,

78
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:41.440
if we can help people that are living in these horrible situations that morally

79
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.260
and at we,
I mean we,
the United States have to do it.

80
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.090
I think that we have to weigh the morality of taking care of other people and

81
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:56.170
taking care of our own people.
Right?
So when you,

82
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.740
and this is a very difficult decision to make and some that I've talked about on

83
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.920
my podcast was the genocide in Rwanda.

84
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.010
So the genocide in Rwanda happened and there was 800,000 Tutsis that were killed

85
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.790
by Hutus in a hundred days.

86
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.150
So this is more efficient than Hitler was able to pull it off.
And by the way,

87
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:20.380
most of the killing was done,
98% of the killing was done with machetes.

88
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.010
So this was just crazy when that was happening,

89
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.190
I was sitting off the coast with a Inicio platoon on a ship with a bunch of

90
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.540
marines,
a bunch of navy power,

91
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.710
and we could have gone in there and done something.
And we did.

92
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.930
And I would say that the primary reason that we didn't is because a year
earlier,

93
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.890
Black Hawk down had happened.
And we lost a bunch of service members in Somalia.

94
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.660
And so I was like,
hmm,
you know what?

95
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:48.760
We don't really want to get involved in that again.

96
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.150
And so that's what we have to weigh is we have to wait,

97
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.440
what are we willing to lose in order to save someone else?

98
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.320
And then what do we benefit from saving those people?

99
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.770
And is that benefit worth the,

100
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.690
the expense in money and lives that we invest into it.

101
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.621
And sure,

102
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:12.710
some of that benefit is feeling like we can look ourselves in the mirror as a

103
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.280
country.
That's part of the benefit.
Part of the benefit might.

104
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.050
Sure there's economic benefits.
Sure there's political benefit.

105
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.320
But part of the benefit is can we look in the mirror and say,
you know what,

106
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.750
we almost a million people were butchered in this country and we didn't do

107
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:30.380
anything about it.
That's something that we have to contend with.

108
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:32.480
And that's why these decisions are hard to make.
And,

109
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.470
and when you do make these commitments as a country,

110
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.500
then you need to commit and not go halfhearted into these efforts.

111
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.550
If you're gonna,
if you're gonna risk American lives,

112
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.560
you better be doing it for a reason.

113
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.960
That is that merits putting our,

114
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.870
our men and women at risk.

115
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.160
What do you make of the catch 22 that America's in with this dilemma all the

116
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:58.010
time where it's like,
if we don't do anything,
no one does it,

117
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.840
but then every time we do do something,

118
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:02.660
there's always the unintended consequences and how long do we have to be there

119
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:04.340
and everything else.
It's a really,
it's a,

120
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:08.990
it's a strange bargain that America's sort of put in or put itself in.

121
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.790
Well,
yeah.
Then this is,

122
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.210
we started off this conversation talking about leadership and why leadership is

123
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:18.680
so hard.
Leadership is hard because decisions,
it's not two plus two equals four.

124
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.840
It's,
it's,
it's not that at all.

125
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.960
There's this insane amount of calculus and and secondary and tertiary things

126
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:29.000
that happen after you make a move that you think is good.

127
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.470
This is what makes it so hard and that's why,
you know,

128
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.040
for America as the leader of the free world,
guess what?

129
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.150
Being in that leadership position,
it's a hard position to be in.
And,

130
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.030
and guess what?
Just like a leader,
just like when I was a leader,

131
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.460
when I was a leader of a scope to and when I was leader of a seal.
Tasking,

132
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.690
did I do everything perfect?
Absolutely not.
I made mistakes.

133
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.090
I made mistakes,
I made mistakes where people died.

134
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.440
And that is the burden of leadership that you bear.

135
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.880
And so as a nation,
we're in the same situation.
The things that we do,

136
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:05.900
we are not going to do things perfectly.
We have to do them with the best intent,

137
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.700
which I believe we do.
But things aren't going to go perfectly.

138
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.050
And guess what?
Some people are going to be mad when you make those mistakes.

139
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.690
Some people are going to be mad.
Even when you do things right,

140
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.430
they're going to look at you and say,
Oh,
you shouldn't have done that.

141
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.310
That was the wrong thing to do.
Okay,
here's what we weighed out.

142
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.230
And you've gotta be willing to take those criticisms.

143
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:26.330
Leadership leadership has a very hard thing.

144
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.920
So what do you make of the guy in the White House now related to leadership?

145
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:32.960
Because even if we were just to look at her rack,
so it's like,
all right,

146
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:34.910
George W.
Bush got us into Iraq.

147
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.730
You can argue whether that was good or bad or whatever.

148
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.550
Obama got us out and as you just laid out,

149
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:43.220
maybe the way we got out was probably not the right way to do it.

150
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.940
It doesn't seem that from at least what I could tell that Trump is looking to

151
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:50.010
get us into extra awards or anything like that.
Well,

152
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.060
it certainly doesn't seem like he's looking to get us into any extra words.

153
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:57.630
I would agree with that.
And again,
there's,

154
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.430
I don't believe that,
hey,

155
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:03.480
we're going to be an isolationist nation and we're not gonna play on the world

156
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:07.410
stage.
I don't think that's the best thing.
The other end of the spectrum is,
hey,

157
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:09.060
we're going to go fight and police up,
but world,

158
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.350
that's not the right thing either.

159
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.620
The right thing is to look at each situation as it unfolds in the world and

160
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:19.840
make,
try and make the best decisions you can as a leader at that time.
And,

161
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.640
and again,
these are not easy decisions to make.
These are,

162
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.870
these are decisions that you make them and they still unfold the day after you

163
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:33.090
make a decision.
The minute after you make a decisions,

164
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.750
things unfold that you didn't expect,
that you didn't anticipate,

165
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.530
and yet you made a decision.
So now you've gotta make another decision.
And,

166
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.250
and it's,
it's a challenge.
What do you make of him just as a leader,

167
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.890
if we were looking at the gray the way you would grade a leader,

168
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.280
how would you look at Trump from a leadership perspective?
Yeah,

169
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.260
I think Trump is an interesting characteristic of some really broad extremes,

170
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.260
right?
So he does things that I say,
Oh,
good move.

171
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.840
And then literally 20 minutes later,
20 minutes later,
I'll be thinking to myself,

172
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.780
what,
what,
how can you even think that this is,
uh,

173
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.230
a decent thing to do?
Right?
And,
and by that I mean,
you know,

174
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:23.130
jumping out on Twitter and criticizing some kind of,

175
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.540
pursue some,
some individual humans,
celebrity or celebrity.
Yeah.
Hey,

176
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.840
what are you doing?
Why,
why are you doing that?
Uh,
you know,

177
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:35.640
so I think the guy who was it that just the,

178
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.520
the testimony that just took place and Michael Color.
Yeah.

179
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.560
So Michael Coleman gets up and says that Trump is a bad character

180
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.010
and I'm like,
okay,
you know,
I mean this is,
this to me is not a surprise.
I mean,

181
00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:54.060
I don't think this is a big surprise.
Anyone.
This is not,

182
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.560
this is a guy that he's not the guy that you want your daughter to marry.

183
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:03.300
At least.
At least I don't want my daughters to marry someone like that.
Okay.

184
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.040
So what's his character like?
Not the one that we want to model ourselves after.

185
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.620
Do we want,
do we expect,

186
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.190
do we want a leader to be someone that we can look up to and model ourselves

187
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:18.960
after?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
We want to look at us,
look at our leader and say,

188
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.943
wow,

189
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.220
I really respect that person and I want to follow them and I'm going to emulate

190
00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:26.160
their,
their actions and their behavior.
That's,
that's absolutely,

191
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:31.050
that's what a leader is.
Yeah.
So does Trump fall short on that?
Oh yes he does.

192
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.170
Yes he does.
So it's a,

193
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.050
it's a strange world that we live in,

194
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:42.030
that that guy versus Hillary Clinton who he ran against.

195
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.410
Neither one of those people are people that,

196
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.210
that you look at and say seems like,
seems like a character I want to emulate.

197
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.130
That's what I'm looking towards.
I want to be that person.
I want to,

198
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.110
I want to move in that direction.
You know,

199
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:58.630
from the 300 plus million people in America,

200
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:02.760
those are the two candidates that we put forward.
One is wrong with us.
Yeah.

201
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.450
That's a problem.
Well,
what is wrong with this?

202
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.850
What do you think the answer to that is?

203
00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:08.950
Is that just the way the political system set up or is that the media or is that

204
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:11.830
us?
Is it all due to the political system?
For sure.

205
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.920
I think it has to do with the,
the way that,

206
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.980
the way that media is and the waste celebrity is that the name is able to carry

207
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:23.650
itself.
The character that Burton a self branding that goes out,

208
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.710
I think drives so much of this that we're not really,

209
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.210
we're not really assessing what type of leader this person is going to be.

210
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.740
We're assessing how popular they are.

211
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.640
So for a guy that talks about discipline a lot,
when you see Trump tweeting,

212
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.860
is that what's going on in your head?
You're like,
man,

213
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.190
this is just a discipline thing.
Like you get some of these things right?

214
00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:47.020
And if you could just discipline yourself in another way.
Yeah,
I would say that.

215
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.160
I thought when,
when Trump won the election,

216
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.910
and I was just as surprised as anyone when Trump won the election,
I thought,

217
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:56.080
okay,
well you know what,

218
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.040
at least now we're going to get to see him step up and act presidential,

219
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.820
all that.
What did it take 15 minutes before he looked at it and said,
okay guys,

220
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.240
okay,
it's gonna take him a little bit longer than I thought.
But,

221
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.200
but it hasn't changed and it was the same thing.

222
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.830
You'd see Hillary Clinton do the same types of things where you do doing

223
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:15.400
behavior that you'd say to yourself,
why are you doing that?

224
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.960
W W w.
W.
W you don't do that.
You don't do those kinds of things.

225
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:22.600
You don't behave that way and so

226
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.430
I think you just have to,
you know,
we have to kind of go through,

227
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:32.431
I hope that this is a situation where this is a a point,

228
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.260
a pivot point for the country where we'll start looking around and saying,
okay,

229
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:39.490
we don't really want to do that.

230
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.270
We want to look for the right person that's going to do this job correctly.

231
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:47.410
That's going to represent the country well and are you worried that we don't get

232
00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:48.040
out of this?

233
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.880
Whatever this thing is that everyone can sort of feel and no one knows exactly

234
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:54.100
what what it is.
Just this,

235
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.610
this endless bickering and how it seems like social media is making us all hate

236
00:13:57.611 --> 00:14:00.190
each other and then we don't,
that we don't have real,

237
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.500
at least at the political level leaders to look up to.

238
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.940
If you're looking for self discipline and morality and whatever else,
you know,

239
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:10.940
when people,
I had people right when Trump got elected,
you know,

240
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.630
people would just fly off the handle with me.
Right?
And,

241
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.140
and I don't really talk about politics very often.

242
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:20.230
And the reason I don't talk about politics very often is because,

243
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.890
well,
because from a leadership perspective,

244
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.220
if I'm trying to get you to do something,

245
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.430
the worst way to lead is for me to bark at you and tell you what to do.

246
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.900
That's not good leadership.

247
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.550
So I don't do that with people that I communicate with.
I don't say,
Hey,
he's,

248
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.210
he's horrible and she's great,
or she's horrible.
And he's got,
oh,

249
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.720
I don't say that.
I just,

250
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:46.530
I just give examples from history about the way good leaders behave and the way

251
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:49.390
badly misbehave and let people make their own decisions.

252
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.990
But somebody was hitting me up,
hey,
you know,
you need to,

253
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:57.560
you need to speak out.
And you know,
I said,
okay,
well here's my speech.

254
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.570
America is stronger than one man.
America is stronger than one man.

255
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.370
America is stronger than any one individual politician.
We're,

256
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.480
we're a massive,
you know,

257
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.100
massive ship and a massive ship takes a long time to turn.

258
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.860
And the checks and balances that are in place inside the government,

259
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.220
which are sometimes really,
really bureaucratic and,

260
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.780
and disappointing an aggravating because it's so hard to change things.
They're,

261
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.070
they're hard to change for a reason.

262
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.590
So am I worried that this is at this tipping point won't come?
No.

263
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.120
It'll come eventually because eventually free people,

264
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.790
the free people of America won't allow for things to go so far in one direction

265
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.520
or so far in the other direction.
We won't allow it now.

266
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.600
What makes it hard to reach that tipping point is because America,
it's so,

267
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.070
it's so beautiful in America,
right?
There's,
there's,
it's such a stress free life,

268
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:54.530
right?
It's just,
there's,
you know,

269
00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:59.531
we were in the middle of two wars and that didn't affect the average American in

270
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:05.360
any way whatsoever,
that not even the oil prices,
like nothing affected them.

271
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.130
They were still driving the SUV to Starbucks and ordering a Latte with zero

272
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:10.790
impact.

273
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.150
And that was when we were fighting two wars and lead losing people every day.

274
00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:16.220
On those battlefields.
It was no factor.

275
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.230
So what happens in Americas,
we,
we're,

276
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.780
we pretty much don't care as long as we're comfortable,

277
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.680
but if things start to get uncomfortable,
that's when I think the,

278
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.790
the real tipping point will come and there'll be a backlash one way or the
other.

279
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.370
Yeah.
All right.
I want to shift off some of the worst stuff,
but very quickly.

280
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.930
So since you mentioned the two wars,

281
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.470
the one that nobody ever talks about or even thinks about is Afghanistan,

282
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:42.650
which I think now it's the longest war we've ever been in,
right?
I mean,

283
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:45.740
this is the longest war.
It's still ongoing now.

284
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:49.800
It seems to me that nobody knows really why we're there or why this is so a and

285
00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:54.270
going,
what the hell should we be doing or thinking about or will you need to,

286
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.540
it's never discussed,
period.
Yeah.

287
00:16:56.541 --> 00:17:00.080
And it's interesting because this is something when,
when Trump,

288
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.330
if you remember Trump said,
hey,
what's the plan?

289
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:06.680
And he got a bunch of pushback and people were saying,
Oh,
who's he to asking?

290
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.370
And I was like,
well,
he's the president.
And so yeah,
you need some kind of a plan.

291
00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:14.420
You need some kind of a goal and I do think that needs clear definition in

292
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:16.940
Afghanistan of what it is we're trying to make happen.

293
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:23.240
What does that look like?
I,
you know,
from my perspective,

294
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.890
when you get into these countries where you're trying to build something,

295
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:28.670
we're trying to,

296
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.760
you're not trying to build yourself and trying to allow them to be free.

297
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.340
That's what you're really trying to make happen.

298
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.920
You're trying to allow these countries to be free.

299
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:38.450
They're not going to be the same as us.

300
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.450
That's one thing that I'm fairly confident about.

301
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.280
There's different cultures that are going to adopt freedom and democracy in a

302
00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:51.281
different way and you can't impose what we think it should be like on other

303
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:54.960
cultures because it doesn't match up perfectly,

304
00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.500
but it can match up pretty well and individual human beings in these countries,

305
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.020
you know what they want.
They want a job,
they want to build a little business.

306
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.180
They want to be able to feed their kids.

307
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.460
They want their kids to have a better opportunity than they do.

308
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.230
That's what you can,
when you can provide some of that,

309
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.520
that will start to take hold and when you provide some of it,

310
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.060
other people in that country will look at it goes,
hmm,

311
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.890
that seems to be a pretty good deal over there.
I would like to try that too.

312
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.580
And pretty soon you can get freedom and democracy,

313
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:37.080
the attitude of it too to expand and so it takes a long time.

314
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.130
You know the average counter insurgency is seven years,
but they can take really,

315
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:45.630
really long time.
But
in my opinion,

316
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.040
and really through the history of the world,

317
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.470
eventually in my mind,
eventually at through history,

318
00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:00.860
eventually the free individual will rise to the top and and rule and,

319
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.400
and they will rule themselves.

320
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.760
And so you have to give that opportunity for individual freedom.

321
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:11.760
You,

322
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.470
they have to have the opportunity to grow and to take root and take good solid

323
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:20.580
root and to grow and be strong enough that when tyranny comes along,

324
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.260
it can't just wipe it out because tierny can wipe out the individuals without

325
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:25.550
priming.

326
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:29.610
We've seen that big history to Tierny can wipe out and destroy individual

327
00:19:29.611 --> 00:19:33.270
freedoms and individual really individual aspirations.

328
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.750
They can just be mopped up and destroyed by a tyranny.
Tyranny.

329
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.050
So you have to give freedom and individual freedom,

330
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.050
not just the time to sprout up a little bit.

331
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:48.380
You got to give it the time to take root because once people have tasted true

332
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:52.890
freedom and true opportunity,
they don't give it up.

333
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.410
And that's what I think you have to do.

334
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:59.970
You have to stay somewhere long enough that people understand what true freedom

335
00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:00.600
is.

336
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.580
They recognize that it's theirs to protect and it has to be rooted strong enough

337
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:08.520
that it can't be white washed away by tyranny.

338
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.380
So then going all the way back.
So what are we doing in Afghanistan?
I mean,

339
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:15.300
do you sense that that's actually happening there?

340
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.110
Cause it's like something like 14 years or something and it's one of these

341
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:24.111
things where we oscillate too much on what it is that we're trying to accomplish

342
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:29.100
and what we're willing to sacrifice to accomplish it.
Because you know,

343
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:33.360
from an isolationist perspective,
from a,
from a,
okay,

344
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:38.160
let's just take of America,
take care of America.
Oh,
let's take the Taliban.
Oh,

345
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:42.540
you want to live in like a world you want your country to be,
you know,

346
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.810
back in the stone age and that's how you want to live.
Okay,
cool.

347
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.930
We'll be over here doing our thing.
Like that's,
that's,
yeah,
that's,
that's,

348
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:53.980
that's uh,
all legitimate plant.
Hey,
you guys want to live in the stone age?

349
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.540
Cool.
We'll be over here with i-phones.
That's fine.
We don't care.

350
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.690
But then it's like,
okay,
but we're going to breed terrorists,
but okay,
we'll,

351
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:04.900
we'll comment on occasionally and knock those guys out.
How's that?
Okay.

352
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.760
We could do that.
And that's if that's the plan.
Okay,
let that be the plan.

353
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.960
But if we're going to stay there,

354
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.790
if we're going to try and get freedom to take root,

355
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.720
which I believe is the best thing to do because I do believe that we do have

356
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:21.750
some level of moral obligation to try and support individual freedom throughout

357
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:26.890
the world.
That's,
that's to me,
that's pretty self evident.

358
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.920
Does that mean that we have to jump in everywhere,
that there's oppression?
No,

359
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:30.754
it doesn't.
And we can't.

360
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.160
And it also means that inside those countries,

361
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:41.910
the human beings inside those countries also has a moral obligation to rise up

362
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.870
and fight on their own.
And I was nice about going back to Iraq was,
you know,

363
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:50.170
I've got friends that fought in Mozel as I took Mozal back,

364
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:53.860
but those were Iraqi troops that were moving from building to building,

365
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.770
taking massive casualties.
As a matter of fact,

366
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.660
one of my friends that was there said there was in the beginning of the Moselle

367
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:06.040
campaign,
the Americans were looking at each other saying,
hey,

368
00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.730
these guys are taking so many casualties,

369
00:22:07.731 --> 00:22:10.630
we're going to run out of Iraqi soldiers.
Like they're all going to die.

370
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.410
And the Iraqi soldiers continued to go forward and they continue to fight and

371
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.840
they ended up,
you know,
getting the upper hand.

372
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.210
<v 1>And so when they say that,
that we were greeted as liberators is,
it actually is</v>

373
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.770
<v 0>true.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Oh my God.
I mean in Mozel.</v>

374
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.030
Oh,
it was I,
and again,
I wasn't there and I never fought in Afghanistan either.

375
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.220
But the guys coming back from Bozel,

376
00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:35.060
those are the people were absolutely just they were,
they were,

377
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:40.880
they were being everything enslaved,
beheaded,
tortured,
everything.

378
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.870
It was absolutely,
it was heinous.
Yeah,
it was.
It was,
it was a heinous war.

379
00:22:44.871 --> 00:22:47.330
Crime across the board.
So yeah,
absolutely.

380
00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.170
<v 1>So we are,
we've done a lot sort of out of our borders here,</v>

381
00:22:51.171 --> 00:22:52.790
but it's interesting you mentioned that,
you know,

382
00:22:52.791 --> 00:22:55.610
in the middle we can be in the middle of all of these words and yet we can still

383
00:22:55.611 --> 00:22:58.730
get a latte and we can still pay no attention to it and live our good lies.

384
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.420
Do you think there's a risk to our freedom here because of that?

385
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.660
That we've got it so freaking good that we almost don't know what freedom is

386
00:23:07.971 --> 00:23:08.804
anymore?

387
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.020
<v 0>Do I think it's an actual risk?
No,
no,</v>

388
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:18.930
no,
I don't.

389
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.790
I think that the minute things,

390
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.590
the minute you start really talking about taking away the personal freedoms of

391
00:23:28.591 --> 00:23:33.570
Americans,
there will be real problems.
So,
okay.
Is that a risk?
Sure.

392
00:23:33.571 --> 00:23:34.590
That that could be a risk.

393
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:39.210
I see that as a real small chance that things get bad enough where,

394
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:45.060
where mass groups of Americans say,
Oh yeah,
we're not,
we're not,
we're not,

395
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.240
we're not doing that.
You just crossed the line,
you know,
the,

396
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.280
the American revolution,
right?
Oh,
do you want to raise t taxes?
No,

397
00:23:52.281 --> 00:23:53.720
actually we're going to fight a war against you.

398
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:56.900
You're not raising the tea taxes.
Right.
That's,
could it get to that point here?

399
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.510
Sure.
But you've got to remember what's going to be sacrificed and yeah,

400
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.560
that's one of the coolest things about the American revolution is the people

401
00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:06.950
that fought it with the people that actually had the most to lose the people

402
00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:10.370
that stood up.
So it would take,
it would take a lot,
but,
um,
I,
I don't,

403
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.690
<v 3>okay.</v>

404
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.160
<v 0>I think it would take a lot to get there.</v>

405
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:19.370
I think it would take a lot to get there.
And if it gets there,
that'd be sad.

406
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.880
It'll be a sad day.
But I believe that freedom would prevail.

407
00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.510
<v 1>All right,
let's,
let's shift all together to sort of what you're doing now.</v>

408
00:24:27.511 --> 00:24:31.740
So podcasting,
writing,
all that stuff happened,
these kinds of conversations.
Um,

409
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.130
it's kind of cool that,
that people are paying attention to this stuff now,

410
00:24:35.131 --> 00:24:37.880
isn't it?
When you started doing the podcast,
was that just sort of,

411
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.860
you were just going to throw it out there and see what happens and see if,

412
00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.460
oh wow.
People might want to listen to long forum conversation.
Yeah.

413
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.140
I did a podcast with Tim Ferriss

414
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.150
<v 0>and when he press stop on the recorder,
he said,
you should do your own podcast.</v>

415
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:52.280
And then Joe Rogan heard it invited me on.

416
00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:54.650
So it was on Joe Rogan's podcast in the middle of that podcast are rung and
said,

417
00:24:54.651 --> 00:24:55.520
you should have your own podcast.

418
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:58.040
So when Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan tell you to have a podcast,

419
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.690
they have a podcast.
You listen.
So I did.
And for me it's a,

420
00:25:02.691 --> 00:25:06.320
it's a,
it's a great medium.
I always,
when I grew up,

421
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.750
I grew up listening to radio shows and so

422
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:15.590
I always liked listening to radio and that's essentially what it is,

423
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:18.530
is radio without commercials.
And

424
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.790
I get to talk about things that I'm interested in.
And again,
you know,
the,
the,

425
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.290
some of the advice that I got when I started off was like,
oh,

426
00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:30.080
you need to have guests all the time.
People are getting tired of,
you don't,

427
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.510
don't talk about these dark,
you know,

428
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:34.550
don't talk about these dark violent things on,

429
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.850
you can't talk about war all the time and you need to keep them shorter and all

430
00:25:37.851 --> 00:25:41.360
this night and listen to anybody.
And My podcasts are really long.

431
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:45.500
Some of them are extremely heavy and dark and talk about some of the worst.

432
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:46.851
In fact,

433
00:25:46.851 --> 00:25:51.140
I think we've covered most of the really the worst things that have unfolded on

434
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:55.790
the planet.
And they're long.
And I don't have a lot of guests,
you know,

435
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:58.280
I do have gas,
but I don't have a lot of guests.
So

436
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.630
the interesting thing is yes,
shockingly enough people,

437
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:07.370
people listen to it and the connection and the feedback is,
is awesome.

438
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:08.900
Yeah.
How do you think it's changed you

439
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.710
<v 1>by going into all those dark places and talking about all this stuff and,</v>

440
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.000
and expressing your ideas and all that?

441
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.320
<v 0>Well I've gotten,
I've,
I've gotten a lot,</v>

442
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:24.020
I've gotten a lot of experience out of it.
The experience I get out of it as I,

443
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.750
so I do a lot of book,
I covered a lot of historical books.
Like I said,

444
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:30.710
first person accounts of war and atrocity in that.

445
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.060
When I first started the podcast I say,
well you know I probably got,

446
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.050
I'll probably do five cause I got like five books that really had an impact on

447
00:26:39.051 --> 00:26:43.860
me.
So I'll cover those books and then oh whatever.
That'll probably be it.

448
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.870
And then I said,
you know,

449
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.960
there was one more book that I really want to throw in this pot.

450
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.830
And then there was another one and it didn't take but you know,

451
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:57.780
five or six more podcasts where I said I'm never going to be able to do the pod

452
00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.850
enough podcast to cover the things that I want to talk about.

453
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.820
And that's the way it's been.
So I've read,

454
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:08.750
I read basically a book a week for the last three years and you know,

455
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:13.950
I,
I finished doing all the books that I,
that I actually had already read.

456
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.510
And like I'm in like,
I dunno.
So you're like,
I better write some then.
Yeah.

457
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:22.370
Well I'd already written my first book when the podcast came out.
Uh Huh.
So,

458
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.350
so how has it changed me and the other,

459
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.970
the other great thing is I get to interact with all these people and

460
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.420
people come up and I know they do this to you.

461
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:38.160
Two people come up to me and they say,
I know,
I feel like,
I know it's weird,

462
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:41.580
but I feel like you know me.
And I'm like,
yeah,
you do know me.

463
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:46.530
Because how I am on the podcast is actually how I am.
That's just me.
And,

464
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.270
and then I tell them that I actually know them too.

465
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:51.210
Because if they've listened to me for 500 hours,

466
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.290
you haven't spent 500 hours listening to your water.
You know what I mean?

467
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:57.070
It's like that's just not happening.
Yeah.

468
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.470
So I do know them and then they gave great feedback and I learned a lot from,

469
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.480
from the books that I read,

470
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:07.980
from the people that I have had on and from the feedback that I get.
And Hey,

471
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:11.310
read this book,
look at this aspect.
So it's made me,

472
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.590
it's made me learn a lot.

473
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.130
So from first person war books and all your life experience,

474
00:28:17.131 --> 00:28:21.840
how do we end up with,
we got two of them here,
I think.
Children's books.

475
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.520
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Right here.
Well,
so there's the Dragon,
the Dragon.

476
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:30.810
So yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't,
I didn't write,

477
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.320
I didn't,
I didn't,
I didn't give Jordan any credit for it.
You know,

478
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.240
it's called Mike and the dragons Jordan.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Um,

479
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:45.000
I got four kids and as I started

480
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.790
continuing to hear back from people that were listening to what I was saying,

481
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.270
and the,
what I hear a lot is,
I wish I had this when I was a kid.

482
00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:57.480
I wish I had this when I was a kid.
And of course my answer would be like,

483
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.750
I do too.
I wish I had the lessons from extreme ownership when I was a kid.

484
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.750
I wish I had the lessons from the discipline equals freedom field manual.

485
00:29:03.751 --> 00:29:08.370
And I was a kid.
Absolutely.
And grown up or watching my own children grow up.

486
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:13.290
I just knew that the things that I tried to impart on them,

487
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:19.010
I figured I could put into stories where I could impart those values onto little

488
00:29:20.941 --> 00:29:25.710
kits and make their lives easier and better.
And that's it.

489
00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:27.270
So I started writing them and it was

490
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.540
surprising that at the,
the response,
the response has been,
you know,

491
00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:35.190
people love him.
And you know,

492
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:39.870
one of my favorite letters I've gotten is I got this letter from this guy who,

493
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:40.201
you know,

494
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:44.740
he's saying I'm 37 years old and I was drinking and I was overweight and I was

495
00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:47.380
doing it,
hadn't been promoted.
And I got all these problems going on his life.

496
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:50.020
And he said,
I read your book.
And I said,
okay,
I'm gonna wake up a little early.

497
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:52.270
Okay,
I'm gonna start working out.
Okay,
I'm going to stop complaining.
Okay.

498
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:56.800
And he went through his whole letter and how now he had lost 52 pounds and he

499
00:29:56.801 --> 00:29:59.470
had been promoted and he had stopped drinking and all this stuff.

500
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:02.710
And then the last line said,
the book I read was the way of the warrior kid,

501
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.050
which is aimed at kids.

502
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:10.050
But the lessons in there are completely universal and apply to your whole life.

503
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.790
So it's been,
it's been great.

504
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:17.791
And I get a lot of social media posts of little kids studying flashcards because

505
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:22.210
the premise of the warrior kid story is that there's a little kid who's,

506
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.110
he can't do any pull ups,
he doesn't know how to swim.

507
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:31.410
He's getting picked on by the school bully Kenny Williamson and he doesn't know

508
00:30:32.471 --> 00:30:35.770
his times tables and the last day of school ends and he's all sad.

509
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.940
And then you remembers that his uncle Jake is coming to stay with him for the

510
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.190
summer and his uncle Jake was in the seal teams.

511
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.700
So his uncle Jay comes to stay and first day said,
hey,
you know,

512
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.640
what do you want to do tomorrow and do something?
You want to go for a swim?

513
00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.410
And the kid goes a little notice swim and I don't know how to,
you know,

514
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.550
don't know my times tables getting picked on.
So the uncle says,
look,

515
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:57.940
these aren't problems we can solve all these,
gets them into Jujitsu classes,

516
00:30:57.941 --> 00:30:58.661
teach them how to swim,

517
00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:02.890
teaches them how to study using flashcards and other memorization techniques and

518
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.970
teaching them how to eat right,
teaches them to work out and the kid turns,

519
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.040
turns around.
And so that's that one.

520
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:14.160
Mike and the dragons is about facing your dragons and little kid that's scared

521
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:19.471
of everything and he finds a book under his bed and it's the opens it up quickly

522
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:23.410
and there's a bunch of pictures in it that looks scary of dragons and fire.

523
00:31:23.411 --> 00:31:24.760
And so he's doesn't want to read it.

524
00:31:24.761 --> 00:31:27.970
But there's also a picture in there of a little kid that looks confident and

525
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:30.730
like he knows what he's doing.
So he says,
all right,
you know what?

526
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:31.630
I'm going to read this book.

527
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.130
And then you turn the page in this book and you are now looking at the cover of

528
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:38.290
this next book,
which is called the dragon prince.

529
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.440
And that's the story of a kingdom where the king had died and now there was no

530
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:48.490
one to defend the kingdom from the dragons except for this little seven year old

531
00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:50.860
prints.
And so he's scared.

532
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.970
He goes to get his father's sword in his father sealed to opens up this big war

533
00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:59.030
chest.
And in there he pulls out the store against too heavy for him.

534
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.290
He pulls out the shield,
it's too heavy for him,
and he's even more scared now.

535
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:06.130
And then he sees a note at the bottom of the war chest and he pulls it out and

536
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:07.240
it's a note from his father,

537
00:32:07.241 --> 00:32:11.830
the king who explains to him what he needs to do to stand up and face the

538
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:16.750
dragons and the story continues on.
So I enjoy storytelling.
Yeah.

539
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:17.531
Well I sent,

540
00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:20.890
I sent an animated movie and I guess the last thing I got for you is what do you

541
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:24.790
do to relax after all this,
after all the work and everything else,

542
00:32:24.791 --> 00:32:26.600
and it's a pretty intense life that you're living,

543
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.410
I'm guessing you're going to say working out,
but give me something off.
Well,

544
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.960
work.
Does that include Jujitsu?
Yeah.
Well,

545
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:35.030
that's still within the working out thing,
but whatever works for me,
that's it.

546
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.800
You know what?
I surf,
I do Jujitsu.
I hang out with my kids,
play guitar,
and

547
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:45.260
yeah,
I find this stuff relaxing.
It's enjoyable for me to to write.

548
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.670
It's enjoyable for me to talk to people about leadership and go out with my

549
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.451
company.

550
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:55.451
I saw up front and teach and align executives on leadership and watch them be

551
00:32:58.341 --> 00:33:03.140
able to turn their company around or bring their company to the next level based

552
00:33:03.141 --> 00:33:05.780
on 100% on leadership,
which is what I tell them.
I say,
look,

553
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:07.880
you've got this problem.
You've got that problem.
You've got another problem.

554
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.990
Every problem that you have inside your organization is a leadership problem.

555
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.090
I guess that means you slayed the dragon and you're,

556
00:33:15.091 --> 00:33:17.090
you're doing the right thing in life.
It's been a pleasure,
man.

557
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.910
Appreciate you finally were able to do this and for more on Jacko,

558
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.340
you can follow him on Twitter at Jocko Willink.
