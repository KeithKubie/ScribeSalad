00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:03.837
I wrote it, I sent it, I'm ****d

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.379 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So it's my senior
year of college

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.849
and I've got really hot
Saturday night plans.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.950 align:start size:84% position:16%
Order Chinese takeout
and then eat it.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.052 align:start size:84% position:16%
I looked in the bag
and there was no fork.

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.620 align:start size:97% position:3%
(buzzer humming)
And there were no chopsticks.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.055 align:start size:84% position:16%
(buzzer humming)
There was no vehicle

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:25.358 align:start size:84% position:16%
with which the
Singapore rice noodles

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.959 align:start size:97% position:3%
could travel into my mouth.
(chips crunching)

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.762 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, in a blind rage,
I sent an e-mail

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.397
to what I thought was my dorm.

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:34.033
Hey guys, does anyone
have a fork I can use?

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.268
But I sent it to
my entire school.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.236
(air horn blaring)

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:38.905
The backlash was immediate.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:40.306
Ding, ding, ding.
(bell ringing)

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.875 align:start size:88% position:13%
Everywhere I have
notifications telling me

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.377
to go fork myself.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.646
Someone responded, yeah,
I have a fork you can use.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.748 align:start size:84% position:16%
Someone else
responded unsubscribe.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.916 align:start size:88% position:13%
And that was a freshman
who responded that.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.485
That is like as alpha move.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.588 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
Then later, someone posted,
is it really necessary

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:58.291 line:0%
to e-mail the entire
school about a fork?

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:01.294 line:0%
Which, as you know, is
the thing that I did.

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:03.129
That one got 200 likes.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.832 align:start position:0%
And then somebody else responded
to it, saying, seconded.

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:08.334
Literally just saying I agree.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.903 align:start size:84% position:16%
Which is, by the way,
what a like does.

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:12.438
That go 100 likes.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.140
People saw that first post
and were like, yeah, mad.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.911 line:0%
And then they saw that second
post that just said, uh huh,

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:21.280 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and they were like,
yeah, I'm even madder.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.349 line:0%
So, uh, I guess my protip

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.851
here would be

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:27.687 align:start size:84% position:16%
if you want to unite
a lot of people,

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.122
send them all an e-mail.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.790 align:start size:97% position:3%
They'll hate you, but they'll
grow to love each other.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.624
(bell dings)
