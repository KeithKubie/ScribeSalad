00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:04.337
My opponent tonight is activist
and author Ijeoma Oluo.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.805
Here's what you need to know.

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:08.508
Her new book is called 
 So You Want to Talk About Race.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.677
I can't wait for the sequel--
 Friendship-Destroying Argument.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.312
(laughter)

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.415
She's the editor-at-large
at The Establishment,

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.784
a media platform run
and funded by women.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.486
I look forward
to mansplaining truth to power.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.455
And Harper's Bazaar 
called her book

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:25.158
"One of the ten books
to read in 2018."

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.393
Stop planning my life, Harper!

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.962
Ijeoma Oluo, everybody.
Welcome.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:32.331
-Thanks for having me.
-Ijeoma?

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.333
(applause and cheering)

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.936
So you want to talk about race.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.639
I generally... do not.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:42.075
Why are you making me talk
about race?

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.777 line:0%
Well, I figured titling it,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.446 line:0%
 So You've Been Dragged
 Kicking and Screaming

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.015 line:0%
 -Into Talking About Race was
a bit long. -That is long.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.850 line:0%
Yeah. So I figured I'd give you
the benefit of the doubt,

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.819 line:0%
since you're there, you have to
have the conversation.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.687
Might as well say you wanted to
do it in the first place.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.156
-Great. So you're putting me in
a position of power. -Yeah.

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:01.394
How do I win, how do I win the
conversation about race?

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.729
You know what's interesting
is you really can't win

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.231
a conversation about race.

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:08.401
Well, uh, you got to give me
a shot, you know?

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.270
So we're talking about
lived realities, right?

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:13.706 line:0%
If you say that you had cereal
for breakfast,

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.375 line:0%
and I say no, you did not have
cereal for breakfast,

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:18.478 line:0%
I can't really win
that conversation.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:21.647
If I say I had oatmeal, so that
means you didn't have cereal,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.783
there's no winner
in that conversation.

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:25.518
When we're talking about race,
we're talking about

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:27.620
what I experience
as a black woman,

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.956
what you experience
as a white man.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.458
There's no winner when we're
talking about lived experiences,

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:33.926
there's only understanding.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.530
Well, what if I ate all the eggs
so nobody could have breakfast?

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:39.565
That's an experience
that we all share.

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:41.567
I'm the guy who gets breakfast
and you don't.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.136
Is that... ?

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.238
Well, then the conversation
really is about

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.074
why you ate all of the eggs and
you felt that was appropriate.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:50.376
And that might have something to
do with race.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.478
-You think so?
-It might.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.413
I don't see. I don't...

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:56.382
(applause and cheering)

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.353
I just have an instinct to want
everything and more,

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:03.589
and neglect other people having
the equal amount.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:06.125
I... I don't see the connection.

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.994
Um...

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.762
I want to look at
your book here.

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:11.931
Your titles of each chapter,

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:14.767
they kind of do the interview
for me.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.969
You break it down each chapter,
what is racism?

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.539
Why am I always being told to
check my privilege?

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.374
Why can't I touch your hair?

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:25.611
I just call it-- I just got
called racist, what do I do now?

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:28.814
Hypothetical, I just got called
racist, what do I do now?

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:30.816
(laughter)

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.319 line:0%
I would say,
first take a deep breathe

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.288 line:0%
before you start responding
and say,

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.957 line:0%
"No I'm not racist.
I didn't do anything racist."

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.960
Stop and listen and think,
"Someone is trying to give me

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:42.995
"an opportunity to learn about
my actions

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:44.964
and how they may be
harming someone."

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:46.999
And pause and think,
"Where can I learn?"

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:48.734
Ask more questions.

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:52.104
Ask what you said or did that
might have been racist.

00:02:52.137 --> 00:02:53.973
And maybe Google a little,
because chances are,

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:55.508
you're not the first person
to do that thing.

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.109
And chances are someone's
written a lot

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:58.611
about why it is racist.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.513
Are these conversations
happening in America?

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.548
Do people want to have this
conversation?

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:04.350
These conversations are
definitely happening,

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:07.119
but when they happen without
thought and care,

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:09.755
it's pretty much just a
shouting match.

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:11.424 line:0%
But we need to be able to talk
about race,

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:12.959 line:0%
because believe it or not,

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.094 line:0%
we're always talking about race.

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:16.762
We're talking about it
in the ways

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:19.298
in which we don't ask people
what they need

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.000
and what their experiences are.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.536
We're talking about it in our
every day decisions.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.105
So we might as well try to do it
with a little thought and care.

00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:29.041
-Did you see the Super Bowl
last night? -I did not.

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:31.677
I did, like you, though,
see a lot of the commercials.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.479
There were great commercials,
right?

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:35.181
Isn't it inspiring that we've
gotten to a place

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:37.683
where somebody like MLK
can sell us trucks?

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:39.785 line:0%
I'm gonna have to impose a
moratorium

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:42.622 line:0%
on white people ever talking
about Martin Luther King.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.524
-It's-it's something that I feel
like, -I'm great.

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:48.227
um, has been abused.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.530
I will first say, write a book
report on Martin Luther King,

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:53.332
and then maybe you can talk
about him,

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:55.101
because until it's been shown

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.403
that it can be done responsibly
by white America,

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:59.705
I think it's best to leave that
to us for now.

00:03:59.738 --> 00:04:03.276
Isn't he a good gateway hero to
start talking about race?

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.745
Oh, I would absolutely love it
if people would listen

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:09.849
-to what Dr. King said about
race. -Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:13.352
That's one angle.
Do you have something else?

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.955
I know my book is called So You
 Want to Talk About Race,

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:19.558
but it's really, so some people
need to listen about race

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.794
while other people talk
about race.

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.497
And the people who need to
listen are kind of like you.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.832
Tell me something
I already know.

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:29.402
What you already know

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.737
is that race is in everything.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.873
And when you are not talking
about race,

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.741
when you think you're not
talking about race,

00:04:35.774 --> 00:04:37.476
you're talking about whiteness,

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.412
because it has infused
our entire culture.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:43.015
So if you don't want to say
"play the race card,"

00:04:43.048 --> 00:04:45.918
you'll start talking about race
with more intention,

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:48.621
so that way we can actually
discover issues

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:51.524
of racial oppression in this
society, and get to the point

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:54.427
where things maybe won't be
always about race.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.962
-It's in everything?
-Everything.

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:59.498
-It's like paprika.
-Yes.

00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:01.133
Good to know.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.469
Her book is called,
 So You Want to Talk About Race.

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:04.968
Ijeoma Oluo, everyone.
