00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.990
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.680
It is my pleasure to
introduce Jacob Silverman.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.370
I am [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.160
I work in new
business development

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.680
here in Mountain View.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.780
Jacob Silverman's
recently released book,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.950
"Terms of Service," is a
call for social media users

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.120
to take back ownership
of their digital lives.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.490
Integrating politics, sociology,
pop culture, and technology,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.660
Silverman explores the
surprising conformity

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.430
at the heart of the
digital culture,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.440
and what it means now that
none of us can ever be alone.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.250
Reflecting on the implications
of the collapsed barriers

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.530
between our private and public
lives, "Terms of Service"

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.860
explains how social
media companies

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.250
engineer their products to
encourage shallow engagements

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.320
and discourage dissent.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.560
Illuminating the new era of
connectivity as never before,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.770
Silverman brings into
focus the inner conflict

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.410
we feel when deciding what to
share and what to quote "like,"

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.040
and explains how
we can take steps

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.512
we need to free ourselves.

00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:02.470
Silverman's work has been
published in "The New

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.230
York Times," "The Los
Angeles Times," "Slate,"

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.460
"The Atlantic,"
"The New Republic,"

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.100
and many other publications.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.570
In 2008, "The Virginia
Quarterly Review"

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.190
recognized him as one of the
top literary critics under 30.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.450
And in 2012-- this
is the coolest part--

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.669
he was a three-time
"Jeopardy" champion.

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:22.960
He lives in Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.620
And I also want to
say a couple words,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.055
because I've known
Jacob for 18-plus years.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.390
He and I went to high
school and college together.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.150
And so I thought, given
that some of his work

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.460
is obviously critical of social
media companies, of which we

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.867
are included, I was really glad
to bring him here to Google,

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:45.700
because I know that
this is a community that

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.780
encourages discourse and is
welcoming of challenging ideas.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.690
And also because I thought
it would be really fun slash

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.770
ironic slash potentially
inappropriate

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.140
for me to go through
my old emails

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.850
and find something about Jacob--

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.285
JACOB SILVERMAN: Oh, no.

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:08.660
MALE SPEAKER:
--and then publicly

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.630
display it not only
here in this room,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.150
but also for the
YouTube audience,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.950
possibly in favor of
those who he critiques.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.640
And so I went through my emails.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.655
And the interesting
thing is-- so Jacob

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:23.700
and I have been
friends for many years,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.947
and he was, with me,
an early Facebook user.

00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:27.780
What's interesting is
that Facebook actually

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.790
did a really good job
of having everything

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.920
that he ever posted
on my wall removed.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.117
So there was lots of gems in
there, but I couldn't get them.

00:02:36.117 --> 00:02:38.450
JACOB SILVERMAN: Because I
deleted my account, you mean?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.658
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, because
you deleted your account.

00:02:40.658 --> 00:02:42.510
But what I did
find-- and I put this

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.895
at the end of your slide deck.

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:50.770
And by sending this slide deck
to me, Google owns it all.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.710
But this was the
first thing I found,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.750
which is Jacob forwarding
me a feature in CNN.com

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.320
about what it's like
to work at Google.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.440
And he said, and I
quote, "Looks amazing."

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.980
JACOB SILVERMAN:
I was naive then.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.814
MALE SPEAKER: A naive,
aspirational Googler.

00:03:06.814 --> 00:03:08.979
And then the second was
actually pretty interesting.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.980
So this is when I
searched "Google Jacob."

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.730
And then when I searched
"Facebook Jacob" I got this,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.216
was amazingly consistent
with Jacob's current views.

00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:23.590
OK, so without
talking much more,

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.530
I'll introduce Jacob Silverman.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:31.700
JACOB SILVERMAN: That was great.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.658
I thought it was going
to be more embarrassing.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.260
Hello.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.590
Thanks for having me.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.620
So this is the kind of very
lofty and pretentious title

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.985
of my talk, but it gives
you a sense of what

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:46.472
I'm going to be talking about.

00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:48.180
I'm going to also be
talking about issues

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.390
that are related to my book and
related to what [INAUDIBLE] was

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.230
talking about, but
some of the stuff

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.590
is sort of new--
or at least, new

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.160
for me to be talking
about-- and kind

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.270
of a jumping-off point of
where my book has brought me

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.750
and some of the issues
that concern me now.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.329
So I'd like to start with
this one, this image macro.

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.620
Perhaps you've seen something
like this floating around

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.720
on social media
over the last year.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.279
I think it's a
pretty clever setup.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.860
Look at all those people
immersed in their newspapers

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.070
and not talking to each other.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.370
With that one line,
"All this technology

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.210
is making us anti-social,"
an argument is made.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.770
It is also, I think, totally
wrong and misleading,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.240
but it's a useful
departure point

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.160
for considering how we
talk about technology

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.890
and our relationship to it.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.090
And I think the sheer popularity
of images and arguments

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.680
like this tells us a lot about
how we think about technology

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.690
and how we relate to it.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.240
But first, let's
figure out what's

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.390
really going on in this scene.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.790
We should start
by narrowing down

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.370
what is actually
meant by "technology,"

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.490
a broad term that we often
use as a helpful shorthand,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.050
but that can lead us
down some rabbit holes.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.620
Here, technology simply
refers to these newspapers

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.030
that everyone is reading.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.390
And newspapers are
technology, or at least,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.800
the convergence of
many technologies

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.980
surrounding printing,
production, delivery,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.410
and so on.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.140
Newspapers are such
a good technology

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.500
that they've stuck around--
embattled, sure, but not much

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.240
different than they were
100 or 200 years ago.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.040
The machines and processes
we use to make them

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.130
have vastly improved.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.340
The journalistic
culture has changed.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.480
But newspapers themselves are
rather similar-- newsprint,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.790
ink, some text, graphics.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.070
And newspapers are
tremendously useful things.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.274
They offer the day's news.

00:05:32.274 --> 00:05:34.190
You can fold them up and
put them in your bag.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.920
You can swat a fly with them
or use them as wrapping paper.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.930
You can take it in the bath
or give the paper to a friend.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.820
You can write notes on
it and tear out a page

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.720
and share it with your kids.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.477
You can stuff the
newspaper in a closet

00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:49.810
and 20 years later take it
out, and it'll probably still

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.559
be readable.

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.100
That's probably not going to be
the case with your smartphone

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.960
or laptop.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.740
But what else is going on here?

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.097
If I were a more
thorough researcher,

00:05:59.097 --> 00:06:01.430
I'd have tried to find out
the provenance of this photo.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.830
But I think it's also
more fun to speculate.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.010
To me it looks like a
passenger or commuter train,

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.150
perhaps in the 1940s.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.240
It appears to be an
English-speaking country,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.410
probably the United
States or perhaps England.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.270
The posters at the front of
the car seem to say "FREE,"

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.060
and another has a photo of
what looks like a soldier.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.780
That might be a draft poster
or something encouraging people

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.280
to buy war bonds, though
because there are so

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.040
many men on this train I
wonder if it's still wartime.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.290
We should also note that
there aren't many women here,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.370
nor a single person of color.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.050
This is mostly a
space for white men,

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.420
perhaps going to work at
the beginning of the day.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.220
So are these newspapers
making them anti-social,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.850
as that little comment
at the top would have it?

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.880
Not really, not in the
sense that newspapers

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.580
have their own volition and can
force someone to do something.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.110
In fact, they're probably all
reading the same newspaper,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.930
or from the same
one or two papers.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.340
Print media was pretty
vibrant in these times,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.847
with lots of competition.

00:06:59.847 --> 00:07:01.430
That means that
they're mostly reading

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.000
about the same events, perhaps
even the same articles,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.760
and in fact have much in common.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.332
What else?

00:07:07.332 --> 00:07:09.540
There are limits to how much
close reading we can do,

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.050
and we should keep in mind
that every photograph is

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.350
in some sense
constructed, and some are

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.270
more constructed than others.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.760
There's a degree
of staging here,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.060
something the photographer
was deliberately

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.180
trying to capture,
a scene of men

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.820
together-- alone, but
also together, as Sherry

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.755
Turkle describes it, immersed in
their daily papers and rituals.

00:07:32.544 --> 00:07:33.960
So how would the
scene look today?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.660
Maybe something like this.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.240
That image macro
implied that there

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.490
was a lineage between
old technologies

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.620
and new, occupying similar
places in the social fabric.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.920
Today this photo might be
on a subway or a plane.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.270
This is from Hong Kong, I
believe, with a smartphone

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.010
in every person's hand.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.170
It'd be a more diverse
crowd, but the train

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.570
would probably be crummier.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.480
This is hardly an era
in which we invest

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.400
in public infrastructure.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.180
Soon we'll all be
reading contentedly

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.880
in our own private
self-driven cars.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.585
And while today it'd
look like everyone

00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:06.600
was doing the same
thing, staring numbly

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.874
into the intoxicating glow
of a smartphone screen,

00:08:09.874 --> 00:08:11.540
they could be doing
any number of things

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.524
with these
multifunction devices.

00:08:13.524 --> 00:08:15.690
Few of them, I'm afraid,
would be reading newspapers

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.080
on their phones, but who knows.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.520
Maybe these imaginary
people would

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.490
be reading news and catching
up on the events of the world,

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.940
and not just scrolling
through social media feeds,

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.070
watching viral videos,
playing freemium games,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.800
and listening to low bit
rate streaming music.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.350
It's hard to say.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.590
Each person, though,
in this kind of scene

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.610
would be wrapped up in his or
her own highly personalized,

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.010
filtered world, even
as they all seem

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.400
to be absorbed with
the same technology--

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.226
a smartphone, today's
universal prosthetic.

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:50.570
If we go back for a second
to the original photo,

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.560
one other thing we can
say about newspapers

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.310
is that they don't change.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.840
They do decay, but
otherwise they're static.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.720
They won't update with
the next day's news.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.136
They won't push notifications
if something important develops.

00:09:03.136 --> 00:09:04.760
They won't interrupt
the act of reading

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.650
with an alert of a new
message from a friend.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.650
And they also-- and this
is pretty important,

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.660
I think-- won't collect any
information on their readers.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.750
They have ads, but these ads
don't know anything about us.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.980
Newspapers are dumb
analog objects--

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.590
not a perfect
technology, of course,

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.860
but I think with much to admire.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.000
Those smartphones, on the
other hand, those insulating

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.960
technologies that are
supposedly keeping us

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.070
from knowing one another,
are always on, always active.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.030
Increasingly, they're
watching us, monitoring us,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.580
trying to decode what we like,
who we are, how we behave.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.130
They're always snitching on
us, ostensibly for our benefit,

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.770
but really betraying
our confidence

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.820
and, yes, our privacy,
to whoever has

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.390
access to the data we produce.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.620
After all, surveillance is the
business model of the internet.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.730
Data is the great resource
and commodity of today,

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.570
though in this case
by data we really mean

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.110
personal information, habits,
preferences, and the like,

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.180
or our "likes," your personal
information and mine.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.460
And the more intimate
and revealing the better,

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.010
particularly if
this information can

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.430
be gathered over a long
period, giving whoever's

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.550
collecting it a picture of
your habits and tendencies.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.140
This pretty excessively
long preamble

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.290
is my way of introducing
a few themes for today,

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.980
namely surveillance,
data, privacy, power,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.990
and how they affect our lives.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.290
But I also started by focusing
on this photograph here,

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.450
because I think how we
talk about technology can

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.594
be just as important as
what we say about it.

00:10:33.594 --> 00:10:35.510
I have sort of one foot
in the academic world,

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.690
and people in academia are
always talking about discourse.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.070
This photograph reflects, I
think, a certain argument,

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.641
a certain worldview.

00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:45.890
In analyzing it, we come to
understand that technology

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.348
is not just something that
lives on its own, that's somehow

00:10:48.348 --> 00:10:51.000
ethically neutral
or an abstraction.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.870
A technology is an embodiment
of the social, political,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.740
and economic conditions
in which it's made

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.310
and in which it's used.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:02.880
It often incorporates human
intention and human error.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.120
This is a kind of crummy photo
that someone posted on Twitter,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.050
but it's a photo from a
middle school hallway.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.120
This is a poster,
and that's supposed

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.020
to be like a CCTV camera.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.200
Surveillance and data
collection have become central

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.110
to our lives and to the flow
of information and money today.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.190
But surveillance isn't benign.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.150
As the law scholar Frank
Pasquale says, surveillance

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.910
is not just a camera,
but an engine driving

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.620
society in a certain direction.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.590
He's right, and
it's worth thinking

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.970
about what that direction is.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.730
Surveillance is
generally coercive,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.390
instrumentalist, designed
to discover something

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.700
or to preserve a
state of affairs.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.260
When we're aware
of surveillance,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.593
especially when we come to
understand that the things we

00:11:45.593 --> 00:11:48.785
do and say are being fed into
systems that potentially shape

00:11:48.785 --> 00:11:51.470
our future experiences--
where we go,

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.560
what we see, what
opportunities we have,

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.320
whether law enforcement
decides we're a threat--

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.410
it alters the relationship.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.060
It potentially introduces a
kind of dissonance, a feeling

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.720
of self-consciousness.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.760
Perhaps if you're a student who
sees this poster walking down

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.551
the hall, I'm sure it might
put you a little ill at ease.

00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:11.050
But it's a
self-consciousness that's

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.260
difficult to contend with,
because so often there's

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.877
nothing we can do.

00:12:14.877 --> 00:12:16.960
Think about how you might
feel when a cop pulls up

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.120
alongside your car
or you notice a bank

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.640
of CCTV cameras in a store.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.910
Suddenly your attitude, your
manner of being in the world,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.870
shifts.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.260
You're on notice.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.830
We live in a culture
of surveillance,

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.810
but what does that mean exactly?

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.360
It's not just about
these processes

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.590
of monitoring, collecting,
sorting, and data mining.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.540
Surveillance is something
that's done to us,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.300
and it's something we do.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.970
So we watch reality TV.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.840
We set up cameras in our homes
to monitor children, pets,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.100
or babysitters.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.530
We broadcast our
lives on social media.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.170
We take videos of
cops because we're

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.200
worried about how they may
treat someone they're wrestling.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.550
We establish online
profiles and update them

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.690
so that we might
never feel invisible.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.400
We watch and are
watched all the time.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.040
This is how we often think
of surveillance these days.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.650
This is a panopticon,
in this case part

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.560
of an old prison in Illinois.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.290
Michel Foucault said that
the panopticon wasn't just

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.640
quote, "a dream building.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.580
It is the diagram of
a mechanism of power

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.200
reduced to its ideal form."

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.790
The 19th-century political
philosopher Jeremy Bentham

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.970
designed the panopticon
as a kind of ideal prison.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.360
Guards stand in the
tower in the middle.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.630
A ring of cells
surrounds the tower.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.280
Prisoners can see
the tower and have

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.250
the feeling of being
watched, which is supposed

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.980
to check their behavior.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.270
But in an ideal
panopticon, they can't tell

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.190
where a guard might be looking.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.590
The prisoners are totally
transparent to the guards,

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.230
while the guards are
opaque, shadowed, hidden.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.040
Sounds to me a little like the
relationship between citizens

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.460
and government today, or between
consumers and tech companies.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.225
But the panopticon metaphor
is a bit worn-out, simplistic.

00:13:58.225 --> 00:14:00.780
It's used all the
time now, and it's

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.559
perhaps time to move beyond it.

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:04.850
I think it doesn't quite
capture the fullness of what's

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.990
going on, nor how highly
distributed and variable

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.030
surveillance has become.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.720
Rather than living
under the unforgiving

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.026
gaze of a panoptic,
Orwellian society,

00:14:15.026 --> 00:14:16.400
it's more accurate
to say that we

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.740
live in a state of constant
possible surveillance.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.230
This is why Kafka, not Orwell,
is the great writer for today,

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.690
though Orwell has
plenty to recommend him.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.720
In Kafka's work, power
is obscured, hidden.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.300
We're aware of its presence
and its effect on characters,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.340
but often only too late.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.820
In Kafka's work, power
presents itself suddenly,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.470
brutally, and mysteriously,
sometimes using

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.400
surveillance in the process.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.090
This kind of disembodied
floating power

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.780
always lurking just out of
view is a helpful framework

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.790
for studying today's
surveillance culture.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.246
I just love that photo.

00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:56.410
Kafka was for much
of his adult life

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.654
a lawyer with an
insurance company.

00:14:58.654 --> 00:15:00.320
He essentially was a
bureaucrat, and had

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.090
a sense of how power could be
wielded by opaque institutions.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.310
Today, we deal with all
kinds of bureaucracy,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.850
often to our own frustration,
and often of a familiar sort.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.340
But I think software represents
a new kind of bureaucracy.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.190
Algorithms act as
the bureaucrats,

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.680
making decisions based on
inscrutable, or secret,

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.860
criteria, and we, the users,
act as data producers and nodes

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.550
and feedback loops
that increasingly

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.710
shape our surrounding world.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.360
Consider this passage
from an article describing

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.670
a maker of smartphone games.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.986
And I've got a long quote here.

00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:35.170
"GSN does not simply track
customers preferences

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.990
and customize its
services accordingly,

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.300
as many digital businesses do.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.940
In an effort to induce players
to play along or try more

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.170
games, it uses the data it
pulls from phones to watch

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.950
for signs that they are tiring.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.950
Largely by measuring how
frequently, how fervently,

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.970
and how quickly you
press on the screen,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.410
the company can predict with
a high degree of accuracy

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.650
just when you're likely
to lose interest,

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.770
giving it the chance to
suggest other games long

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.450
before that happens.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.660
The games are free, but GSN
shows ads and sells virtual

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.690
items that are
useful to players,

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.022
so the company can persuade
someone to play"-- oh,

00:16:08.022 --> 00:16:10.480
excuse me-- "so the longer the
company can persuade someone

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.560
to play, the more
money it can make."

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.981
End quote.

00:16:13.981 --> 00:16:15.980
So essentially what we
have here is this company

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.090
GSN, which makes little
gambling and poker apps

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.057
and things like that.

00:16:20.057 --> 00:16:22.390
It's tracking what people do,
how they respond, and sort

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.310
of trying various
prods and nudges,

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.710
and perhaps even changing
the parameters of a game,

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.035
to try to get someone
to play longer.

00:16:29.035 --> 00:16:30.410
That's from an
article about what

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.430
are called persuasive
technologies, technologies that

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.130
try to get us to do
something-- perhaps

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.580
with our own consent, perhaps
arguably for our own benefit,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.350
like a fitness monitor that
prods its owner to sleep more.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.350
But of course, these
persuasive techniques

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.110
first and foremost
help the bottom lines

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.800
of the companies behind them.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.404
And even that fitness
monitor, to take one example,

00:16:50.404 --> 00:16:52.570
might be trying to get me
to sleep more because it's

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:53.944
cut a deal with
my health insurer

00:16:53.944 --> 00:16:56.730
and my employer that,
in exchange for us

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.310
wearing fitness monitors,
we'll achieve certain health

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.140
benchmarks, fork over
more personal information,

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.740
and save the company some
money in health costs.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.619
These so-called
persuasive technologies

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.579
offer more visible
manifestations

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.369
of how power operates in
networked digital systems.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:16.020
And even these are only visible
because they're reported on.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.579
And in some cases, companies are
so proud of their innovations,

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.640
of their ability to
persuade, that they're

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.349
willing to disclose
how they work.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.499
But most people playing
GSN's games likely

00:17:26.499 --> 00:17:28.040
have no idea that
they're essentially

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.170
being coaxed and herded
toward desirable behaviors,

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.950
all with the goal of keeping
them on the platform.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.140
Excuse me, I'm getting over
a little bit of a cold.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.890
The type of power we're
talking about here

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.470
is invisible and mysterious.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.050
And that's what I think
makes it so confounding.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.660
That's what makes it difficult
to talk about, to regulate,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.600
to protest, to argue over,
to defend, to legislate,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.990
and on and on.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.030
We have to make
it visible first.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:59.580
We have to learn how to describe
it and articulate its contours.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.180
There are many other
possible examples

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.969
of these sort of
persuasive technologies,

00:18:03.969 --> 00:18:05.760
or of this kind of
hidden movement of power

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.718
that I'm talking about.

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:08.760
Some of them may be
familiar to you--

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.600
ads that show up in
pivotal moments in games,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.030
call center software that gauges
customers' emotional states

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.560
and sorts out the
possible troublemakers,

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.320
online retailers that
employ differential pricing

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.600
software, that offers
a different price

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.170
for each customer
based on personal data

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.030
and the software's judgment
of what they might pay.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:33.650
I have to apologize for
the next slide, but.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.210
Or you might recall that
Facebook got in trouble

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.080
last summer for releasing the
results of a study in which it

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.470
manipulated the content of
more than 600,000 users news

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.347
feeds to show happier
or sadder content.

00:18:45.347 --> 00:18:46.930
The company wanted
to know if it could

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.510
induce certain emotional
states in users,

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:53.780
and then see those emotions
travel through the network.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.172
And for people like me,
who study the tech industry

00:18:56.172 --> 00:18:57.630
with a kind of
disturbed admiration

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.940
at its influence
over customers, it

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.510
was an unnerving experiment--
not only because Facebook

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.777
seemed to think that it
had done nothing wrong,

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:07.360
but because these
kinds of experiments

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.370
go on all the time in secret.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.794
And of course,
Facebook never asks

00:19:10.794 --> 00:19:12.960
the users who are involved
in the study for consent.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.380
It's presumed based
on their accepting

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.450
the terms of service agreement
that they had already given it.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.940
Indeed, the fact that these
experiments go on all the time,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.530
that's what OkCupid founder
Christian Rudder told us.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.050
Quote, "We experiment
on human beings,"

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.540
he wrote on OkCupid's blog.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.540
Continuing the quote,
"If you use the internet,

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.310
you're the subject of hundreds
of experiments at any given

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.110
time on every site.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.020
That's how websites work."

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.649
It was troubling to see
Rudder being so enthusiastic

00:19:42.649 --> 00:19:44.190
about this state of
affairs, but he's

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.310
correct at least in one sense.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.930
Many tech companies are in the
behavior modification business.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.810
That this represents the status
quo doesn't make it ethical.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:56.600
It also doesn't mean that it
can't change for the better.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.130
Frank Pasquale, who
I quoted earlier,

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.890
calls this world the
black box society,

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.020
a place where surveillance, data
collection, sorting algorithms,

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.830
and related systems exert
a peculiar kind of control.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.350
This kind of control may be
based on millions of A/B tests,

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.200
reflecting the kind of
experimentation that

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.220
so excites Christian Rudder.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.600
Or maybe utter pseudoscience,
but with a patina

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.350
of mathematical precision of
the unimpeachable authority

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.930
of a computer.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.070
The TSA, for instance, has
spent more than $900 million

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.140
tracking the behavior
of human beings

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.400
in airports across the country.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.900
The idea is that
would-be terrorists

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.000
might be spotted by noticing
certain telltale tics,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.760
as if finding a
terrorist in a crowd

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.624
is like spotting a
poker player's bluff.

00:20:41.624 --> 00:20:43.790
A number of studies have
found that these techniques

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.290
are utterly useless.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.510
Supposedly revealing
signs like someone

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.000
who's visibly nervous or
sweating, or asking a few too

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.500
many questions, are
common to many travelers,

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.100
but that hasn't stopped the
TSA from pouring resources

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.250
into this and other similarly
crummy programs, most of them

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:03.660
based on saturating our airports
and various transport networks

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.880
with CCTV and surveillance
and facial recognition

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.530
and all sorts of forms of data
collection and data mining.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.140
But after all, this is why
it's called security theatre.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.250
The authorities must be
seen doing something,

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.097
even if it's an utter waste.

00:21:18.097 --> 00:21:20.305
And who knows, perhaps
advances in facial recognition

00:21:20.305 --> 00:21:22.410
and other forms of
biometric monitoring

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.582
will soon render all this moot.

00:21:24.582 --> 00:21:26.040
Would-be terrorists
will be spotted

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.500
because an algorithm decides
that their style of walking

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.600
looks suspicious,
or that they spent

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.090
a few seconds more than the
average traveler lingering

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.060
around the security area.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.370
It's through this
kind of logic, which

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.034
I think in some ways represents
the logic of big data,

00:21:40.034 --> 00:21:41.575
that some behaviors
become normalized

00:21:41.575 --> 00:21:43.660
and others criminalized.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.480
Like the internet,
airports increasingly

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.850
represent personalized
filter bubbles,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.240
where different demographics
and even individuals

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.110
are assessed and sorted
according to obscure criteria

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.000
that's never shared with them.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.820
This is how we get black and
brown people randomly selected

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.730
for additional inspection,
interrogation, and suspicion,

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.820
while whites and other
privileged populations

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.290
are allowed to smoothly
pass through pre-check.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.670
In other words, the
black box society

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.550
affects different populations
in different ways.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.650
Here's one stark example.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:20.920
I hope you'll pardon my
crude graphic skills here.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.390
Here we have two opposite
approaches to networked cars.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.080
At the top you have a tweet
from Elon Musk describing

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.170
how owners of a
certain Tesla car

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.550
were going to receive
an over-the-air software

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.540
update to an inverter
algorithm, and it's

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.950
going to make the acceleration
0.1 second faster.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.610
On the bottom
here, this is taken

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:46.370
from an article about these
interrupter devices that

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.530
are put on cars for people
who get high interest

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.560
loans in order to afford cars.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.230
And I see here two opposite
approaches to networked cars.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.980
Those who can afford
expensive Teslas

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.010
receive over-the-air
software updates that

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.090
improve the car's performance.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.780
It seems like a great
deal, this promise

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.630
of incremental periodic
updates for your car,

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.030
though maybe we should be
wary of cars that increasingly

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.770
act like computers, that
basically are computers

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.240
with engines attached.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.430
Soon enough, they'll
be accumulating viruses

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.420
or refusing to drive because
we haven't installed the latest

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.950
firmware update.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.380
But for now, I guess, this
must seem kind of cool.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.720
In the second example,
subprime lenders

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.920
cajole buyers into
accepting devices called

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.120
startup interrupters, which
can be activated remotely

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.640
to shut down the car
if the borrower is even

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.740
a day late on a payment.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.930
Many people who take this kind
of deal have little choice.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.020
They need a car to
get to their job,

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.940
or to take their kids to school.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.140
They're often from
low-income backgrounds,

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.400
so they accept the
29% interest rate

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.070
and the mysterious
interrupter device

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.150
that's planted in their car.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.280
Some of these interrupters
are also geofenced,

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.170
meaning that the car might be
shut down if the driver goes

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.190
out of a designated area.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.670
The lenders and repo men
operating the interrupter

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.480
software have a real-time view
of everywhere a driver goes.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.000
They know when she goes to work.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.810
Or, in the case of one
Texas driver who had her car

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.650
shut off, when she
leaves her geofenced area

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.450
to go to a shelter to find
refuge from an abusive husband.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.990
In this woman's case, the
lender shut down her car

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.920
and sent a tow truck to
repossess it while she

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.970
was still at the shelter.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.720
Others have had their cars
shut off before their loans

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.920
actually go into default,
during family emergencies,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.800
or even while driving
on the freeway.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.360
What unites these
examples-- and in fact,

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.580
what I think is a defining
feature of the black box

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.730
society and of a world
in which software

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.000
acts as a new form
of bureaucracy--

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.100
is the difficulty of appeal.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.730
Who can you ask for help,
for some understanding

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.430
or accommodation or relief from
standard operating procedures?

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.300
Even when it's possible to
talk to real human being,

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.100
that person can always point to
the terms of service agreement

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.250
or the mechanics of the
software to remind the customer,

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.510
this is just how it is.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.720
You're stuck.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.930
These kinds of arrangements
are endemic to what's

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:07.970
been called the sharing economy.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.230
On Gigwalk, a jobs marketplace
like Mechanical Turk

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.460
that assigns tasks
through smartphones,

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.990
workers who don't respond
to tasks within 30 minutes

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.570
are penalized.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.370
This fact is unadvertised, which
makes it even more difficult

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.910
for workers who may not
realize why they're not

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:26.850
getting the kinds of tasks
they were being offered before.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:30.090
Not long ago, I took a
car through Hailo, a taxi

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.740
through Hailo, to take
my cat to the vet.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.890
It seemed like a
pleasant enough cab ride.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.960
I tried to apologize
for my cat's meowing,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.679
and the driver
didn't seem bothered.

00:25:38.679 --> 00:25:40.220
But then as I stepped
out of the car,

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.600
I noticed him give me a
rating of three stars.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.820
Since then, when I
open the Hailo app

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.590
I'm told that there
aren't any cars available.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.670
Is it true?

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.610
Are there no drivers
in my area anymore?

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.380
Or was I downgraded in
the app by that rating

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.880
and now drivers are
refusing to pick me up?

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.850
It's hard to know, and
I probably never will.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.310
So, goodbye to Hailo for me.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.360
Obviously, my situation
pales against that

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.450
of a Gigwalk worker
or sharing economy

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.940
labor, who face these kinds
of dilemmas constantly.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.410
Uber drivers are let
go after their ratings

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.930
fall under 4.6 stars.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.460
They're not fired exactly.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.160
After all, they're not employees
in any legal sense, which

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.310
has been key to Uber's growth.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.750
The app simply deactivates
their accounts,

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.310
meaning that they can no longer
earn money driving for Uber.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.890
What can a driver do but
accept this arrangement,

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.710
or go work for a
competitor who probably

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.150
has similarly abusive policies?

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.030
In the end, power
lies with whomever

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.546
is controlling the app.

00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:39.170
One of the problems
I mentioned earlier

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.430
is that when we're dealing with
computers and other machines,

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:45.550
we often assume that they can
do no wrong, that whatever

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.670
information or result they
produce is the correct one.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.729
A calculator never lies.

00:26:50.729 --> 00:26:52.645
But it doesn't take much
digging to understand

00:26:52.645 --> 00:26:56.070
that automated systems reflect
the biases, intentions,

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.140
and social conditions
of their creators.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.690
Latanya Sweeney, a
computer scientist

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.690
and Harvard
professor, discovered

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.560
this when she ran a
Google search on herself

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.290
several years ago.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.949
The ads that appeared
next to her name

00:27:08.949 --> 00:27:11.490
were mostly offers for criminal
background checks and to look

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.300
up her criminal record.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.080
Sweeney had no
criminal record, so she

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.230
decided to do some digging.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.580
In fact, she conducted a study,
with some funding from Google,

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.350
and found that traditionally
black names like hers

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.710
were 25% more likely to yield
ads for criminal records

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.820
than were white names.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.240
Now, there are many
possible explanations

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.870
for what was going on there.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:34.890
It could be the fault of
a programmer or Instant

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.010
Checkmate, which bought the ad.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.700
It could be that racist
users of Google search

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.630
more often click on
arrest records of people

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.460
with black-sounding names.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.960
There are many
possible explanations

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.835
that it might not even
be possible to isolate

00:27:46.835 --> 00:27:48.030
a single factor.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.040
Ad systems are pretty
complex, as you all

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.585
know better than I do.

00:27:51.585 --> 00:27:53.710
But the difficulty of
knowing exactly what happened

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.026
is a major part of the problem.

00:27:56.026 --> 00:27:57.650
In the meantime, we
can see these kinds

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.130
of biases and blind spots
cropping up all over.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.050
A study by scholars
at Carnegie Mellon

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.690
found that women
searching job sites

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:07.240
are shown fewer opportunities
for higher-paying jobs

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.590
than men are.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.830
In England recently,
a female pediatrician

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.590
was trying to get into the
locker room at her gym,

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.410
and she found that
the keypad on the door

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.610
wouldn't recognize her pin.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.630
She later learned that the
keypad software was programmed

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.930
to only recognize
men as doctors,

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.530
and this woman had checked a
box on the gyms sign-up form

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.400
to indicate that
she was a doctor.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.370
In one sense the software
was acting correctly,

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.780
trying to bar a man, or
what it thought was a man,

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.900
from accessing the
women's locker room.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:40.590
But obviously, because it was
programmed to only recognize

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:45.210
doctors as men, it had been
programmed in a sexist manner.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.130
Earlier I mentioned
data as a new commodity.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.420
It's what allows our
semi-automated surveillance

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.480
society to function.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.550
In practice, data acts
something like a fluid, I think,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:59.800
ending up in often
unexpected places.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.480
In 2013, Latanya Sweeney,
the same Harvard professor

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.690
I just mentioned,
devised this map,

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.670
showing where
health data travels.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.390
As you can see, it's a
vast but loose network,

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.310
and many of the holders
of this data arguably

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.070
have no right or
reasonable use for it.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.340
One of the points that Sweeney
has made is that maps like this

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.470
are incomplete, offering only
a partial sense of where,

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.820
in this case, medical
data might end up.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.640
But I think that she
also would propose

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.080
that this process of
mapping, of discovery,

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.220
of trying to make these networks
visible, is just as important.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.810
This idea of circulation,
of data as something

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:40.010
that flows through systems
and networks, is key.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.860
Where data flows,
power does as well.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.139
But this idea
isn't entirely new.

00:29:45.139 --> 00:29:46.805
If data is a commodity,
then think of it

00:29:46.805 --> 00:29:48.570
as just another form of money.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.960
And these days, money is just
another form of information.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.056
It all flows through
the same pipes.

00:29:55.056 --> 00:29:56.430
The flow of money
and information

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.440
has long been central to the
functioning of capitalism,

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.070
but the journey hasn't always
been so smooth as it is today.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:06.180
Here's Karl Marx,
writing in 1858,

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.000
quote, "Capital,
by its very nature,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.040
drives beyond every
spatial barrier.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.690
Thus, the creation of
the physical conditions

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.520
of exchange, of the means of
communication and transport,

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.040
the annihilation
of space by time,

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.747
becomes an extraordinary
necessity for it."

00:30:24.747 --> 00:30:27.080
This, I think, is the great
achievement of the internet,

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.000
altering the physical
conditions of exchange.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.890
As Marx might have
described it, the internet

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.510
annihilated space and
time as impediments

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.815
to the flow of capital
and information.

00:30:37.815 --> 00:30:40.559
Or at least, the internet
has nearly achieved that.

00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:42.100
High-frequency
traders, for instance,

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.740
are always trying to
shave another pico

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.910
or nanosecond off their trades,
whether by moving their servers

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.200
closer to Wall Street or hooking
up to a fiber optic cable

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.400
that offers their information
an ever so slightly straighter,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.810
quicker path to its destination.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:03.510
This is a map of world
telegraph lines in 1875,

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.480
around the time that
Marx was writing.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.970
And the reason I
think why Marx was

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.345
able to make this
kind of insight

00:31:09.345 --> 00:31:11.080
was not just because
he was smart,

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.900
but because he also
lived in the early days

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.740
of electrical networks.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.630
By 1858, when that
quote is from,

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.140
telegraph lines
were transporting

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.060
news and information around the
world with a previously unheard

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.190
of speed.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.200
They were collapsing
the barriers of space

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.970
and moving us closer to a world
in which the speed of light

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.430
would be the only limit
on the flow of capital.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.000
Before the telegraph, the
movement of information

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.310
was limited by the speed of a
steamship, a horse, a sailboat,

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.180
or person's feet.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.390
Though, as James
Gleick has shown,

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.900
some savvy people found ways
around these physical barriers.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.890
In West Africa,
indigenous communities

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.220
long used drums to communicate
over long distances,

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.170
to transform information into
something intangible that

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:58.650
could be transmitted through
the air, through sound itself.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.430
It's really a kind of
remarkable innovation.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:03.450
There, the speed of sound
and the density of air

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.940
limited how far
information could travel,

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.290
but there were ways
around that, too-- say,

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.150
by having an adjacent community
act as a kind of relay,

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.970
taking in the message
and rearticulating it,

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.000
retransmitting it, to
the next tribe over.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.020
The same thing was
done in other times

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.290
in other parts of the
world, with smoke signals

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.670
or by lighting beacon fires
to announce the arrival

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:27.170
of an invading army.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:29.060
One of the great
innovations of the internet

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.650
was to take information,
chop it up into the packets,

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.630
send them out, and reassemble
them at their destination.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.400
But in these
pre-industrial communities

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.530
you can see similar
techniques at work,

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.920
filtered through the
technologies of the time.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.690
Let's get that back to Marx
and this idea of circulation.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.490
As capital flowed
through networks,

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:50.640
Marx saw it
transforming, sometimes

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.520
representing money, sometimes a
commodity, sometimes something

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.630
else entirely.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.250
As the writer Jonathan
Crary noted, quote,

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.210
"This was hardly a one
time transmutation.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.540
For with each successive
upgrading and expansion

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.190
of these networks, new forms
of fluidity and convertibility

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.030
emerged."

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.336
End quote.

00:33:10.336 --> 00:33:12.836
This is one of the achievements
of the Industrial Revolution

00:33:12.836 --> 00:33:14.860
in the decades that followed.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.980
The telegraph network was
joined by wireless telegraphy,

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.480
the telephone by radio
microwave satellites.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.775
Before the rise of
AT&amp;T, some small towns

00:33:23.775 --> 00:33:25.150
had their own
telephone networks,

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.360
which connected a few
homes or entire community

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.840
but when no farther.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.570
Some banking networks
still run on old mainframes

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.750
and use COBOL, a
programming language

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.100
that's nearly 60 years old.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.520
These networks continue
to operate in parallel

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.030
to our own internet.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.780
In fact, I'd argue
that if we step back

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.590
and look at all these various
networks, all these ways

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.520
of transmitting information,
as a flow, that we've

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.280
been blinded by the internet.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.580
We've become
enchanted by this idea

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.470
of one monolithic global network
through which all information

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.130
must travel.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.062
Following the
Snowden revelations,

00:34:00.062 --> 00:34:02.020
some countries have
started requiring companies

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.510
to store customer data
within their borders,

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.250
or have begun investing
in what might be described

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.969
as country-wide intranets.

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:12.250
Increasingly,
commentators worry about

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.730
the so-called balkanization
of the internet.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.320
It's being broken up as
new barriers are introduced

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.239
to the once smooth flow
of capital and information

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.469
across borders.

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:25.270
But if we think of the internet
as simply the latest, and not

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:27.580
the only, network
transporting information,

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.540
we might not fear this as much.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.610
We might even say that this
internet, our internet,

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.409
isn't as great as it could be,
and that it might even be worth

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:37.790
replacing.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.340
We might also begin to question
whether the unimpeded flow

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.139
of data is all that
it's cracked up to be.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:46.219
Perhaps there are some places
we don't want our data to go.

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:47.830
Perhaps there are
some types of data

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.670
that should be
difficult to find,

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:54.179
that should become obscure
or disappear, forgotten.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.800
I'm not the first to come
to this kind of conclusion.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.610
Evgeny Morozov argues
that there's actually

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.670
no such thing as "the
internet," which he

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.540
likes to put in scare quotes.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.380
And I've become
increasingly sympathetic

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.460
to this kind of view.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.335
Not only are there many
information networks,

00:35:09.335 --> 00:35:10.710
some of which are
linked together

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.170
in what we call the
internet, but each of us

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.940
increasingly has a singular
experience in relation

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.480
to these networks.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.490
Our own experience is
composed of our filter bubbles

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.210
and personalized
services, our specific

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.450
journeys through difficult
and sometimes overlapping

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:26.950
bureaucracies.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:30.320
The Internet, too, is simply
is a shared set of protocols,

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.270
and one might argue that the
World Wide Web, the hypertext

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.290
transfer protocol,
should be considered

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:39.230
its own network apart from this
thing we call the internet.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.200
By taking this
view, by unbundling

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.102
these various
networks, I hope we

00:35:44.102 --> 00:35:45.810
can look at them anew
and learn something

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.500
about the relationship between
the flow of data and the flow

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.740
power.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.490
These days it's
fashionable to look

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.340
at our global
communications networks

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.790
and think we've achieved
something momentous,

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.520
that perhaps, in the
parlance of Silicon Valley,

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.199
the world is being
made a better place.

00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:03.740
But this is a dream
that has followed

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.430
every advance in communication
since time immemorial.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:10.420
Guglielmo Marconi, a
pioneer of radio-- one

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.020
of those pivotal networks of
yesteryear-- said that quote,

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:17.410
"The coming of the wireless
era will make war impossible,

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.320
because it will make
war ridiculous."

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.390
When I hear Mark Zuckerberg
say that Facebook

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.260
is a tool for
advancing world peace

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.830
or that internet connectivity
is a human right,

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.120
I hear the hopelessly
naive bombast of Marconi.

00:36:32.601 --> 00:36:34.759
This is a map of
global shipping lanes,

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.300
which I think also
has the appearance

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.439
of a kind of network.

00:36:38.439 --> 00:36:39.980
What the internet
has achieved, then,

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.935
is to enfold people
more closely together

00:36:41.935 --> 00:36:45.540
in networks of communication,
capital, and exchange, and more

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.830
recently in systems of
monitoring and surveillance.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.070
This is no small thing, but I
don't think it's a revolution.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.420
It's merely an incremental,
if important, step

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.360
beyond the kinds of
communication networks

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.810
that inspired Marx.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:00.930
What I think we need,
then, is to understand

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.460
what this world of data-driven
surveillance and automation

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.290
that I spoke of earlier
truly represents.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:10.360
Where other speak of convenience
I see the surrender of control.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.750
Where others speak of
personal liberation,

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.460
I see the same faded
dreams of emancipation

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.810
that have dogged every
industrial epoch.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.610
Where others find a
new kind of sociality,

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:22.820
I worry that we are giving
out some essential form

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.740
of autonomy.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.150
But the advantage of this
point, I would argue,

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.780
is that it doesn't
treat the internet

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.840
and our new digital
technologies as magical.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.760
It grants them no credit,
simply because they

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.700
seem special or novel.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.800
Instead, it proposes that,
in our relentlessly digitized

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.730
world, people are struggling
with the same challenges

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.660
of discrimination, politics,
economics, labor, and the right

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.486
to live life as one chooses.

00:37:49.486 --> 00:37:50.860
None of that will
go away because

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.070
of the advent of a new device
or a new way of communicating.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.240
The world is still
hopelessly mediated,

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.410
despite all the talk these
days about disintermediation.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.410
With new platforms and corporate
powers replacing the old,

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.500
there are simply new
middlemen that we may not

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.830
recognize as middlemen.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:08.580
The great hope of
some true believers

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.050
is that the screens
in our hands,

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.980
our cars, our offices,
and practically everywhere

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:16.540
else, will be replaced by
something even more seamless,

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.160
as the digital becomes
not an overlay, not

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.060
some isolated network,
but perfectly entwined

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.810
with the physical world.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:27.280
Call it pervasive computing,
ubiquitous computing,

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.520
augmented reality, ambient
computation, whatever you like.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.840
We'll be able to call
upon networked interfaces

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.560
wherever we desire.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.060
They may even be
implanted in us,

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.580
or perhaps we'll simply
be content to wear them

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.790
on our wrists, which
have become the latest

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.020
site of digital mediation.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.110
Jonathan Crary, commenting
on such a utopian prophecy,

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:52.970
had this to say,
quote, "If and when

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.590
such devices are introduced
and label as revolutionary,

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.090
they will simply be
facilitating the perpetuation

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:02.850
of the same banal exercise
of nonstop consumption,

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.140
social isolation, and
political powerlessness,

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.140
rather than representing
some historically

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.490
significant turning point."

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.050
End quote.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:14.360
In other words, they
too will be replaced.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.020
Today's remarkable gadget
is tomorrow's e-waste.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.760
The human drama remains
largely the same,

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.590
though we may be more
distracted from the main event.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.870
It's a dark point of view, but
I find a weird kind of optimism

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.420
in it, the sort of
optimism that puts people

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.340
before their devices.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.560
If we accept that all these
products and systems are

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.240
disposable, fated to become
so much techno trash,

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.910
what does that mean?

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.490
Perhaps it tells
us that people are

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:45.010
capable of more than we think,
that data shouldn't be mistaken

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:48.370
for knowledge, and that our
digital shadows reflect us

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.090
but aren't us, and so we
shouldn't let them define

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:53.230
our experience in the world.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.960
Finally, it may give
us pause on this,

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.620
our long march toward a
society in which no one is

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.040
left alone or unmonitored.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.350
There we can catch
our breath and say,

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:05.640
our technologies aren't
driving us apart,

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.120
but they aren't quite
serving us, either.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.000
And maybe out there
lies some better way

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.730
of being hidden behind
the algorithmic curtain.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:15.270
Thanks.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:18.102
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.481
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so we
have some time for Q&amp;A.

00:40:24.481 --> 00:40:26.480
AUDIENCE: I was curious
what you would recommend

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.050
we do to be safer, more
secure, or just smarter

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:32.670
about our own digital lives.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:35.040
JACOB SILVERMAN: Well,
frankly, being here at Google,

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.730
I fear you guys could tell me
more than I could tell you.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.050
People ask me this stuff a
lot, and I find it challenging,

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:47.385
because there's certainly
stuff you can do.

00:40:47.385 --> 00:40:48.926
One of the things
I write about a lot

00:40:48.926 --> 00:40:51.300
is the ad-driven
surveillance economy,

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.640
which bothers me a lot-- which
is, we have to acknowledge,

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.840
the main source of revenue here.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.000
So I do things like
I use ad blockers,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.940
or often use a VPN,
occasionally the Tor browser,

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.269
things like that.

00:41:05.269 --> 00:41:07.560
And I think there are these
kind of technological tools

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.430
to mask your
identity, if you want,

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.080
or kind of cover up
the amount of data

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:19.070
you might be leaking towards
whoever might be watching.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.160
On the other hand,
I'd really rather see

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.120
that we find new business
models and new kinds of systems

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.450
are created that aren't
so dependent on monetizing

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:32.520
the raw material of people's
daily lives and who they are.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.282
And one reason why I
also-- I mean, I certainly

00:41:35.282 --> 00:41:37.740
don't mind recommending specific
solutions to individuals--

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.150
but why I also talk a lot
about regulation and kind

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.130
of government
intervention of some sort

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:47.435
is because I think that we
have these ethical impulses.

00:41:47.435 --> 00:41:51.640
We want these services to be
as useful and amazing as they

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.710
can be.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.220
But we also want
people to feel safe

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.540
and protected while using them.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.200
And I think the
virtue of regulation

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.080
is that it sort of takes
that ethical impulse

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.430
and establishes it as policy
that can help everyone.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.140
And a lot of people really
don't have the time, resources,

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.740
or education to deal
with this kind of stuff

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:15.080
or to even really worry about,
oh, is information about me

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.786
being put into some
credit report that's

00:42:16.786 --> 00:42:18.910
going to used against me
at a future job interview?

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:21.760
Most people would never
know that even happens.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.620
AUDIENCE: Do you feel that
the surveillance that's

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:30.610
done without people knowing
is in itself unethical,

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:33.110
and how that
compares to the fact

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.920
that that's being
done for profit?

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.480
And so just to put
it another way,

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:43.570
if you could imagine someone
in a position of power

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:45.900
using information
about people's habits

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:51.330
and knowledge about psychology
to inject certain articles

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:54.270
into people's streams,
that could potentially

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:57.750
reduce racial tensions
between two different groups

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.640
or have some benefit to
society where they're not

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.700
trying to profit from it?

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.230
But it's being done using
these same kinds of techniques

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:07.760
that they're being
done in secret.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.000
They're not
transparent about it,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.916
but they're being done
for a different reason.

00:43:10.916 --> 00:43:13.010
Would you find
that is unethical?

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.260
JACOB SILVERMAN: I don't know.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.680
I think that is one of
those sort of hinge cases

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.010
that would leave me
open to saying perhaps

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:20.940
that's totally fine.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.820
I mean, what people like me
in the world of journalism

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.180
worry about, with an example
kind of related to that,

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.651
is Facebook has so much power
as pretty much the homepage

00:43:31.651 --> 00:43:33.150
of the internet for
a lot of people,

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:38.520
as by far the biggest driver
of readers to news articles.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.160
And for a long time, people have
worried that Facebook really

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.810
privileges bad content,
and then they kind of

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:47.520
got rid of a lot of that, a
lot of the click bait stuff.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.090
But then it seemed, and they
really just released a study

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:54.030
about it, that political
content-- especially

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.620
about current events, things
like the riots in Baltimore--

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.574
were not showing up
enough on people's news

00:43:58.574 --> 00:44:00.240
feeds, and perhaps
were being suppressed

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.323
by the newsfeed algorithm.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.460
But the problem
is, what do we want

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.130
from something like Facebook?

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.870
If Facebook were some
nonprofit company that

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:13.910
had a more public-spirited
mission that says,

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:15.550
we want people to be
informed, so we're

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:17.070
going to filter all this
information on their behalf

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:19.140
and kind of decide what
they should be reading

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.132
and what might be
important to them, that's

00:44:21.132 --> 00:44:23.340
a little different than the
current Facebook we have,

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.549
which is this giant for-profit
monolith who, of course, mostly

00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:28.340
cares about people
staying on the platform.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:35.010
To kind of go to your broader
question of can data collection

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:37.310
surveillance be used
for the public good,

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:38.760
I think in some ways it can.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:44.600
I think sometimes, though,
it's in very basic methods.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.500
And this isn't even
a nonprofit purpose,

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.195
but you have
companies that track

00:44:48.195 --> 00:44:50.320
how many people go through
intersections and things

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.010
like that.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.580
And that seems like
something really basic,

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.620
but that's actually really
important for urban planning,

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.450
or for someone who wants to
start a restaurant somewhere

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:57.100
or something like that.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.690
And you're not
storing data on who

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:04.170
people are unless you link that
up to some facial recognition

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:05.170
program.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:07.330
But you are kind of
using similar techniques

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:11.810
and processes for something that
can potentially help people,

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:13.840
but also won't create
this permanent data trail

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.840
or associate them with
something that they don't

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.480
want to be associated with.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.460
AUDIENCE: As someone who's
trying to design experiences

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:24.190
for people, which may
hinge on this content-- so

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:26.270
your example of Uber-- or sorry.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:29.790
A different service, where
you didn't see any more cars

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:35.650
and it was not transparent
to you what was being shown,

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:38.900
do you think that
you would you be

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.230
OK with that kind of decision
on the part of the designer

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:47.043
if it was at least
transparent what was going on?

00:45:47.043 --> 00:45:48.626
JACOB SILVERMAN:
It's a good question.

00:45:48.626 --> 00:45:54.435
I think I would appreciate it
more, certainly, if I knew,

00:45:54.435 --> 00:45:56.810
look, you're not getting cars
because your rating is kind

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:57.790
of low, or something like that.

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:59.810
If there were some sort
of transparency, yeah,

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:01.470
I think I'd probably
appreciate that.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:03.940
Though I do think in the
case of a lot of these apps

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.240
and the ways the
sharing economy works

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.580
is that you are required to make
these very brief assessments

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:14.730
of people or ratings that can
often prove very consequential.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.730
So I kind of think that
that whole rating system

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.620
is flawed from the outset.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.340
On the other hand, though, I
think this idea of transparency

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:21.979
is good.

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:23.770
A lot of people talk
about this, especially

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:24.890
in the academic world.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.940
They talk about transparency,
or making these systems legible.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.080
I use the term visibility
a lot, but they

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.640
have to be legible
somehow in order

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.370
for us to know
what kind of power

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:37.300
they are exerting over us.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.000
And the problem, I think,
and the problem I have even

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.500
when giving this kind of talk,
is that a lot of this stuff

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.080
is still very new, or
these types of power

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.160
can be very hazy.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.460
And the difference
between someone exerting

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.330
some sort of control or
influence on you or someone

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:54.990
really helping you,
it can be a fine line.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:57.440
You don't always
really know, right?

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.600
We're kind of in this
murky territory where,

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.940
am I giving up some essential
kind of personal autonomy

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.570
by kind of giving myself
over to these systems?

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.730
At times it does feel like it,
but perhaps in other situations

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:09.550
it doesn't.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.890
And I think something
that can make people

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:13.930
more comfortable with
not only giving over

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:15.700
personal information
but with delegating

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.390
that kind of power
autonomy is if they really

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.657
know how the processes work.

00:47:20.657 --> 00:47:22.990
Of course, there are always
concerns about trade secrets

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:25.156
and things like that, but
I think there's definitely

00:47:25.156 --> 00:47:28.990
room to be more transparent and
to tell users more about how

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.420
these systems work.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.300
[APPLAUSE]
