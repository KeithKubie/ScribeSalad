&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.770
&gt;&gt; Can teaching with primary
sources engage young learners?

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.140
Skeptics might argue historical
materials are boring.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.660
There's too much text.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.030
The vocabulary's too difficult.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.480 position:59%
Students won't understand the history.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.450 position:72%
However, current research, teacher
testimonials, and personal experience indicate

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.080
that primary sources can bring
history alive for younger students.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.730 position:69%
Nearly all state standards acknowledge the
importance of teaching with primary sources.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.020 position:67%
Exposure to these raw materials can spark
students' imaginations and support inquiry,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020 position:73%
historical thinking, and constructive learning.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.030 position:69%
If you've ever wondered how early elementary
students develop historical thinking skills,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.310 position:73%
take a look at this lesson from Teresa St.
Angelo with a group of kindergarten historians.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.850 position:66%
Teresa teaches kindergarten at the John I.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.540 position:64%
Dawes Early Learning Center in Manalapan,
New Jersey, and is the 2016-17 Library

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.170
of Congress Teacher in Residence.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.750 position:70%
&gt;&gt; Using primary sources in my classroom is
just so important that I want to get students

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.570 position:59%
and parents excited and involved from
the very beginning of the school year.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.570
I send home a newsletter and
then explain to parents at back

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.950
to school night how their children
will become kindergarten historians

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.780
through analysing primary sources.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.220 position:67%
I outline a schedule of lessons and show
how parents can get involved throughout the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.110
whole year.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.110 position:63%
For the students, the year begins with a
short lesson on the Library of Congress

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.570
and what it has for all learners.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.640
I follow this with an activity on
the important job of a historian.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.690 position:70%
And finally, we examine what a primary source
is and students do an analysis together.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.610 position:63%
Once the groundwork is complete, we jump
into actually using primary sources.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.020
We establish the analysis as
a routine so they can't wait

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.870 position:59%
for the new primary source to analyse.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.840
Here's an example of a primary
source lesson I did in February

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.490
when we were discussing Valentines
cards in the post office.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.410 position:75%
Prior to this unit, we had spent time as a class
identifying key people in their communities,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.040 position:56%
their jobs and job descriptions, and
identified locations of those jobs.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.850 position:72%
Planning lessons that are relevant and related
to students' lives allows them to process

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.370 position:73%
on a deeper level and adds to their engagement.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.540 position:56%
All students gathered on the carpet.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.760
The classroom lights were
turned off and the boys

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.350
and girls began wondering
what they were going to watch.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.170
They saw a short film from
1903 titled Collecting Mail.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.570 position:61%
Some students couldn't contain
themselves and called out what they saw

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.080 position:63%
or a connection they made with the film.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.190 position:56%
One girl called out, my dad watches
black and white movies all the time!

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.460 position:64%
The students were so interested that when
I asked them to turn and talk to a buddy,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.120
they started talking immediately.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.640
When the film was over, the
students did a turn and talk

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.880 position:64%
about what they noticed or what happened.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.340 position:59%
I then had the students work
independently to analyse a photograph.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.190 position:61%
The guiding question for them was,
where do you think the men are working?

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.490 position:70%
I told them to circle the evidence that
helped them guess where the men were working.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.850 position:67%
One student thought they were in a kitchen.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.230
I asked the student to think
about things we see in a kitchen

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.070 position:61%
and find evidence of them in the image.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.350
When he couldn't find any, he
reconsidered his conclusion.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.470 position:64%
Responding to observations this way
allows the students to develop the skills

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.180
of citing evidence to support
ideas and evaluate information.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.220 position:63%
In small group discussions, the boys
and girls analysed a set of photographs.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.370 position:61%
They shared their thoughts and ideas
around a set of early 1900s photographs

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.250 position:63%
of a horse-drawn mail wagon at a railway
station, unsorted mail at a post office,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.290
and a girl handing a letter to a
mailman titled, A Letter to Papa.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.350 position:59%
They had to describe similarities and
differences between mail delivery then

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.570
and what they know about
mail delivery today based

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.290 position:72%
on their experiences and background knowledge.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.670
This was followed with the
boys and girls writing a letter

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.640 position:58%
to their family that was mailed home.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.160 position:73%
A recap of the lesson was sent home to parents.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.780 position:59%
It included a copy of the railway mail
train image along with an assignment

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.520
which asked parents to discuss
the image with their child.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.490 position:64%
I asked parents to submit a statement
about what they learned from their child.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.130 position:69%
Using primary sources allows my kindergarten
students to develop their critical thinking,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.900
questioning, and analysis skills.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.980 position:58%
I see the students carry those skills

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.200
over into other academic areas
such as literacy and science.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.210 position:69%
It takes their natural curiosity and allows
them to discover and grow as young learners.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.350 position:70%
&gt;&gt; Such introductory activities help teachers
and younger students become more comfortable

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.630
with connecting to and analysing
primary sources.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.930
But this is only the beginning.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.160 position:73%
The possibilities are endless for helping
students in elementary grades delve more deeply

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.580
into learning with primary sources.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.230
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
