this program is brought to you by Emory

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:02.530

this program is brought to you by Emory
University

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820
 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.910
we got to the first

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920
we got to the first
 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.870
we got to the first
for from a patient's that was prevent

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880
for from a patient's that was prevent
 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.250
for from a patient's that was prevent
presenting with priate symptoms in

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260
presenting with priate symptoms in
 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.710
presenting with priate symptoms in
january 1983 and we put in a culture in

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
january 1983 and we put in a culture in
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.310
january 1983 and we put in a culture in
the lab and got the first sign of virus

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
the lab and got the first sign of virus
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.460
the lab and got the first sign of virus
replication in the culture a few weeks

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470
replication in the culture a few weeks
 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.939
replication in the culture a few weeks
later mid mid January 1983 so that was

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949
later mid mid January 1983 so that was
 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.329
later mid mid January 1983 so that was
the first detection net set of the

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339
the first detection net set of the
 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.110
the first detection net set of the
retrovirus in the culture and obviously

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120
retrovirus in the culture and obviously
 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.240
retrovirus in the culture and obviously
it was still a lot of work to be done to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
it was still a lot of work to be done to
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.880
it was still a lot of work to be done to
show the link between the virus and the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
show the link between the virus and the
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.899
show the link between the virus and the
disease itself of course later on I mean

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909
disease itself of course later on I mean
 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.090
disease itself of course later on I mean
the first detection was in 1983 then we

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
the first detection was in 1983 then we
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.320
the first detection was in 1983 then we
had to characterize a virus both

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330
had to characterize a virus both
 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.730
had to characterize a virus both
biological properties of the virus but

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
biological properties of the virus but
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.930
biological properties of the virus but
also the replication cycle and the first

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940
also the replication cycle and the first
 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.570
also the replication cycle and the first
thing that was done indeed before

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
thing that was done indeed before
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.990
thing that was done indeed before
because before developing antiretroviral

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
because before developing antiretroviral
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.620
because before developing antiretroviral
treatment was a development of

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630
treatment was a development of
 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.450
treatment was a development of
diagnostic tests and the diagnostic

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
diagnostic tests and the diagnostic
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.569
diagnostic tests and the diagnostic
tests were available as soon as June

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579
tests were available as soon as June
 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.630
tests were available as soon as June
July 1985 they were commercialized later

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
July 1985 they were commercialized later
