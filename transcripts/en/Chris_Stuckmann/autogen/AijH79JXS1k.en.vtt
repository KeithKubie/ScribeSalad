and then there was some deer that came
 

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.400
and then there was some deer that came
close to us while we were filming and I

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:44.410
close to us while we were filming and I
 

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.750

decided to incorporate them into the
 

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.430
decided to incorporate them into the
film as well because you know production

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440
film as well because you know production
 

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.350
film as well because you know production
value so this day mark decides you know

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.900
but he knows that when he left he was
going south so he has to find the

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:57.910
going south so he has to find the
 

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.030
going south so he has to find the
northern direction and to do so he looks

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:00.040
northern direction and to do so he looks
 

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.590
northern direction and to do so he looks
for moss growing on the north side of

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600
for moss growing on the north side of

lot of things that I learned well

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:04.930
lot of things that I learned well
 

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:06.690
lot of things that I learned well
filming this movie about how to make

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:06.700
filming this movie about how to make
 

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.030
filming this movie about how to make
better movies I learned that I'm immune

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:09.040
better movies I learned that I'm immune
 

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.070
better movies I learned that I'm immune
to poison ivy because there's a shot in

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080
to poison ivy because there's a shot in
 

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.110
to poison ivy because there's a shot in
this movie of me straight up sitting in

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120
this movie of me straight up sitting in
 

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.180
this movie of me straight up sitting in
it and I didn't get poison ivy I've

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:15.190
it and I didn't get poison ivy I've
 

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.460
it and I didn't get poison ivy I've
never had poison ivy in my life and I

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:17.470
never had poison ivy in my life and I
 

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.560
never had poison ivy in my life and I
made a feature-length movie in the woods

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:19.570
made a feature-length movie in the woods
 

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.360
made a feature-length movie in the woods
so now we're getting close to like the

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:21.370
so now we're getting close to like the
 

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.070
so now we're getting close to like the
big scene where Mark starts to connect

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080
big scene where Mark starts to connect
 

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:31.690
big scene where Mark starts to connect
the dots about certain things

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:31.700
 
 

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.980
 
and this is where we learned this thing

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:33.990
and this is where we learned this thing
 

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.900
and this is where we learned this thing
is most certainly a creature it's an

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:35.910
is most certainly a creature it's an
 

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.900
is most certainly a creature it's an
alien it has weird creature II arms and

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:38.910
alien it has weird creature II arms and
 

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.540
alien it has weird creature II arms and
a it drools a lot like the xenomorph and

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:41.550
a it drools a lot like the xenomorph and
 

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.190
a it drools a lot like the xenomorph and
you can clearly tell where I was

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200
you can clearly tell where I was
 

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.660
you can clearly tell where I was
inspired to do that and we just had like

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:44.670
inspired to do that and we just had like
 

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.210
inspired to do that and we just had like
a really shitty mask that's all we had

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220
a really shitty mask that's all we had
 

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.190
a really shitty mask that's all we had
we didn't have any moving parts or jaws

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200
we didn't have any moving parts or jaws
 

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.380
we didn't have any moving parts or jaws
or anything so I could really only show

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:51.390
or anything so I could really only show
 

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.970
or anything so I could really only show
it a couple times because if I showed it

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980
it a couple times because if I showed it
 

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.830
it a couple times because if I showed it
too much it would become really obvious

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840
too much it would become really obvious
 

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.970
too much it would become really obvious
that it was fake and we did our best to

00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980
that it was fake and we did our best to
 

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.530
that it was fake and we did our best to
kind of make it seem like it was cool

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:00.540
kind of make it seem like it was cool
 

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.320
kind of make it seem like it was cool
but in the end we could only show it in

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:03.330
but in the end we could only show it in
 

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.240
but in the end we could only show it in
certain angles and share certain ways it

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:05.250
certain angles and share certain ways it
 

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.520
certain angles and share certain ways it
kind of paid off in a way because a lot

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:07.530
kind of paid off in a way because a lot
 

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:08.810
kind of paid off in a way because a lot
of people I showed it to back in the day

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820
of people I showed it to back in the day
 

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.190
of people I showed it to back in the day
they were like I was always really

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200
they were like I was always really
 

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.660
they were like I was always really
curious about what was under that cloak

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:11.670
curious about what was under that cloak
 

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.250
curious about what was under that cloak
but once you actually do see the thing

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260
but once you actually do see the thing
 

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.620
but once you actually do see the thing
you're like that's it so this is where

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:15.630
you're like that's it so this is where
 

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.360
you're like that's it so this is where
