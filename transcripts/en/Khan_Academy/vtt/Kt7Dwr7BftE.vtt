00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.460
We have four fractions
written over here.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.830
And what I want
you to do is think

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.480
about which of these fractions
is the smallest value, which

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.160
of these is the largest
value, and which

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.001
of these might be equal.

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.750
And there's two ways
that you could do it.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.910
You could try to plot
them on a number line,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.270
or you could try to
depict them visually.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.730
So pause the video now
and try it on your own.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.940
So let's plot these
on a number line.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.270
So let me give ourselves
another little number line

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.230
right over here.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.850
Let me see, I can draw one.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.460
So let's say this is my number
line-- draw it as straight

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.070
as I can.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.060
So that's my number line.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.490
That is 0.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.330
Let's say that this is
1, and then that is 2.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.150
So let's first try to plot
where 1/2 is on the number line.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.050
So we can split the
section between 0 and 1

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.255
into 2 equal sections.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.410
And 1/2, would mean
that I would have

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.099
gone one of those
2 equal sections.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.750
So if I just go that
far, I should be at 1/2.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.160
So this right over here is 1/2.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.990
Now let's think about 2/4.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.840
Well, to do 2/4,
we want to split

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.980
the section between 0 and
1 into 4 equal sections.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.550
So let's do that.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.820
So 0-- so that's 1 equal
section, 2 equal sections,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.720
3 equal sections,
and 4 equal sections.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.800
So where we do end up if we go
2 out of those 4 equal sections?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.910
Well we would end up--
1, 2 equal sections,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.820
so we end up right over here.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.342
2/4, we end up at
the exact same place.

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:44.550
So at least based on how
we've drawn the number line,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.272
it looks like 1/2
is equal to 2/4.

00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:48.230
Let me write that down.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.370
1/2 is equal to 2/4.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.430
Now what about 4/8?

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.340
Well let's split the part
of our number line between 0

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.177
and 1 to 8 equal sections.

00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:01.010
So if we take each of
those 4 equal sections

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:12.120
and split them into 2-- So now
we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.230
I can't draw it
perfectly, but I'm

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.840
trying to make them
equal sections.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.550
Now it's 8 equal sections.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.920
And now we're going
to go 4 of them.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.340
Starting at 0, we're
going to go 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.910
So we end up at the
same place again.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.750
This is also equal to 4/8.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.480
So 1/2 is equal to 2/4,
which is equal to 4/8.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.670
Now, what about 3/8?

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.630
Well, we've already
split our number line

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.780
into 8 equal sections--
let's go 3 of them.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.870
1, 2, 3.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.350
So 3/8 is right over here.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.860
3/8 is less than 1/2, it's less
than 2/4, it's less than 4/8.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.170
It is a smaller number.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.930
Let's see if that
also makes sense

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.160
when we try to
visually depict or try

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.090
to visually draw
these fractions.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.400
So I've done that
right over here.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.460
And this is one 1/2.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.040
So all of these rectangles
are the exact same size.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.540
And this purple
one over here I've

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.690
split into 2 equal sections,
and we shaded in one of them.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.480
So we see that this is 1/2.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.680
Now here I shaded in 2 out
of the 4 equal sections,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.510
and you see that this
looks the exact same size

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.850
as the 1/2 right over here.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.180
We started with rectangles
of the same size.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.569
If you shade in 1/2 or 2/4,
it looks exactly the same.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.110
And that makes sense, because
if you took this one right over

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.530
here, if you took
this first one and you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.680
divided each of your 2 equal
sections into 2 equal sections,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.970
so you split it again, then you
see that this is equal to 2/4.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.950
Now what about 4/8?

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.860
Here I've split it up where
I have this one, this one,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.780
this one, and this
one shaded in.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.340
But if you rearrange
them, you could

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.080
see that you could get
exactly the same amount

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.590
of the rectangle shaded in.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.220
And if you want to
see that, divide

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.650
each of these 4 into 2-- so
divide those into 2 and those

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.480
into 2.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.750
Notice I now have 1, 2, 3, 4 out
of the 8 equal squares shaded

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.250
in.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.560
These two things are equal.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.960
So let me make it clear.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.920
This is an equal fraction, which
is an equal fraction of that

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.760
which is equal fraction of that

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.640
And here, this is 3 out of 8.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.250
You see that it's less than
this region right over here.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.210
This one we've
literally filled in half

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.609
of the entire rectangle--
4 out of the 8.

00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:29.150
If we did 4 out of the 8 here,
we would have also had to fill

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.025
in this one right over
here, which we didn't.

00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:32.920
We only filled in
3 out of the 8.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.760
So it makes sense
that 3/8 is a smaller

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.360
part of our whole than
4/8, or 2/4, or 1/2.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.840
And likewise, it's
a smaller number.
