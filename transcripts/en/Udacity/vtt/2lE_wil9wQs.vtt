00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.670
Welcome to our fictional
company Twisted Threads.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.840
Twisted Threads ships
cotton t-shirts on demand.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.210
The founder started the company ten
years ago from her basement, but

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.560
it has since expanded
to over 200 employees.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.970
There is a warehouse, several physical
stores, and an e-commerce site.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.150
Customers love the high quality
materials and custom designs.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.610
That's the good news.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.065
Now for the bad news.

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:31.446
[SOUND] Twisted Threads has a homegrown
inventory system separate for

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:33.949
each physical shop and the warehouse.

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.979
The demand varies per season in both
the quantity of t-shirts ordered and

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.870
the type of items that customers want.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.810
Because of this, the company has
supply and inventory issues.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.890
Sometimes the company
runs out of stock and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.305
customer order fulfillment is
delayed by a week or more.

00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:51.923
[SOUND] At other times,

00:00:51.923 --> 00:00:57.046
Twisted Threads has ordered way too
many T-shirts from its supplier.

00:00:57.046 --> 00:01:00.559
They have had to throw out
merchandise to make room for

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.445
newer more popular styles.

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:07.193
Twisted Threads hosted servers for their
Internet shop in-house, but there was

00:01:07.193 --> 00:01:11.645
massive flooding in the city and their
servers were damaged beyond repair.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:14.777
[SOUND] They decided
to move to the cloud.

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:18.833
Since making this decision, there have
been major issues with performance and

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:20.470
cost on the cloud.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.380
Customers complain about
the website being buggy.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.300
The site has gone down several times
during periods of high traffic

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.425
like the holiday season.

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:31.787
[SOUND] The product team
wants more features, but

00:01:31.787 --> 00:01:35.077
the rollout of new features
is painfully slow.

00:01:35.077 --> 00:01:38.409
The competition just launched
personalization on their site,

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.140
which was a huge hit with customers.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.770
Twisted Threads is falling behind
because their website is outdated.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.540
Developers are unhappy because
deployment of new features

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.840
takes ages and operations does
not give them new servers.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.760
Operations is too overwhelmed with
running the cloud in general and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.710
worry about what will happen if
the cloud data center burns down.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.210
