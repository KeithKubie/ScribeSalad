00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.159
Guys for this video. I want to show you a cool trick

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.490
You could do with Safety Matches

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:10.500
now safety Matches are different than strike-anywhere matches because you cannot strike these anywhere they have to be struck on the red strip on the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.410
side of the box

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.619
In order for them to light off whereas with strike-anywhere matches you can basically strike them on any rough surface

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.220
And they'll ignite

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.609
So what happens if you have lots of matches left over but your red striker strip powder is gone from Previous experiments

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.919
Or maybe it gets wet saturated or ripped off to the box. It's not gonna work at all. It's just all gummy.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.340
There is still a way

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.480
You can light these matches

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.419
And I'm gonna to show you how to do it right now. Now even though these are not

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.520
strike-anywhere Matches if you find a surface

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.779
That's rough and long enough you might be able to build up enough friction to get them to light off like this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.750
That's about as easy as it gets

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.250
now the key to making this work is putting your finger right under the head of the match then pressing it to the surface and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.860
Dragging it in a nice long stroke if you do short strokes, there's not going to be enough friction for this to light off

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.639
But if you can drag it 8 to 10 inches you can see the light off no problem

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.760
this works because the friction [between] the match head and the wood is

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.440
enough to ignite the potassium chlorate just make sure you get your

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.180
Finger out of the way of the flame before it burns you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.209
the reason this works is because this wood is very dry

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.020
It's very rough

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.199
And there's a long enough striking surface for the friction to build up where it can ignite

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.760
Now that may not always be the case if your

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.750
wood was damp or if you had a surface that was too smooth it wouldn't

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.000
Work the same, so you see this stick is moist

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.089
I actually dropped in the river and Matches will not light on it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.710
But if we take a stick and rub it back and forth as if we were trying to start a fire by rubbing sticks together

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.849
The Friction will actually drive out the moisture and this has become a very good striking surface

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.930
I don't actually want to start a fire by rubbing sticks, but it is a very similar concept

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.799
By rubbing the two sticks together we've actually generated quite a bit of heat

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.258
Which is charred wood that means it's driven the moisture off and this is very warm right now. Now. That should be dry enough

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.100
We take a match

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.390
boom

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.580
and it lights

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.900
I got it lit off in less than an inch big difference, okay?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.059
So it's been about five [minutes] since we rub the sticks together

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.049
This is already cooled down quite a bit, but surprisingly it still works really really well

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.720
The side of a Matchbox is red phosphorus, and when you strike potassium chlorate

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.328
it generates a chemical reaction what we're doing

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.159
Here is we're actually building enough to auto-ignite the testing cord itself

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.309
so you can see even if you find a moist piece of wood you can very easily drive off the moisture and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.650
Strike your Matches how cool is that?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.460
This almost works as well as the red striker strip paper does by itself

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.169
So there you have a [guys] using a few random sticks

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.309
You can find on a nature hike you can now turn safety matches in to strike anywhere

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.820
Thanks so much for joining me for this video, and I'll be looking for you in the next video. Talk to you then
