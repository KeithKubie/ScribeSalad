00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.730
- [Instructor] In this video,
we're gonna think about

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.590
what makes a poll or a survey credible.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.290
Because remember, the whole
reason why we're going

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.800
to do a poll or a survey is

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.190
we wanna understand public opinion.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.790
But if it's not statistically
credible, if we can't believe

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.990
what it's saying or if we
don't understand exactly

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.650
what it's saying then we
might not have a good sense

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.770
of what public opinion actually is.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.510
So the first really important thing,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.330
if you're writing any type
of survey, whether it's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.950
in politics or government or
not, is that you are taking

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.143
a random, random, sample.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.180
What does that mean?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.590
Well we go into a lot more
depth in it in our statistics

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.210
content on Khan Academy, but
it means that you should look

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.510
at the people, the voting population.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.340
And it does get a little
bit nuanced and tricky

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.310
on who are likely voters,
but you would go to say

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.820
the voting population
or the people in an area

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.620
whose opinion you care
about, and you would want

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.410
any one of them to have an equal shot

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.880
of being selected for your survey.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.880
So good examples of random
samples is maybe you take,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.140
you have a random phone number
generator of likely voters

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.280
in your district and you call them up.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.880
Maybe, and even then
you might say well hey,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.840
maybe certain types of
people pick up the phone

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.360
and certain people don't, or
certain people have a phone

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.193
and certain people don't.

00:01:20.193 --> 00:01:21.870
So you have to be very
careful about this design.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.960
But examples of non-random
sample would be to go

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.610
hang outside of the
Democratic party headquarters

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.870
in your district and just
survey people coming out

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.670
of that building, that
would be very not random

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.500
and you would get very skewed results.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.340
Now, the next thing that
you would want when you are

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.340
taking a survey is that you
want a large population size.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.750
Now, typically speaking, it's going to be

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.090
at least 500 folks, but you're
going to see a lot of surveys

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.560
that are about 500 to 1,000 participants.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.580
And sometimes in statistics
they'll say your N,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.250
which is the number of people
you surveyed is 500 to 1,000.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.170
And this is so you have a
good chance of getting close

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.890
to the true public opinion.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.780
We're gonna talk in a second
about margin of error.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.740
The larger this is, and
especially if you're doing

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.030
a true random sample, this is so,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.030
larger, larger, it reduces
the, you'll have a lower,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.850
margin, margin, of error.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.970
And I'll explain in depth what

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.700
a margin of error is in a second.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.410
Now, another key thing is
whatever you ask in your survey,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.710
it needs to be, the language, needs to be

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.510
as neutral and unbiased as possible.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.490
Let's say there's a new proposition,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.980
you could get very different results

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.400
if the wording of the question
is do you support funds

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.440
for those in need or if you
said do you support funds

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.550
for those who are not working.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.580
Those could get very,
very different results.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.240
And this is, there's really
an art to trying to get

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.980
a neutral, unbiased question there.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.080
Last, but not least, you
wanna make it very transparent

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.000
to the public how you conducted your poll

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.280
so that they can decide for themselves

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.460
how credible your poll actually is.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.400
So with that out of the way,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.090
let's look at real poll results.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.360
And then I'm gonna dig into
what the idea of margin of error

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.513
is, because you'll see this
a lot when you read the news.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.570
So this is from the Sun
Sentinel in Florida.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.810
They have a senatorial
race going on, and it says

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.130
despite millions of dollars
in television ad spending,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.250
Florida's US Senate race between

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.920
Bill Nelson and Rick Scott hasn't budged.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.670
A Florida Atlantic University
poll shows Republican Scott

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.670
with 44% of voters surveyed,
Democrat Nelson with 40%.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.440
So the first thing you might
say is well, what about

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.120
this only adds up to 84%,
what about the other 16%?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.850
Well, those could be undecided
voters or maybe there's

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.040
a third candidate there.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.570
That's a four-point
advantage in Scott's favor,

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.640
but it's within the
survey's margin of error,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.780
which means the race could be tied,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.233
or Scott could have a lead.

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:13.260
The FAU Business and
Economics Polling Initiative

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.100
survey of 800 Florida
registered voters was conducted

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.770
online and through
automated calls to people

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.830
with landline telephones.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.770
Researchers said it had a margin of error

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.090
of plus or minus three percentage points.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.710
So let's think about whether
this is a credible poll

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.920
and what inferences we can make from it.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.330
So the first thing is,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.700
were they transparent about their methods?

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.510
And it seems like they were, this whole,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.700
this paragraph right over
here, they're very transparent

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.210
about their methods, how
many people did they survey,

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.230
they say how they actually
conducted the survey,

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.750
and so check on transparency.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.470
And then because they were
transparent, we can check

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.860
whether these other things are true.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.100
So first, random sample.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.550
They don't go into a lot of depth

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.600
on how it was conducted online,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.890
but if it is a neutral site
where any Florida voter

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.570
is equally likely to show up,

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.910
well then that might be
a good random sample.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.760
Now, you have to be
careful with online because

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.210
who has access to online,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.730
who does not have access to online,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.700
who might go to whatever site
it is being conducted on.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.860
So this has a couple of
question marks right over here.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.420
And then they say through
automated calls to people

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.240
with landline telephones.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.620
So once again, this
seems reasonably random,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.810
it's along the lines that
I talked about earlier.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.380
Maybe they had some
random phone number picker

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.580
in Florida and they called those folks,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.080
but maybe, you know, there's
certain people have landlines,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.560
a lot of people now
only have mobile phones.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.010
There's certain people who
pick up and might answer things

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.500
and certain people who might not.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.210
So as you can see,
there's an art to getting

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.590
a truly random sample,
but you can tell that the

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.330
Florida Atlantic University group

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.860
tried to get a random sample.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.910
The next was the large population size.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.910
Well, they said a survey
of 800 Florida voters,

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.280
so that's pretty good.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.240
And it's not just 800 for 800 sake,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.680
it's the number of voters

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.230
that's gonna drive the margin of error.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.780
So this is a good time to say
what is the margin of error?

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.220
So a margin of error is
going to be associated

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.180
with a confidence level.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.890
It's typically going to
be a 95% confidence level

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.770
if they don't tell you otherwise.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.770
And so what this means is,
is that 95% of the time,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.580
when you take a random sample
of 800 Florida residents,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.580
you will get a result that is
within three percentage points

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.770
of the true result.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.120
Remember, there's some
true result we don't know

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.110
unless we could perfectly
get into everyone's head

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.510
and this poll is a way of
trying to estimate that.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.230
So one way to think about it,
within 3% of what you got,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.440
Republican Scott is really,
you could create a confidence

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.140
interval where you could say
the confidence interval's

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.500
going to be 3% less
than this, which is 41%,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.380
all the way to 3% more
than this, which is 47%.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.160
And one way to think about it is,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.500
there's a 95% chance
that this will overlap

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.680
with the true result.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.190
And you might say hey, well
the low end of this range

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.530
is still higher than Democrat Nelson,

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.090
but that confidence level applies

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.200
to Democrat Nelson as well.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.250
So Democrat Nelson's
confidence interval would be

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.250
between 37%, 3% less than this,
and 43%, 3% more than this.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.120
There's still a reasonable
chance maybe the Democrat's

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.640
at the higher end of this
range which could still mean

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.960
that the Democrat could win
even though the headline numbers

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.360
show a four-point advantage
for the Republican.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.430
And outside of the statistical
error, the margin of error

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.200
we're talking about, you have
to remember that this poll

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.000
is before the actual election.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.430
People change their minds,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.190
there's a whole campaign going on,

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.020
so even if you were to
get the exact result,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.760
this is just a snapshot in time.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.740
It could change on election day.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.260
Now this last question
where they asked a neutral,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
unbiased question, we don't know exactly,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.480
at least just from this article,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.480
they might have published it
in the details of the poll,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.510
but if they asked something
like who will you vote for

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.520
on the election on this day, that would be

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.400
very neutral and unbiased.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.460
But if they say are you going
to vote for the public servant

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.050
who has served Florida for many years

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.763
or that Democrat guy, well
that would be not unbiased.
