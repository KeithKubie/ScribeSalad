00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.480
I actually got interested in epidemiology and public health back when

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.189
I was an undergraduate in Wisconsin an 
I was a science journalist.

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.720
My daughter is almost three and lately I've been asking her what do you want to do when

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.939
you grow up and she said she says now "I want to be a research doctor like Mommy."

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.250
And, "So well what do you want to research?" and she says "Babies like like like baby

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.780
Owen," her little brother. I got interested
in transplantation when I was a public

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.579
health student here at Emory. I had a
really fantastic mentor, Bill McClellan

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.780
who was a nephrologist and an
epidemiologist, and he really introduced

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.890
me to the field of kidney disease and to
transplantation, and really inspired me

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.570
to want to do more in the transplant
world. We want to be able to improve

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.670
equity in access to transplantation. As
an epidemiologist I'm striving for

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.930
trying to collect better data to report
on these differences with the hope that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.310
eventually there are no differences in
access to transplantation and there's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.520
equality in transplant access across the
country. Emory Transplant Center is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.299
phenomenal and I feel so lucky that I am
working here alongside some of the best

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:39.750
surgeons and nephrologists and others.
I think I want my legacy to be just that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.250
I made some difference in people's lives.
The patients who are willing to donate a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.100
kidney to help save a life are truly
amazing individuals. I think it's so

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.259
inspirational when I see the flag raised
for when I know someone has donated an

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.399
organ. For me it does have a lot of
personal significance because I've had

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.910
family members who have been touched by transplant. but it also it just

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.980
illustrates I think the power of altruism and how much that helps someone

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.970
else to save a life.
