00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.240
&gt;&gt;In Norway, a lot of people have commented
on what they think is

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.349
important that's the debated here at Davos.
England, for instance, says think global,

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.920
act local.
[INAUDIBLE], he says that we should focus

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.970
more on tolerance and respect
one another.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.570
Now those are really good suggestions and
they are actually debated

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.470
quite a lot here at Davos and focused on.
So thank you everyone that sent in your suggestions

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.800
and your ideas that
was really nice reading, and gave me a bit

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.460
of input on what I could do
here at the World Economic Forum.
