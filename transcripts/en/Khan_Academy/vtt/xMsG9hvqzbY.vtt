00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.470
Like the last video, I want
to start with two warm up

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.210
problems. And then we'll
do an actual word.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.050
And you're going to see these
are going to be a little bit

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.340
more involved than the equations
in the last video.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.190
But we're still going to
be doing the exact same

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.630
operations, or what we could
consider legitimate

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.130
operations, to get our answer.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.880
So here we have 3 times x
minus 1 is equal to 2

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.590
times x plus 3.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.880
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.880
The first thing I like to do--
and there's no definite right

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.730
way to do it-- there's several
ways you could do these

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.439
problems-- but I like
to distribute out

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.000
the 3 and the 2.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.240
So 3 times x minus 1, that's the
same thing as 3x minus 3--

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.440
I just distributed the
3-- is equal to--

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.810
distribute out the 2.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.570
2 times x, plus 2 times
3, which is 6.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.100
Now what I like to do is get
all of my constant terms on

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.220
the same side of the equation
and all my variable terms on

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.390
the same side of the equation.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.660
So let's see if we can get
rid of this 2x term on

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.580
the right hand side.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.220
So let's subtract 2x.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.120
I'm going to do a slightly
different notation this time

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.290
because you might see
it done this way.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.880
Or you might find it easier
to visualize it this way.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.410
It doesn't matter.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.360
It's the same thing we did
in the last video.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.160
But I want to subtract 2x from
this side of the equation.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.960
But if I subtract 2x from the
side of the equation, I also

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.610
have to subtract 2x from that
side of the equation.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.930
So then when we subtract 2x
from both sides of the

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.470
equation, what do we get?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.810
Here we get 3x minus 2x.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.900
That's just 1x, or x minus 3.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.390
2x minus 2x is no x's, or 0.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.130
Then you just have the 6.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.620
So we get x minus
3 is equal to 6.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.980
That was by getting rid of the
2x from the right hand side;

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.890
subtracting it from both
sides of this equation.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.140
Now we have this negative
3 on the left hand side.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.920
I don't want it there.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.410
I just want an x there.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.640
So to get rid of that
we can add 3 to both

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.890
sides of this equation.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.910
You could imagine this is being
adding this equation to

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.980
the equation 3 is equal to 3.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.570
3 is, obviously, equal to 3.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.250
Negative 2x is, obviously,
equal to negative 2x.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.070
You could do it either way.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.410
But if you add 3 to both sides
of this equation the left hand

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.170
side of the equation becomes
just an x, because these two

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.710
guys cancel out. x equal,
and 6 plus 3 is 9.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.650
And we are done.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.520
And we can even check
our answer.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.950
3 times 9 minus 1 is what?

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.890
This is 3 times 8.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.450
This is 24.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.400
So that's what the left
hand side equals.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.220
What does the right
hand side equal?

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.890
That is 2 times 9 plus 3.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.390
That's the 2 times 12, which
is also equals 24.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.790
So it all works out.
x is equals to 9.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.430
Next problem.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.830
z over 16 is equal to 2 times 3z
plus 1, all of that over 9.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.210
So it's a hairy looking
problem.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.820
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 9.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.520
So if you multiply both sides
of this equation by

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.510
9, what do we get?

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.490
We get 9 over 16z is equal to--
this 9 and that 9 will

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.250
cancel out-- 2 times
3z plus 1.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.240
Now let's distribute this 2.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:38.540
So we get 9 over 16z is equal
to 2 times 3z is 6z plus 2.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.900
Now let's get all of z's on the
same side of the equation.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.070
So let's subtract 6z from both
sides of the equation.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.210
So let's subtract minus 6z
there, and that, of course,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.370
equals minus 6z there.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.390
And what do we get?

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:02.250
On the left hand side,
we get 9/16 minus 6.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.640
What is 6 if I have 16
as a denominator?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.030
6 is equal to what over 16?

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.956
Let me think about it.

00:04:09.956 --> 00:04:11.890
60 plus 36.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.980
It's equal to 96/16.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.140
So it's 9 minus 96 over 16z.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.240
This is just 6-- I just rewrote
minus 6 here-- is

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.360
equal to-- these
two cancel out.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.985
That's why I subtracted
6z in the first place.

00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:29.940
So it's going to equal 2.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.710
So what does this equal
right over here?

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.100
Let me do it in orange.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.320
9 minus 96.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.820
Well let's see.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.710
The difference between 9 and
96 is going to be 87.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.650
And, of course, we're
subtracting the larger from

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.130
the smaller.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.460
So it's going to be negative
87 over 16z is equal to 2.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.460
And we're almost there.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.540
We just have to multiply both
sides of this equation by the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.730
inverse of this coefficient.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:10.630
So multiply both sides of this
equation by negative 16/87.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.750
These cancel out.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.420
87, 87, 16 and 16.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.660
The negative signs plus.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.990
You're just left with z is equal
to 2 times this thing.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.830
So 2 times negative 16
is negative 32/87.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.160
And we are done.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.970
That's not a pretty looking
answer, but

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.620
that's what we got.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.460
And you can try it with
multiple methods.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.850
Maybe you can multiply both of
the equation by 16 first.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.970
Maybe you can distribute out the
2 9's first. All sorts of

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.550
things you can do.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.970
And you could also verify that
this is, indeed, the answer.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.240
Let's do a word problem now
that we're warmed up.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.030
All right.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.360
It says Manoj and Tomar are
arguing about how a number

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.200
trick they heard goes.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.880
Tomar tells Andrew to
think of a number.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.770
Let's say that x is the number
that Andrew thinks of.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.750
Think of a number.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.010
Multiply it by 5.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.730
So this is what Tomar
is saying.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.105
Æ’ is telling Andrew to think of
a number, multiply it by 5,

00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:11.130
so let me do that.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.435
So multiply it by 5, and
subtract 3 from the result.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.325
We'll do that in a
different color.

00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:23.280
We'll do it in blue.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.670
Subtract 3 from the result.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.030
So subtract 3 from the result.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.740
Then Manoj comes along.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.490
So here's Manoj.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.010
Manoj comes along and tells
Andrew once again

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.820
to think of a number.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.150
So once again, think
of a number.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.600
We'll call that x.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.250
So they both are telling him
to think of a number.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.780
Add five.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.960
So now he's saying add
five to the number.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.370
So you add 5 to number.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.290
And then multiply
the result by 3.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.990
So multiply the result by 3.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.580
Andrew says that which ever way
he does the trick, he gets

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.730
the same answer.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.100
What was Andrew's number?

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.080
So regardless of whether he does
5 times the number, and

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.170
then subtracts 3, or whether he
adds 5 and then multiples

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.950
the whole answer by 3, he
gets the same number.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.470
So that must mean that these
two things are equal.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.070
He gets the same answer.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.630
That means that these
two are equals.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.540
So let's solve this equation.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:30.380
We get 5x minus 3 is equal
to 3 times x plus 5.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.870
A good place for me-- I like to
distribute out this 3, so

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.620
that is equal to 3x plus 15.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.820
Always have to remember to
multiply the 3 times all of

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.330
the terms in parentheses.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.020
This is a 15.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.460
And, of course, 5x minus
3 is equal to that.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.040
Now, I think you know how
I like to operate.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.090
I like to get all of my
ex-coeffients on one side.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.590
So let's get them all on
the left hand side.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.770
Which means, let's get rid of
them on the right hand side.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.120
So let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.420
So minus 3x minus 3x and
then what do we get?

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.410
Our equation becomes
5x minus 3x is 2x.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.420
You still have a minus 3 is
equal to-- these cancel out--

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.380
equal to 15.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.170
Equal to that yellow
15 right there.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.300
Now we want to get rid
of this negative 3 on

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.170
the left hand side.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.110
And the best way to do it
is to add 3 to both

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.170
sides of the equation.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.620
So add 3 to both sides
of this equation.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.770
So what do you get?

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:35.539
You now get 2x-- and these
cancel out-- is equal to 18.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.144
And then you divide both
sides of this by 2.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.159
And you get x is equal
to 18 over 2.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.340
Or 9.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.560
So in either situation, Andrew
was thinking of the number 9.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.430
Let's see if it works according
to both Tomar and

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.720
Manoj's method.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.190
If I were to take 5 times-- if
this is 9-- you get 5 times 9

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.350
is 45 minus 3.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.270
So you get 42.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.910
That's when you do
Tomar's method.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.270
When you do Manoj's method--
this is a 9, right there.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.110
9 plus 5 is 14.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.990
So this thing becomes 14, and
it becomes 3 times 14.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.860
3 times 14 is 30 plus
12, which is 42.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.790
So Andrew was right.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.230
When he randomly picked the
number 9, and regardless of

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.030
which method he uses, he
gets the same results.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.000
He gets 42.
