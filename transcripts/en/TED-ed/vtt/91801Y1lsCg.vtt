00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:11.713
How much can we really know about 
the universe beyond our galaxy?

00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:13.677
The Hubble Telescope has enabled us to see

00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:18.448
objects in space as far 
13,000,000,000 light years away.

00:00:18.448 --> 00:00:21.720
But this still doesn't give us the answers
to all our questions,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.243
questions like, "What is the universe
made of?"

00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:28.833
"Which elements are the most abundant?"

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:33.082
"Does space contain undiscovered
forms of matter?"

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:38.025
"Could there be antimatter stars
or galaxies?"

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:41.914
Some of these questions cannot
be answered solely from visual images,

00:00:41.914 --> 00:00:45.181
but what if we had messengers
bringing us physical data

00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:46.868
from distant parts of the cosmos,

00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:50.374
beyond the reach of 
explorers or satellites?

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:56.881
In a way, we do, and these 
"space messengers" are called cosmic rays.

00:00:56.881 --> 00:01:00.471
Cosmic rays were first discovered
in 1912 by Victor Hess

00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:04.841
when he set out to explore variations
in the atmosphere's level of radiation,

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:08.367
which had been thought to
emanate from the Earth's crust.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:12.083
By taking measurements on board
a flying balloon during an eclipse,

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:15.403
Hess demonstrated both that
the radiation actually increased

00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:19.709
at greater altitudes
and that the sun could not be its source.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.560
The startling conclusion was that 
it wasn't coming from anywhere

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.780
within the Earth's atmosphere
but from outer space.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.892
Our universe is composed of many
astronomical objects.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:38.120
BIllions of stars of all sizes, black holes,
active galactic nuclei,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.255
astroids, planets and more.

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:45.809
During violent disturbances, such as a
large star exploding into a supernova,

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:49.651
billions of particles are 
emitted into space.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.567
Although they are called rays,

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:54.531
cosmic rays consist of these 
high energy particles

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:58.111
rather than the photons that
make up light rays.

00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.792
While the light from an explosion
travels in a straight line

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:03.091
at its famous constant speed,

00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:05.389
the particles are trapped
in extraordinary loops

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:09.175
by magnetic shockwaves 
generated by the explosion.

00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:12.080
Crossing back and forth
through these magnetic field lines

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.040
accelerates them to almost the speed of
light before they escape.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.778
There are lots of cosmic rays in space,
and some of these particles have traveled

00:02:20.778 --> 00:02:24.404
for billions of years before reaching Earth.

00:02:24.404 --> 00:02:27.735
When they enter our atmosphere,
they collide with the molecules there,

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:30.873
generating secondary cosmic rays,

00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:34.756
lighter particles with less energy
than the original.

00:02:34.756 --> 00:02:37.247
Most of these are absorbed 
into the atmosphere,

00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:41.965
but some are able to reach the ground,
even passing through our bodies.

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:45.004
At sea level, this radiation is fairly low.

00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:48.623
But people who spend a lot of time
at higher altitudes,

00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:52.829
such as airline crews,
are exposed to much more.

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.531
What makes cosmic rays
useful as messengers

00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:59.242
is that they carry the traces
of their origins.

00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:02.741
By studying the frequency
with which different particles occur,

00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:06.182
scientists are able to determine
the relative abundance of elements,

00:03:06.182 --> 00:03:09.807
such as hydrogen and helium,
within the universe.

00:03:09.807 --> 00:03:13.012
But cosmic rays may provide
even more fascinating information

00:03:13.012 --> 00:03:16.034
about the fabric of the universe itself.

00:03:16.034 --> 00:03:20.571
An experiment called
the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, A.M.S.,

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:24.203
has recently been installed on board
the International Space Station,

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.497
containing several detectors that can
separately measure

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:32.969
a cosmic ray particle's velocity,
trajectory, radiation, mass and energy,

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.214
as well as whether the particle
is matter or antimatter.

00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:39.679
While the two are normally
indistinguishable,

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:44.779
their opposite charges enable them
to be detected with the help of a magnet.

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:50.040
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is
currently measuring 50 million particles per day

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.367
with information about each particle being
sent in real time from the space station

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:57.427
to the A.M.S. control room at CERN.

00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:58.885
Over the upcoming months and years,

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:03.329
it's expected to yield both amazing
and useful information about antimatter,

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.248
the possible existence of dark matter,

00:04:05.248 --> 00:04:07.953
and even possible ways
to mitigate the effects

00:04:07.953 --> 00:04:11.095
of cosmic radiation on space travel.

00:04:11.095 --> 00:04:15.161
As we stay tuned for new discoveries,
look to the sky on a clear night,

00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:18.066
and you may see the
International Space Station,

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:21.636
where the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer
receives the tiny messengers

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:23.977
that carry cosmic secrets.
