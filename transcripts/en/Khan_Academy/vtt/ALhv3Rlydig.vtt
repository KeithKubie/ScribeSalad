00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.285
 

00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:01.660
In this video, I
really just want

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.280
to introduce you
to some terminology

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.380
for some basic angle types.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.010
And the terminology I
want to introduce you to

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:20.410
are acute angles, right
angles, and obtuse angles.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.190
And I think when we
just go through these,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.660
they'll be pretty
self-explanatory.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.380
An acute angle is an
angle-- well, let me just

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.210
draw them first.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.229
Then it might start
to make sense.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.510
So an acute angle will
look something like that.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.850
I draw two rays that are
coming from a common point.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.070
So the acute angle will be
this angle right over here.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.590
I could also draw an
acute angle, maybe

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.160
an angle that's formed from
the intersection of two lines.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.200
This angle will be acute,
and so will this angle.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.894
They're both acute angles.

00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:55.060
And we're going to see is
acute angles are ones that

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.120
are-- since I haven't defined
right angles yet-- they're

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.620
narrower.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.411
And what we're going
to see is that they're

00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:01.760
smaller than right angles.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.770
Right angles are when the
rays or the lines are going,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.520
I guess, in the-- I don't
want to use the word, right,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.650
in my definition-- but if
one is going horizontal,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.457
the other one will
be going vertical.

00:01:17.457 --> 00:01:19.040
So let me draw it
with the rays first.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.410
So the right angle, this
one's going from the left

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.220
to the right.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.570
Then the other ray is going
from the bottom to the top.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.330
This angle right over
here is a right angle.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.670
And I could label it like
that, as a traditional angle.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.560
But the general convention
for labeling right angles

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.940
is to put a little, kind of a
half of a box right over there.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.080
And that means that
is a right angle.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.770
Or that if this is
going left to right,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.910
this is going perfectly
top to bottom,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.360
that this is in no way kind of--
I guess the best way to think

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.150
about it and why
it's called right

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.140
is that this ray is
completely upright, compared

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.130
to this ray over here.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.860
And let me draw it
with some lines.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.090
So if I have one line
like this and then I

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.500
have another line like
that, a right angle

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.230
over here-- actually
all of these

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.090
would have to be right angles--
it would mean that this line is

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.860
completely-- if
this was the ground,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.590
this line is completely
upright, relative to this line

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.090
over here.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.010
So either of these, that's
what a right angle means.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.860
And now that we've
defined right angle,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.400
I can give you another
definition for an acute angle.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.250
An acute angle has a
measure, or it's smaller,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.080
than a right angle.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.710
When you learn about
radians and degrees, which

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.510
are different ways
to measure angles,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.950
you'll see that a right angle
can be measured as 90 degrees.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.070
This over here is
less than 90 degrees.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.180
So this is less than 90 degrees.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.690
And one way to
conceptualize this

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.570
is that this angle, its opening
is smaller, it's more narrow,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.520
the lines are-- you would
have to rotate one line less

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.650
to get to the other line
than you would over here.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.130
Here, you'd have to move
it all the way over there.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.180
Here, you'd only have
to move it a little bit.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.950
So the acute angle is
less than a right angle.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.180
And so you might imagine
already what an obtuse angle is.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.370
It is greater than
a right angle.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.500
So let me draw a couple of
examples of obtuse angles.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.440
So an obtuse angle
might look like-- let

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.930
me make it a little bit clearer.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.850
It might look like that.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.730
If this was a right
angle, this line over here

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.550
would look something like that.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.940
It would be completely
upright relative to this

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.120
if this were the ground.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.680
But we don't see that.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.130
This orange ray over here is
actually opened out wider.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.930
It's opened up wider.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.910
So it is obtuse.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.860
And this kind of comes from
the actual everyday meaning.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.910
Acute means very sharp
or very sensitive.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.940
Obtuse means not very sharp
or not very sensitive.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.800
So you could imagine this looks
like a sharp point or it's not

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.510
opening up much, so maybe
it's more sensitive relative

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.960
to other things,
or I don't know.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.590
I'm just trying to
make connections.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.040
This is less sensitive.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.380
It's all big and open.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.960
It won't be able
to notice things

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.070
that are small
because I don't know.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.930
Maybe that's not an
appropriate analogy.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.019
But one way to think about it,
it's kind of open up wider,

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.260
or it's bigger
than a right angle.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.820
It's larger than 90
degrees if you measure it.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.000
You would have to
rotate this ray more

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.220
to get to this other ray
than you would if they were

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.280
right angles, and
definitely a lot more than

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.860
if they were acute angles.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.580
If I were to draw this with
lines, which of the angles

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.250
are obtuse and which are acute?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.400
Well, the way I've drawn
them right over here,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.720
these two over here are acute,
and then these over here

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.760
are going to be obtuse.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.860
This one and this one, these
are both obtuse angles.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.980
And I actually drew
it up here, as well.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.160
This one and this one
are going to be obtuse.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.460
So very simple idea.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.250
If one line or one ray
relative to the other one

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.540
is straight up and down,
versus to left and right,

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.560
or is completely
upright, then we're

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.146
talking about a right angle.

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:21.770
If they're closer to
each other, if you

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.353
have to rotate them less, you're
talking about an acute angle.

00:05:24.353 --> 00:05:26.001
If you have to rotate
them more, you're

00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:27.250
talking about an obtuse angle.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.249
And I think when you just
look at them visually,

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.330
it's pretty easy to pick out.
