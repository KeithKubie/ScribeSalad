CHRIS YING: My
name's Chris Ying,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.770
I'm the editor-in-chief
of a silly food

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.400
magazine called "Lucky Peach".

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.355
Among the things that my
job is good for-- or one

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:13.230
of the only things it's
good for-- is getting

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.670
to eat at lots of restaurants
that I otherwise would not

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.490
be able to.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.470
I think in the last year,
since meeting Christopher,

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.680
I've had the pleasure of
eating at Meadowood five times

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.530
or something
ridiculous like that.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.110
Too many times for him.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.920
And I've eaten at a number
of fine dining restaurants

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.430
around the world
and certain trends

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.180
start to kind of appear
to you once you've

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.180
eaten at a number of two
or three Michelin star

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.230
restaurants.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.160
And you start to see that
two-star Michelin restaurants

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.329
are kind of where a lot of
the innovative, exciting stuff

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.870
is happening.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450
And three Michelin
star restaurants

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.950
are where luxury and
over-the-top eating

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.327
happens and you're
just pampered.

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:57.910
And so when I went
to eat at Meadowood

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.610
for the very first time,
I thought, OK, well this

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.790
is going to be another
one of those situations

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.410
where I'm going
to have to loosen

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.826
my belt toward the
end of the meal

00:01:04.826 --> 00:01:06.500
and just feel really
uncomfortable.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.720
And I was just struck
eating at Meadowood.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.150
Of all the restaurants
I've eaten,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.760
it was this really
exciting, innovative place

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.530
where cooking was happening
that spoke to a specific place

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.710
in time and felt relevant.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.300
And it was set in
this place that

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.961
was really luxurious
and beautiful,

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.460
but it didn't feel
stodgy in the way

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.410
that a three Michelin
star restaurant was--

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.700
and by the way, Meadowood is a
three Michelin star restaurant.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.160
So anyway, I got to know
Christopher a little bit more

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.290
and found him to be
one of these guys who

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.940
is at the very forefront of
cooking in the world today.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.580
Just pushing things forward and
speaking to his specific place

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.100
where Meadowood is, which
is in the Napa Valley.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.580
So with that all
in mind, here we

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.080
are today in
Mountain View, which

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.138
is something a little bit
of a homecoming for you.

00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:04.100
Can you give us a little
bit about-- can you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.766
explain what the hell
I'm talking about?

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:06.690
CHRIS KOSTOW: Sure.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.460
Thanks for coming
everyone, thank you.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.210
My first chef job was
actually at Chez TJ,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.650
which is on Villa
Street, in Mountain View.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.780
It has been there for 28
years, 29 years, maybe.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.370
Same owner, same paint
on the walls, same lamps.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.530
And so, yeah.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.030
So I moved to Mountain View
after I lived in San Francisco,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.430
as the sous chef at Campton
Place for Daniel Humm.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.520
And I wanted my first chef
job-- and having never been

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.610
to Mountain View or
anywhere near here--

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.380
it seemed close
enough to the city,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.073
I think that was my thinking.

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:42.031
And I came and I lived
in what was more or less

00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:44.114
a double-wide trailer
behind the restaurant, which

00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:46.300
is where all the chefs
lived throughout their time

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.800
at the restaurant.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.050
I spent two years there, we
had some degree of success

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.350
and moved on to Meadowood.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.890
And I'm actually coming back to
do a dinner this coming Monday,

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.750
like a dinner
surrounding the book,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.605
at Chez TJ, which
should be a lot of fun.

00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:02.355
CHRIS YING: What brought
you to California

00:03:02.355 --> 00:03:04.630
or northern
California originally?

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.520
CHRIS KOSTOW: I went to college
in New York, Hamilton College.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.210
We don't produce a
lot of engineers.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.690
It's all poets and finance.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.370
And I had some idea that I
wanted to be in California,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.620
having visited.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.806
I had a roommate who was from
San Diego and those of you that

00:03:24.806 --> 00:03:26.180
know that area
where Hamilton is,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.970
like the center
of New York state.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.950
It's like this
meteorological, bizarro world

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.520
where there's no sun ever.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.920
It's really odd.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.106
So I just wanted to go
somewhere that was sunny,

00:03:37.106 --> 00:03:38.480
and I wanted to
go to California,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.850
and I wanted to be a chef.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.440
Those were like the
general ideas that I had.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.790
So I ended up in San Diego,
living on the beach, cooking,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.210
and eventually found my
way to San Francisco.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.360
CHRIS YING: And at Hamilton,
you studied philosophy.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.510
Not a lot of chefs
start their careers

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.220
by going to college
to study philosophy.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.066
And it's interesting, I was
thinking about it being here

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:00.690
at Google, too.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.530
A lot of people who are in this
industry, in the tech industry,

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.410
don't necessarily study
engineering or study anything

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.317
that pertains to a company
where they end up working.

00:04:09.317 --> 00:04:10.900
But in the book, you
talk a little bit

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.890
about how your different
background informs

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.140
the way you cook or helps you.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.290
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.019
CHRIS KOSTOW: I mean,
I think I should

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.829
say when it's written
that I studied philosophy,

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.426
I was terrible at it.

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:22.800
So I don't want
people thinking I

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.767
could have been this
acclaimed writer of philosophy

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:26.850
and instead chose to cook.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.225
I don't think that
was an option.

00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:33.410
Is there reverb or am I
just hearing that in my ear?

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.805
CHRIS YING: That's
definitely something.

00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:35.513
CHRIS KOSTOW: OK.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.490
Philosophy, like
cooking-- you study

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.010
philosophy in an
academic setting.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.230
You're learning what
other people said,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.630
you're studying those
things, with the end goal

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.300
in mind of maybe distilling
those things through the lens

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.840
of your own life and
creating an original idea.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.820
I think that's sort of the idea.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.580
And cooking's very
much like that.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.186
You come up in
different kitchens

00:04:59.186 --> 00:05:01.060
and you learn all these
different techniques.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.510
You learn flavor profiles,
you learn skill sets.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.190
But in the end, it's up to you,
after a certain period of time,

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.090
to take all that
information and create

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.548
something that's
uniquely your own.

00:05:10.548 --> 00:05:12.090
And that takes a long time.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.520
And that's the challenge with
young cooks now is they watch

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.020
a lot of TV where
everyone's a chef.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.010
People want to create
their food, as they say.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.596
But really that's the last
step of the whole thing.

00:05:26.596 --> 00:05:27.970
It's about acquiring
a skill set.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.880
I think the parallel is
that, is that eventually,

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.210
if you study well enough,
if you learn enough things,

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.959
and if you're honest
enough with yourself,

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:38.250
you can maybe, one day,
articulate your own vision.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.400
CHRIS YING: So the book is
called "A New Napa Cuisine".

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.760
For those of us who are not
familiar with the old Napa

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.260
cuisine or what
came before, can you

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.096
explain what you're
trying to achieve?

00:05:51.096 --> 00:05:52.220
What a new Napa cuisine is?

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.011
CHRIS KOSTOW: Sure.

00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:56.252
And I'm very careful to
recognize the fact that there's

00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:58.585
a lot of great chefs who have
already cooked in the Napa

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:00.230
Valley, well before
I ever got there.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.750
Before I was born, frankly.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.192
So it's not to say
that I'm the first guy

00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:06.150
to grill in the Napa
Valley and cook nice food,

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.150
because that's
obviously not the case.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.470
But I think we make the
parallel in the book

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.440
between architecture, as an
example, where, in the Napa

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.330
Valley, it was the arrival
of the wine industry

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.750
and the wealth that followed it.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.072
It had a hodgepodge of
architectural styles.

00:06:22.072 --> 00:06:24.530
There was like Spanish Revival
and there's a lot of Tuscan,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.280
and there was
suburban McMansion.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.270
There's all this stuff and
as the Valley slowed down

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.110
and started to maybe curate
something specific to it

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.770
in an architectural sense.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.790
People specifically like
Howard Backen, who's

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.270
a renowned architect in the
area-- the Valley started

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.880
to create this more singular
architectural style that

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.210
had references to the
Valley's agrarian past,

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.970
had a very minimalist
aesthetic, it

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.250
was something that is now a
Napa Valley architectural style.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.380
So in looking at
food in the same way,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.540
there was always nice food.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.495
Tra Vigne did great
Italian food for 15 years

00:06:59.495 --> 00:07:01.370
and the French Laundry
does great food that's

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.880
of a French bend.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.940
There was places like Cindy's
that were very America.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.700
There's always good
food, but I don't

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.830
know if there was necessarily
the ambition, the desire,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.830
or the wherewithal to
create a cooking that

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.230
really sprang from the place.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.340
And, as we outline in
the book, that really

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.510
details those four
operating principles

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.020
which are: the use of
agriculture as a jumping off

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.520
point.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.030
We do that by operating own
gardens, a nod to the Valley's

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.470
agricultural past.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.400
It's using the materia
prima of the Valley--

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.170
it's the grains that
are milled nearby,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.660
it's the use of the
bees and the honey

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.210
and all of those things,
the olive oil, all

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.397
that is found within the Valley.

00:07:40.397 --> 00:07:42.730
There's the artisans, which
is a big part of what we do,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.745
which is the curation
and commissioning

00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:51.100
of our plates made in the Napa
Valley for the restaurant.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.680
And then--

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:55.210
CHRIS YING: The materia--

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.793
CHRIS KOSTOW: Did I
say materia prima?

00:07:56.793 --> 00:07:57.660
Growers, artisans.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.140
CHRIS YING: Foraging.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:58.630
CHRIS KOSTOW: Thank you.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.606
Jesus Christ.

00:07:59.606 --> 00:08:00.980
And then there's
the wilds, which

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.430
is utilizing the wild
elements of the Valley--

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.665
the foraging, the mushrooms,
the wild sorrells, all

00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:07.490
of those things.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.040
So really using those
things, most of which

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.539
were really untouched.

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:13.580
But in a culinary sense,
harnessing those things,

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.740
and starting to write a
new chapter in the Napa's

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.719
culinary history.

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:20.510
CHRIS YING: This idea
you're talking about,

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.510
of cooking food, of having a
restaurant that's specifically

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.460
of a place that's very
much tied to the artisans

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.920
and the wilds and
the materia prima,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.746
is that something that
you brought with you

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:33.870
when you came to Meadowood?

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.890
Or is it something that you
learned when you arrived?

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.450
CHRIS KOSTOW: I think that
a lot of those words--

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:44.320
local and specificity
of place-- those

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.924
are definitely currents
in the food world.

00:08:46.924 --> 00:08:48.340
I wasn't the first
guy to be like,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.880
I want to cook food from here.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.070
And maybe I was the first guy to
actually choose that particular

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.060
here, but there are
people, I think--

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.610
and there have been
for a long time--

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.926
sort of acting as
proponents of that idea.

00:08:58.926 --> 00:09:00.300
But when I got
there, I certainly

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.355
had no idea that that was the
direction I wanted to take.

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:04.730
And as we talk
about in the book,

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.380
they were a lot
of "aha!" moments

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.500
when you start to realize that
Napa has a very thin veneer.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.250
Meaning, there's this
assumption that it

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.654
is a certain kind of
place-- and it is.

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:16.820
It's a place where there's
money and wealth and wine

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.500
and tourists and
all these things.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.730
But that veneer is very
thin and below that

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.210
is a lot of historical
and cultural depth

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.120
and opportunities to
pursue something unique.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.990
So I think it was my
first couple of years

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:34.690
there that I started to
notice these things, it

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.790
was wild things growing,
if it was gaining

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.690
a small understanding of the
Valley's history and meeting

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.190
artisans.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.770
It was a slow development.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.020
And I really think it
came to focus years ago

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.490
and that was what
inspired the book.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.845
CHRIS YING: So, like
you said, no one

00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:52.570
had really thought
that Napa Valley was

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.320
one of these places
with a heritage that

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.500
could be unearthed from the
surface that we all know.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.870
And the same goes
with Copenhagen

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.250
with Noma or Sao
Paulo and Alex Atala.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.770
So is this idea of
uncovering what's

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.410
beneath the veneer
something that

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.700
could be translatable anywhere?

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.405
Can you do it in Mountain View?

00:10:12.405 --> 00:10:13.030
Can you do it--

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.071
CHRIS KOSTOW: I think so.

00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:18.770
It's important to not make it
an overly academic process.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.147
You have to cook the food well.

00:10:20.147 --> 00:10:22.480
You have to have nice product,
you need to cook it well,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:30.762
otherwise it's an intellectual
exercise and has no value.

00:10:30.762 --> 00:10:31.720
Food has to taste good.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.260
So that's the jumping off point.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.250
So, yeah, you could apply it
to a lot of different things.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.080
And a lot of people frankly are,
in very forced, contrived ways,

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.280
trying to do that,
but in the end,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.160
again, it's about being able to
cook well and pleasing people.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.525
Everything else, I think
has to follow from that.

00:10:48.525 --> 00:10:50.400
CHRIS YING: And so you
have these four tenets

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.858
that you talked about and you
talk about in the book, which

00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:58.280
are the garden operations and
the artisans, the wilds of Napa

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:03.590
and the materia prima-- the
local earth and product.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.867
So maybe we can go through
each of these a little bit

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:07.700
and talk about them.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.860
Can you describe the garden
operations at Meadowood?

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.730
CHRIS KOSTOW: Sure.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.480
When I got there, there
was a small garden

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.810
that was connected
to the property which

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.440
we use quite a bit and
we still use somewhat.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.424
There's fruit trees and figs
and apples and quince and pears

00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:24.840
and we still use
that quite a bit.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.385
But we outgrew it and
developed a partnership

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:29.402
with a local Montessori
school which is just

00:11:29.402 --> 00:11:31.110
on the other side of
the Silverado trail,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.900
like a quarter mile
from the restaurant.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.370
And we joined forces
with the school.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.310
We utilized their land--
we have hoop houses

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.100
and we grow on about
two acres over there.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.100
I work with the kids and
we do community lunches

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.400
at the restaurant.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.590
It's as much an
agricultural effort

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.530
as it is a community outreach.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.050
And that has really
proven to be the beating

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.140
heart of our creative process.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.370
And we have a woman in
place there, Christine,

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:06.310
who is like the world's
greatest gardener, frankly.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.182
We work very closely with her in
terms of, what are we planting?

00:12:09.182 --> 00:12:09.890
When's it coming?

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:10.850
And we've really
gotten to a point--

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.590
we've gotten fairly good at it
over the past couple of years--

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.140
where maybe on a good month,
maybe 70% of what we're using

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.654
from a vegetable point of view
is coming from the garden.

00:12:19.654 --> 00:12:21.195
CHRIS YING: That's
pretty incredible.

00:12:21.195 --> 00:12:24.026
I don't know that people really
understand, that's a lot.

00:12:24.026 --> 00:12:25.150
CHRIS KOSTOW: That's a lot.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.441
CHRIS YING: I actually wanted
to back up just a second.

00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:29.830
How many people here
have been to Meadowood?

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.950
OK, so I'll just
give a brief on what

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.960
this restaurant is like
for the rest of you.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.490
It is tucked away on a
sprawling resort that's

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.959
just one of those places that's
impossible not to love being.

00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:48.250
Eating at Meadowood is this
really holistic experience.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.530
You don't accidentally
show up at Meadowood.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.030
You go out of your
way to get there.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.100
You stay where you eat.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.250
So if you drink-- you
will drink and then

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.230
you will be wheeled by
Meadowood's capable staff

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.454
into your room and
deposited into your bed.

00:13:04.454 --> 00:13:05.620
CHRIS KOSTOW: On the ground.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.520
CHRIS YING: Onto the ground,
it's not a full service thing.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.360
So it's part of this
tradition, Meadowood

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.500
is, that not a lot of
people are familiar

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.770
with and not a lot of us have
experienced in our lifetime.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.955
And you talk in the
book about wanting

00:13:20.955 --> 00:13:22.580
to be a part of this
tradition, wanting

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.871
to be a destination restaurant.

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:25.630
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.463
CHRIS KOSTOW: Yeah, I
always liked the idea,

00:13:27.463 --> 00:13:32.960
even when I was in Mountain
View, of not having

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.260
casual diners.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.930
You wanted people to come who
really wanted to eat that food.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.180
You didn't want them to
struggle to get there, per se,

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.980
but you want it to
be a deliberate act.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.950
And I think that enables one,
as a chef, a lot more freedom

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.530
in determining
maybe what they do.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.040
And having worked
in Europe a lot,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.980
I liked that idea of these
restaurants and properties

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.010
set away from everything
else, because there's

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.925
this transformative separation
that happens when you-- and

00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:00.550
even if you're driving
up from the city

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.050
and you're driving through
Napa-- you're already relaxed.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.497
You drive on this beautiful
property, it's something

00:14:06.497 --> 00:14:08.080
of an escape and,
therefore, much more

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.621
of an immersive experience than
if you just pull up in a taxi

00:14:10.621 --> 00:14:12.680
and walk in the front
door of a restaurant.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.930
And you feel that very
much in the restaurant.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.590
When you're in the
room, people are

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.840
incredibly happy to be there.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.340
And that makes our
job a lot easier.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.999
It makes for a much more
enjoyable experience.

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:25.540
So that was always
something I liked.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.900
And that idea of-- we talk
about in the book, that

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.650
aubergiste mentality of,
you're on the front steps

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.940
of your place sweeping and
people are journeying to you.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.710
I like that a lot.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.210
CHRIS YING: And you
guys have become

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.560
a part of this local community
of nearby St. Helena.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.090
I've walked down the street
with you and your family,

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:46.030
you just get stopped by
everybody, like, you owe me $5.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.350
CHRIS KOSTOW: Exactly.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.910
CHRIS YING: So let's go back
to the garden a little bit.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.060
You were just saying that when
things are really clicking,

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.710
you can take up to 70% of the
vegetables in the restaurant.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.860
So how do you and your cooks
interact with the garden?

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.610
Does the garden
inform what you cook?

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.710
Are you telling the
gardener I need four carrots

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.130
to come out of the ground today?

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.570
CHRIS KOSTOW: It's a
little bit of both.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.403
We're determining what
we're going to plant,

00:15:07.403 --> 00:15:10.460
it's like, we want to do this
this year, this, this, this.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.440
But then you forget.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.780
And then, all of a sudden,
it's like, hey, there's

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.257
carrots coming tomorrow.

00:15:15.257 --> 00:15:16.590
So there's a little bit of that.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.950
But there's also, we know
that this is in the ground.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.469
So from a systemic point of
view, on a day-to-day basis,

00:15:23.469 --> 00:15:24.510
we order from the garden.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.470
We know what's coming.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.160
Christine sends out these order
lists, we order what we need.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.410
So there's the part of it where
the kitchen informs the garden

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.285
and says, plant this.

00:15:31.285 --> 00:15:35.380
But to a much greater degree,
it's, hey, this is coming up.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.180
And limits and
restraints very much,

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.939
for us, very much
fuel creativity.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.480
It's a lot harder
to create good food

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.932
when you have every
ingredient at your disposal.

00:15:43.932 --> 00:15:45.390
For me, it's a lot
easier when it's

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.579
like, hey, we have
kohlrabi coming.

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.620
CHRIS YING: As you guys
flip through these books,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.370
you'll see a lot of the dishes
that Meadowood-- the plating,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.230
specifically-- are
very much focused

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.330
or feature the vegetable.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:02.780
Feature the herb and the
fruit and the vegetable

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.740
as this beautiful,
precious commodity

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.970
and highlights them over
the more expensive--

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.220
over this caviar or the
foie gras or whatever.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.610
Is this something that you've
always emphasized vegetables?

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.402
Or is it something that having
a garden has increased in you?

00:16:19.402 --> 00:16:21.110
CHRIS KOSTOW: I think
once you understand

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.735
the process as a chef, you
realize how much harder it

00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:26.110
is to grow that
carrot than it is

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.210
to order some caviar
from the caviar guy.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.440
And that's why.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.355
You know, we don't shave
truffles table-side.

00:16:32.355 --> 00:16:34.480
We're trying to get these
porcinis just right so we

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.800
can shave the porcini table-side
that were forged by our guy.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.880
It's a way of showing
what we value.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.670
Luxury's great.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.000
I love truffles, I like caviar.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.230
But for me, that just doesn't
have the same degree of value.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.816
It's that thing
that you-- not just

00:16:48.816 --> 00:16:52.310
that you planted and you grew--
but you created the garden,

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.190
hired the people, and
worked with the school,

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.180
and tilled the earth,
and, I mean, it's like--

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.380
and you get this little
carrot as a result.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.454
Not to mention that
they taste pretty good.

00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:02.370
CHRIS YING: One of the
things that I've always

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.870
loved, like eating
at the restaurant

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.829
and noticed that sometimes those
ingredients, like the caviar,

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:10.427
the truffle, are literally
hidden underneath vegetables.

00:17:10.427 --> 00:17:12.510
You don't even know they're
there until you eat it

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.300
and I'm kind of
like, don't you want

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.960
to show off your Lamborghini?

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.459
CHRIS KOSTOW: Some people would
rather show it off a little,

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:20.640
I'm not gonna lie.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:28.462
CHRIS YING: Do you have a
hard time ever with guests--

00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:30.920
and Meadowood's not a cheap
restaurant, in case anybody had

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.380
any ideas that it was
a cheap Tuesday night

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.130
place or anything.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.990
CHRIS KOSTOW: Well, Google said
they would subsidize, actually,

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.470
all of your meals.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.440
CHRIS YING: If you all
look under your seats,

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.300
there's a gift certificate.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.633
CHRIS KOSTOW: Yeah, there's
a free dinner for everybody.

00:17:43.947 --> 00:17:46.030
CHRIS YING: I've always
wondered this of Meadowood

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.430
and of some other top-tier
restaurants today.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.160
Like, do you ever have to have
that conversation with a diner

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.890
to justify the
price when you have

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.150
a very vegetable-focused menu?

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.290
And not to say that
it's a vegetarian--

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.420
CHRIS KOSTOW: Yeah, right.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.630
You know, it does happen.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.255
But I think it happens
the same percentage

00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:06.090
that it happens anywhere when
people don't get their steak.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.730
So it's not a big
problem that we have.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.275
It's about how you
tell the story.

00:18:11.275 --> 00:18:13.441
It's not about preaching
to someone, saying, no, you

00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:14.450
don't understand.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.530
This carrot took my blood,
sweat-- you don't say that.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.840
Ideally, you weave a
tale of certain narrative

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.930
that engages the diner
in what you're doing

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.170
and they're as excited
about it as you are.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.444
If you have to lecture your
guest so they understand

00:18:29.444 --> 00:18:31.610
the value of things, you're
doing your job terribly.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.994
And if you're making
things taste delicious,

00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:35.910
I really feel, especially
at that price point,

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.290
the diners are so sophisticated
and frequent those places

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.910
enough, that they're equally
pleased to have something

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.861
that's delicious and
different and special.

00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:48.360
CHRIS YING: And that is totally
the experience of Meadowood,

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:54.510
is you feel things are
stimulating and interesting,

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.120
but never challenging
the point of displeasure.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.309
You're not trying to--

00:18:58.309 --> 00:18:59.600
CHRIS KOSTOW: I mean, you know.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.558
When you eat at a lot of
these restaurants that

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:08.020
are on the certain lists and
are these well-known places,

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.897
you'll have dishes
that taste like shit.

00:19:09.897 --> 00:19:10.980
Would you agree with that?

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.688
CHRIS YING: Sure.

00:19:11.688 --> 00:19:14.840
CHRIS KOSTOW: You have
dishes that don't taste good.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.640
And that's the thing that
we have to wrestle with is,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.080
everything has to taste good.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.460
We are trying to be
the tip of the sword,

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.960
in terms of pushing
things forward,

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.520
in terms of being a
little cutting edge.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.544
But there's no room for failure.

00:19:32.544 --> 00:19:33.960
The end result
can't be a failure.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.640
What the guest sees
can't be a failure.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.840
So it may be that's the
difference between two

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.650
and three stars.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.880
And that's maybe what we do is
so odd, in that the two's can

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.020
make some mistakes, but they're
also pushing really hard.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.511
We're pushing really hard,
but we have no net below us.

00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:49.760
And that's pretty challenging.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.920
CHRIS YING: But I think
that what-- sorry,

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.670
not to argue about how
great your restaurant

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.405
and prove to you.

00:19:55.405 --> 00:19:56.530
CHRIS KOSTOW: Unbelievable.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.439
CHRIS YING: I've felt often
times that at a three Michelin

00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:02.480
star restaurant, there
are certain things they're

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.602
obligated to do for you.

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.560
At the end of the meal,
you have to have some--

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.040
after you've eaten
tons of stuff,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.456
you've got to have
some tchotchkes

00:20:08.456 --> 00:20:10.500
and you've got to end
with a big, fat piece

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.420
of dry-aged steak that
you don't possibly want.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.050
And I never felt like there
were any gestures at Meadowood

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.140
that you felt obliged to do.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.740
And which is the most
impressive part about Meadowood

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.970
is that you're able to not
give those things, necessarily,

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.552
and yet maintain
the three stars.

00:20:28.552 --> 00:20:30.010
CHRIS KOSTOW: I
mean, maybe one day

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.170
Michelin will say, wait, you're
not giving away tchotchkes.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.870
But that goes to the
way we look at it,

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.150
is like, we are going to go in
the direction we think is best.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.440
And I keep thinking of the
tchotchke thing-- a lot

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.740
of three star restaurants,
you finish dinner,

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.150
they give you all this stuff.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.760
You know, cookies for the
next day and all this stuff.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.244
And I like the idea
that you leave your meal

00:20:51.244 --> 00:20:53.410
with just the memories of
it and it's a nice feeling

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.860
and you don't find stale cookies
on your counter the next day.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.620
But that's one of those things.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.260
I don't want to say it's a trap,
but that's one of those things

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.230
that we consciously don't do.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.040
And so maybe we'll be
one of those two star

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.991
restaurants one day.

00:21:05.991 --> 00:21:07.990
CHRIS YING: Another thing
that you guys don't do

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.900
is you don't serve
all of your food

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.736
on the same fine
porcelain white china.

00:21:14.736 --> 00:21:16.235
Which brings us
into another section

00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:17.810
of the book, which
is the artisans.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.710
So could you tell us a
little bit about the plates?

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.501
CHRIS KOSTOW: Sure.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.710
That's another thing
that's very trendy

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.290
and I think it's actually a
great trend within the industry

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.810
is the use of ceramics.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.520
If you start studying
the history of ceramics

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.060
and the role of ceramics in
restaurants and in dining,

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.190
you really start to see
how silly it is sometimes

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.180
when you're curating food so
specifically to then go buy

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.190
a plate from someone and put
all these things that you

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.210
made on a plate
they just bought.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.850
There's a bit of a
disconnect there.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.780
The artisan project
began with a couple

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.935
different artisans in
the Valley, all of whom

00:21:58.935 --> 00:21:59.580
we still use.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.110
And it is now culminated
in this new partnership

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:07.400
that I'm doing with a ceramicist
named Richard Carter, who's

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.664
in Pope Valley, which
is Napa County, just

00:22:09.664 --> 00:22:11.080
on the other side
of the mountain.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.788
And if you read the
book, that's actually

00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:14.491
where we shot all the food.

00:22:14.491 --> 00:22:16.240
And with the exception
of the chapter that

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.698
deals with the
plates, all the food

00:22:17.698 --> 00:22:20.900
is actually shot on surfaces
from this gentleman's

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.290
19th century homestead.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.921
The thinking was the way a
band would go-- you know,

00:22:25.921 --> 00:22:27.670
Dylan and the band
used to go to Woodstock

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.810
and record in the basement
of the house there.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.690
And bands will retire to certain
studios and places to record

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.060
and the feeling of that
place bleeds into the music.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.630
That was our thinking
with the book.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.670
So we shot the
food not on plates,

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.980
but on all the kiln shelves
from his wood-fired kiln

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.620
and on the glass
and the wood and all

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.260
the varied tactile surfaces
that you find there.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.300
So part and parcel to
that is we're actually

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.490
launching a new plate
line, me and him,

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.030
and it's this
collaboration that's

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:01.030
now reaching this point
if we ever get it done.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.950
But I really found
that, to do what

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:08.075
we want to do and to make each
dish a self-contained idea,

00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:09.700
maybe one reason
we're able to get away

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.940
with the stuff we get away with
is because it feels like you're

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.540
being told a very big story.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.070
And the reason it
feels as such is

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.780
because each thing
you're given is

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.210
like a little sentence
or a little chapter.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.990
So without the vessels
that fit the food

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.780
it's a lot harder to do that.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.260
We do a dish now, it's like
a pork collar acorn miso

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.490
that we make and it sits on
a plate that's burnt orange.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.910
And the whole dish,
it looks like fall.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.590
It's beautiful, it makes
sense, it touches all the bases

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.170
that we touch, and it's a
totally self-contained idea.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.391
That dish would not be impactful
if we put it on something

00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:45.890
we bought.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.540
And that's the goal in the
distance, is to really, really,

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.220
really make that
point really well.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.080
And that's an expensive
and painstaking process

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.250
to really develop pieces of clay
that fit the food that you're

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.770
thinking of in your mind and
have those two things come

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.020
to fruition at the same thing.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.580
That's really challenging.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.190
But the goal is,
throughout the meal,

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.980
you're stunned by the
overall beauty of what's

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.540
being put in front of you.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.123
CHRIS YING: There's
a line in the book

00:24:14.123 --> 00:24:17.490
that I really, really liked
and talking about that luxury

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.640
aspect and this idea of a new
kind of luxury at Meadowood.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.190
And that was when you said
that specificity costs money.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.970
And it kind of flies in the face
of most other business models

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.900
in this day and age,
where it's like, you've

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.950
got to provide
everything to every one

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.120
and then show them
ads or-- sorry, guys.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.640
CHRIS KOSTOW: I didn't say
that, I did not say that, guys.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.345
The ads are great.

00:24:42.345 --> 00:24:43.970
CHRIS YING: All the
plates at Meadowood

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.470
have a tiny, little ad.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.260
But I just noted that that's an
interesting way to look at it.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.919
What they're paying
for is not necessarily

00:24:52.919 --> 00:24:55.460
just you sourcing out the most
expensive thing of everything.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.209
CHRIS KOSTOW: I think
that's more and more

00:24:57.209 --> 00:24:59.100
valuable and relevant
as we, as a society,

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.981
become more and more
build-your-own Starbucks

00:25:01.981 --> 00:25:02.480
coffee.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.780
I did a talk the other day with
the head of R&amp;D of Starbucks

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.400
and she's like, we 180,000
possible combinations.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.210
Who wants 180,000-- like,
who really needs that?

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.270
So there's something nice
about you sitting in our room.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.200
We got you.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.834
We got you, we have put so
much thought into that potato

00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:23.000
because I don't want you to.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.410
I just want you to
appreciate it, maybe

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.800
but definitely enjoy it.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.177
CHRIS YING: And at
Meadowood, the reservationist

00:25:29.177 --> 00:25:30.760
will speak about
dietary restrictions,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.530
but when you sit down at
table, there's no menu.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.240
CHRIS KOSTOW: There's
no menu, yeah.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.114
CHRIS YING: You're just
strapped in for ride.

00:25:35.114 --> 00:25:38.075
CHRIS KOSTOW: The thinking was,
it's not about taking control

00:25:38.075 --> 00:25:40.700
away, it's that I don't want you
to look at a menu and be like,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.210
OK, I'm getting chicken next
and then I'm getting this next.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.180
That makes it possible for it to
be a really immerse experience.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.263
We want there to
be surprise and we

00:25:48.263 --> 00:25:50.020
want to be able to
play with the guest.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.978
It's not like, OK, I've
got three more courses,

00:25:51.978 --> 00:25:54.620
one of which is beef.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.010
CHRIS YING: So, the next section
of the book is about the wilds.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.560
And you talked in
the introduction

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.020
about this section, thinking
that this trend of foraging

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.750
and finding ingredients
out in the world

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.186
was not really for you.

00:26:07.186 --> 00:26:08.710
You thought it was a trend.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.360
But then you tell
a great story that

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.230
involves a certain
character named Charlie.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.730
If you could maybe
communicate that.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.620
CHRIS KOSTOW: Charlie is a dog.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.680
He's a half German
shepherd-- this

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.140
is my wife, Martina over here.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.319
It's our dog.

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:24.360
A lot of these aha! moments
that we talked about.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.590
And we used to live in a
little-- we were still dating--

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.590
in a house that backed
up into this estuary that

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.160
runs to the river and I used to
take Charlie there as a puppy.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.910
And he used to run
around and that's

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:40.790
when you'd notice that there's
pea-- P-E-A-- pea growing.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.860
There's wild plums,
there's eucalyptus,

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.270
there's these huge oaks
and all of the acorns,

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.580
there's all this stuff
just growing there.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.820
And it's very Willy Wonka,
like everything's edible.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.900
And that was the connection.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.710
I still think a lot
of foraging is silly.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:00.500
And people think that
just because they went out

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.820
in the morning and got it
doesn't mean it tastes good.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.140
I think there's a lot of that.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.244
But we found what we
want and what we look for

00:27:08.244 --> 00:27:08.910
and what we get.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.530
And I think that, for
me, the importance

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.680
of the historical
connection to the place,

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.410
we still find mortar
stones along the river that

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.580
are mortar rocks from when the
Indians would grind acorns.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.630
We still pick the
same blackberry bushes

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.450
that people did
hundreds of years ago

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.700
or use Indian paintbrush
or the mustard flowers

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.480
that bloom in the spring.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.100
There's something--
yeah, it tastes good

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.750
and that's the most important--
but that addition of meaning

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.524
and value and the
amount of depth

00:27:37.524 --> 00:27:39.940
that that can lead to a story
as a whole is really, really

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:40.880
powerful.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.340
And sometimes you have
to go find that stuff.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.340
CHRIS YING: I have a couple
of questions about that idea.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.140
just underneath our noses in
Saint Helena and Napa Valley

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.060
are these rocks
that Wappo Indians

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.470
would use to grind
acorns and there's

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.020
a whole levels of stories
underneath what we see now.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.950
So could you tell
us a little bit

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.880
about how it is you came
to know this history?

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.829
And what is the difference
between the Napa that we all

00:28:07.829 --> 00:28:09.620
see when we go wine-tasting
for the weekend

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.680
and what's underneath?

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.520
CHRIS KOSTOW: There's these
really good books by-- his name

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.260
escapes me-- one's called
"The Far Side Of Eden",

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.250
James Conaway.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.000
And these are really
modern, actually.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.170
How did the wine industry start?

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.190
And his next book is
called-- I can't remember.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:31.860
But it's about what happened
in the '90s, Silicon

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.350
Valley, the first
dot-com boom, what

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.540
that did to the Valley,
the influx of wealth.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.082
So then you start
to say OK, this

00:28:38.082 --> 00:28:39.540
is why things are
the way they are.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.914
This is why there's
a wine trade.

00:28:40.914 --> 00:28:43.010
This is why there's
all this stuff.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.400
And then you start looking
back and understanding

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.280
what the role of probation
was, what the cash crops were

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.209
before there were
grapes, why the CIA is

00:28:50.209 --> 00:28:51.750
this huge
monastery-looking building.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.660
Why?

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.367
You start to learn
all these things.

00:28:54.367 --> 00:28:56.492
And I would go to the
Historical Society-- we still

00:28:56.492 --> 00:28:58.200
work at the Historical Society.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.950
My staff has to go
take historical tour

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.660
of the town and all this stuff.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.580
And for me, I'm a nerd about
that stuff and I like it.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.760
But also, not just
in terms of cooking

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.940
where you are,
from living there,

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:15.080
I think that provides a
certain depth of importance.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.230
CHRIS YING: I mean, short
of assigning homework

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.490
to your diners before
they come in to eat--

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:23.080
is there a way
for you to Google?

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.140
Do you think diners
would benefit,

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.900
do you think they would
enjoy the meal more if they

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.690
understood that you took
this walk on this trail that

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.630
used to be, et
cetera, et cetera?

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.220
CHRIS KOSTOW: Some yes, some no,
but the success of the dinner

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.742
can't be contingent upon
their understanding of it.

00:29:38.742 --> 00:29:40.700
CHRIS YING: And so the
last section of the book

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.610
is divided into is
the materia prima.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:47.990
And it also speaks to
the very bones of Napa.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.560
Can you explain that idea?

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.518
CHRIS KOSTOW: That's
probably the hardest part,

00:29:51.518 --> 00:29:54.580
because wine-growing
land in the Napa Valley

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.040
can fetch a quarter of a million
to half a million dollars,

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.076
meaning there's not
a lot of small farms.

00:29:59.076 --> 00:30:01.284
Because there's a lot more
money in grapes than there

00:30:01.284 --> 00:30:02.440
is in chickens.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.415
So for us, that's been
our biggest struggle,

00:30:04.415 --> 00:30:08.510
is finding people who produce
things at a high quality,

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.372
protein-wise.

00:30:09.372 --> 00:30:11.580
And when we have to make a
decision between something

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.130
that's local and shitty
and somethings that's

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:14.754
not local and good,
we're going to have

00:30:14.754 --> 00:30:16.870
to get what's not
local and good.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.000
So that's been a challenge.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.980
And we've now found someone
who raises pigs for us,

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.290
someone who raises guinea
hens, but that search

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.930
is really challenging.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.592
But sometimes it takes working
with the people to help them.

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:29.800
Like we have this walnut
oil from Rancho [INAUDIBLE],

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.330
which is this old Spanish land
grant, and this lovely woman

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.199
and her husband--
who I know-- they've

00:30:35.199 --> 00:30:37.740
revived the walnut orchard, they
make this really nice walnut

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.830
oil.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.980
But sometimes you have
to help a little bit,

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.450
maybe create other
customers for them

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.190
so it's a financially
viable system.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.720
And then that concept
of what is sustainable.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.650
There's also economic
sustainability.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.775
And in order to make some
of these things possible,

00:30:52.775 --> 00:30:54.060
you have to create that.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.539
And you're using
the mill in town,

00:30:55.539 --> 00:30:56.830
their stones aren't that sharp.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.899
So I might need to
put them in touch

00:30:59.899 --> 00:31:01.440
with someone who
sharpens millstones.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.984
And it seems like a lot of work
to get flour, but in the end

00:31:05.984 --> 00:31:07.400
the flour's really
good and you've

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.540
done good things
for a lot of people.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.830
CHRIS YING: Like most of us
food nerds in California,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.090
you talk in the beginning
when you couldn't really

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.540
afford to buy cookbooks,
one of your first cookbooks

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.240
being the Chez Panisse Cafe
Cookbook and anybody who

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.170
is a, again,
California food fatty,

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.580
our education begins
with Chez Panisse

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.140
and is tied to this idea
of California cuisine.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.570
Where does Meadowood
lie in this narrative

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.610
of California cuisine.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.100
CHRIS KOSTOW: I think there's
a lot of chefs in California

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.210
who are in that tradition.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.360
I mean, they're
all that tradition.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.920
I think maybe what sets
Meadowood apart maybe, again,

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:52.230
is that idea of operating at
that old-school hospitality,

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.229
ideally perfect
execution, world,

00:31:55.229 --> 00:31:57.020
while still remaining
true to those tenets.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.590
Because it's easy to remain
true to those tenants,

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.480
when you're just like, hey,
we've got green beans, hey,

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.010
we can sautee them
up with some bacon.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.230
I used what's in the garden.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:07.550
That's, while super-honorable
is kind of easy.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:11.240
When it's like, hey,
we've got green beans,

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.206
there's 70 people coming
for a $400-a-pop dinner,

00:32:14.206 --> 00:32:15.580
what are you going
to do with it?

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.121
So I don't mean to imply that
we're doing California cuisine,

00:32:18.121 --> 00:32:20.050
but we're doing it better.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.090
We're just making it
really hard on ourselves.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.550
CHRIS YING: And it
is a new idea that

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.200
took California-- northern
California, specifically--

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.460
a long time to catch up, was,
yes, California cuisine is

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:34.340
a great and beautiful philosophy
and important to the overall

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.880
advancement of American
cooking, but we shouldn't just

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.040
stop at that point.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:38.790
CHRIS KOSTOW: Yes.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.690
CHRIS YING: It's
great that everyone

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.730
can serve those green
bean, it would also

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.146
be great if there
were restaurants

00:32:43.146 --> 00:32:45.315
that did something else
with those green beans.

00:32:45.315 --> 00:32:47.940
CHRIS KOSTOW: I think your very
good friend had made a comment.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.648
CHRIS YING: Yeah, some
figs or something.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.590
You mentioned just a
minute ago, the influx

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.440
of money during the
first dot-com boom.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.390
And in the book you
talk about, there's

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.420
certain laws in Napa
that prevent you

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.939
from having businesses.

00:33:04.939 --> 00:33:06.980
It's protecting agriculture
and things like that.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.640
What makes Napa Valley
an interesting place

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.490
to work in and run a restaurant?

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:19.080
CHRIS KOSTOW: I mean, you're
in what really is an agrarian

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.110
setting which has been
incredible value in terms

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.220
of creating food
that's of a terroir.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.910
And you're an hour
and fifty minutes

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.750
from the most sophisticated
city in America.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.740
That's a very rare thing.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.290
You have people who are already
coming there, people of means.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:37.520
You have a bit of
a captive audience

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.450
and they used to be
a seasonal audience.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:43.820
Now, Napa is literally
a year-round destination

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.530
for a lot of people.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.170
People who by nature
of they're coming there

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.470
obviously appreciate
food and wine.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.050
That's a pretty good
situation to be in,

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.100
provided you're doing
the right kind of work

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.665
in capturing those people.

00:33:58.665 --> 00:34:00.290
CHRIS YING: Toward
the end of the book,

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.575
you have a really
beautiful final essay

00:34:03.575 --> 00:34:05.200
talking about this
idea of the new Napa

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.360
cuisine and your
commitment to this area

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.650
and being a steward of it
and advancing these ideas

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.520
and taking your own part
in this long history.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.290
How do these ideas
spread beyond Meadowood?

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.779
Do you think that your
cooks will go and stay

00:34:21.779 --> 00:34:22.570
in the Napa Valley?

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.004
Like, how do you intend
for this to play out

00:34:24.004 --> 00:34:25.420
in the next ten,
15, 20, 30 years?

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.409
CHRIS KOSTOW: I think
the biggest challenge

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:30.150
to your earlier
point is, there's not

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.449
a lot of restaurant
spaces in Napa Valley.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:36.565
I mean, there's some, but it
suffers from the same problems

00:34:36.565 --> 00:34:38.190
that San Francisco
does for young cooks

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.170
and young entrepreneurs,
the cost of living

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.739
being what it is, the cost of
opening a restaurant in Napa

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:43.447
being what it is.

00:34:43.447 --> 00:34:46.469
But I already see that happening
and it'll be one or two.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.280
It'll take time.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.030
But I do see that happening.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.830
And I think what'll
be interesting

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.386
and both what I'm going to do
and what the next generation

00:34:54.386 --> 00:34:55.969
will do or what the
next cooks will do

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:58.250
is it'll be at all sorts
of different price points.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.490
I mean, there's a lot of
restaurant-y concept things

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.290
that we want to do that all
fit within the ethos of what

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:07.390
we talked about in the book
that are totally different.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.470
And, again, I feel like every
time we find a new product

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.960
or find a new way of
using what's around us,

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.431
I genuinely think we help a
lot of people when we do it,

00:35:16.431 --> 00:35:17.930
provided we're doing
it responsibly.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.754
That walnut oil example or
the mill or whatever it is.

00:35:20.754 --> 00:35:22.920
So I think when you're doing
good things for people,

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.110
people support you.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:27.370
I think that we have a lot
of goodwill in our community

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.280
for what we do, which
I think affords us

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.590
the opportunity to build
a lot of businesses,

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.910
both myself and my team.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:37.010
CHRIS YING: I have reached
the end of my piece of paper.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.010
CHRIS KOSTOW: You did a
really good job, though.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.343
CHRIS YING: Which means maybe
it's somebody else's turn,

00:35:41.343 --> 00:35:44.514
if anybody has any
questions to ask Mr. Kostow?

00:35:44.514 --> 00:35:46.930
AUDIENCE: What's your favorite
restaurant in wine country?

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:49.300
Basically, where
should I eat next?

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.394
I've already been
to your restaurant.

00:35:52.394 --> 00:35:53.810
CHRIS YING: It
changes seasonally.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.101
CHRIS KOSTOW: Yeah, it sure
is different, I would come!

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.065
Where did we go for dinner?

00:36:00.065 --> 00:36:01.773
We have a little one,
so we don't eat out

00:36:01.773 --> 00:36:02.820
as much as we used to.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.380
I like Redwood.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.860
I think they do a nice
pizzas and stuff at Redwood.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.430
Cook is nice in Saint Helena.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:09.920
It's cute and fun.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.262
AUDIENCE: Speaking
of little ones,

00:36:12.262 --> 00:36:13.970
can you get them to
eat any of your food?

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.130
CHRIS KOSTOW: She eats well,
she eats a lot of tofu,

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.800
a lot of eggs, she eats pasta.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.740
She freaks out over pasta.

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.740
But I'm not making
the pasta by hand

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.000
from the flour
ground from the grain

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.830
to the mill with the old
guy in period attire.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:37.317
Yeah, there's only some
many hours in the day.

00:36:37.317 --> 00:36:38.900
But she eats well,
she eats very well.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.729
AUDIENCE: It's important.

00:36:40.729 --> 00:36:42.770
AUDIENCE: So, okay, this
one's about-- how do you

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.750
go about finding staff?

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.980
And training your staff
to embody the same tenets

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:49.620
that you have?

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.400
And making sure that's
conveyed to all the diners?

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.312
And keeping that whole
level consistent?

00:36:55.312 --> 00:36:57.020
CHRIS KOSTOW: I mean,
if I believe in it,

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.610
I'm enthused about it.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.540
All I have to do is
communicate about it

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.820
consistently and effectively.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.820
In terms of finding
people, we're

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.640
a bit immunized from
the staffing challenges

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.600
that right now are endemic in
restaurants, in the Bay Area

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.600
specifically.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.793
Because we've acclimated
to the restaurant.

00:37:13.793 --> 00:37:16.410
A, we have tons and tons
and tons of applicants,

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.890
but we also don't really
have any turnover.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:22.380
I mean, how many [INAUDIBLE]
one of said staff,

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.540
I mean they said in the
kitchen, how many people quit?

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.150
Zero, right?

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.380
CHRIS YING: He's going to
take this opportunity to--

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.588
CHRIS KOSTOW: Chef, I've
been meaning to talk to you.

00:37:34.588 --> 00:37:38.620
I think we don't have the
turnover that restaurants do

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.170
and we don't have the turnover
that high-end restaurants tend

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.970
to have.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.845
We have a thing called
TRAM U, The Restaurant

00:37:45.845 --> 00:37:46.845
of Meadowood University.

00:37:46.845 --> 00:37:48.860
Where it's going to
the historical society,

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.943
it's going to Sturgeon
ranch, it's going foraging,

00:37:50.943 --> 00:37:52.130
they go to wineries.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.470
They are immersed.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.120
It's hard, because
everyone's so busy,

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.950
but we try to immerse
everybody in what we're doing.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.390
AUDIENCE: Alright, I'd like
to thank Chris for coming.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.840
I'll give him a
round of applause.
