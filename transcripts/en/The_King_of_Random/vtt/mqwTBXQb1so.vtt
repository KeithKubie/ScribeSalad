[Captions by Y Translator]
In this video,

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.620
we're unboxing our very
first King of Random kit.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.500
Everything you need to build
a fully functional laser blowgun

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.960
all in one box.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.160
[Music]

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.150
Guys, the first-ever
King of Random DIY kit is here,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.208
and we are about to show it
off to you what's inside,

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:20.520
how to build it,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.240
and some fun things
to do with it.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.140
I love this caution tape.

00:00:24.143 --> 00:00:24.731
Everything.

00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:25.816
Like, I'm super happy

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:28.150
with like just with
how the whole kit looks,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.340
and I didn't design this.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.300
I'm not bragging
that I design something nice.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.120
This is nicer than something
I would have designed.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.940
Custom printing on the box,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.021
got this fun King of Random caution tape.

00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:39.980
It's pretty box.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.820
I'm gonna break it.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.600
[Music]

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.940
Give me that.
Thank you.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.260
Much prettier.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
[Music]

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.440
1, 2, 3.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.000
That's really cool.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.600
Look at this.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.980
It comes with stickers?

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.826
Comes with stickers?

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:02.129
It comes with a glue gun.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.350
Oh, wow. That's like actually legit.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.682
Okay. This is my favorite.

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:07.984
It's instruction manual
with our target.

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:09.200
Seems simple enough.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.961
There we go.

00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.562
A little postcard,
from The King of Random.

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:16.240
Little zip ties, pre-cut PVC,
that is useful.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.380
We've got three
different pieces here.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.240
I think one is going
to be joining them together,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.006
one's a mouthpiece,

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:22.750
and one is to hold
the laser sight,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.749
and it does come with a laser.

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:27.040
So we literally just
send everything you

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.860
could possibly need in the kit.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.060
There are two,

00:01:31.152 --> 00:01:33.850
well sort of three
things not included.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.050
One is electricity
to run the glue gun.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.200
We do not provide that.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.800
You must provide
your own electricity.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.540
But we do include glue sticks.

00:01:40.548 --> 00:01:42.191
There are some small screws,

00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:44.250
and we do not provide
a screwdriver,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.779
but these are pretty nice.

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:47.086
They have the kind of head

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:49.286
so you can use either
a Phillips screwdriver,

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:50.800
or a flat head screwdriver,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.210
or if you don't have
either of those,

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.810
you can just use
a kitchen knife,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.000
like that'll work fine too.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.380
So we don't include one,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.920
but everyone can find something
that will work as a screwdriver

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.780
for these screws.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.659
All right, lots
of little paper tabs,

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.650
and the paper cone.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.540
A whole roll of electric tape.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.820
Also included,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.020
two sets of stickers you
can use as decoration.

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:10.179
You don't have to use these,
but you can.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.297
Dibs some pink one.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.380
We also do not provide
pair of scissors.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.120
You are going to need those.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.740
So electricity, screwdriver,
pair of scissors.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.400
That's the only things
we do not provide

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.857
for this project in the box.

00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:22.937
It's pretty complete.

00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:24.349
We've got all our stuff.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.254
It's a lot of stuff.

00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:26.380
Let's try building it.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.180
First, let's plug in
one of the glue guns.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.440
Get that warming up.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.260
Nate's become a kitty cat.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.120
All right.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.420
Now, one of the first things
we're actually going to do is

00:02:40.425 --> 00:02:42.334
if you want to use
these camo stickers,

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:43.528
you want to apply those

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:45.500
before you start
assembling everything.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.682
So, like I said,
I'm claiming the pink one.

00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.112
Sticker is just

00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:53.650
like it's custom-made to be
just the right size fit nicely

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.960
around the PVC pipes
that are included.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.592
So all I'm just going to do is
line it up nice and straight,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.220
and then roll it on.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.580
[Music]

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.880
All right. So next step is you've
got this mid sized piece here,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.040
cut PVC.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.300
That's going to be your coupler.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.020
It's going to hold
these two pieces together.

00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:16.125
These stickers have

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.424
like a little King
of Random logo in one spot,

00:03:18.424 --> 00:03:19.820
and that's a...

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.946
I mean I prefer to have
that down near the mouthpiece.

00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:23.596
So don't put
the coupler on there.

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:25.207
Make sure it goes
on the other end.

00:03:25.207 --> 00:03:26.880
This also comes
with some electrical tape.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.920
This is largely decorative.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.680
We don't really use this
as a structural element,

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:32.890
but I'm going to use
that to cover this coupler.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.900
So it doesn't just look
like a piece of PVC.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.420
So here's the thing guys,
we provide you with tape,

00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:39.350
we provide you
with decorative stickers,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.159
awesome things,

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.586
but feel free to customize
this however you want.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:44.060
That's the whole point.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.640
Now that our pipes
are coupled together,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.120
let's add a mouthpiece.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.000
That's what the shortest
one is going to be.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.140
That's going to go on the end
with the King of Random logo.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.531
At least, that's
how I'm doing it.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.240
Do it yourself.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.309
You want on the other end,
that's fine.

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:57.044
If you don't even want
to use this sticker,

00:03:57.044 --> 00:03:58.360
and you want to decorate
with other stuff,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.220
that's fine too.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.000
Multi-purpose weapons.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.140
All right, as this coming along,
now I'm going to attach,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.740
these little foam things,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.209
and they're partially
cut through,

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.320
so I'm just gonna break
through the rest away,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.917
fit them over,

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.701
and then another layer
of electrical tape.

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:14.571
So these are for holding
your darts in place

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.400
so you always have
your ammo close at hand.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.920
So here, we're adding another
layer of electrical tape,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.020
and that's simply just
to hold the foam in place.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.700
All right, next up.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.920
We've got a couple
of different ways

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.100
that we can mount our laser
onto our blowgun here.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.360
If you want,
you can take these zip ties,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.260
and zip-tie your laser directly
to the body of the blowgun.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.640
Now that is one way
to mount the laser on,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.060
but it's not the best way.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.300
We included it as an option

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.140
so that you can do it
if you prefer.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.220
However, I've got a method
that I like more,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.760
and it's what we've got
the pieces for.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.900
So the other way of mounting
your laser is to actually

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.799
use the eight screws
that are included,

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:57.150
drive them into this piece
of PVC that's been pre-cut for you,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.520
and secure your laser inside
for precision pointing.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.260
[Music]

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.260
I made a pet.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.240
[Music]

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.542
So now we've got
the screws driven

00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:13.057
into our little pieces of PVC,

00:05:13.057 --> 00:05:15.041
let's fit the laser
pointer down inside,

00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.220
and tighten up the screws
just a little bit.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.780
We're still going to do like
calibration of the laser later,

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.000
but we can start.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.600
We don't really need
the key chain attachment.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.300
That just pops right off.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.600
Our lasers now mounting
this little housing,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.960
and we're going to glue
this onto the blowgun.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.291
It's kind of up to you
where you want it.

00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.350
It should be high enough

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.451
that it clears the coupling
right in the middle.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.060
So even if you wanted
on the back side,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.900
it's going to work.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.260
I think for me,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.800
I'm just going to put it right
in front of the coupling.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.072
I don't have a reach
that's quite as long as Nate,

00:05:46.072 --> 00:05:48.822
so I'm going to go ahead,
and put my laser pointer right

00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:49.822
behind the coupling.

00:05:49.822 --> 00:05:52.000
So it's a little bit closer
to the mouth guard.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.740
You want to make sure not to get
the glue on your screws

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.780
if you ever want to adjust
the site on your laser.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.960
So as I said before,
lots of different ways

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.140
that you can customize
your own blowgun.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.640
We're going to go
with spray paint.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.040
[Music]

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.100
Beautiful blue laser sight.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.360
Customization is
highly encouraged.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.000
Now, we're going to start
making some darts.

00:06:15.018 --> 00:06:16.231
We've got our blowguns.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.200
We've got the lasers
attached to them.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.260
Now, we need a piece of paper,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.100
comes lots of these little
squares of paper.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.440
It's got this set
of 12 clear stickers.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.760
It's really hard
to tell with these are

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.750
because they're clear.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.632
But this is
12 small round stickers,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.340
and a small nail.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.580
Be aware that making these darts

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.280
with the nails does make
them very dangerous.

00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:35.950
You should not ever shoot there
anything that can be damaged,

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.980
or is alive,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.280
or can feel pain,
just a bad idea.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.780
Use at your own risk,
and be very careful.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.740
So this is pretty cool.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.980
These little paper cups are just here

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.400
to get exactly the right size

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.432
and shape of form that you want
for your little paper cones.

00:06:50.432 --> 00:06:52.550
What we're going
to do is take one

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.960
of our clear circle stickers.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.900
That's going to be our tape.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.940
So we just wrap one of our,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.008
one of these square
pieces of paper.

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:02.540
We just wrap it around the cone,

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.529
leave a very small
hole at the top,

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.520
and then just use
a sticker to seal it.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.404
Now, if you want
to reinforce this, you can.

00:07:10.404 --> 00:07:13.404
You should still have like an
entire roll of electrical tape.

00:07:13.404 --> 00:07:14.611
You can wrap that around,

00:07:14.611 --> 00:07:16.350
and you're going
to have a little bit

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.660
more sturdy of a cone.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.040
It's going to hold up longer.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.980
It's going to be waterproof,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.240
if you do a really good job
of covering it in tape.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.000
But for now,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.900
we are just going to keep
using that one sticker to show

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.740
how it works.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.840
Once we've got
the little cone made,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.772
obviously, it's not even
all the way around,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.160
we need to grab a nail,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.580
and go back to our glue gun.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.260
So what we're going to do is
we're going to take our nail,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.420
and you're going to drop
it into your cone,

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.150
and that little hole
that you've left at the bottom,

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.740
let it fall through.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.767
And you're going to hold
it up a little ways so

00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:45.983
the nail hasn't completely
dropped through.

00:07:45.983 --> 00:07:46.783
This way,

00:07:46.783 --> 00:07:49.180
you can drop a little bit
of hot glue right

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.700
around the top of that nail.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.400
And then, pull it the rest
of the way down.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.400
[Music]

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.200
We're going to take our dart,
fit into the end of the gun,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.320
and just twist.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.480
And this should leave
a mark on the paper

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.540
that will show us
where we need to trim it.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.640
Because obviously, we have
too much paper right now.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:18.920
[Music]

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.620
At this point,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.400
we should have
functional blowguns

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.460
with functional blow darts.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.920
And I think going to do is
zero in our sight,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.600
so it's a little more accurate.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.960
[Music]

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.780
To get our laser sight
it in just right,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.108
we've got the blowgun in a vice,

00:08:34.108 --> 00:08:36.640
and we just want to make sure
that it's nice and level.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.196
So right now,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.000
it's being held very
gently in the vice.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.460
Once I get it level right there,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.000
look how he's going
to tighten it a little bit.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.460
Now, what we're going to do is
we're going to take one of the darts.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.840
We're going to fire it as
hard as we can at the target,

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.712
and then we're going
to twist the screws,

00:08:54.712 --> 00:08:57.331
moving them around
until the laser lines up right

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.802
with where the dart hits.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.380
So we can see our laser dot
does not line up very well,

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.120
but that's why
we have adjustable.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.500
We need to adjust the laser

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.860
until that dot is right
where the dart hit the target.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.480
So adjusting your laser
and making sure

00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:15.434
that you're citing is accurate 
isn't really that difficult.

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:16.940
All you've got to do is loosen

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.450
or tighten the screws
that are holding it in place,

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.140
and you should be able
to get it even.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.060
[Music]

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.100
Bullseye.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:38.660
[Music]

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.200
The kit does come with a target,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.140
and I've used some of the tape
and tape it to the box,

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.840
so you do have a target
that's already included.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.600
You can use this.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.933
You don't have to be
using a dartboard.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.260
Let's a...

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.580
Let's try shooting this bad boy.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:56.640
[Music]

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.300
I think I just
stabbed another dart,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.160
like perfectly nested.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.420
You shot one dart
through another dart,

00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:03.729
Robin Hood style.

00:10:04.762 --> 00:10:08.122
That one just shot right
through that one.

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:13.450
If you want a slightly less
dangerous version of projectile,

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.920
you can use a bamboo skewer,
instead of the provided nails.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.440
And if you're really
worried about it,

00:10:18.442 --> 00:10:21.542
you can even sand down the tip,
so it's not quite so pointy.

00:10:21.702 --> 00:10:25.340
[Music]

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.560
So obviously,
the bamboo is not nearly...

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.740
Less piercing power.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.700
Less lethal.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.720
Barely, barely stuck
into the cardboard.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.500
Wanna go for a moving target.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.700
Do you want me to throw it?

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.350
Yes.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.760
This is a terrible idea.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.460
Ready?

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.640
Pull.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.100
I hit it.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.520
Did you really?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.260
Oh my God.
He hit it.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.040
It wasn't a good hit,
but I hit it.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.280
Yeah, it's kind
of way too windy,

00:10:52.282 --> 00:10:53.458
and dangerous for that.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.100
So we're not going
to do that anymore,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.100
but I did get one hit.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.960
[Music]

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.300
I think it went through it.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.920
Oh, no!

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.840
I went right through it.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.850
The kit is here,
and it is awesome.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.940
Don't forget that you can download
your own digital target

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.880
at TheKingofRandom.com.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.300
It's also fun to experiment with
different types of ammunition.

00:11:18.316 --> 00:11:20.520
I'm pretty sure you could get
some marshmallows

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.980
to work in this beautifully.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.492
So then you can have like a
laser assisted marshmallow gun.

00:11:25.492 --> 00:11:27.068
Guys, to get your own kit now,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.038
And that box down
to the bottom will show you

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.480
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.560
And if you're not subscribed,
hit that bomb in the middle.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.713
That will get you subscribe
to the channel,

00:11:44.713 --> 00:11:45.942
so you never miss
out on the fun.

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.227

00:11:47.227 --> 00:11:48.320
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.020
Talk to you then.
