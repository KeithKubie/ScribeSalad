00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.210
Let's do some data sufficiency
problems.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.920
So the first problem, problem
number one on page 278.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.440
It says, how much is 20%
of a certain number?

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.750
So we want to know
20% of a number.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.710
Let me just call that x.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.130
So what is that?

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.560
So the first data point they
give us is that 10% of the

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.030
number is 5.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:33.470
So we could say that 10%
times x is equal to 5.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.775
Or another way we can just
write that is 0.1

00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:39.800
x is equal to 5.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.940
And then the second data point,
I guess you could call

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.070
it, is 40% of twice the
number is equal to 40.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:58.940
So 40%, 0.4 times twice the
number, so times 2x, right?

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.550
We chose x as our number--
is equal to 40.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.870
So what we have to figure out
is do either of these data

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.305
points allow us to
figure out x?

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:11.660
Or maybe we need both of them.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.840
Or maybe we can't figure it
out even with all of this

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.880
information.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.510
Well, this is a simple
linear equation.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.980
A very easy way to think about
it is you could multiply both

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.830
sides of this by 2, both
sides of the equation.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.330
And you end up with 0.2 times
x is equal to 10.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.190
Well, that's the same thing
is saying that 20% of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.440
x is equal to 10.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.810
So statement one alone is all
we need to figure out this.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.900
Let's see what statement
two gets us.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.750
So if we simplify this
expression just a little bit,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.795
we get 0.4 times 2.

00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:55.510
We have 0.8 times x
is equal to 40.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.890
And here, instead of multiplying
both sides of this

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.680
equation by 2, we could divide
both sides by 4, right?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.350
Because we want to
get 20% of x.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.900
This is 80% of x.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.580
So if we divide both sides of
this by 4, we get what?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.910
We got 0.2 x is equal to 10.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.620
There you go.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.310
20% of x is equal to 10.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.780
So either of these alone are
enough to solve that problem.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.830
And I always forget what the
letters are, but I think that

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:35.220
is statement d.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.790
Each statement alone
is sufficient.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.150
All right.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.130
Problem number two.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.520
I don't want to waste too
much time on that.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.460
And I'm trying to do this in
real time without looking at

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.180
the answers, because I really
want you to get a sense of how

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.810
someone thinks about this
if they've never

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.120
seen the problem before.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.320
And so I'll ask you to bear with
me a little bit because

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.520
maybe I'll get a
problem wrong.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.660
And maybe that'll be instructive
if I do.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.040
OK, They say a thoroughly
blended biscuit mix includes

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.056
only flour and baking powder.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.910
What is the ratio of the number
of grams of baking

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.860
powder to the number
of grams of flour?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.930
So we want to know the ratio
of baking powder to flour.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.840
That's what we need
to figure out.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.740
Now statement number one, they
tell us exactly 9.9 grams of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.436
flour is contained in 10
grams of this mix.

00:03:31.436 --> 00:03:31.600
soon.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.190
So if there are 9.9 of flour,
and there's exactly 10, how

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.300
much baking powder is there?

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.710
Well, baking powder is going
to be equal to 10 minus the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.860
amount of flour.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.700
So it's going to be what?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.740
0.1 grams. 9.9, we could say
that that is equal to flour.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.320
So we could easily, just using
this statement, figure out the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.760
ratio, right?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.010
The ratio of baking powder to
flour is 0.1, because we just

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.980
took 10 minus the amount
of flour, to 9.9.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.820
Or you could say, it's 1:99,
whatever, however you need it.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.260
But that's what's fun about
these problems. You don't have

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.730
to figure it out.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.930
We just have to say we
could figure it out.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.720
So one is enough by itself.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.360
Let's see what statement
two tells us.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.320
I'll do it in a slightly
different color.

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:25.870
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.070
Statement two says,
exactly 0.3 gram.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.820
I think that's an error
in the book.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.070
It should be grams. Exactly 0.3
gram of baking powder is

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.110
contained in 30 grams
of the mix.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:46.470
So if we have 0.3 baking powder,
that's grams, and it

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.920
tells us there's 30
grams of the mix.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.000
So how much flour do we have?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.740
What's 30 minus 0.3
is equal to what?

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.900
It's equal to 29.7 flour.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.410
And so, once again, we can
easily figure out the ratio of

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.880
baking powder to flour is
0.3:29.7, which is, once

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.020
again, 1:99.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.370
But we didn't have to
figure that out.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.500
We just know that
this is enough.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.230
So once again, we know that
d, each statement alone is

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.020
sufficient, unless I
missed something.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.570
All right.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.820
Problem number three.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.580
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.220
What is the value of the
absolute value of x?

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.180
So they want to know the
absolute value of

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.290
x is equal to what?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:43.450
And the first statement, they
tell us is that x is equal to

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.620
the minus absolute value of x.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.620
So what numbers is this true
for, that the number is equal

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.940
to the minus absolute value?

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.940
It's definitely not true for
positive numbers, right?

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.720
Put a positive 1 there.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.410
1 is not equal to-- the absolute
value of 1 is 1, so 1

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.260
is not equal to negative 1.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.410
This works for 0, right?

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.840
0 is equal to negative
0 is equal to 0.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.960
And this works for
negative numbers.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.430
Try it out.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.380
Negative 1 is equal to the
negative absolute value of

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.460
negative 1.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.380
Well, the absolute value of
negative 1 is 1, so you get

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.600
negative 1 is equal
to negative 1.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.740
So it works for 0 and
negative numbers.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.900
So all this tells us-- and maybe
this will help us in

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.910
conjunction with the second
part, who knows?

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.800
This tells us that x is less
than or equal to 0.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.170
It's just a convoluted
way of saying this.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.380
Let's see where that gets us.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.630
Now the second statement.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.150
Let's see, they say that x
squared is equal to 4.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:54.270
Well, this tells us that x is
equal to plus or minus 2.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.650
Now, if we were trying to figure
out what x is equal to,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.790
we would actually need both of
these statements because this

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.800
statement says that x is
positive you 2 or negative 2.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.350
And then this statement
says that, oh, x

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.380
is definitely negative.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.110
So if we were trying to figure
out what the value of x was,

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.820
we would need both of
these statements.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.860
But notice, they're asking us
what's the value of the

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.530
absolute value of x, right?

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.890
So regardless of whether x is
positive or negative 2, the

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.770
absolute value of either
positive or negative 2 is

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.670
always going to be equal to 2.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.410
So really, this is
all you need.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.580
You only need statement two to
figure out this problem.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.760
And so that is b.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.290
You only need statement two.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.860
All right.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.890
I think I got that one right.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:35.490
Let's see.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.540
Problem number four.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.850
I'll do it in this
brownish color.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.580
Problem number four.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.350
Is r greater than 0.27?

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.840
Very simple question.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.900
Is r greater than
0.27, they ask?

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:03.820
OK, statement one tells us that
r is greater than 1/4.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.580
OK, well, that doesn't really--
r could still be--

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.590
this is 0.25, so r could still
be equal to 0.251, right?

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.890
It could be 0.251, or
it could be 0.3.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.760
So this really doesn't give
us any information.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.370
We don't know whether r
is greater than 0.27.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.176
Let's see what the second
statement tells us.

00:08:24.176 --> 00:08:30.390
The second statement says
r is equal to 3/10.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.120
Well, that is equal to 0.3,
and that's definitely

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.659
greater than 0.27.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.960
So this is all we need.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.150
We just need statement two.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.020
Statement one was a
little useless.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.840
So that is-- I always forget
what letters-- that's b.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.720
We only need statement two.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:46.940
All right.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.790
How am I doing on time?

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.440
Oh, I have time.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.400
I think I can do a couple more
problems. These go fast,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.380
because you don't have to
actually do the math.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.360
Problem number five.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.580
What is the value of the sum of
a list of n odd integers?

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.610
OK., and they didn't say
consecutive, and they didn't

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.060
say where it starts.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.280
It's just n odd integers.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.500
Fair enough.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.070
OK, one, they tell us
n is equal to 8.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.200
So if I knew that I was going to
sum eight odd integers, can

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.480
I know the sum?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.320
Well, no.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.540
I mean, it could be-- all of
these could be numbers in the

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.410
millions, or they could be
negative, or they could be

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.240
really small numbers.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.670
So that doesn't help me much.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.850
Point number two, they say the
square of the integers on the

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.090
list is 64.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.730
So they're essentially saying
that n squared is equal to 64.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.590
And since we're talking about
numbers in a list, it can't be

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.620
negative, so n is equal to 8.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.010
So these are really telling me
the same thing, just this is a

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.290
little bit more convoluted.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.910
But really, they
don't help out.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.450
I could have eight numbers in
the billions, or I could have

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.670
eight numbers in the hundreds,
and so obviously, you're going

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.100
to get a different sum.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.830
I don't think I can figure
this out anyway.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.820
So that's what?

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.580
That is statement e, that
together they're not

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.390
sufficient.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.500
So both of these are useless.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.460
I still don't know the
answer, which is e.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.220
All right.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.390
Well, I think I'm out of time.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.940
I just passed the
10-minute mark.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.510
I will continue in
the next video.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.760
