00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.320
In this lesson, we will learn about switching

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.810
and bridging. In particular, we will learn about how

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.990
hosts find each other on a subnet and

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.520
how subnets are interconnected. We will also learn about

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.700
the difference between switches and hubs, and the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.710
difference between switches and routers. And we'll talk about

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.440
the scaling problems with Ethernet. And mechanisms that

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.150
can be used to allow it to scale better.
