Can you do this one?
I think so.
All right.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.645 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I'm going to put my finger
over this hole...

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.645 align:start size:31% position:69%
Mm-hmm.

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.881 align:start position:0% line:85%
...light it, suck in...

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.881 align:start size:34% position:66%
Yeah.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:18.017 size:84% position:42% line:83%
...and then when I'm ready,
I move my finger.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:18.017 align:start size:69% position:31%
Get that off of there.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.819 size:75% position:38% line:83%
Okay, I think I'm ready.
I think I'm ready.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.819 align:start size:53% position:47%
Get it all. Yeah.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.487 size:78% position:39%
One time,
when I first smoked weed,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.622 align:start size:94% position:6%
I didn't suck in,

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.290 size:75% position:38%
and then I was just
slowly burning my flesh.

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.825 align:start size:66% position:34%
I still, to this day,

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.994 size:63% position:69%
have issues
with these things.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.664 align:start size:47% position:53% line:92%
Oh, boy.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.664 align:start size:81% position:19%
What?

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:33.566 align:end position:100%
No, that was just --
you got a big hit there.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:34.734 align:start size:56% position:44%
Oh, there you go.

[ Laughs ]

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.737 size:72% position:36%
I got scared
when you called it big.

[ Whistles ]

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:46.879 align:start size:56% position:44%
What do you think
about this case?

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:49.949 size:66% position:33%
Man, I think Warren's
a shady dude.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.584 align:start size:75% position:25%
He's got shady eyebrows.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:54.053 size:66% position:67%
He's got the eyebrows
of a villain.

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.154 align:start size:88% position:13%
You're right.

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:56.489 align:start size:56% position:44%
He's got the, uh,

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.791 align:start size:63% position:38%
sort of the jaw line
and the overall size

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:01.260 size:63% position:69%
of, like,
a Gaston from --

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:02.728 align:start size:75% position:25%
I bet you -- you know...

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:03.796 align:start position:0%
"Beauty and the Beast."

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.165 size:78% position:61%
...he doesn't like a girl
who reads.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:07.533 align:start size:72% position:28%
No.

[ Laughter ]

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:09.569 align:start size:72% position:28%
No.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.437 size:72% position:36%
He's got, like,
just one line of teeth.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.172 size:63% position:69%
I don't want to --
[ Chuckles ]

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.941 size:63% position:69%
I don't want to...
[ Laughs ]

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.976 align:start size:66% position:34%
...judge him entirely
on his appearance...

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.611 align:start size:97% position:3% line:85%
Okay, that's true.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.611 align:start size:81% position:19%
...'cause he's also weird.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.012 align:start size:75% position:25% line:92%
Yeah.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.012 align:start size:41% position:59%
[ Laughs ]

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.380 align:start position:0%
But I think that wasn't

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:23.749 align:start size:97% position:3%
the wisest purchase
for their family...

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:26.285 align:start size:34% position:66% line:78%
Right.

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:26.285 size:84% position:42%
...because, for example,
I have bought a car before.

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:29.455 size:88% position:44%
I would have never have paid
$47,000 for it.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:32.091 align:end position:100%
She kind of rolled her eyes
when I said $47,000 car,

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.926 size:63% position:69%
like, "Yeah,
it's kind of crazy,"

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.228 align:start size:63% position:38%
but it's like, also,

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.163 align:start size:59% position:41% line:91%
"Yeah, but you're
still doing it."

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.163 align:start size:81% position:19%
Yeah.

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:39.031 size:84% position:58%
"You're still trying to buy
a $47,000 car."

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:42.935 align:end position:100%
And you're talking to
a shady, you know, character

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:46.239 align:end size:94% position:94% line:83%
played by Puddy
from "Seinfeld."

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:46.239 align:start size:84% position:16%
Exactly.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.307 size:66% position:33%
$47,000 was not
a fair price.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.443 align:start size:63% position:38% line:85%
What is happening?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.443 align:start size:94% position:6%
I thought so, too.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:51.911 size:66% position:33%
She had a --
Like, the evidence --

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:53.779 align:start size:69% position:31%
Did she give a deposit
and not get the truck?

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:56.082 size:69% position:66% line:83%
That's all
we need to know.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:56.082 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's the truth.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.350 size:81% position:41%
I was like,
"do you have that $2,000?"

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.217 size:88% position:44%
He was like, "This and that.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.452 align:start size:94% position:6%
Of course. Duh."

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:01.721
But that was --
He was also flirting, though.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.322 align:start size:81% position:19% line:85%
With me?

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.322 align:start size:53% position:47%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:04.457 align:start size:75% position:25%
Hmm.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.160 size:66% position:67%
Listen, I don't think
he's a bad guy,

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.729 align:end position:100%
but how do you feel about
being tied to train tracks?
