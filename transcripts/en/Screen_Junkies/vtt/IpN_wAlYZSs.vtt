00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.360
Because of your contributions to our Women In Film charity event,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.580
you've unlocked an Honest Trailer for every Christopher Nolan movie.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.160
BWAAAH!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.720
You first knew him as the guy who made "Momento"

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.480
Then he was the guy who saved Batman

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.360
Now revisit retroactively perfect films of the internet's god of cinema

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.780
Makes sense, because only the god can get "Dark Knight Rises" rated 66 of the best movie ever made

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.160
Suit up, very literally, with Christopher Nolan

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.560
A visionary director, whose actual vision is colorblind

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.180
Which enplanes why so much of his work is tinted blue

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.920
Watch as he carefully construct a series of intricate puzzle boxes

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.020
Full of non-linear story-telling

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.200
In-camera technical wizardry

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.840
Plots that range from - Holy crap that was mind blowing,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.720
to -Holy crap that blows,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.180
And intense percussive musical scores that  will make you scream - Whaaaaat

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.720
I can't hear ya

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.820
----intense music intensifies---

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.800
This man is a genius. Ghmm...

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.880
Sorry.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.020
Meet a Christopher Nolan protagonist

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.320
He's a well dressed white dude

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.780
With brushed back hair

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.260
Kinda like Christopher Nolan

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.000
Follow this intense stoic man who is likely some kind of thieve, criminal or vigilante

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.840
But who still follows a strict code

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.740
"Never follow same person twice"

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.640
"Never show anyone"

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.000
"Never recreate places from your memory, always imagine new places"

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.820
Batman - "I have one rule"

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.260
Joker - "And that's the rule you'll have to brake"

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.860
As he recons with the tragedy of his past

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.520
Whether is the death of his wife

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.820
"I remember my wife dying"

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.420
The death of his wife

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.660
"Once i had a wife, she was taken from me"

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.160
The death of his wife

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.160
"It won't bring your wife back"

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.700
The death of his wife

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.740
"the doctors would have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain, *before* she died instead of afterwards"

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.500
The.Death.Of.His.Wife

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.820
"no"

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.540
Or when Nolan really wants to shake things up

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.160
The death of his...... Girlfriend

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.680
That's... a lot of dead wifes

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.140
What could it all mean?

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.780
"..The other fascinating thing about you is that you work with your lovely wife, Emma"

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.560
(in whisper voice) ruuuun

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.600
Experience ten masterfully crafted films

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.440
that as cold and remote as the ice tundra they feature

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.480
Where human emotions aren't so much felt as  reasoned about

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.360
"I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time"

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.260
"Love has meaning, yes. Social utility, social bonding, child rearing..."

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.820
"We love people who've died. Where's the "social utility" in that?"

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.060
Where time is just a toy to be played with

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.000
Whether the stories told out of order, backward and forwards, simultaneously

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.540
then in interlocking series of flashbacks

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.320
In three separate levels of a dream, where time moves in different speeds

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.340
In space where time is relative

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.480
Or in WW2 where time is sort of mashed up to make things more suspenseful

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.700
And if you think it's all too complicated

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.340
I let Nolan break it down on a level that you babies can understand

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.160
"That's basically the end of the movie"

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.080
"This stuff is the black and white running backwards

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.000
"As we cut between the two scenes"

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.620
"Scene there, scene there, scene there, scene there"

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.760
"you have flashbacks to a different timeline, some of which have color, some of which is black and white"

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.920
"the end of the film being sort of there-ish"

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.820
"the ones that  relate to a parallel story"

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.860
See, couldn't be simpler

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.800
So if you love cinema and enjoy being wowed by a true art

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.180
Cheer for a man who is rightfully considered one of our greatest modern directors

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.260
Whose sharp cinematic eye, incredibly talented pool of actors,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
And obsessive dedication to the craft of filmmaking

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.420
Have given birth to the rabid fan following

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.020
That will ignore all  the nice things we just said and focus on joky nitpicks which will be taken one hundred percent seriously

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.760
"you know I hate comedians"

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.160
He's one of the best filmmakers working today, OKEY? Is that not enough?

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.560
"Why so serious? "

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.980
"I'm buying this hotel"

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.020
"Company went public a week ago"

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.300
"And i bought most of the shares"

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.760
"I bought the airline"

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.460
"so let's put a couple of tables together"

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.800
"I'm not sure that they let us"

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.200
"oh, they should. I own a place"

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.200
"Where is it?"

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.940
"The clean slate? When you type someones name date of birth and in a few minutes they gone, every database on earth"

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.940
"Now we're trapped in Fischer's mind battling his own private army, and if we  get killed we'll be lost in limbo until our brain tuned to scrambled egg"

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.820
"you're well educated man, Coup. And a trained pilot. "

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.200
"and an engineer"

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.760
"would you like to see my mask?"

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.720
"This is your mask"

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.380
"You are wearing a mask"

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.280
"Just take off that mask"

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.060
"You just  rake off your little mask"

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.980
"like putting on a mask"

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.760
"If you working alone wear a mask"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.040
"Let's mask up"

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.860
"No one cared who I was till I put on the mask"

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.080
"Sssssmoken'"

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.640
oops, wrong mask

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.540
"in garbage bag"

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.680
"where is he"

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.600
"you can't give in"

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.340
"why can't you out-think him"

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.800
"where are they, where is the trigger"

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.660
"Wake up"

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.780
"Rachel"

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.380
"Moe, look at me"

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.760
"we'll soon be together"

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.020
"What have you done?"

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.440
"Forgive me,. I lied to you"

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.840
"and it also means loosing someone I have cared for, since I first heard each cries echo  through this house"

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:22.220
"I failed you, you trusted me, and I failed you"

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.740
OK, I'm sure you all know about  first letters in the characters names in "Inception" spelling out "dreams".

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.420
But did you know that all the astronauts initials in "Interstellar" spell out BRCMD ?

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.780
Which can only be referenced to the TV show DOC

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.860
Where Billy Ray Syrus plays an MD

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.160
And his character name was Clint Cassidy. CC!

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.780
That has to be reference to Charlie Chaplin, who was good friends with...

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.020
ooh.. Edith Piaf! That sing that song in "Inception" that's the cue for everyone to wake up

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.420
It all make perfect sense!

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.320
We're in a dream , man!

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.620
Nolan's trying to wake us up!

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.540
Hurry! Before it's too late! The top just keep spinning!

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.380
I have to wake up! I have t....
