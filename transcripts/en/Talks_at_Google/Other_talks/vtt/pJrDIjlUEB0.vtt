MATT SHEETS: Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.853
My name is Matt Sheets,
and it's a pleasure for me

00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:07.722
to introduce David
Lamfrom to you today.

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.180
David is the director of the
California Desert and National

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.614
Wildlife programs.

00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:14.030
His career has offered him a
diverse set of vantage points

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.770
into our country's parklands.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.540
He's worked in the fields
of research biology, where

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.692
he focused on aquaculture,
agricultural biology

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:23.650
and herpetology, which
is the study of reptiles

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.810
and amphibians.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.280
After this, he spent three years
as an environmental consultant

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.310
working in his home
state of Florida.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.726
He's authored a book on
tortoises in the Mojave Desert

00:00:32.726 --> 00:00:34.100
and has leveraged
his photography

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.130
to help document
and build awareness

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.180
of the diverse wildlife
which fills our parklands

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.270
and deserts.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.150
Today, as the director
of California Desert

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.780
and the National
Wildlife programs,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.280
David has dedicated both his
professional and personal lives

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.560
to inspiring others to
learn about and protect

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.720
our wild lands, which brings
us to the topic for the today,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.710
which is President Obama's
recent designation of three

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.060
new national monuments
in the California desert.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.450
Without further ado, I'd
like to introduce David.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.450
DAVID LAMFROM: So I'm
going to talk to you today

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.400
about a couple of things.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.860
The first thing is I'm going
to talk to you about deserts

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.590
in general and why they matter.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.485
And I'm going to talk to
you about one of the truly,

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:13.860
I think, remarkable
things that's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.235
happened in recent
history, which

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:18.130
is the designation
of a vast swath

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.910
of the beautiful
California desert

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.400
in perpetuity connecting an
incredibly large landscape

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.080
together.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.000
But before I do that, I'm
going to tell you a story.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.740
So everybody can see this
lizard that's on the screen.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.630
This is a baby desert iguana.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.890
So most people don't know
and some people wouldn't even

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.810
care, necessarily, that
the state of California

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.990
has its own iguana.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.020
So like the green iguana you
would think of in Costa Rica,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.430
we have a desert-adapted
species of iguana.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.120
And I grew up in very
urban south Florida.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.670
And basically, for
my entire life,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.690
I was fascinated for,
at least at the time,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.970
no good reason to
the Mojave Desert.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.995
I was just fascinated.

00:02:10.995 --> 00:02:12.870
I wanted to know everything
about that place.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.953
I wanted to know everything
about the animals that

00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:15.690
lived there.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.870
And I was especially
interested in the reptiles

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.050
that lived there, because
they were just so fascinating.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.340
And they just did
different things

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.360
than animals in
other places did.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.760
So for example, these lizards
that live in the Mojave Desert,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.560
many of them are vegetarians.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.570
And a whole bunch of
them-- actually, there's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.110
a whole hierarchy
of these lizards.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.520
And the smaller ones
have adapted the ability

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.700
to run on two legs
to elude predators.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.320
And then the bigger lizards
that chase those lizards run

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.870
on two legs, kind of like
a miniature Jurassic Park

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.130
happening all across the
California desert, which

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.230
to me was so fascinating.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.920
But as I had the
incredible privilege

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.060
of living in the
California desert

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.420
and becoming a
wildlife photographer

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.780
and getting to know
the place, the thing

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.730
I realized about this
desert is so often, it

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.210
exists in its fullness
right before your eyes,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.910
and it's oftentimes extremely
difficult to really see it.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.180
And it's a subtle place.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.560
And it's a place that's governed
by incredibly long periods

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.660
of time, and then spectacular,
dramatic things happen.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.030
I was reminded of this.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.010
I was reminded of innovation.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.640
I was reminded of the
diversity of the desert

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.525
when I was reviewing
some of my photos

00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:50.650
and I looked at this photo.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.150
I was looking at
this desert iguana.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.820
And for many, many years
when I looked at this photo,

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.204
I always liked it, but I
didn't know exactly why.

00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:00.370
And it was a little strange.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.580
And I didn't really know why.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.830
But one day, I was really
carefully looking at it.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.440
And even though I had studied
this species for decades

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.760
of my life, I learned
something completely brand new

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.500
that was right in front
of me the whole time.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.260
I was looking at it,
and I was looking--

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.180
if everybody can
see-- does everybody

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.970
see the eye of that lizard?

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.870
And I looked at the
eye really carefully.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.340
I realized that eye
wasn't an eye at all.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.670
And in fact, the eye
is above that eye.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.030
You see the slit?

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.070
And I realized that
without knowing it

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.400
for all those years--
looking at this photo,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.700
working with this species-- that
this lizard in the California

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.680
desert had invented the
first pair of sunglasses.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.700
And literally, the
reason that this lizard

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.025
has this particular pattern
underneath its eye--

00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:08.496
it closes its eye.

00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:09.870
And if you think
about it, if you

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.060
live in an extreme environment,
like a desert, that's

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.810
incredibly arid-- intense
heat, intense cold-- your eyes

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.680
are sensitive.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.270
They're wet.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.250
And this lizard basically
pulls up the shades.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.654
And it does it in a way that
predators would think that they

00:05:31.654 --> 00:05:32.695
were still being watched.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.440
We're lucky.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.920
We have an incredible
national park

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.030
system in the United States.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:48.180
And maybe more importantly,
maybe just more to appreciate,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.070
is that that
national park system

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.050
has been the genesis of the
creation of national parks

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.260
across the world.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.490
When people think about
our beautiful parks

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.210
and think about this
100 years of protecting

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.380
these remarkable places, people
think of places like the Grand

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.550
Canyon, pictured here.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.980
It's an incredible chasm
shaped by water and by ice.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.760
Or people think of Denali.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.850
Denali is a mountain that
is so big and so vast,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.930
that when you see
it-- I remember

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.840
the first time I saw Denali.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.240
I was at a campground
called Wonder Lake.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.815
And it's a hell of a
time to just get there.

00:06:35.815 --> 00:06:37.940
And when you get there,
you stay there for a while.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.070
And I stayed there for a while.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.990
And I saw the mountain
emerge, and it

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.950
was the most amazing thing
that I had ever seen.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.860
And then I realized I had only
seen the bottom third of it.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.160
And when the rest
of it unshrouded,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.030
I understood that I had
never seen a mountain before.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:04.550
And I understood why people
called Denali the great one.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.680
And I think about these
parks, these monuments

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.680
to ice, to mountains to
rock, to vibrancy and life,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.270
like Redwood.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.660
I think about the sequoias.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.560
I think about the
desert that I live in.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.160
And I think about the inherent
balance in the universe where

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:32.830
a giant mountain range bisects--
14,000-foot peaks run north

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.460
to south.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.890
On one side, the
greatest trees to ever

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.650
live on the planet Earth
because of the moisture

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.820
that's dropped,
on the other side,

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.230
an incredible desert with the
oldest living animals, plants

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.900
on the planet.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:59.290
In addition to the
remarkable places,

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.970
the exposition, the
geography, that's

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.450
protected by our national
parks- and before I go on,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.020
let me just say that in talking
about our national parks

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.790
and talking about the
history of our parks,

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.370
it's not just the protection
of natural landscapes

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.310
of our natural history
that makes them special.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.380
What our national
parks do, in fact,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.530
is they tell the
story of America.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.650
And that story of America
includes the story

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.210
of our prehistory, of
our geological history,

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.250
of our natural history, of
our evolutionary history,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.549
our biological
history, but also,

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:42.610
telling some of the very
difficult stories of America

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.120
and of what it means to be
American-- some of the very

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.080
difficult times that we've
come through as a country, some

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.550
of the terrible mistakes
that we've made.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.400
I, for example,
think about Manzanar.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.970
I think about the incarceration
of American citizens

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.220
in camps looking out
across the eastern Sierra.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.080
To imagine being an
American citizen,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.810
and because of your ethnicity,
a war happens with the country

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.750
that you come from, and
you're forced, then,

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.899
to live in a concentration camp.

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:14.690
Our national parks also
tell those stories.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:23.560
In addition to the protection
of these great places

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.960
and these great
stories, there's also

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.770
the protection of
incredible life and life

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.940
that may have otherwise
not been protected.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.312
And I spend my spare time
as a wildlife photographer,

00:09:36.312 --> 00:09:37.770
and I'd like to
show you guys a few

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.860
of those species that
exist now because

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.450
of the protection of
our national parks--

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:48.590
the additive value,
the amplification.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:54.590
I met this particular grizzly
bear in coastal Alaska.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.180
But the organization
that I work for,

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.270
the National Parks
Conservation Association,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.860
is doing work to protect grizzly
bears across the country.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.400
And I think about the bears
that live in the lower 48.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.810
And without Yellowstone
and Glacier National Park,

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.980
there would be no grizzly
bears left in the lower 48.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.000
So in addition to
being sanctuaries

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.490
of culture and
sanctuaries of story,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:25.580
our national parks are also
refugia-- the last places

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.850
for the last species,
including some of the greatest

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.380
extant living animals
on our planet,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.390
like this incredible bear.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:38.550
I saw this bear take a
salmon that was this big

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.590
and eat it in two bites.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.080
Because he wanted to.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.230
This is a musk ox.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.160
Musk ox is a species
that's represented now--

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.160
in the Pleistocene, there
were four species of musk ox.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.840
There's only one left.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.047
And I saw this one in Bering
Land Bridge in Alaska,

00:11:01.047 --> 00:11:02.880
which is one of the
last places that you can

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.660
find this particular species.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.685
This is, I think, the
species that people--

00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:10.310
the reason that people like this
the most is because I think it

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.720
reminds them of "Star Wars."

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.100
But for me, I like
them because they

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.030
have this incredible response.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:23.010
They are always fearful of
being eaten by polar bears

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.170
or being eaten by wolves.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.310
And so they've developed
this strategy, which

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.530
is they put all their young
in the middle of a circle,

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:36.090
and they all circle up, horns
out, to protect their young.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.920
I think about the natural
processes that have happened,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.140
that have evolved over
time in North America.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.670
And maybe nothing is more
powerful than the thought

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.870
of the salmon run.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.750
Where I think about it,
the nerdy biologist in me

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.710
comes out all the time.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.400
But it's to think about
these structures for bringing

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.630
nutrients from the deep
ocean back to land,

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:04.070
that in the trees that you
find along salmon streams,

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.720
the protein actually
builds forests.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.160
And to think about that
distribution and redistribution

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.550
of resources and
how vital that is,

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.860
and that those processes
have developed over all time,

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.310
and that we're lucky enough,
at least in some places,

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.140
to still have that,
to enjoy that.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.750
This really cute hawk lives
in Soberania National Park,

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.220
which is in Panama.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.090
This particular hawk is
exceedingly endangered.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.110
And farmers look at
it as a nuisance,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:40.710
because it eats goats, just
picks them up and takes them

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:41.970
away.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.890
And its natural prey
source is usually monkeys.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.560
So this eagle, if you
can believe it or not,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.170
it has short wings,
lives in the high canopy,

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:58.250
and it snatches monkeys out of
trees if you can believe that.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.150
And while it's a bad
day for a monkey--

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.070
and I think we can all agree
that monkeys are cool--

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.480
the protection of these
great species is profound.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.500
And it makes life richer.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.730
It makes the content of the
world we live in richer.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.430
I'll never forget the day
that I met my first Jaguar.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:26.660
And these jaguars were hunting
capybaras down by a river.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.370
And they were day hunting.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:35.981
And so I was in a boat, and
I was photographing one.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.730
And then I heard
[MAKES FOOTFALL  NOISES].

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.550
Don't worry.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.508
It wasn't a jackhammer.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.970
It was a capybara on a cliff.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.630
And it jumped off of a
cliff into the river,

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.250
and it screamed.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:00.630
And one second later, a
really pissed off Jaguar

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:05.550
was at the top of the
cliff, looking down.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:10.650
These things are still happening
all over the world because

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.500
of an American concept
that was exported

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:20.620
that said we want to tell the
full stories of the world we

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.750
live in.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.760
And now we're celebrating
our 100th anniversary.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.570
And happy anniversary to you.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.136
This is a photo I took.

00:14:28.136 --> 00:14:30.030
And to me, it's the
transition of the desert.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.960
Because I found
this tiny species

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.380
in the Australian desert.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.400
And it's the ecological
analog to our horned lizard.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.700
So it's thinking about
how resources in places

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.230
actually create species.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.480
You see a leopard
and you see a jaguar.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.850
You see a green tree python,
and you see an emerald tree boa.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.135
You see a thorny devil, and
you see a horned lizard.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.930
The resources that
are present actually

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:07.870
create shapes in nature,
like an incredible play-doh

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:12.880
that the environment
itself acts on the world

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.914
to create the shapes.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.590
Folks don't think about
it, but roughly 30%

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.830
of the lands on planet
Earth are desert.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.850
And the distribution
of those deserts

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:39.890
are very similar along
the lines of latitude.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.640
You see those
lines going across?

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.610
It goes through the majority
of-- 30 degrees north goes

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.080
through the majority of
deserts on the planet.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.050
And that's because of ocean--
basically currents and wind

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:56.790
patterns, and where rain is
brought and where it's not.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:01.320
But to think of--
I think the desert

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.150
is probably the
most misunderstood

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.900
and underappreciated landscape,
terrestrial biome on planet

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.800
Earth.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.400
It's a place, I think, where
people generally characterize

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.440
it by what it isn't.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.610
It isn't a place
with giant trees.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:21.662
It isn't a place with
abundant rivers or greenery.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.410
But what it is is
it's a place that

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.020
has been acted on
by these pressures,

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:35.480
and these pressures have
created spectacular innovation,

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.760
the type of innovation
where-- and I'll show you.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:46.660
Things are happening on a
global scale that are sometimes

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.660
difficult to comprehend.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.000
And things that we're
still-- as we think

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.260
of, say, the rainforest and
the medicine that lives there,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.380
and the species that
live there, we're

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.470
still coming to understand
why the desert matters

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.490
and what a big role it
plays on the planet.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.180
So I don't think that I would
have to convince anybody

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.540
that the rainforest is one
of the most important--

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.040
it's the lungs of our planet.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.450
And for us to live and be
sustainably on this planet,

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.069
we have to protect
that rainforest.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:24.950
What if I told you that
the rainforest exists

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.610
in the way and shape it does
because of the Sahara Desert?

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.060
That's the case.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.990
So you can see this picture
here from NASA, the good folks

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.030
over there at NASA.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:43.680
You can see here this satellite
image of the winds coming off

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.570
of the Sahara being blown
across the Atlantic Ocean

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:53.530
and landing in the
Amazonian rainforest.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.670
And I guess the
question that you

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.650
would ask yourself is
why does that matter

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.870
that the sand is being blown.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.530
Or sand is being blown-- cool.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.890
What does that mean?

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:13.020
Well, that sand, even
though the grains of sand

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.500
might be a tenth
of a millimeter,

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.130
they contain phosphorus.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:24.850
And that phosphorous is actually
used for the growth and health

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.097
of the rainforest itself.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.580
There is an incredible
interwoven tapestry

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.420
of this entire planet.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.980
And again, we're just coming
to start to understand that.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:48.540
This is as nerdy as I'll
get, and I promise that.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.380
But I just wanted to
show you that in terms

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.890
of the amount of species
of anyplace on the planet,

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:02.550
only tropical savannas have
more species of animals

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.910
than deserts do.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:08.360
And so what's known
to science today

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.490
is that there is something
like almost 8,000 species--

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.250
just animals-- in the
deserts of the world.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.390
And that's more than
tropical forests.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:27.270
That's more than grasslands,
than the temperate zones.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.830
And deserts are
probably also the most

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:35.790
under-studied and under-explored
places on the planet,

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:41.590
meaning that the opportunity
to learn more and to find more

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:46.340
and for people who grew up
like I did, wanting desperately

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.760
to be an explorer, that
that opportunity still

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.010
exists in the world.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.110
If you want to be
Indiana Jones--

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.760
This is perhaps the most famous
picture of a desert animal

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.040
ever taken, this
National Geographic

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.220
photo by Chris Johns.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:08.480
And it shows the majesty of
a black-maned lion fighting

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.280
the elemental nature
of the desert.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.930
It's these stark things.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.513
It's power versus power.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.790
When you think
about the desert, I

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.150
think people-- we talked a
lot about, say, reptiles,

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.790
or we talked about
other types of animals.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.390
But the reality is that
if you think about deserts

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.160
on this planet, the
majority of mammals

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.189
that you find in any type
of ecosystem regularly

00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:36.980
live in the desert.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.170
So if you think
of a tiger, there

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.100
are tigers that live
in Indian deserts.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.940
There are lions that
live in deserts.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.520
The grizzly bears that
lived in the San Bernardino

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.380
Mountains used to come
down off of those mountains

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.430
into the California desert.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.300
Elephants live in the desert.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.500
So while I think we have
a notion about the value

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.640
of deserts, the reality is
that life on this planet

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.320
is well adapted to deserts.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.170
And that specialization
has happened on a long-term

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.340
and on a short-term basis.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.400
This is a picture of Death
Valley National Park.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.860
And Death Valley National
Park is, I think, well

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.190
known as a land of extremes.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.060
But it's also one of the
most beautiful places

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.860
on planet Earth.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:28.930
And it's a place where the
raw geology of the planet

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.310
is surfaced.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.510
There's not that many
places where you can walk

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.810
on a 2 billion year old rock.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.060
And there's not many places
where you can find a plant,

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.340
a tree that's 6,000
years old, or a bush,

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:47.520
or a humble bush that's four
feet tall that had been around

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:53.990
since the Egyptians were
doing some stuff that

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.228
isn't happening right now.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.350
When I talk about the
California desert,

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.680
I want to give you guys the
context of this landscape.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.800
The California desert
is remarkably large.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.180
It's about a fifth of
the state of California.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.880
And it's roughly the
size of Virginia.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.790
Also, if you look at
the green dots in here,

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.190
those are three of the now
four national parks that exist

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.680
within the California desert.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.356
It's a land with-- I think
it's characteristically--

00:22:30.356 --> 00:22:32.480
I think when people think
of the California desert,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.370
they think of sand dunes.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.647
I think people
think of-- really,

00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:38.730
when people are thinking
of the California desert,

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.590
they're actually
thinking of the Sahara

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.544
and what they've seen on TV.

00:22:42.544 --> 00:22:43.960
But in fact, the
California desert

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.990
is an incredibly rocky place.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.066
And it's a place with
huge mountain ranges,

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:49.690
and mountain range
after mountain range

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.320
after mountain range.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.780
It's a place where,
in the 1800s,

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.950
folks tried to introduce
camels, but the camels

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.490
couldn't make it,
because it was too rocky.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.800
It's that kind of landscape.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.190
It's just an endless
basin and range,

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:15.020
geology with an incredibly
diverse range of life.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:20.540
This photo here-- if you look at
the various colors that exist,

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:27.930
this is an area that goes
from almost LA up to Utah.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.330
And it shows the Mojave Desert.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.950
And it shows, in
these various colors,

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:36.535
all the lands that are
protected within that landscape.

00:23:36.535 --> 00:23:40.040
The California
desert is, in fact,

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.370
the most protected
landscape in the lower 48.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:46.350
It's a big landscape.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.740
It's in incredible condition.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.505
I'll show you.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.550
As you get more towards
the color green,

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:02.260
you can see-- this is
basically showing what's left

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.070
that's pristine in the country.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.850
And when you look at where
the greatest concentration

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:13.080
of dark and light
green converge,

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.830
that happens in the
California desert

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.980
stretching into central Nevada.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.370
There are some other
really well-protected areas

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:26.080
in the country, but nothing to
that extent, and nothing where

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.810
you can draw a line
700 miles or 800 miles

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.270
and have a contiguous
landscape like that.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.370
And a contiguous landscape like
that means a lot of things.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.620
It means that
species that migrate

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.410
are able to still migrate,
as they have for thousands

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:47.560
of years, that the
anthropogenic change has not

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.150
been intense on that landscape.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:55.660
And for our California desert,
that's really happened.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.700
Recently, it's happened due
to really good planning.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.490
But for so long before
that, it was really

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.230
that people hadn't
found a use for it.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.040
And when you think of our
desert, our California desert,

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.000
and you compare it to
deserts across the world,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.600
our California desert
is in the best shape

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.951
of any desert on the planet.

00:25:17.951 --> 00:25:19.950
And it's one of the most
protected and connected

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.832
landscapes on planet Earth.

00:25:21.832 --> 00:25:23.540
And I think when people
would think about

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.368
that, they would think about
the Congo or the Amazon.

00:25:28.955 --> 00:25:31.330
They wouldn't necessarily
think of the California desert.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.370
But industrial
activities have really

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.230
only taken place in
the California desert

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.820
for less than 100 years.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.600
And real industrialization
has probably only really taken

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.820
place for about 50 years.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.620
So we're talking
about, as we talk

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.620
about the conservation
of this landscape, which

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:53.480
is the effort to which I spend
my full life, to understand

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.620
and protect this desert,
that maybe this is

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.990
a different kind of story.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.860
Maybe this isn't the
story of what would it

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.382
have been like if we had only
gotten here at this time.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.230
In this place, I think we're
making decisions today.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.500
And we're making
decisions every day

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.520
about what the future
of this landscape

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.990
is going to look like.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:26.030
And there's been a tremendous
amount of positive momentum

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.100
and action that's taken place.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.320
There are right now-- and
I'll show you some maps--

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:40.350
but there's roughly 10 million
acres of contiguous protection

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.100
that exists in the
California desert,

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.160
making it the second
largest protected desert

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:51.870
reserve on the planet in our
beautiful California desert.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.190
The desert is humbling.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.220
The desert is also a place where
many people go to find spirit.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.720
It's a difficult place,
certainly in summer.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.460
And it is like the
Arctic in many ways

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:09.380
where there are long
stretches of harshness

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:16.880
and then incredible, short,
ephemeral times of bounty

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.430
where, in the Arctic, everything
becomes blueberries or salmon

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.460
run up streams, or in
the California desert,

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:32.680
where once you do a
hike, and the hike goes

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.560
through a beautiful, rugged,
elemental, brown country,

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.710
and you do that hike
again after a wet spring,

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.920
and the entire world is flowers.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.510
This year, we had a
remarkable spring.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:49.320
We had a remarkable
bloom in Death Valley.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.420
And it had a different
type of composition

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.540
than any I had ever seen.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.290
And one of those things
was called verbena.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:01.620
Verbena is a small,
beautiful, purple flower.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.390
And verbena has this
wonderful smell.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.460
And I was camping
on a dry lake bed,

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.240
because that's just something
you do in the desert.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.820
And there were these
guys who were basically

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.490
using these self-propelled--
I don't know exactly what you

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:26.450
call them, but they were
basically personal helicopters.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:27.790
You get a running start.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.650
You turn the motor on.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.680
That's why they were
on the dry lake bed.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.510
And you get up in the air.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.910
And they were way up in the air.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:40.835
And when the guy came down,
he looked like he was lost.

00:28:40.835 --> 00:28:42.460
And I was like, hey,
are you all right?

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.070
Do you need water?

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:47.190
And he said, I just had
a spiritual experience.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:51.550
I was up about 2,000 feet above
that large mountain range.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.184
It was a mountain range
called the Kingston Mountains.

00:28:54.184 --> 00:28:55.600
That's a 7,000-foot
tall mountain.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.200
And he was flying over it.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.150
And on one side of it is an
entire sand dune complex.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.364
That was completely covered.

00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.780
So the whole sand dunes was
covered in this purple flower,

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.270
this verbana.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:12.800
And he said as I flew
over the mountain,

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.110
all I could smell was verbana.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.780
And it had never occurred to me.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.652
Where do those oils go that
are carried in the wind?

00:29:21.652 --> 00:29:22.610
Where are they carried?

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.550
Where are those
seeds carried to?

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.832
They're carried all
across that desert.

00:29:26.832 --> 00:29:28.550
There's just so much to learn.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:34.500
And there's so much-- I think
the contrast in the desert

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:39.510
of the harshness
and the fragility

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:45.730
is profound, artistic,
spiritual, whatever

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.980
you want to call it.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.871
It's poignant.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.050
I arrived in the
California desert in 2008.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:30:03.060
And in 2008, shortly thereafter,
myself, my colleagues,

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.890
the coalition of folks that I
work with started on an effort

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.890
to protect the greatest
connected landscape

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:10.950
in the lower 48.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.400
And you can see here on
these colors-- basically,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.330
the light green are the
national park lands.

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.530
And just north where it says
Fort Irwin, just north of that,

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.580
Death Valley National
Park connects north

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.240
from Mojave National Preserve.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.530
This is an incredibly
large landscape

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:32.300
we're talking about,
going from almost--

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.180
we're talking about
50 miles to the border

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.880
all the way up to
Bishop, California.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.290
That's how far north and
south we're talking about.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.440
We started an effort that was
community focused but also

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:50.270
political to take wild
places that really, really

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:55.480
needed protection and to
start sharing that with folks

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.410
and working to get
people to understand

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:01.440
why these places mattered and
what could be done about it.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.460
And I'm so glad to be able
to be here with the good news

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:12.490
to let you guys know that after
nearly a decade of work, so

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:18.720
much effort, strife,
discussions, thousands

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.270
and thousands and
thousands of hours,

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.700
we were able to get to
a point where we were

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.690
unable to pass legislation.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:30.010
We had a bill to
protect these lands.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.200
We couldn't get Congress
to do the right thing.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.240
And we asked the President if
he would do the right thing.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.650
And in February, he did, and he
designated 1.8 million acres.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:44.870
And this map here
shows those lands.

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.310
And those lands will
be protected forever.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.970
And I'm going to
walk you through

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:54.390
these different monuments
so you can get to know them.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.294
They're better in person.

00:31:57.294 --> 00:31:59.210
Unless you get me in
advance, I'm probably not

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:03.540
going to able to narrate them
for you while you're there.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.730
You guys hate jokes.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:13.779
So the gray down at
the bottom, that's

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:15.070
Sand to Snow National Monument.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:19.420
I want to walk you
through that a little bit.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.070
This is an aerial photo of
Sand to Snow National Monument.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.320
And it's special for
a lot of reasons.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.820
And the name is literal.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.820
Because it stretches
from 1,500 feet

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.220
sand up to 10,000 feet in snow.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:39.700
And as national monuments go,
this one is the most diverse

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.920
in terms of the life zones
that it goes through.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.140
It goes through six
different life zones.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:49.070
And you can imagine what that's
like going from-- you actually

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:53.000
go from the Sonoran Desert
to the Mojave Desert,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.240
because that's where the
deserts come together.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.600
And the Mojave Desert is
a higher, colder desert.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.010
Then you start
moving up into Aspen.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:07.190
You start moving up
into fur, yellow pine.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:10.000
You almost get to tree line
in this national monument.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:16.090
You can see in the
very background

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:19.310
San Gorgonio, the highest
point in Southern California,

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:21.330
which is part of that
national monument.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:24.020
The foreground are the little
San Bernardino Mountains.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.850
And the little San
Bernardino Mountains

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:30.630
are the mountainous shield
that mark the transition

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:34.120
from the Coachella Valley,
where Palm Springs is, up

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.557
to Joshua Tree National Park.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.310
These are ocotillos, which
are found in the lower Sonoran

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.014
Desert, kind of the very bottom.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.960
So Sand to Snow is really
important for wildlife

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.870
and for wildlife migrations.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.980
There's really a place
in this national moment

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.410
that's really special to me.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.420
It's called Big Morongo Canyon.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.290
And Big Morongo Canyon is one
of the most important places

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.260
for birds in the entire
state of California.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.159
And if you could
imagine being a bird

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:12.810
and flying over
harsh desert, and you

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.020
see an oasis of
cottonwood trees,

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.550
standing water, palms-- this is
where hundreds of bird species

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.920
come to nest, in
this, basically,

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.090
pocket, a pocket of water
that's created a forest.

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:32.449
Because the geology just--
there's a fault, water.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.409
There's an underground river.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:39.429
The fault hits that water
source, pushes it upwards.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:41.620
Life-- just add water.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.570
It's also a really, really
important place for folks

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.179
who spend time in the Sierra.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:49.050
As folks who spend time
in the Sierra know,

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:53.840
the California mountains
get increasingly

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.600
dry as the year goes on.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.840
So there is snow melt,
and there's abundance.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.860
There's waterfalls in spring.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.720
As you get into fall,
everything starts drying up,

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.590
and you start getting
wildfire danger.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.600
And everything
almost gets crispy.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.260
And at those times, those
perennial water sources

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.880
become even more important.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.130
So you might be at
Big Morongo Canyon,

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.680
and it wouldn't be uncommon
to see a black bear down

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.584
at 2,000 feet in the middle of
the desert, just in his grove

00:35:25.584 --> 00:35:26.750
in the middle of the desert.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.480
You might be on a
boardwalk, and there

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.750
could be a black bear on
it-- or mountain lions,

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.530
or a big-horned sheep.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.910
This is the cactus
wren, which has

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:40.900
one of the most beautiful
songs of any birds,

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:46.045
and which is characteristic
of the Mojave portion of Sand

00:35:46.045 --> 00:35:46.655
to Snow.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.549
And many people don't
know that the California

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:53.340
desert is actually a
really wonderful place

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.460
to see fall color.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.000
And along the river
bottoms and the places

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.230
where you get
especially cottonwood,

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.872
you get outstanding fall color.

00:36:03.872 --> 00:36:05.620
The second place I'm
going to talk to you

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.910
about is Mojave Trails
National Monument.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:12.900
And that's this big,
white component.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.800
It stretches all the
way down to Joshua Tree

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.890
National Park and up to
Mojave National Preserve.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:23.040
For context, Mojave National
Preserve is 1.6 million acres.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.677
It's the third largest
national park in the lower 48.

00:36:27.677 --> 00:36:29.510
Mojave Trails, which
is now connected to it,

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:33.230
is also 1.6 million
acres connecting down

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:39.420
to Joshua Tree National
Park, which is 800,000 acres.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.715
This is an aerial photograph.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.520
It's incredible to
fly over the Mojave,

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.470
because you have the
opportunity to really see

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.710
the geological forces at work.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:53.470
You'll see huge volcanic
fields, and you'll

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:57.840
see dry lake beds that were,
in the Pleistocene, home

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.460
to Native American villages
and to mammoths alike.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.740
And you see oceans of sand
slowly taking over the land.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.410
And when you're
flying over, you'll

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.650
see these mountain ranges.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.460
And as you get high
enough, they almost

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.890
look like caterpillars
walking across the landscape.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:20.440
Here you can see that
the sand is actually

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.190
covering the mountains.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.320
And there was a bunch of places
where the mountain ranges are

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.540
actually buried in so much
sand that all you can see

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.820
is the little
crest of the peaks.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:37.580
And those crests are
like islands in the sand.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.797
And you think about that
on a geological level.

00:37:39.797 --> 00:37:41.380
You think about how
much sand that is,

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.770
and how many years
that is, and how

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.980
remarkable that is that
there are mountain ranges

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:51.770
completely covered in sand
across the California desert.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.052
Mojave Trails National
Monument is a place where

00:37:54.052 --> 00:37:55.260
you get that kind of feeling.

00:37:58.782 --> 00:38:00.490
This is one of the
lower mountain ranges.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.140
And I'm just showing you this
because the lightest color

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:09.190
rock is actually an old fossil
bed from the Carboniferous

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:14.530
period, where people actually
go to find trilobites.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.920
So people will go
with their pick axes,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.070
and they'll pull out
these ancient sea

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.232
creatures from 350
million years ago

00:38:25.232 --> 00:38:27.690
that are probably seeing the
light-- they're not seeing it,

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:33.480
obviously-- but they're seeing
the light for the first time

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.486
in a really long time.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.950
The protection of
Mojave Trails also

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.810
protects almost a million acres
of critical desert tortoise

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:48.250
habitat, which is so
important, because number one,

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:52.580
it's super cool that we
have a desert tortoise.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.930
In America, we have four
species of tortoises,

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.780
and one of those
lives in California.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.740
It's our state reptile, and
it's an interesting and cool

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.240
species.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.810
But to know that in
the last 20-plus years

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.219
that we've probably
lost 90% of them,

00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:08.760
and then to know
that we've protected

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.100
over a million additional
acres of their habitat

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:16.120
is extremely important for the
perseverance of the species.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.730
Just an important place
for large mammals--

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:24.260
for mountain lions, for
Coyotes, for bighorn sheep,

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.190
for mule deer.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:30.970
They walk across these
grand landscapes.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.790
And they don't really
have-- a species

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.920
that lives in a place
with abundant resources

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.027
might not have to cover
the same amount of ground

00:39:39.027 --> 00:39:40.360
as a species in the desert does.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.280
So to protect the larger
landscapes and the really

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.740
important water sources is
crucial to the well-being

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.860
of these creatures.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.620
And throughout the Mojave, we
have these underground river

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.450
systems.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.530
Here is the Mojave
River, which comes down

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.140
from the San
Bernardino Mountains

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.920
and ends at Mojave
National Preserve.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.900
This is Amboy Crater, one
of the youngest lava fields

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.080
in the California desert.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.040
It's home to an incredible
diversity of species.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.300
And it's actually a laboratory,
an ecological laboratory.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.590
Because the species
that live here

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:18.190
all exhibit melanism, which
means that they're darker.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.430
So species that you'll find that
will be various colors when you

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.385
find them in the lava, they've
adapted to that environment,

00:40:24.385 --> 00:40:26.560
and they've done
that really quickly.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.180
And scientists from
all over the world

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.690
are coming to this
particular place

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:32.242
to figure out how they've
adapted so quickly.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.210
That's the chuckwalla.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.580
It's a two-foot-long
vegetarian lizard.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.220
They're really social.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.040
And they don't get
bitey aggressive,

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.370
but they get very territorial.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:53.470
And when they get into breeding,
they'll come right up to you

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:56.320
and let you know that you should
not mess with their females.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.711
The final monument that I
want to talk to you about--

00:40:58.711 --> 00:41:01.210
and I'm going to stop very soon,
because I want to make sure

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.260
that we have time
for questions--

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:07.659
is this black piece in
Mojave National Preserve.

00:41:07.659 --> 00:41:09.325
It's Castle Mountains
National Monument.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.910
This is our newest
National Park Service unit.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:20.530
This is the National Park
Service website for the unit,

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.772
just created this year.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.860
And this is some original
art that NPCA produced

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.550
to celebrate and
commemorate the designation

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:33.330
of this remarkable landscape.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:35.590
Let me tell you
why it's special.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:39.540
At about 5,000 feet in the
very eastern Mojave Desert,

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.630
you get monsoonal
rain, which makes

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:47.120
it incredibly lush, and high
enough elevation that you

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.320
actually create an extremely
rare thing in the California

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:50.820
desert.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.170
That's a grassland.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.500
So this is an actual
grassland that

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.140
is hugged between two of
the most iconic mountain

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.340
ranges in the entire
California desert.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.020
Because it's a grassland,
and because of its elevation,

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.830
and because of the amount
of moisture it gets,

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.330
it's super diverse.

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:11.612
And you get all kinds
of things happening here

00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:13.195
that aren't happening
in other places.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.840
The Joshua Tree-- so this
is the eastern termination

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.660
of the world's largest
Joshua tree forest.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:28.110
And those Joshua trees
are riddled with life.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.560
There are all kinds
of animals using them,

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.780
including red tail hawks
which nest in them.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.670
And we were out here
recently on a tour,

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.670
and there were
baby red tail hawks

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.410
that were just learning to fly.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.460
And we were able to
see these hawks doing

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.520
a really terrible
job of flying, but

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.690
in a ridiculous
and wonderful way

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:52.090
where they're flapping around,
they're hanging upside down.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.000
And we were there as
the sun was setting,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.400
and so we were watching
the silhouette of the hawks

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.480
as they're flapping around.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.840
It's remarkable.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.050
Here's a good look at the
extent of the grassland.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.340
This is the most
intact grassland

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.020
left in the California desert.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:17.930
And it was severely threatened,
and thankfully has just now

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.630
been protected,
just this February.

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.910
There are two herds
of bighorn sheep

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.110
that live here-- a
migratory herd that

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.960
goes around a large
set of mountains,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.620
and then another one that stays
the entire year in the Castle

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.110
Mountains.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.400
This is a good look
at the Castle Peaks.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.580
They're volcanic in origin.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.080
And a really good look at
the diverse Joshua tree

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.085
forest as well as the
different species of yucca

00:43:46.085 --> 00:43:46.710
that live here.

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:50.810
Some of those yuccas
may be 1,000 years old.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.420
The final goal that we
have for this landscape,

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.117
for the Castle Mountains,
is the reintroduction

00:43:56.117 --> 00:43:57.200
of the pronghorn antelope.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:02.600
So 100 years ago
on this grassland,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.280
there were pronghorned antelope,
and there were Mexican wolves

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.050
that would hunt them.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.574
And our first step
is to reintroduce

00:44:10.574 --> 00:44:12.490
these pronghorned antelope,
and it's something

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:14.323
that we've wanted to
do for a very long time

00:44:14.323 --> 00:44:16.700
but were unwilling
to do, because we

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.800
didn't know what the fate of
the landscape was going to be.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.930
And now that it's protected,
it's our next step.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:26.460
I'm going to end it here just
so we have time for questions,

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.376
but thank you guys so
much for listening to me

00:44:28.376 --> 00:44:29.780
talk about the
California desert.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:36.702 --> 00:44:38.160
AUDIENCE: One
question I would have

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.700
for you is if you could
explain to us some

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.030
of the difference
between a designation

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.120
of a national monument
versus a national park

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.203
and some of the other
possibilities the government

00:44:45.203 --> 00:44:47.570
had with these lands,
that would be awesome.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:48.450
DAVID LAMFROM: So I
think everybody knows

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:49.533
that government is simple.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.720
There's so many different
agencies in the California

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.510
desert that manage land.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:05.610
So there's different-- within
the Interior Department,

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:07.906
and within that
Interior Department,

00:45:07.906 --> 00:45:09.780
there is the Bureau of
Land Management, which

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.520
is the largest landowner
in the entire country.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.130
And they manage for
a specific purpose,

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.090
which is called multiple
use, which means

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:20.540
that they protect some lands.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.790
Some lands are designated
for protection.

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:28.790
Some lands are designated
for recreation, et cetera.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:31.970
The National Park
Service has less lands,

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:34.610
although they have a great
deal of lands in the California

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:35.110
desert.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:39.470
The National Park Service has
a more conservation-focused

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:43.820
mission, and that mission is
to protect those resources that

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.964
exist there in perpetuity.

00:45:45.964 --> 00:45:47.380
There are other
land managers that

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.100
are not in the
Department of Interior,

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.590
like the Forest
Service, for example,

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.010
which is in the
Department of Agriculture.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:57.040
And there's also the
Department of Defense,

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.420
which owns something like
3 million acres of land

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:00.590
in the California desert.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:05.560
So there's a lot of different
types of designations.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.650
The national monuments
that I discussed-- Sand

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.030
to Snow and Mojave
Trails-- those

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:13.280
are both owned by the
Bureau of Land Management,

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.430
and they are being
protected for the protection

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.080
of their resources.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.870
Castle Mountains is owned by
the National Park Service,

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:24.200
and is going to be protected in
perpetuity for the protection

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:24.990
of its resources.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:29.490
So in both cases, they
have extremely high levels

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.435
of protection.

00:46:30.435 --> 00:46:31.810
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering how you

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:35.000
think about the future
of having people being

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.600
able to camp in these preserves
and in these national parks,

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.270
but also making sure that
they aren't destroying them

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:43.000
at the same time, and what you
think tourism in that sense

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.810
will be as we go on.

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:48.320
DAVID LAMFROM: I think that's
a really important question.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.810
And it's a tough
thing for-- I think

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:54.060
that it's really easy to
look at it in this binary way

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.010
where the amount of people
who use something directly

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:02.072
correlates to the intensity
to which it is harmed.

00:47:02.072 --> 00:47:04.030
I don't think that that's
necessarily the case.

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:07.790
And I think in many cases,
the more a person steps

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:10.490
foot on a place, the
softer their foot

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:14.270
becomes, because they
come to care about it.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:15.780
They come to understand it.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:19.825
And so I don't think that it's
really about the specific use.

00:47:19.825 --> 00:47:24.540
I think it's about people
being open to understanding

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:29.440
what a place is, and why it
matters, and who it's for.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.480
And the answer to who
it's for is for everybody,

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.750
and that matters.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:39.900
And it's hard sometimes to
have the perspective of time

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.880
to think about who came before
and who will come after.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:48.275
But I think it's a humble
and important thing for us

00:47:48.275 --> 00:47:48.900
to think about.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:54.540
And I think that ultimately,
we have to show people,

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:58.170
and not in a judgey way, or not
in a restrictive, necessarily,

00:47:58.170 --> 00:47:59.180
way.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.340
But just about being-- I
think that there's nothing

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.550
more compelling to me than
people who love things.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.510
And so if we have
genuine stewards

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.240
in places who care
about places, I

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.550
think we will have those places.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.810
AUDIENCE: And maybe
what you have observed

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.490
and what you are
observing currently,

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:19.810
and maybe what would be
your hopes for the future,

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:26.520
and the two sides of
it-- how technology

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:31.830
gets to separate
people from nature,

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:37.400
and as you said, what
we don't directly know,

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:43.290
and I think that we don't
directly engage with.

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:47.570
Maybe we don't really
feel the need to protect.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.870
And the other side--
how technology may help

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:54.900
to-- completely the opposite.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.814
We establish that connection.

00:48:57.814 --> 00:49:00.230
DAVID LAMFROM: I think that's
a really wonderful question,

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:02.610
and I think there's
a lot of answers.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:05.170
There's a lot of ways that
we could discuss this.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:10.260
But there's a couple of, I
think, really immediate points.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:16.420
One is it's an incredibly
privileged position

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:22.330
to have the Earth sustain you,
to have food, to have water,

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:25.200
to have everything
you need, and then

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.580
to say I don't need nature.

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:31.280
It's a very privileged
place to be.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:37.610
And I don't think it's
about people having

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:40.330
to reconnect to
nature, or that people

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:42.630
have disassociated from nature.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:49.310
I think it's that continuum
that I was discussing before,

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:55.190
which is if you think-- if we
all think back-- and some of us

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:57.580
don't even have the privilege
of knowing-- I don't know--

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.920
I can't go that far back
in my own family tree

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.710
and know exactly what my
distant relatives did.

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:05.360
I have no idea.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:09.480
But a couple generations ago,
we were all fundamentally

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.670
connected to the land.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:15.270
And understanding who we
are and where we came from

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.690
is a function of understanding
that we came from the land.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:20.640
And it's not about--
I think it's not

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:25.590
about certain good Samaritans
showing folks, hey, let

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:26.840
me show you how to be outside.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.798
Let me take you hiking.

00:50:27.798 --> 00:50:29.130
Let me teach you how to camp.

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:33.210
It's about people
understanding themselves

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:34.570
and where they come from.

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:38.600
And I don't think every person
has to be an environmentalist.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.720
Or maybe every person doesn't
even enjoy being outside.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.682
But I think that you
have to understand

00:50:45.682 --> 00:50:47.140
that you're on this
planet, and you

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.650
have to understand
your place on it,

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:53.200
and that you have a
profound privilege.

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.610
We, at least, have this
incredible privilege.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:51:01.214
And part of that is being
respectful of that world.

00:51:01.214 --> 00:51:02.630
Now, when you think
about and talk

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:06.550
about people who are
being disconnected

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:13.740
due to technology-- so I just
think that because people-- I

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:21.430
think people inherently
care about nature.

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:25.680
Cat videos, animals-- people
are drawn instinctively,

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.691
inherently to living creatures
on the Earth and to the Earth

00:51:29.691 --> 00:51:30.190
itself.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.910
And when people think about
themselves in beautiful places,

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.240
they think about these places.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.690
It's a deep part of our ethos.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:38.760
So we are connected.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.630
And so if I thought about
the lines of disconnection,

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.610
I don't think that they're
really that far apart.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:48.110
And I frankly think
that technology can,

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:50.530
if we're open to it-- I
think it's just about us

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:52.690
being humbled.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:57.030
But I think if we're open to it,
technology can help us enjoy.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:01.510
I just saw today there was
an app, a Shazam for plants,

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:05.330
where you take a
picture of a plant,

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.770
and your phone is going to
tell you what that plant is.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.010
Because I still
use a typewriter,

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:14.835
I wasn't the guy to invent that,
but I think that's awesome.

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:23.820
It's easy to it's easy to
assume that we are very far,

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.500
but we're not.

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.620
We are here.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.900
We are a part of this
thing that's happening.

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:35.150
And I think that really,
people have to take a moment.

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:40.290
I think if you just really
calmly think about yourself

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.020
and your place on
this Earth, you

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:46.930
understand that you're connected
to all of these systems.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.050
We are plugged into the
natural world in way

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:52.710
more ways than we're plugged
into the internet or our phones

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:54.840
or any of these things.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.730
AUDIENCE: Are there
similar efforts

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:00.110
to protect these deserts in
the other states in the west--

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:06.200
in Arizona, Nevada,
Idaho, Wyoming, Utah,

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.870
as you described in California?

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:12.590
DAVID LAMFROM: There are
multiple and discreet efforts

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:19.480
across the West in deserts and
in mountains to protect really,

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.000
really precious places.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.800
I don't think that
there's anything--

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.220
there is, I think, something
of this scale that's

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.565
being thought about in the
state of Utah right now.

00:53:31.565 --> 00:53:33.190
Beyond that, I don't
think that there's

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:36.200
anything of this magnitude
that has been envisioned.

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.520
And for me, what's
really remarkable

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:43.430
is that we got there, that we
had the foresight to protect.

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:48.380
That's a wild and vast land.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.410
But there are efforts.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:52.520
Efforts are ongoing.

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:57.080
But the reality is
there's more to do.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.850
There's a tremendous amount of
really, really special places.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:04.900
But for these efforts
to actually work,

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.590
they have to be authentic.

00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:10.500
And they have to be driven
by people who know the places

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.930
and love the places.

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:16.270
So I don't think that
conservation should not--

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:17.720
that's not the right word.

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.050
Conservation for its
own sake has value,

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:27.140
but it's best when done
by people who love places

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.680
to care for those places.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:35.280
Otherwise, it becomes
politics or a game.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.960
And that may take us farther
away from where we want to be,

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.580
which is to really help
people understand these places

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.077
and why they matter.

00:54:42.077 --> 00:54:43.660
MATT SHEETS: Thank
you so much, David.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.610
We really appreciate it.

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:46.360
And thank you, everyone,
for coming today.

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:50.294
