it's a truly beautiful analysis and a

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:00.900
it's a truly beautiful analysis and a
 

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.290
it's a truly beautiful analysis and a
great read but it's not written by an

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300
great read but it's not written by an
 

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.940
great read but it's not written by an
architect I think that's very important

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:04.950
architect I think that's very important
 

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.230
architect I think that's very important
to understand the third one is written

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240
to understand the third one is written
 

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.460
to understand the third one is written
by an architect and that's all you need

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:07.470
by an architect and that's all you need
 

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.770
by an architect and that's all you need
to know it's not about archives actually

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:09.780
to know it's not about archives actually
 

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.170
to know it's not about archives actually
the sources are always secondary or even

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180
the sources are always secondary or even
 

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.510
the sources are always secondary or even
tertiary and so on what's primary for

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:14.520
tertiary and so on what's primary for
 

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.760
tertiary and so on what's primary for

what architecture is trying to be

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.070
what architecture is trying to be
 

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:20.960
what architecture is trying to be
thinking in the end about

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:20.970
thinking in the end about
 

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.630

I mean sort of floating somehow vaguely

00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519
I mean sort of floating somehow vaguely
 

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:24.969
I mean sort of floating somehow vaguely
is the idea there's a number of scholars

00:16:24.969 --> 00:16:24.979
is the idea there's a number of scholars

newspapers within this kind of academic
 

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:34.299
newspapers within this kind of academic
tradition which was sort of as it were

rift I think they are caught and we're

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:45.409
rift I think they are caught and we're
 

00:16:45.409 --> 00:16:45.939
rift I think they are caught and we're
cold

00:16:45.939 --> 00:16:45.949
cold
 

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:49.359

probably still are caught but so but I

00:16:49.359 --> 00:16:49.369
probably still are caught but so but I
 

00:16:49.369 --> 00:16:51.460
probably still are caught but so but I
felt I didn't want to do that maybe also

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:51.470
felt I didn't want to do that maybe also
 

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.639
felt I didn't want to do that maybe also
I felt that I might be made

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:54.649
I felt that I might be made
 

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:57.340
I felt that I might be made
uncomfortable by some of these scholarly

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:57.350
uncomfortable by some of these scholarly
 

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.019
uncomfortable by some of these scholarly
contributions so I saw they were trying

00:16:59.019 --> 00:16:59.029
contributions so I saw they were trying
 

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:02.499
contributions so I saw they were trying
to dodge that and and so this is a kind

00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:02.509
to dodge that and and so this is a kind
 

00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:04.629
to dodge that and and so this is a kind
of anti fest rift in as much as it's

00:17:04.629 --> 00:17:04.639
of anti fest rift in as much as it's
 

00:17:04.639 --> 00:17:06.939
of anti fest rift in as much as it's
known there's no shrift involved except

00:17:06.939 --> 00:17:06.949
known there's no shrift involved except
 

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:09.669
known there's no shrift involved except
the words of well my own words and marks

00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679
the words of well my own words and marks
 

00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:12.249
the words of well my own words and marks
works but also the works words of the of

00:17:12.249 --> 00:17:12.259
works but also the works words of the of

the five firms that are collected here

00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439
the five firms that are collected here
 

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:18.669
the five firms that are collected here
to to make this presentation and I

00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679
to to make this presentation and I
 

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:20.379
to to make this presentation and I
suppose that might even make a book on

00:17:20.379 --> 00:17:20.389
suppose that might even make a book on
 

00:17:20.389 --> 00:17:25.059
suppose that might even make a book on
I'm sure it's worth it should be I am so

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:25.069
I'm sure it's worth it should be I am so
 

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.100
I'm sure it's worth it should be I am so
confident about all five of these

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.110
confident about all five of these
 

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.549
confident about all five of these
practices that I'm sure it merits a book

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559
practices that I'm sure it merits a book
 

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:32.259
practices that I'm sure it merits a book
and particularly perhaps a book that's

00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:32.269
and particularly perhaps a book that's
 

00:17:32.269 --> 00:17:34.389
and particularly perhaps a book that's
under one cover if one still putting

00:17:34.389 --> 00:17:34.399
under one cover if one still putting
 

00:17:34.399 --> 00:17:36.190
under one cover if one still putting
books into covers that he is and so on

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200
books into covers that he is and so on
 

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.299
books into covers that he is and so on
and and I mean I think the other point

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:40.309
and and I mean I think the other point
 

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:43.840
and and I mean I think the other point
that mark made before I want to other

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:43.850
that mark made before I want to other
 

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.070
that mark made before I want to other
thank-yous I want to make before I

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080
thank-yous I want to make before I
 

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.629
thank-yous I want to make before I

which is highly repetitive these ones

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:14.250
which is highly repetitive these ones
 

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.819
which is highly repetitive these ones
which are basically the same form that's

00:47:16.819 --> 00:47:16.829
which are basically the same form that's
 

00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:20.059
which are basically the same form that's
used all the way up these sliding forms

00:47:20.059 --> 00:47:20.069
used all the way up these sliding forms
 

00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:22.069
used all the way up these sliding forms
which are inserted and pulled out and

then the fact that um the production of

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020
then the fact that um the production of
 

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.839
then the fact that um the production of
the building is also the completion of

00:47:26.839 --> 00:47:26.849
the building is also the completion of
 

00:47:26.849 --> 00:47:28.849
the building is also the completion of
the building so after the concrete is

00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859
the building so after the concrete is
 

00:47:28.859 --> 00:47:32.960
the building so after the concrete is
cured the glass is inserted and at that

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:32.970
cured the glass is inserted and at that
 

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:34.730
cured the glass is inserted and at that
point the building is finished and

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740
point the building is finished and
 

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:35.539
point the building is finished and
waterproofed

00:47:35.539 --> 00:47:35.549

techniques of construction seven trades
follow each other to create the seal

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740
follow each other to create the seal
 

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.069
follow each other to create the seal
because the concrete's basically hidden

00:47:49.069 --> 00:47:49.079
because the concrete's basically hidden
 

00:47:49.079 --> 00:47:53.170
because the concrete's basically hidden
between some kind of skin of framing and

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:53.180
between some kind of skin of framing and

so he had two trades actually achieved

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740
so he had two trades actually achieved
 

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.740
so he had two trades actually achieved
the completion and the building is

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:06.750
the completion and the building is
 

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.990
the completion and the building is
actually built from within itself so

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000
actually built from within itself so
 

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.579
actually built from within itself so
that it doesn't need any scaffolding

00:48:10.579 --> 00:48:10.589
that it doesn't need any scaffolding
 

00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:12.470
that it doesn't need any scaffolding
because they sell a little actual work

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480
because they sell a little actual work
 

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.210
because they sell a little actual work
that needs to be done on the exterior

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220
that needs to be done on the exterior
 

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.579
that needs to be done on the exterior
and these savings actually were

00:48:16.579 --> 00:48:16.589
and these savings actually were
 

00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:19.460
and these savings actually were
translated into using better materials

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:19.470
translated into using better materials
 

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:21.650
translated into using better materials
so typically in the competitive

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:21.660
so typically in the competitive
 

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.900
so typically in the competitive
buildings it's impossible to get this

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:23.910
buildings it's impossible to get this
 

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.270
buildings it's impossible to get this
much glazing whereas here the entire

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280
much glazing whereas here the entire
 

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.309
much glazing whereas here the entire
surface of the building is actually

00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319
surface of the building is actually
 

00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:31.280
surface of the building is actually
constructed of glass and this is just

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:31.290
constructed of glass and this is just
 

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.020
constructed of glass and this is just
the process where you see that as the

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:33.030
the process where you see that as the
 

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:38.569
the process where you see that as the
building is being still poured the

00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579
building is being still poured the
 

00:48:38.579 --> 00:48:41.150
building is being still poured the
finishing of the lower units is possible

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160
finishing of the lower units is possible
 

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.430
finishing of the lower units is possible
and works going on so the time frame

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440
and works going on so the time frame
 

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.490
and works going on so the time frame
gets compressed which is a huge economy

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500
gets compressed which is a huge economy
 

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.650
gets compressed which is a huge economy
and yeah with by the time the roof is

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:48.660
and yeah with by the time the roof is
 

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.990
and yeah with by the time the roof is
being put on the building's already all

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000
being put on the building's already all
 

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.880
being put on the building's already all
sealed up and being completed on the

so I decided immediately that the one

00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319
so I decided immediately that the one
 

00:57:38.319 --> 00:57:39.720
so I decided immediately that the one
thing that I was going to do

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:39.730
thing that I was going to do

which would produce the possibility of

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:24.340
which would produce the possibility of
 

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:27.180
which would produce the possibility of
growth and so there's a kind of math

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:27.190
growth and so there's a kind of math
 

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:31.940
growth and so there's a kind of math

thing about this museum was that it had
an incredibly modest budget so we had to

00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:57.810
an incredibly modest budget so we had to
 

00:59:57.810 --> 01:00:01.580
an incredibly modest budget so we had to
really be begging for many in it was

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:01.590
really be begging for many in it was

we created this effect was through this
 

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:18.760
we created this effect was through this
series of perforated panels which were

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:18.770
series of perforated panels which were
 

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:23.840

communally and here you can see the
 

01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:30.439
communally and here you can see the
diagram of that space the first

01:10:30.439 --> 01:10:30.449
diagram of that space the first
 

01:10:30.449 --> 01:10:33.560
diagram of that space the first

basically the original idea was that
 

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.520
basically the original idea was that
women didn't participate in the service

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:04.530
women didn't participate in the service
 

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:06.410
women didn't participate in the service
and said in these balconies up above and

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:06.420
and said in these balconies up above and
 

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:09.830

all of the activity occurred with men on

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840

separation of men and women and it was
 

01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:26.240
separation of men and women and it was
very important that the building

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:26.250
very important that the building
 

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:29.120
very important that the building
reflected this transformation which has

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:29.130
reflected this transformation which has
 

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:33.770
reflected this transformation which has
worked and gave rise to this form this

01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780
worked and gave rise to this form this
 

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.380
worked and gave rise to this form this
is the site which is along Park Presidio

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:36.390
is the site which is along Park Presidio

established and two religious buildings
 

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:44.510
established and two religious buildings
to be built there was a synagogue here

01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520
to be built there was a synagogue here
 

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.610
to be built there was a synagogue here
which was demolished for the new project

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620
which was demolished for the new project
 

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.280
which was demolished for the new project
and initially the synagogue's were at

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:49.290
and initially the synagogue's were at
 

01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:50.930
and initially the synagogue's were at
the the religious buildings were not

01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:50.940
the the religious buildings were not
 

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:54.410
the the religious buildings were not
send it to normal darling and they were

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420
send it to normal darling and they were
 

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.570
send it to normal darling and they were
allowed additional height and so on but

01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580
allowed additional height and so on but
 

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.640
allowed additional height and so on but
the Carol's railing doesn't recognize

01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:58.650
the Carol's railing doesn't recognize
 

01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:02.000
the Carol's railing doesn't recognize
that right and said the synagogue had to

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:02.010
that right and said the synagogue had to
 

01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:04.250
that right and said the synagogue had to
conform with all of the residential

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260
conform with all of the residential
 

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:07.149
conform with all of the residential
zoning that any exceptions are for

01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159
zoning that any exceptions are for

steeples which Jews don't have
 

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:15.600
steeples which Jews don't have
so it basically had to conform in in the

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:15.610
so it basically had to conform in in the
 

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:19.500
so it basically had to conform in in the
residential envelope and this is the

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:19.510
residential envelope and this is the
 

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:21.300
residential envelope and this is the
Christian Science church which was met

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:21.310
Christian Science church which was met
 

01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:24.800
Christian Science church which was met
earlier which is much larger structure

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:24.810
earlier which is much larger structure
 

01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:29.640
earlier which is much larger structure
here you see the site plan and initially

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:29.650
here you see the site plan and initially
 

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:31.350
here you see the site plan and initially
the building which had occupied the site

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360
the building which had occupied the site
 

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.479
the building which had occupied the site
had built out the entire lot what I

01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:33.489
had built out the entire lot what I
 

01:12:33.489 --> 01:12:37.200
had built out the entire lot what I
tried to do was use the existing really

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:37.210
tried to do was use the existing really
 

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:39.240
tried to do was use the existing really
odd pattern and put it into this

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:39.250
odd pattern and put it into this
 

01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:42.750
odd pattern and put it into this
courtyard so that it was continuous with

courtyard so that it was continuous with
the neighborhood which I thought was a

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:45.580
the neighborhood which I thought was a
 

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:48.390
the neighborhood which I thought was a
nice gesture but the neighbors hated and

01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400
nice gesture but the neighbors hated and
 

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.690
nice gesture but the neighbors hated and
tried to slap controls on how we use

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:51.700
tried to slap controls on how we use
 

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.830
tried to slap controls on how we use
that space and so on the whole process

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840
that space and so on the whole process
 

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.780
that space and so on the whole process

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320
which connects all of the activities of
 

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:12.600
which connects all of the activities of
the synagogue

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:12.610
 

01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:15.959
this was the first thinking about the

01:15:15.959 --> 01:15:15.969
this was the first thinking about the
 

01:15:15.969 --> 01:15:18.870
this was the first thinking about the
project and obviously in these drawings

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880
project and obviously in these drawings
 

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.180
project and obviously in these drawings
the memory of being in this space was

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:21.190
the memory of being in this space was
 

01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:25.680
the memory of being in this space was
very strong and the idea of this space

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:25.690
very strong and the idea of this space
 

01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:28.890
very strong and the idea of this space
of community bigger than the traditional

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:28.900
of community bigger than the traditional
 

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.410
of community bigger than the traditional
synagogues but operating the same with

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:31.420
synagogues but operating the same with
 

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:34.859
synagogues but operating the same with
this sort of focus on a center and idea

01:15:34.859 --> 01:15:34.869
this sort of focus on a center and idea
 

01:15:34.869 --> 01:15:37.290
this sort of focus on a center and idea
of a community in prayer rather than a

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:37.300
of a community in prayer rather than a
 

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:42.270
of a community in prayer rather than a
sort of performance of a service and the

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280
sort of performance of a service and the
 

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:48.500
sort of performance of a service and the
actual space and one of the problems of

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:48.510
actual space and one of the problems of
 

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:51.229
actual space and one of the problems of
the Hebraic tradition is that

01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239
the Hebraic tradition is that
 

01:15:51.239 --> 01:15:54.600
the Hebraic tradition is that
iconography is equated to idolatry so

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:54.610
iconography is equated to idolatry so
 

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:56.939
iconography is equated to idolatry so
it's very hard to have any decorative

01:15:56.939 --> 01:15:56.949
it's very hard to have any decorative
 

01:15:56.949 --> 01:16:00.570
it's very hard to have any decorative
elements the crenellations was actually

01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:00.580
elements the crenellations was actually
 

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:03.990
elements the crenellations was actually
about an acoustic issue with the hard

01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000
about an acoustic issue with the hard
 

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.629
about an acoustic issue with the hard
surfaces but the other element of

01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639
surfaces but the other element of
 

01:16:06.639 --> 01:16:10.470
surfaces but the other element of
ornament is the shadow menorah which the

01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480
ornament is the shadow menorah which the
 

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.959
ornament is the shadow menorah which the
structure casts in which changes the

01:16:12.959 --> 01:16:12.969
structure casts in which changes the
 

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:15.990
structure casts in which changes the
space as the sunlight changes through

01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000
space as the sunlight changes through
 

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.250
space as the sunlight changes through
the day so you see the sort of menorah

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:20.260
the day so you see the sort of menorah
 

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:25.590
the day so you see the sort of menorah
that animates the space time one of the

01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600
that animates the space time one of the
 

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.260
that animates the space time one of the
things about the description of the

01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:28.270
things about the description of the
 

01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:30.180
things about the description of the
tabernacle that I mentioned was the

01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:30.190
tabernacle that I mentioned was the
 

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:33.300
tabernacle that I mentioned was the
emphasis on connection and the idea of

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:33.310
emphasis on connection and the idea of
 

01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:36.060
emphasis on connection and the idea of
connection as being the sort of element

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:36.070
connection as being the sort of element
 

01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:38.399
connection as being the sort of element
of community and yeah what I tried to do

01:16:38.399 --> 01:16:38.409
of community and yeah what I tried to do
 

01:16:38.409 --> 01:16:40.169
of community and yeah what I tried to do
was make all the connections out of

01:16:40.169 --> 01:16:40.179
was make all the connections out of
 

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.750
was make all the connections out of
light so everything's pulled apart and

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760
light so everything's pulled apart and
 

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.080
light so everything's pulled apart and
joined by light and it's like that sort

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:46.090
joined by light and it's like that sort
 

01:16:46.090 --> 01:16:50.580
joined by light and it's like that sort
of holds everything together this is the

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:50.590
of holds everything together this is the
 

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:57.020
of holds everything together this is the

the chapel which took some of the
 

01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:02.660
the chapel which took some of the

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:19.890
conditions in a way this image is our
 

01:36:19.890 --> 01:36:22.070
conditions in a way this image is our
most recent project and I guess I think

01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080
most recent project and I guess I think
 

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.170
most recent project and I guess I think
of everything we do as a bit of an

01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:24.180
of everything we do as a bit of an
 

01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:26.780
of everything we do as a bit of an
experiment and we're very fortunate to

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:26.790
experiment and we're very fortunate to
 

01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:28.880
experiment and we're very fortunate to
have a range of clients who kind of go

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:28.890
have a range of clients who kind of go
 

01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:32.810
have a range of clients who kind of go
along with it and allow us to kind of

01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:32.820
along with it and allow us to kind of
 

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.910
along with it and allow us to kind of
experiment at both small and large

01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920
experiment at both small and large
 

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:40.090
experiment at both small and large
scales so in a way for us the kind of

01:36:40.090 --> 01:36:40.100
scales so in a way for us the kind of
 

01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:42.950
scales so in a way for us the kind of
exploration of ideas through the medium

01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960
exploration of ideas through the medium
 

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:44.240

an exterior court and so for us this
 

01:36:57.250 --> 01:36:59.790

think about it all the time and we think
 

01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:19.020
think about it all the time and we think
about not just this verdant summer green

schools today we think about them from
the inside out and so we're kind of

the inside out and so we're kind of
 

01:38:41.770 --> 01:38:44.040
the inside out and so we're kind of
preoccupied with this kind of push and

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:44.050
preoccupied with this kind of push and

somehow to show the kind of rawness of
 

01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:44.090
somehow to show the kind of rawness of
nature and in this view you can see the

01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100
nature and in this view you can see the
 

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:46.400
nature and in this view you can see the
kind of roughness of the water beyond

and more pastoral condition there's a

01:39:58.940 --> 01:39:58.950
and more pastoral condition there's a
 

01:39:58.950 --> 01:40:01.040
and more pastoral condition there's a
kind of acceptance of that rawness and a

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:01.050
kind of acceptance of that rawness and a
 

01:40:01.050 --> 01:40:05.110
kind of acceptance of that rawness and a
kind of inclusion into the work itself

01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:05.120
kind of inclusion into the work itself

end of every season and so we actually

01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760
end of every season and so we actually
 

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.390
end of every season and so we actually
devised a series of briefs all A's that

01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400
devised a series of briefs all A's that
 

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.280

whole building up in a very short period

01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360
whole building up in a very short period
 

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:27.379
whole building up in a very short period
of time the kind of idea that the kind

01:42:27.379 --> 01:42:27.389
of time the kind of idea that the kind
 

01:42:27.389 --> 01:42:29.180
of time the kind of idea that the kind
of extension of the building becomes a

01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:29.190
of extension of the building becomes a
 

01:42:29.190 --> 01:42:31.459
of extension of the building becomes a
kind of outdoor porch which is very much

01:42:31.459 --> 01:42:31.469
kind of outdoor porch which is very much
 

01:42:31.469 --> 01:42:33.919
kind of outdoor porch which is very much
part of the vernacular condition but

01:42:33.919 --> 01:42:33.929
part of the vernacular condition but
 

01:42:33.929 --> 01:42:36.200
part of the vernacular condition but
it's rethought and reconsidered and then

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:36.210
it's rethought and reconsidered and then
 

01:42:36.210 --> 01:42:38.720
it's rethought and reconsidered and then
again kind of frames the landscape

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:38.730
again kind of frames the landscape
 

01:42:38.730 --> 01:42:42.320
again kind of frames the landscape
beyond and then this kind of question of

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:42.330
beyond and then this kind of question of
 

01:42:42.330 --> 01:42:44.810
beyond and then this kind of question of
the way that the building actually takes

01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820
the way that the building actually takes
 

01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:48.260
the way that the building actually takes
on these very local conditions so what

01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:48.270
on these very local conditions so what
 

01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:49.610
on these very local conditions so what
you're looking at is this kind of

01:42:49.610 --> 01:42:49.620
you're looking at is this kind of
 

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:52.610
you're looking at is this kind of
ready-made greenhouse glazing a kind of

01:42:52.610 --> 01:42:52.620

used on barns a kind of cedar that is a
 

01:42:58.110 --> 01:43:01.430
used on barns a kind of cedar that is a
kind of very local condition and yet

01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440
kind of very local condition and yet
 

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.100

assembles them together in a slightly
 

01:43:04.110 --> 01:43:07.760
assembles them together in a slightly
different way in a way for us at the

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:07.770
different way in a way for us at the
 

01:43:07.770 --> 01:43:11.090
different way in a way for us at the
same time shortly after we started to

01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:11.100
same time shortly after we started to
 

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:14.030

design a cabin Georgian Bay and so many

01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040
design a cabin Georgian Bay and so many
 

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:15.590
design a cabin Georgian Bay and so many

actually removed from the plywood and
 

01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:35.270
actually removed from the plywood and
then filled with an alkyl and dye and we

01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280
then filled with an alkyl and dye and we
 

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:37.040
then filled with an alkyl and dye and we
actually designed a studio for Paterson

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:37.050
actually designed a studio for Paterson
 

01:43:37.050 --> 01:43:39.380
actually designed a studio for Paterson
before he died and he worked in it for

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:39.390
before he died and he worked in it for
 

01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:40.850
before he died and he worked in it for
several years and was a kind of

01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860
several years and was a kind of
 

01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:43.310
several years and was a kind of
inspiration in terms of the way that his

different conditions so the project that
 

01:43:53.970 --> 01:43:56.000
different conditions so the project that
was the kind of beneficiary of the

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:56.010
was the kind of beneficiary of the
 

01:43:56.010 --> 01:43:58.850
was the kind of beneficiary of the
experiment of the the moorlands camp

01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:58.860
experiment of the the moorlands camp
 

01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.160
experiment of the the moorlands camp
dining hall is this very small cabin and

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:01.170
dining hall is this very small cabin and
 

01:44:01.170 --> 01:44:02.900
dining hall is this very small cabin and
we thought of it as a kind of wooden

01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:02.910
we thought of it as a kind of wooden
 

01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:05.870
we thought of it as a kind of wooden
tent so it early sketches but kind of

01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880
tent so it early sketches but kind of
 

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.610
tent so it early sketches but kind of
rendering where we're the kind of main

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:12.170
space really is intended to feel like a
porch so here you are in this kind of

01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:12.180
porch so here you are in this kind of
 

01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:14.840

wild landscape but wanting it to be open

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:14.850
wild landscape but wanting it to be open
 

01:44:14.850 --> 01:44:17.420
wild landscape but wanting it to be open
and accepting of it and maybe not so

01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:17.430
and accepting of it and maybe not so
 

01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:20.540
and accepting of it and maybe not so
afraid of it a very simple system

01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:20.550
afraid of it a very simple system
 

01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:22.250
afraid of it a very simple system
thinking very carefully about

01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:22.260
thinking very carefully about
 

01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:24.830
thinking very carefully about
foundations a kind of adapted screw jack

01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840
foundations a kind of adapted screw jack
 

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:27.230

light way of literally touching down

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:29.610
light way of literally touching down
 

01:44:29.610 --> 01:44:32.330
light way of literally touching down
into this ancient rock I'm a kind of

01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:32.340
into this ancient rock I'm a kind of
 

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:35.570

very regular eyes system and a series of

01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:35.580
very regular eyes system and a series of
 

01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:37.960
very regular eyes system and a series of
kind of models that are kind of the

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:37.970
kind of models that are kind of the
 

01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:41.030

development of both the building idea

01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040
development of both the building idea
 

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.160
development of both the building idea
the kind of conceptual thinking as well

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:43.170
the kind of conceptual thinking as well
 

01:44:43.170 --> 01:44:45.020
the kind of conceptual thinking as well
as the construction idea because in many

01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:45.030
as the construction idea because in many
 

01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:47.000
as the construction idea because in many
of our projects they're inter woven and

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:47.010
of our projects they're inter woven and
 

01:44:47.010 --> 01:44:50.840
of our projects they're inter woven and
intertwined together this project is on

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:50.850
intertwined together this project is on
 

01:44:50.850 --> 01:44:52.910
intertwined together this project is on
an island so everything had to be

01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:52.920
an island so everything had to be
 

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.370
an island so everything had to be
thought of as a kid apart so we kind of

01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:55.380
thought of as a kid apart so we kind of
 

01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:57.110
thought of as a kid apart so we kind of
almost built it and then almost imagine

01:44:57.110 --> 01:44:57.120
almost built it and then almost imagine
 

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.150
almost built it and then almost imagine
how you would disassemble it how you

01:44:59.150 --> 01:44:59.160
how you would disassemble it how you
 

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:00.620
how you would disassemble it how you
would actually think about how its

01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:00.630
would actually think about how its
 

01:45:00.630 --> 01:45:04.400
would actually think about how its
fabricated and thinking about again the

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:04.410
fabricated and thinking about again the
 

01:45:04.410 --> 01:45:06.260
fabricated and thinking about again the
lightness of every piece so every

01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:06.270
lightness of every piece so every
 

01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:08.420
lightness of every piece so every
element had to be carried by two people

01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:08.430
element had to be carried by two people
 

01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:11.060
element had to be carried by two people
over a rocky terrain transferred several

01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:11.070
over a rocky terrain transferred several
 

01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:14.570
over a rocky terrain transferred several
times and so the kind of the its

01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:14.580
times and so the kind of the its
 

01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:17.140
times and so the kind of the its
intrinsic ability to be maneuvered

01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:17.150
intrinsic ability to be maneuvered
 

01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:20.420
intrinsic ability to be maneuvered
through different water land conditions

01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:20.430
through different water land conditions
 

01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:22.870
through different water land conditions
was actually part of the criteria and

01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880
was actually part of the criteria and
 

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:25.070
was actually part of the criteria and
then we actually built full-size

01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080
then we actually built full-size
 

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.990
then we actually built full-size
mock-ups and which is some of the one of

01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000
mock-ups and which is some of the one of
 

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.360
mock-ups and which is some of the one of
the things that we loved doing we

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:29.370
the things that we loved doing we
 

01:45:29.370 --> 01:45:31.040
the things that we loved doing we
actually got our structural engineers to

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:31.050
actually got our structural engineers to
 

01:45:31.050 --> 01:45:32.740
actually got our structural engineers to
actually sign off on the mock

01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:32.750
actually sign off on the mock
 

01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:34.600
actually sign off on the mock
as opposed to the structural drawing so

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:34.610
as opposed to the structural drawing so
 

01:45:34.610 --> 01:45:36.610
as opposed to the structural drawing so
that we could again kind of push this

01:45:36.610 --> 01:45:36.620
that we could again kind of push this
 

01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:39.880
that we could again kind of push this
question of lightness even further and

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:39.890
question of lightness even further and
 

01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:41.920
question of lightness even further and
then this looks like Tom Sawyer and

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:41.930
then this looks like Tom Sawyer and
 

01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:43.690
then this looks like Tom Sawyer and
Huckleberry Finn but this is how they

01:45:43.690 --> 01:45:43.700
Huckleberry Finn but this is how they
 

01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:46.030
Huckleberry Finn but this is how they
got all the sips structurally insulated

01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.040
got all the sips structurally insulated
 

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:50.410
got all the sips structurally insulated

the island then have to be carried to

01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:52.760
the island then have to be carried to
 

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:56.860
the island then have to be carried to
the actual site itself and then here

01:45:56.860 --> 01:45:56.870
the actual site itself and then here
 

01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:58.450
the actual site itself and then here
you're seeing the actual building where

01:45:58.450 --> 01:45:58.460
you're seeing the actual building where
 

01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:00.520
you're seeing the actual building where
you're reading the porch and the sense

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:00.530
you're reading the porch and the sense
 

01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:02.830
you're reading the porch and the sense
of how it's actually both connected but

01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840
of how it's actually both connected but
 

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:05.320
of how it's actually both connected but
also hovering above this ancient rock

rethought and actually used a gained in
 

01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:38.890
rethought and actually used a gained in
a quite a different way so here we

01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:38.900
a quite a different way so here we
 

01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:41.770
a quite a different way so here we
actually have a curving wood ceiling and

01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:41.780
actually have a curving wood ceiling and
 

01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.810
actually have a curving wood ceiling and
only possible only possible in this

this area to expect something like this
 

01:46:59.810 --> 01:47:02.230
this area to expect something like this
from local craftsmen is kind of a

01:47:02.230 --> 01:47:02.240
from local craftsmen is kind of a
 

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.030
from local craftsmen is kind of a
problematic condition and so we have to

01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040
problematic condition and so we have to
 

01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:06.790
problematic condition and so we have to
rethink in effect the local condition in

01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800
rethink in effect the local condition in
 

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.710
rethink in effect the local condition in
relation to our desire for a kind of

01:47:08.710 --> 01:47:08.720
relation to our desire for a kind of
 

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.840
relation to our desire for a kind of
level of refinement and worked with

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:10.850
level of refinement and worked with
 

01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:13.510
level of refinement and worked with
local craftsmen as well as these brought

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520
local craftsmen as well as these brought
 

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.640
local craftsmen as well as these brought
in pieces and did a hybrid combined

01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:15.650
in pieces and did a hybrid combined
 

01:47:15.650 --> 01:47:18.880
in pieces and did a hybrid combined
condition and then framing views of the

the angle of the Sun being able to
modify and amplify the space itself and

01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:47.350
modify and amplify the space itself and
 

01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:49.980
modify and amplify the space itself and
then the next experiment is a kind of

01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:49.990
then the next experiment is a kind of
 

01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:55.790
then the next experiment is a kind of
one where we worked on a project now

01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800
one where we worked on a project now
 

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.380
one where we worked on a project now
1994 a little red house it's the little

01:47:58.380 --> 01:47:58.390
1994 a little red house it's the little
 

01:47:58.390 --> 01:48:00.720
1994 a little red house it's the little
red house that could we designed in

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:00.730
red house that could we designed in
 

01:48:00.730 --> 01:48:03.420
red house that could we designed in
Toronto again in a back alley for an

01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:03.430
Toronto again in a back alley for an
 

01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:06.210
Toronto again in a back alley for an
architect who was our client clad in red

01:48:06.210 --> 01:48:06.220
architect who was our client clad in red
 

01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:10.800
architect who was our client clad in red
plywood and about 10 years later the

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:10.810
plywood and about 10 years later the
 

01:48:10.810 --> 01:48:13.620
plywood and about 10 years later the
same client came back to us and asked us

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:13.630
same client came back to us and asked us
 

01:48:13.630 --> 01:48:15.600
same client came back to us and asked us
if we would design a studio and we have

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:15.610
if we would design a studio and we have
 

01:48:15.610 --> 01:48:18.570
if we would design a studio and we have
Qi now have about four projects that are

01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:18.580
Qi now have about four projects that are
 

01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:20.520
Qi now have about four projects that are
these kind of pairs where we did

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:20.530
these kind of pairs where we did
 

01:48:20.530 --> 01:48:22.200
these kind of pairs where we did
something a while ago and then we do

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:22.210
something a while ago and then we do
 

01:48:22.210 --> 01:48:24.830
something a while ago and then we do
something again and it's a kind of odd

01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840
something again and it's a kind of odd
 

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:26.490
something again and it's a kind of odd
phenomena to actually have a

01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:26.500
phenomena to actually have a
 

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:28.830
phenomena to actually have a
conversation with yourself so the idea

01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:28.840
conversation with yourself so the idea
 

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:30.600
conversation with yourself so the idea
of so you're seeing a glimpse of the

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:30.610
of so you're seeing a glimpse of the
 

01:48:30.610 --> 01:48:32.730
of so you're seeing a glimpse of the
early red house and then the newest

01:48:32.730 --> 01:48:32.740
early red house and then the newest
 

01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:34.500
early red house and then the newest
piece that we did on the same property

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:34.510
piece that we did on the same property
 

01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:37.620
piece that we did on the same property
for the same client and so this is a

01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:37.630
for the same client and so this is a
 

01:48:37.630 --> 01:48:40.740
for the same client and so this is a
client who is an architect archivist and

01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:40.750
client who is an architect archivist and
 

01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:42.960
client who is an architect archivist and
so here is a kind of one room and we

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:42.970
so here is a kind of one room and we
 

01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:44.430
so here is a kind of one room and we
actually applied for a building permit

01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:44.440
actually applied for a building permit
 

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:47.430
actually applied for a building permit
for a garage and but he doesn't drive

01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440
for a garage and but he doesn't drive
 

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:51.330
for a garage and but he doesn't drive
and so hence you get the studio so part

01:48:51.330 --> 01:48:51.340
and so hence you get the studio so part
 

01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:53.310
and so hence you get the studio so part
of it was a whole experiment in light

01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320
of it was a whole experiment in light
 

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.680
of it was a whole experiment in light
one of the things he wanted was he has a

one of the things he wanted was he has a
large what he calls a working reference

01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:57.670
large what he calls a working reference
 

01:48:57.670 --> 01:48:59.760

architectural posters and wanted both

01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760
architectural posters and wanted both

and so because this was a garage we

01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:12.130
and so because this was a garage we
 

01:49:12.130 --> 01:49:13.830
and so because this was a garage we
could build it on the property line a

01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840
could build it on the property line a
 

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.380
could build it on the property line a
very low budget and a series of little

01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:16.390
very low budget and a series of little
 

01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:19.680
very low budget and a series of little
light coffers with a very thin skylight

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:19.690
light coffers with a very thin skylight
 

01:49:19.690 --> 01:49:22.350
light coffers with a very thin skylight
and the thickness of the wall actually

01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360
and the thickness of the wall actually
 

01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:25.230
and the thickness of the wall actually
changes on every elevation so this is

01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:25.240
changes on every elevation so this is
 

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.940
changes on every elevation so this is
the South elevation and the thinnest

a storage of either images or books and
then garden store

01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:53.640
then garden store

outside and then a sense of the kind of
 

01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:01.970
outside and then a sense of the kind of
experience of this kind of light filled

01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980
experience of this kind of light filled
 

01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:05.030

room but with no direct light itself and
 

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:06.950
room but with no direct light itself and
in a way for us that was a really

01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960
in a way for us that was a really
 

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:10.180
in a way for us that was a really
interesting ability in a very low-budget

01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:10.190
interesting ability in a very low-budget
 

01:50:10.190 --> 01:50:13.400
interesting ability in a very low-budget
small project to really be able to

01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:13.410
small project to really be able to
 

01:50:13.410 --> 01:50:15.380
small project to really be able to
explore a kind of idea of light that we

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:15.390
explore a kind of idea of light that we
 

01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:17.750
explore a kind of idea of light that we
had for another project that we were

01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760
had for another project that we were
 

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.520
had for another project that we were
working on so again this reciprocity

01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:19.530
working on so again this reciprocity
 

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:22.130
working on so again this reciprocity
between one thing at a small scale

01:50:22.130 --> 01:50:22.140
between one thing at a small scale
 

01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:24.530
between one thing at a small scale
actually informing something at a larger

01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:24.540
actually informing something at a larger
 

01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:27.140
actually informing something at a larger
scale and it was wonderful in the

01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:27.150
scale and it was wonderful in the
 

01:50:27.150 --> 01:50:28.910
scale and it was wonderful in the
beginning to hear I'm Stan Lee talk

01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920
beginning to hear I'm Stan Lee talk
 

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.920
beginning to hear I'm Stan Lee talk
about a synagogue because we were

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:30.930
about a synagogue because we were
 

01:50:30.930 --> 01:50:32.900
about a synagogue because we were
actually fortunate to be able to also

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:32.910
actually fortunate to be able to also
 

01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:35.150
actually fortunate to be able to also
design a synagogue and I think went

01:50:35.150 --> 01:50:35.160
design a synagogue and I think went
 

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.740
design a synagogue and I think went
through many of the kind of early

01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:36.750
through many of the kind of early
 

01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:39.110
through many of the kind of early
research where there's no building type

01:50:39.110 --> 01:50:39.120
research where there's no building type
 

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.750
research where there's no building type
there's no requirements there's very few

01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760
there's no requirements there's very few
 

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.360
there's no requirements there's very few
things that you really have to do to

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:44.370
things that you really have to do to
 

01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:46.550
things that you really have to do to
design a synagogue and it was for a

01:50:46.550 --> 01:50:46.560
design a synagogue and it was for a
 

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:49.640
design a synagogue and it was for a
reformed congregation in Portland Maine

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:49.650
reformed congregation in Portland Maine
 

01:50:49.650 --> 01:50:52.070
reformed congregation in Portland Maine
and I think that one of the questions

01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080
and I think that one of the questions
 

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:55.490
and I think that one of the questions
they had was about light itself and we

01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:55.500
they had was about light itself and we
 

01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:57.830
they had was about light itself and we
were able to observe a kind of sunrise

01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840
were able to observe a kind of sunrise
 

01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:00.530
were able to observe a kind of sunrise
and an early morning ceremony and this

01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:00.540
and an early morning ceremony and this
 

01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:02.000
and an early morning ceremony and this
question of light was a kind of

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:02.010
question of light was a kind of
 

01:51:02.010 --> 01:51:03.860
question of light was a kind of
preoccupation for us so here's a very

01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:03.870
preoccupation for us so here's a very
 

01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:06.440
preoccupation for us so here's a very
early sketch thinking about the light as

01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:06.450
early sketch thinking about the light as
 

01:51:06.450 --> 01:51:10.730
early sketch thinking about the light as
it would come in during sunset and then

01:51:10.730 --> 01:51:10.740
it would come in during sunset and then
 

01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:12.620
it would come in during sunset and then
a kind of early study model actually

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:12.630
a kind of early study model actually
 

01:51:12.630 --> 01:51:14.780
a kind of early study model actually
exploring again this very question of

01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:14.790
exploring again this very question of
 

01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:17.180
exploring again this very question of
light and the kind of idea about how

01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:17.190
light and the kind of idea about how
 

01:51:17.190 --> 01:51:19.790
light and the kind of idea about how
someone who arrives for a Friday evening

01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800
someone who arrives for a Friday evening
 

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.950
someone who arrives for a Friday evening
service but also shows up for the

01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960
service but also shows up for the
 

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:24.260
service but also shows up for the
Saturday morning service in the same

01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:24.270
Saturday morning service in the same
 

01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:26.510
Saturday morning service in the same
space actually understands the

01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520
space actually understands the
 

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:28.730
space actually understands the
transformative aspect of the space and

01:51:28.730 --> 01:51:28.740
transformative aspect of the space and
 

01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:31.870
transformative aspect of the space and
maybe it's only because of the light

01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:31.880
maybe it's only because of the light
 

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:34.550
maybe it's only because of the light
again a kind of prospective study and

01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560
again a kind of prospective study and

this kind of idea of journey I think is
 

01:51:55.530 --> 01:51:58.420
this kind of idea of journey I think is
very much part of our kind of interest a

you're looking at the social hall which
is part of this extended space and this

is part of this extended space and this
 

01:53:25.770 --> 01:53:27.110
is part of this extended space and this
is actually the first time we've ever

01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:27.120
is actually the first time we've ever
 

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:29.030
is actually the first time we've ever
shown this project it was finished about

01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040
shown this project it was finished about
 

01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:31.370
shown this project it was finished about
a year ago but we're waiting for the

01:53:31.370 --> 01:53:31.380
a year ago but we're waiting for the
 

01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:34.250
a year ago but we're waiting for the
landscape to kind of develop and so

01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:34.260
landscape to kind of develop and so
 

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:36.170
landscape to kind of develop and so
these photographs were shot really

01:53:36.170 --> 01:53:36.180
these photographs were shot really
 

01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:39.680
these photographs were shot really
recently and the first time I've seen

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:39.690
recently and the first time I've seen
 

01:53:39.690 --> 01:53:43.160
recently and the first time I've seen
them big so here you are looking at the

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:43.170
them big so here you are looking at the
 

01:53:43.170 --> 01:53:45.260
them big so here you are looking at the
exterior cladding and so you're actually

01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:45.270
exterior cladding and so you're actually
 

01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:48.110
exterior cladding and so you're actually
seeing horizontal Cypress that's being

01:53:48.110 --> 01:53:48.120
seeing horizontal Cypress that's being
 

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.820
seeing horizontal Cypress that's being
used and the idea is that it'll weather

01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:49.830
used and the idea is that it'll weather
 

01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:51.440
used and the idea is that it'll weather
gray so they don't actually have to

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:51.450
gray so they don't actually have to
 

01:53:51.450 --> 01:53:53.420
gray so they don't actually have to
paint or maintain it and then you're

01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:53.430
paint or maintain it and then you're
 

01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:55.730
paint or maintain it and then you're
looking at the skylight but above it the

01:53:55.730 --> 01:53:55.740
looking at the skylight but above it the
 

01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:57.530
looking at the skylight but above it the
clerestory windows and then you're

01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:57.540
clerestory windows and then you're
 

01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:00.590
clerestory windows and then you're
actually seeing there is a skylight on

01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600
actually seeing there is a skylight on
 

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:02.540
actually seeing there is a skylight on
top of that so you're getting light in

01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:02.550
top of that so you're getting light in
 

01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:05.660
top of that so you're getting light in
these baffles from from both the side

01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:05.670
these baffles from from both the side
 

01:54:05.670 --> 01:54:08.150
these baffles from from both the side
but also above and they become the way

01:54:08.150 --> 01:54:08.160
but also above and they become the way
 

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:09.980
but also above and they become the way
that depending on the time of the day

01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:09.990
that depending on the time of the day
 

01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:12.080
that depending on the time of the day
that you're there you register the light

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:12.090
that you're there you register the light
 

01:54:12.090 --> 01:54:15.380
that you're there you register the light
in front or behind of the back

01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:15.390
in front or behind of the back
 

01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:17.630
in front or behind of the back
and again here you're reading this kind

01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:17.640
and again here you're reading this kind
 

01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:19.610
and again here you're reading this kind
of condition and I mean it was

01:54:19.610 --> 01:54:19.620
of condition and I mean it was
 

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:22.160
of condition and I mean it was
interesting to sort of hear and see the

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:22.170
interesting to sort of hear and see the
 

01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:24.500
interesting to sort of hear and see the
images of San Francisco because Portland

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:24.510
images of San Francisco because Portland
 

01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:26.720
images of San Francisco because Portland
Maine is very much it has a very brick

01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:26.730
Maine is very much it has a very brick
 

01:54:26.730 --> 01:54:29.690
Maine is very much it has a very brick
core the working port but men should the

01:54:29.690 --> 01:54:29.700
core the working port but men should the
 

01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:32.930
core the working port but men should the
residential fabric is clabber as as the

01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940
residential fabric is clabber as as the
 

01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:35.209
residential fabric is clabber as as the
kind of New England area is and so this

01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:35.219
kind of New England area is and so this
 

01:54:35.219 --> 01:54:36.940
kind of New England area is and so this
question of embracing the light

01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:36.950
question of embracing the light
 

01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:39.020
question of embracing the light
understanding the light both a kind of

01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:39.030
understanding the light both a kind of
 

01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:42.110
understanding the light both a kind of
exterior condition and then also an

01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:42.120
exterior condition and then also an
 

01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.700
exterior condition and then also an
interior condition so here's that

01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:43.710
interior condition so here's that
 

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:46.130
interior condition so here's that
hallway leading you from the entry

01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:46.140
hallway leading you from the entry
 

01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:49.640
hallway leading you from the entry
toward the sanctuary itself and then

01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:49.650
toward the sanctuary itself and then
 

01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:51.440
toward the sanctuary itself and then
when you enter again this question of

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:51.450
when you enter again this question of
 

01:54:51.450 --> 01:54:53.870
when you enter again this question of
light and the way that the combination

01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:53.880
light and the way that the combination
 

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:56.120
light and the way that the combination
of the clerestory versus and the

01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:56.130
of the clerestory versus and the
 

01:54:56.130 --> 01:54:58.670
of the clerestory versus and the
skylight together and these kind of

01:54:58.670 --> 01:54:58.680
skylight together and these kind of
 

01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:01.490
skylight together and these kind of
tilted baffles actually provide a kind

01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:01.500
tilted baffles actually provide a kind
 

01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.500
tilted baffles actually provide a kind
of register understanding of the light

01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:03.510
of register understanding of the light
 

01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:05.390
of register understanding of the light
and they're actually times that the

01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400
and they're actually times that the
 

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:07.340
and they're actually times that the
congregation is there especially during

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:07.350
congregation is there especially during
 

01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:10.430
congregation is there especially during
high holidays for a whole day or a day

01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440
high holidays for a whole day or a day
 

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:13.280
high holidays for a whole day or a day
and a half and so this kind of reading

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:13.290
and a half and so this kind of reading
 

01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:15.200
and a half and so this kind of reading
of the space through the light is

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:15.210
of the space through the light is
 

01:55:15.210 --> 01:55:17.660
of the space through the light is
actually part of the kind of experience

01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:17.670
actually part of the kind of experience
 

01:55:17.670 --> 01:55:21.470
actually part of the kind of experience
itself so when it is a high holiday the

01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480

kind of viewing of the light and this
changing quality and so the kind of idea

01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:03.820
changing quality and so the kind of idea
 

01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.670
changing quality and so the kind of idea
that almost becomes a calendar to

this kind of section which steps down
 

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.660
this kind of section which steps down
and so when you enter the project you're

01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:34.670
and so when you enter the project you're
 

01:58:34.670 --> 01:58:36.340
and so when you enter the project you're
actually viewing it from an upper level

01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:36.350
actually viewing it from an upper level
 

01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:38.830

which is obscured and we use fiberglass

01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:38.840
which is obscured and we use fiberglass
 

01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:41.530
which is obscured and we use fiberglass
and then you come down to actually be in

01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:41.540
and then you come down to actually be in
 

01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:43.510
and then you come down to actually be in
a reflecting pool that's almost as big

01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520
a reflecting pool that's almost as big
 

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:46.990
a reflecting pool that's almost as big
as the actual house itself so here

01:58:46.990 --> 01:58:47.000
as the actual house itself so here
 

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.340
as the actual house itself so here
you're actually seeing this kind of

01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:48.350
you're actually seeing this kind of
 

01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:50.290
you're actually seeing this kind of
obscuring of the landscape and this was

01:58:50.290 --> 01:58:50.300
obscuring of the landscape and this was
 

01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:52.150
obscuring of the landscape and this was
a kind of this isn't a system we just

01:58:52.150 --> 01:58:52.160
a kind of this isn't a system we just
 

01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:55.360
a kind of this isn't a system we just
used two layers of this fiberglass with

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:55.370
used two layers of this fiberglass with
 

01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:57.220
used two layers of this fiberglass with
an airspace in between it was a kind of

01:58:57.220 --> 01:58:57.230
an airspace in between it was a kind of
 

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:59.709
an airspace in between it was a kind of
summer project and so we experimented

01:58:59.709 --> 01:58:59.719
summer project and so we experimented
 

01:58:59.719 --> 01:59:01.720
summer project and so we experimented
with this kind of way of obscuring the

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:01.730
with this kind of way of obscuring the
 

01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:04.510
with this kind of way of obscuring the
landscape to then allow you to come down

01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:04.520
landscape to then allow you to come down
 

01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:07.150
landscape to then allow you to come down
and to be in the landscape and then even

01:59:07.150 --> 01:59:07.160
and to be in the landscape and then even
 

01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:08.560
and to be in the landscape and then even
though you're on an island you would

01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:08.570
though you're on an island you would
 

01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:09.760
though you're on an island you would
think you would get to build really

01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:09.770
think you would get to build really
 

01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:11.979
think you would get to build really
close to the water but all the

01:59:11.979 --> 01:59:11.989
close to the water but all the
 

01:59:11.989 --> 01:59:14.260
close to the water but all the
regulations prevent you from doing so so

01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:14.270
regulations prevent you from doing so so
 

01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:16.600
regulations prevent you from doing so so
you end up being having setbacks and so

01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:16.610
you end up being having setbacks and so
 

01:59:16.610 --> 01:59:19.180
you end up being having setbacks and so

the reflecting pool actually creates the
 

01:59:19.190 --> 01:59:21.970
the reflecting pool actually creates the
idea of island and makes it a reality in

idea of island and makes it a reality in
 

01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:24.430
idea of island and makes it a reality in
the project and so here you are in the

01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:24.440
the project and so here you are in the

kind of thing where we said oh that was
 

02:01:10.230 --> 02:01:12.380
kind of thing where we said oh that was
an easy thing and took us quite a while

you sort of process and so early study

02:01:24.590 --> 02:01:24.600
you sort of process and so early study

you sort of process and so early study
models and we work a lot in physical

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:26.970

acquisitions developing specific aspects
of the project and then the idea of

02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:46.650
of the project and then the idea of
 

02:01:46.650 --> 02:01:48.950
of the project and then the idea of
section which is again something that

02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960
section which is again something that
 

02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:50.870
section which is again something that
hasn't really been discussed in the kind

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880
hasn't really been discussed in the kind
 

02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:52.460
hasn't really been discussed in the kind
of numerous points that have been made

02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:52.470
of numerous points that have been made
 

02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:55.370
of numerous points that have been made
but is actually a game part of what all

02:01:55.370 --> 02:01:55.380
but is actually a game part of what all
 

02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:57.800
but is actually a game part of what all
of us do and is a kind of maybe for us

02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:57.810
of us do and is a kind of maybe for us

the section is more important than the

02:01:59.720 --> 02:01:59.730
the section is more important than the
 

02:01:59.730 --> 02:02:02.930
the section is more important than the
plan or the plans look fairly simple and

02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:02.940
plan or the plans look fairly simple and
 

02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:04.670
plan or the plans look fairly simple and
straightforward but then how they're

02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:04.680
straightforward but then how they're
 

02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:07.640
straightforward but then how they're
realized in section for us becomes part

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:07.650
realized in section for us becomes part
 

02:02:07.650 --> 02:02:10.190
realized in section for us becomes part
of the kind of the pleasure of working

02:02:10.190 --> 02:02:10.200
of the kind of the pleasure of working
 

02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:12.200
of the kind of the pleasure of working
through the architecture so here you see

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:12.210
through the architecture so here you see
 

02:02:12.210 --> 02:02:14.180
through the architecture so here you see
a project where the kind of two-story

02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:14.190
a project where the kind of two-story
 

02:02:14.190 --> 02:02:16.490
a project where the kind of two-story
section from here and then down the hill

02:02:16.490 --> 02:02:16.500
section from here and then down the hill
 

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.680
section from here and then down the hill
and it keeps going and even though the

02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:18.690
and it keeps going and even though the
 

02:02:18.690 --> 02:02:20.660
and it keeps going and even though the
drawing stops the property and the

02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:20.670
drawing stops the property and the
 

02:02:20.670 --> 02:02:24.230
drawing stops the property and the
ravine continue beyond and again the

02:02:24.230 --> 02:02:24.240
ravine continue beyond and again the
 

02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:26.000
ravine continue beyond and again the
section where you come in at an upper

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:26.010
section where you come in at an upper
 

02:02:26.010 --> 02:02:28.610
section where you come in at an upper
level and descend down to in effect what

02:02:28.610 --> 02:02:28.620
level and descend down to in effect what
 

02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:31.640
level and descend down to in effect what
is the main performance space or 150 of

02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:31.650
is the main performance space or 150 of
 

02:02:31.650 --> 02:02:33.920
is the main performance space or 150 of
your closest friends and then descending

02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:33.930
your closest friends and then descending
 

02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:36.230
your closest friends and then descending
down again almost into the ravine so the

02:02:36.230 --> 02:02:36.240
down again almost into the ravine so the
 

02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:37.730
down again almost into the ravine so the
idea that the journey through the

02:02:37.730 --> 02:02:37.740
idea that the journey through the
 

02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:39.770
idea that the journey through the
project should actually feel is that

02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:39.780
project should actually feel is that
 

02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:41.540
project should actually feel is that
you've entered a ravine whether or not

you've entered a ravine whether or not
 

02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:43.610
you've entered a ravine whether or not
you go outside is a kind of totally

you go outside is a kind of totally
 

02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:46.250
you go outside is a kind of totally
separate issue and then I have a series

02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:46.260
separate issue and then I have a series
 

02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:48.110
separate issue and then I have a series
of plans that go from the lowest level

02:02:48.110 --> 02:02:48.120
of plans that go from the lowest level
 

02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:50.570
of plans that go from the lowest level
up so you're kind of reading an effect

02:02:50.570 --> 02:02:50.580
up so you're kind of reading an effect
 

02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:52.439
up so you're kind of reading an effect
or kind of pool

02:02:52.439 --> 02:02:52.449

02:02:58.649 --> 02:02:58.659
there's a study and gallery areas that
 

02:02:58.659 --> 02:03:01.020
there's a study and gallery areas that
skirt the edges and rooms that are more

02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:01.030
skirt the edges and rooms that are more
 

02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:03.259
skirt the edges and rooms that are more
pushed into the side of the hill and

02:03:03.259 --> 02:03:03.269
pushed into the side of the hill and
 

02:03:03.269 --> 02:03:05.489
pushed into the side of the hill and
then as you go up this is the main

02:03:05.489 --> 02:03:05.499
then as you go up this is the main
 

02:03:05.499 --> 02:03:07.350
then as you go up this is the main
performance space with kind of this

02:03:07.350 --> 02:03:07.360
performance space with kind of this
 

02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:09.839
performance space with kind of this
undulating edge really almost being a

02:03:09.839 --> 02:03:09.849
undulating edge really almost being a
 

02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:13.080
undulating edge really almost being a
contour line pushed out to the edge of

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:13.090
contour line pushed out to the edge of
 

02:03:13.090 --> 02:03:15.060
contour line pushed out to the edge of
the building and then again back of

02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:15.070
the building and then again back of
 

02:03:15.070 --> 02:03:18.149
the building and then again back of
house spaces and then the kind of main

02:03:18.149 --> 02:03:18.159
house spaces and then the kind of main
 

02:03:18.159 --> 02:03:20.069
house spaces and then the kind of main
entry level where you enter and then

02:03:20.069 --> 02:03:20.079
entry level where you enter and then
 

02:03:20.079 --> 02:03:22.290
entry level where you enter and then
descend down with these upper-level

02:03:22.290 --> 02:03:22.300
descend down with these upper-level
 

02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:24.330
descend down with these upper-level
spaces almost reading as balconies

02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:24.340
spaces almost reading as balconies
 

02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:28.049
spaces almost reading as balconies
during a performance and this drawing is

02:03:28.049 --> 02:03:28.059
during a performance and this drawing is
 

02:03:28.059 --> 02:03:29.850
during a performance and this drawing is
an early study but again if you think

02:03:29.850 --> 02:03:29.860
an early study but again if you think
 

02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:31.949
an early study but again if you think
about the island house and the idea that

02:03:31.949 --> 02:03:31.959
about the island house and the idea that
 

02:03:31.959 --> 02:03:34.259
about the island house and the idea that
you don't actually see the entire

02:03:34.259 --> 02:03:34.269
you don't actually see the entire
 

02:03:34.269 --> 02:03:36.600
you don't actually see the entire
landscape at the beginning but then as

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:36.610
landscape at the beginning but then as
 

02:03:36.610 --> 02:03:38.879
landscape at the beginning but then as
you descend down it reveals itself and

02:03:38.879 --> 02:03:38.889
you descend down it reveals itself and
 

02:03:38.889 --> 02:03:41.339
you descend down it reveals itself and
then continues to reveal itself as you

02:03:41.339 --> 02:03:41.349
then continues to reveal itself as you
 

02:03:41.349 --> 02:03:42.899
then continues to reveal itself as you
move through the project and so I think

02:03:42.899 --> 02:03:42.909
move through the project and so I think
 

02:03:42.909 --> 02:03:45.060
move through the project and so I think
that was really the kind of idea from a

02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:45.070
that was really the kind of idea from a
 

02:03:45.070 --> 02:03:47.040
that was really the kind of idea from a
very small project that we actually took

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:47.050
very small project that we actually took
 

02:03:47.050 --> 02:03:49.799
very small project that we actually took
in it elaborated and so here you're

02:03:49.799 --> 02:03:49.809
in it elaborated and so here you're
 

02:03:49.809 --> 02:03:52.919
in it elaborated and so here you're
seeing the 97 fins that we used at the

02:03:52.919 --> 02:03:52.929
seeing the 97 fins that we used at the
 

02:03:52.929 --> 02:03:55.169
seeing the 97 fins that we used at the
kind of upper level and in a way this is

02:03:55.169 --> 02:03:55.179
kind of upper level and in a way this is
 

02:03:55.179 --> 02:03:57.029
kind of upper level and in a way this is
only possible because of computer

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:57.039
only possible because of computer
 

02:03:57.039 --> 02:03:58.919
only possible because of computer
fabrication and moving back and forth

02:03:58.919 --> 02:03:58.929
fabrication and moving back and forth
 

02:03:58.929 --> 02:04:02.339
fabrication and moving back and forth
between a kind of idea and very simple

02:04:02.339 --> 02:04:02.349
between a kind of idea and very simple
 

02:04:02.349 --> 02:04:04.439
between a kind of idea and very simple
hand models to kind of being able to

02:04:04.439 --> 02:04:04.449
hand models to kind of being able to
 

02:04:04.449 --> 02:04:07.140
hand models to kind of being able to
realize them in a kind of fabrication

02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:07.150
realize them in a kind of fabrication
 

02:04:07.150 --> 02:04:09.270
realize them in a kind of fabrication
format and to be able to do it in a way

02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280
format and to be able to do it in a way
 

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:12.120
format and to be able to do it in a way
that's actually affordable and in doable

02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:12.130
that's actually affordable and in doable
 

02:04:12.130 --> 02:04:14.489
that's actually affordable and in doable
so this kind of use and interest in kind

02:04:14.489 --> 02:04:14.499
so this kind of use and interest in kind
 

02:04:14.499 --> 02:04:16.439
so this kind of use and interest in kind
of it exploiting the technology in a

02:04:16.439 --> 02:04:16.449
of it exploiting the technology in a
 

02:04:16.449 --> 02:04:19.770
of it exploiting the technology in a
really positive way and here are sort of

02:04:19.770 --> 02:04:19.780
really positive way and here are sort of
 

02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:22.290
really positive way and here are sort of
some of the kind of different fins and

02:04:22.290 --> 02:04:22.300
some of the kind of different fins and
 

02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:24.270
some of the kind of different fins and
they all were fitted but each one

02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:24.280
they all were fitted but each one
 

02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:27.270
they all were fitted but each one
music going between the fabricator shop

02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.280
music going between the fabricator shop
 

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:29.759
music going between the fabricator shop
and the site and moving back and forth

02:04:29.759 --> 02:04:29.769
and the site and moving back and forth
 

02:04:29.769 --> 02:04:33.060
and the site and moving back and forth
and then here everyone bidding on the

02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:33.070
and then here everyone bidding on the
 

02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:35.640
and then here everyone bidding on the
fin package had to produce a fin so in a

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:35.650
fin package had to produce a fin so in a
 

02:04:35.650 --> 02:04:37.319
fin package had to produce a fin so in a
way it actually allowed us to do quality

02:04:37.319 --> 02:04:37.329
way it actually allowed us to do quality
 

02:04:37.329 --> 02:04:39.540
way it actually allowed us to do quality
control while we were looking at tenders

02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:39.550
control while we were looking at tenders
 

02:04:39.550 --> 02:04:41.850
control while we were looking at tenders
at the same time and it was amazing the

02:04:41.850 --> 02:04:41.860
at the same time and it was amazing the
 

02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:43.770
at the same time and it was amazing the
different approaches for the same thing

02:04:43.770 --> 02:04:43.780
different approaches for the same thing
 

02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:44.969
different approaches for the same thing
you would have thought it would be

02:04:44.969 --> 02:04:44.979
you would have thought it would be
 

02:04:44.979 --> 02:04:47.040
you would have thought it would be
really similar but they were actually

02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:47.050
really similar but they were actually
 

02:04:47.050 --> 02:04:49.640
really similar but they were actually
more different than you would think and

02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:49.650
more different than you would think and
 

02:04:49.650 --> 02:04:52.560
more different than you would think and
then at the lower level below that

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:52.570
then at the lower level below that
 

02:04:52.570 --> 02:04:54.449
then at the lower level below that
there's a more standardized spin so

02:04:54.449 --> 02:04:54.459
there's a more standardized spin so
 

02:04:54.459 --> 02:04:56.219
there's a more standardized spin so
you're actually seeing in effect the

02:04:56.219 --> 02:04:56.229
you're actually seeing in effect the
 

02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:58.080
you're actually seeing in effect the
kind of assembly of these elements the

02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:58.090
kind of assembly of these elements the
 

02:04:58.090 --> 02:04:59.850
kind of assembly of these elements the
structure and one of the things that

02:04:59.850 --> 02:04:59.860
structure and one of the things that
 

02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:01.379
structure and one of the things that
happens in much of North American

02:05:01.379 --> 02:05:01.389
happens in much of North American
 

02:05:01.389 --> 02:05:02.090
happens in much of North American
construction

02:05:02.090 --> 02:05:02.100
construction
 

02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:04.490
construction
there's these layers of construction so

02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.500
there's these layers of construction so
 

02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:06.470
there's these layers of construction so
it's like wearing different coats for

02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480
it's like wearing different coats for
 

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:08.420
it's like wearing different coats for
different kind of sporting events and

02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:08.430
different kind of sporting events and
 

02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:10.640
different kind of sporting events and
thinner layers and thicker layers and we

02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:10.650
thinner layers and thicker layers and we
 

02:05:10.650 --> 02:05:12.980
thinner layers and thicker layers and we
wanted you to be it's had to you know

02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:12.990
wanted you to be it's had to you know
 

02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:15.440
wanted you to be it's had to you know
clearly operate within that realm but

02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:15.450
clearly operate within that realm but
 

02:05:15.450 --> 02:05:17.120
clearly operate within that realm but
for you to be unaware of that so what

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:17.130
for you to be unaware of that so what
 

02:05:17.130 --> 02:05:19.040
for you to be unaware of that so what
happens is that you actually don't read

02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:19.050
happens is that you actually don't read
 

02:05:19.050 --> 02:05:20.840
happens is that you actually don't read
a window frame the frame actually gets

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:20.850
a window frame the frame actually gets
 

02:05:20.850 --> 02:05:23.810
a window frame the frame actually gets
slotted into this element the fin is

02:05:23.810 --> 02:05:23.820
slotted into this element the fin is
 

02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:26.060
slotted into this element the fin is
actually protruding into the room and

02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:26.070
actually protruding into the room and
 

02:05:26.070 --> 02:05:28.910
actually protruding into the room and
there's an EP cap on the exterior that

02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920
there's an EP cap on the exterior that
 

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:31.250
there's an EP cap on the exterior that
actually provides the actual cladding on

02:05:31.250 --> 02:05:31.260
actually provides the actual cladding on
 

02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:34.490
actually provides the actual cladding on
the outside of the building so here

02:05:34.490 --> 02:05:34.500
the outside of the building so here
 

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:35.720
the outside of the building so here
you're seeing a kind of full-size

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:35.730
you're seeing a kind of full-size
 

02:05:35.730 --> 02:05:37.640
you're seeing a kind of full-size
mock-up or you're seeing the kind of

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:37.650
mock-up or you're seeing the kind of
 

02:05:37.650 --> 02:05:40.220
mock-up or you're seeing the kind of
shaped fin that is the more standardized

02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:40.230
shaped fin that is the more standardized
 

02:05:40.230 --> 02:05:42.770
shaped fin that is the more standardized
spin the IPE cap and the way that the

02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:42.780
spin the IPE cap and the way that the
 

02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:45.140
spin the IPE cap and the way that the
glass slips in so that all that assembly

02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:45.150
glass slips in so that all that assembly
 

02:05:45.150 --> 02:05:48.680
glass slips in so that all that assembly
is there but just not expressed and then

02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:48.690
is there but just not expressed and then
 

02:05:48.690 --> 02:05:51.500
is there but just not expressed and then
a kind of series of templates that are

02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:51.510
a kind of series of templates that are
 

02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:54.320
a kind of series of templates that are
really part of a game this time that we

02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:54.330
really part of a game this time that we
 

02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:57.050
really part of a game this time that we
are in as architects or the ability to

02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:57.060
are in as architects or the ability to
 

02:05:57.060 --> 02:05:59.150
are in as architects or the ability to
use the computer to do all kinds of

02:05:59.150 --> 02:05:59.160
use the computer to do all kinds of
 

02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:00.950
use the computer to do all kinds of
things that would be quite expensive or

02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960
things that would be quite expensive or
 

02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:02.840
things that would be quite expensive or
difficult in another time

02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:02.850
difficult in another time
 

02:06:02.850 --> 02:06:04.670
difficult in another time
so this is actually a kind of metal

02:06:04.670 --> 02:06:04.680
so this is actually a kind of metal
 

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:07.130
so this is actually a kind of metal
template that was all laser-cut and

02:06:07.130 --> 02:06:07.140
template that was all laser-cut and
 

02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.770
template that was all laser-cut and
actually used to create this kind of

02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:09.780
actually used to create this kind of
 

02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:12.830
actually used to create this kind of
curving condition on the site itself so

02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840
curving condition on the site itself so
 

02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:14.450
curving condition on the site itself so
this kind of and we're sort of

02:06:14.450 --> 02:06:14.460
this kind of and we're sort of
 

02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:15.770
this kind of and we're sort of
fascinated and interested in these

02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:15.780
fascinated and interested in these
 

02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:17.930
fascinated and interested in these
interim pieces that are not the final

02:06:17.930 --> 02:06:17.940
interim pieces that are not the final
 

02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:19.850
interim pieces that are not the final
thing but they're kind of essential to

02:06:19.850 --> 02:06:19.860
thing but they're kind of essential to
 

02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:22.370
thing but they're kind of essential to
realizing the final thing in the way

02:06:22.370 --> 02:06:22.380
realizing the final thing in the way
 

02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:25.670
realizing the final thing in the way
that you imagine it and then the site

02:06:25.670 --> 02:06:25.680
that you imagine it and then the site
 

02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:27.860
that you imagine it and then the site
itself so the project itself is on this

02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:27.870
itself so the project itself is on this
 

02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:30.530

whole thing and it's quite narrow
 

02:10:20.570 --> 02:10:22.450
whole thing and it's quite narrow
because it really again is not a public

02:10:22.450 --> 02:10:22.460
because it really again is not a public
 

02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:25.210

much a way just to get to an upper level
 

02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:30.880
much a way just to get to an upper level
and then what happens is its impact is

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:30.890
and then what happens is its impact is
 

02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:33.310
and then what happens is its impact is

02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:02.680
breaks so there was a question about
maintenance and fixing the louvers are

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:02.690
maintenance and fixing the louvers are
 

02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:04.870
maintenance and fixing the louvers are
all fixed so they don't none of the move

02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880
all fixed so they don't none of the move
 

02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:08.049
all fixed so they don't none of the move
so you move in relation to them but they

02:13:08.049 --> 02:13:08.059
so you move in relation to them but they
 

02:13:08.059 --> 02:13:10.540
so you move in relation to them but they
are actually fixed both upper level ones

through this layering materials the most

02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:37.070
through this layering materials the most
 

02:13:37.070 --> 02:13:38.799
through this layering materials the most
important point in the building is that

02:13:38.799 --> 02:13:38.809
important point in the building is that
 

02:13:38.809 --> 02:13:40.899
important point in the building is that
membrane where the outside meets the

02:13:40.899 --> 02:13:40.909
membrane where the outside meets the
 

02:13:40.909 --> 02:13:43.270
membrane where the outside meets the
inside and so I'm seeing this very rich

02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280
inside and so I'm seeing this very rich
 

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:44.859
inside and so I'm seeing this very rich
sort of layering of like this

02:13:44.859 --> 02:13:44.869
sort of layering of like this
 

02:13:44.869 --> 02:13:46.720
sort of layering of like this
transparencies but then I'm wondering

02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:46.730
transparencies but then I'm wondering
 

02:13:46.730 --> 02:13:49.209
transparencies but then I'm wondering
how it does that transition happen like

02:13:49.209 --> 02:13:49.219
how it does that transition happen like
 

02:13:49.219 --> 02:13:52.000
how it does that transition happen like
sensient glass with snow behind it yeah

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:52.010
sensient glass with snow behind it yeah
 

02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:54.040
sensient glass with snow behind it yeah
so in a way I think the sections that I

02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:54.050
so in a way I think the sections that I
 

02:13:54.050 --> 02:13:56.919
so in a way I think the sections that I
showed the cutaways both the large-scale

02:13:56.919 --> 02:13:56.929
showed the cutaways both the large-scale
 

02:13:56.929 --> 02:13:59.530
showed the cutaways both the large-scale
working drawing details and then the

02:13:59.530 --> 02:13:59.540
working drawing details and then the
 

02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:02.169
working drawing details and then the
full-size mock-up were precisely trying

02:14:02.169 --> 02:14:02.179
full-size mock-up were precisely trying
 

02:14:02.179 --> 02:14:04.510
full-size mock-up were precisely trying
to show that where all those assemblies

02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:04.520
to show that where all those assemblies
 

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:06.160
to show that where all those assemblies
are there we live in a climate where you

02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:06.170
are there we live in a climate where you
 

02:14:06.170 --> 02:14:09.760
are there we live in a climate where you
have to build from minus 40 centigrade

02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:09.770
have to build from minus 40 centigrade
 

02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:12.760
have to build from minus 40 centigrade
to plus 40 centigrade that's the zone

02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:12.770
to plus 40 centigrade that's the zone
 

02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:15.640
to plus 40 centigrade that's the zone
that we have to kind of look after and

02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:15.650
that we have to kind of look after and
 

02:14:15.650 --> 02:14:19.180
that we have to kind of look after and
so it's not a it's not a kind of joke

02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:19.190
so it's not a it's not a kind of joke
 

02:14:19.190 --> 02:14:21.250
so it's not a it's not a kind of joke
it's like you as an architect it's a

02:14:21.250 --> 02:14:21.260
it's like you as an architect it's a
 

02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:22.930
it's like you as an architect it's a
kind of requirement that you address

02:14:22.930 --> 02:14:22.940
kind of requirement that you address
 

02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:24.760
kind of requirement that you address
that so what happens is that they're all

02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:24.770
that so what happens is that they're all
 

02:14:24.770 --> 02:14:28.089
that so what happens is that they're all
double glazed sealed units and you're

02:14:28.089 --> 02:14:28.099
double glazed sealed units and you're
 

02:14:28.099 --> 02:14:30.399
double glazed sealed units and you're
and they're actually capped in the kind

02:14:30.399 --> 02:14:30.409
and they're actually capped in the kind
 

02:14:30.409 --> 02:14:33.370
and they're actually capped in the kind
of in that detail you don't see or read

02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:33.380
of in that detail you don't see or read
 

02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:36.399
of in that detail you don't see or read
the frame of those windows but they're

02:14:36.399 --> 02:14:36.409
the frame of those windows but they're
 

02:14:36.409 --> 02:14:38.229
the frame of those windows but they're
actually embedded within the kind of

02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239
actually embedded within the kind of
 

02:14:38.239 --> 02:14:40.510
actually embedded within the kind of
assembly and so that's part of the kind

02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:40.520
assembly and so that's part of the kind
 

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:42.760
assembly and so that's part of the kind
of experiment for us of how to really

02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:42.770
of experiment for us of how to really
 

02:14:42.770 --> 02:14:44.370
of experiment for us of how to really
address our climatic zone

02:14:44.370 --> 02:14:44.380
address our climatic zone
 

02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:46.260
address our climatic zone
while actually having this kind of these

02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:46.270
while actually having this kind of these
 

02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:48.210
while actually having this kind of these
varying and different experiences at the

02:14:48.210 --> 02:14:48.220
varying and different experiences at the
 

02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:50.430
varying and different experiences at the
same time so it's both a challenge but

02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:50.440
same time so it's both a challenge but
 

02:14:50.440 --> 02:15:10.140
same time so it's both a challenge but
also an opportunity at the same time so

02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:10.150
also an opportunity at the same time so
 

02:15:10.150 --> 02:15:12.870
also an opportunity at the same time so
the question was about budget everyone

02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880
the question was about budget everyone
 

02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:15.120
