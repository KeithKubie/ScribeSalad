so we've alighted some of the details

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.290
so we've alighted some of the details
 

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.410
so we've alighted some of the details
here if you need to you can also you can

here if you need to you can also you can
 

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.780
here if you need to you can also you can
do that up in managed code in Java you

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:24.790
do that up in managed code in Java you
 

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.639
do that up in managed code in Java you
can also use that file descriptor to go

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:26.649
can also use that file descriptor to go
 

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:28.860
can also use that file descriptor to go
across J&amp;I and contribute data if you

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:28.870
across J&amp;I and contribute data if you
 

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.440
across J&amp;I and contribute data if you
have native code in your application at

some point we'll be finished with the
 

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.590
some point we'll be finished with the
file descriptor we'll close it and now

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600
file descriptor we'll close it and now
 

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.990
file descriptor we'll close it and now
it's time to reveal that to the other

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000
it's time to reveal that to the other
 

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.639
it's time to reveal that to the other
apps on the device and that's as simple

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:38.649
apps on the device and that's as simple
 

00:11:38.649 --> 00:11:40.620
apps on the device and that's as simple
as clearing out that content values

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:40.630
as clearing out that content values
 

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.170
as clearing out that content values
setting the is pending bit to zero and

setting the is pending bit to zero and
then calling content resolver dot update

00:11:45.569 --> 00:11:45.579
then calling content resolver dot update
 

00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:47.579
then calling content resolver dot update
once you make this call that's going to

00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:47.589
once you make this call that's going to
 

00:11:47.589 --> 00:11:49.199
once you make this call that's going to
cause it to become visible to the other

00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:49.209
cause it to become visible to the other
 

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.319
cause it to become visible to the other
apps on the device so that was a simple

one of those volume names it's easy to
 

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.730
one of those volume names it's easy to
start working with that collection using

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:00.740
start working with that collection using
 

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.190
start working with that collection using
the various get content URI methods that

images collection that will allow us to

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040
images collection that will allow us to
 

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.860
images collection that will allow us to
work with images that are present on

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:17.870
work with images that are present on
 

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.170

that secondary the storage device such
 

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.380
that secondary the storage device such
as an SD card so let's took a take a

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:23.390
as an SD card so let's took a take a
 

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.970
as an SD card so let's took a take a
look at an example of both of these

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:24.980
look at an example of both of these
 

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.790
look at an example of both of these
advanced concepts together in one one

advanced concepts together in one one
 

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.190
advanced concepts together in one one
example so the first thing we talked

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:30.200
example so the first thing we talked
 

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.199
example so the first thing we talked
about was that relative path being able

00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:32.209
about was that relative path being able
 

00:14:32.209 --> 00:14:34.090
about was that relative path being able
to influence where things land on disk

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.100
to influence where things land on disk
 

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.220
to influence where things land on disk
here we have a simple music file that

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:36.230
here we have a simple music file that
 

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.190
here we have a simple music file that
we're inserting my song mp3 um the

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:39.200
we're inserting my song mp3 um the
 

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.990
we're inserting my song mp3 um the
relative path here we're asking for it

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000
relative path here we're asking for it
 

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.600
relative path here we're asking for it
to be placed under music my artists my

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:43.610
to be placed under music my artists my
 

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.510
to be placed under music my artists my
album something worth noticing to call

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:46.520
album something worth noticing to call
 

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.699
album something worth noticing to call
back to a subs point that he made

00:14:48.699 --> 00:14:48.709

earlier one of our goals in queue is to

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.050
earlier one of our goals in queue is to
 

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.930
earlier one of our goals in queue is to
help ensure that the users content

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:52.940
help ensure that the users content
 

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.329
help ensure that the users content
content is organized on their device and

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:55.339
content is organized on their device and
 

00:14:55.339 --> 00:14:57.310
content is organized on their device and
so what this means that top-level

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320
so what this means that top-level
 

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.049
so what this means that top-level
directory we're going to help make sure

00:14:59.049 --> 00:14:59.059
directory we're going to help make sure
 

00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:00.549
directory we're going to help make sure
that it's placed in a reasonable

00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:00.559
that it's placed in a reasonable
 

00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:03.189
that it's placed in a reasonable
location so here we're inserting an mp3

00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199
location so here we're inserting an mp3
 

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:05.799
location so here we're inserting an mp3
file an audio file into the music

00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:05.809
file an audio file into the music
 

00:15:05.809 --> 00:15:08.019
file an audio file into the music
directory the top-level directory the OS

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:08.029
directory the top-level directory the OS
 

00:15:08.029 --> 00:15:09.609

is going to allow this because the

00:15:09.609 --> 00:15:09.619
is going to allow this because the
 

00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:11.349

content type makes sense

00:15:11.349 --> 00:15:11.359
content type makes sense
 

00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:14.349
content type makes sense
if for example we were trying to insert

00:15:14.349 --> 00:15:14.359
if for example we were trying to insert
 

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:17.169
if for example we were trying to insert
this mp3 file into the users pictures

00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:17.179
this mp3 file into the users pictures
 

00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:19.149
this mp3 file into the users pictures
collection that doesn't make sense

00:15:19.149 --> 00:15:19.159
collection that doesn't make sense
 

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:21.339
collection that doesn't make sense
that's disorganized and so the OS would

00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:21.349
that's disorganized and so the OS would
 

00:15:21.349 --> 00:15:23.769
that's disorganized and so the OS would
throw an exception back to you so just

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:23.779
throw an exception back to you so just
 

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:25.629
throw an exception back to you so just
those three common collection types that

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:28.029
those three common collection types that
we discussed audio video and images

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:28.039
we discussed audio video and images
 

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:30.309

and write access let's take a look at an

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:07.340
and write access let's take a look at an
 

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.790
and write access let's take a look at an
example here at the top we're trying

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:09.800
example here at the top we're trying
 

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.200
example here at the top we're trying
we're attempting to delete a specific

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:11.210
we're attempting to delete a specific
 

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.780
we're attempting to delete a specific
photo but we don't know we don't have to

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:13.790
photo but we don't know we don't have to
 

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.130
photo but we don't know we don't have to
know ahead of time if we have that

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:15.140
know ahead of time if we have that
 

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.320
know ahead of time if we have that
permission or not if we have the

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:17.330
permission or not if we have the
 

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.360
permission or not if we have the
permission the delete will succeed if we

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:19.370
permission the delete will succeed if we
 

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.160
permission the delete will succeed if we
don't it'll throw that recoverable

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:21.170
don't it'll throw that recoverable
 

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.710
don't it'll throw that recoverable
security exception back at us and it's

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720
security exception back at us and it's
 

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.780
security exception back at us and it's
up to us to involve the user and

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:25.790
up to us to involve the user and
 

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.120
up to us to involve the user and
whatever way is most appropriate in this

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.130
whatever way is most appropriate in this
 

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.650
whatever way is most appropriate in this
example on the code slide we're going to

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:29.660
example on the code slide we're going to
 

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.810
example on the code slide we're going to
be showing an alert dialog to the user

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:31.820
be showing an alert dialog to the user
 

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.690
be showing an alert dialog to the user
in our application on this alert dialog

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:34.700
in our application on this alert dialog
 

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.340
in our application on this alert dialog
when the user presses the button we're

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:36.350
when the user presses the button we're
 

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.780
when the user presses the button we're
going to launch that pending intent

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:37.790
going to launch that pending intent
 

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.330
going to launch that pending intent
that's included in that

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:39.340
that's included in that
 

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.620
that's included in that
exception which is going to show a

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:40.630
exception which is going to show a
 

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.060
exception which is going to show a
dialogue to the user letting them grant

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.070
dialogue to the user letting them grant
 

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.160
dialogue to the user letting them grant
that access to your application for that

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.170
that access to your application for that
 

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.280
that access to your application for that
specific item that you're interested in

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:46.290
specific item that you're interested in
 

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.900
specific item that you're interested in
so we get that exception there's a nice

in this case the open input stream for a

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:02.290
in this case the open input stream for a
 

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.890
in this case the open input stream for a
particular photo you can pass that into

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:04.900
particular photo you can pass that into
 

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.440

the exif interface that's a class that's
been in the OS for a couple years but

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:09.310
been in the OS for a couple years but
 

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:10.890
been in the OS for a couple years but
it's also available in the jetpack

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:10.900
it's also available in the jetpack

support libraries that will help decode
 

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.180
support libraries that will help decode
that information in the metadata and

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:15.190
that information in the metadata and
 

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.070
that information in the metadata and
give you access to that latitude

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080
give you access to that latitude
 

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.840

are these document providers and appear
 

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.470
are these document providers and appear
in the list right next to any of the

other storage locations that are
 

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.680
other storage locations that are
available to the user so we think it's

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:02.690
available to the user so we think it's
 

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.160
