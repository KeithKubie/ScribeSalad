00:00:00.853 --> 00:00:04.185
- [Voiceover] Which shows
the length of the rectangle

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:06.054
measured correctly?

00:00:06.054 --> 00:00:07.192
Alright.

00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:10.454
So here, we have this green rectangle,

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:12.083
and, let's see, how did we measure it?

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:14.986
We have one centimeter, right over here,

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:18.655
and then we put another
centimeter right over here.

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:20.953
And they say, "Two rulers

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:24.181
"measure the rectangle side-to-side."

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:25.551
Well this makes sense, 'cause we can say,

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:28.221
"Look, if from here to
here, from the beginning

00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:30.973
"of the rectangle to the
middle, is one centimeter,

00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:32.157
"and then it's another centimeter that

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.885
"gets us to the other
side, to the right side,

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:36.186
"then we know that this is going to be

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:37.915
"two centimeters long."

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:39.820
One, and two.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.758
So I'm pretty sure this
is measured correctly.

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:43.523
But let's just make
sure that the other two

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:46.925
don't really measure
the rectangle correctly.

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:51.186
So this one right over here,
you have one centimeter

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:53.020
and then another centimeter,
but you're leaving

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.924
a gap right over here.

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:57.258
And you can't leave a gap here, you wanna

00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:58.674
measure what this distance is.

00:00:58.674 --> 00:01:00.752
And you notice that this ends to the right

00:01:00.752 --> 00:01:02.761
of the right of the rectangle.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.955
So this isn't a good way of measuring it.

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:06.952
And this way, you're
not going all the way,

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:09.587
the entire length of the rectangle,

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:11.178
so this, you're coming up short.

00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:12.351
You need to measure the entire length.

00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:14.452
You need to start on the
left side, which they did,

00:01:14.452 --> 00:01:16.484
but you need to go all
the way, without any gaps,

00:01:16.484 --> 00:01:19.189
and without overlapping
the rulers in any way

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.095
to get to this side.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:21.917
So this isn't right either.

00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:23.717
So let's keep doing these.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:27.595
Which shows the length of the
eraser measured correctly?

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:30.044
So, this one, well once
again, there's some

00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:32.087
weirdness over here, I don't
even know what's happening.

00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:34.653
But the entire ruler
isn't even getting to the

00:01:34.653 --> 00:01:37.126
entire length of this rectangle.

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:38.995
So this isn't measured correctly.

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:42.013
And they say, "Two rulers
measure the eraser and overlap."

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:43.917
Oh, I see, this is kind of, the ruler's

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:45.380
a little bit transparent, so this one is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.052
overlapping with the one underneath.

00:01:47.052 --> 00:01:48.420
So you definitely don't wanna do that.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.127
You wanna put them
right next to each other

00:01:50.127 --> 00:01:51.393
without a gap.

00:01:51.393 --> 00:01:53.123
And you wanna get all the way to the edge

00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:55.549
of this rectangle.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.954
So this one, you have a gap, and you're

00:01:56.954 --> 00:02:00.379
actually going beyond the
edge of the rectangle.

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:01.528
So that's not good.

00:02:01.528 --> 00:02:04.152
Here, you have no overlap,
and no gap right over here.

00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:05.917
They're just right next to each other.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.808
And we're starting at the
left side of this rectangle.

00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:10.793
And we're going exactly to the right side.

00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:14.485
We're not overstepping it
or we're not under-doing it.

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:17.190
So this is going to be right.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.618
This is a lot of fun.

00:02:18.618 --> 00:02:20.685
Let's do, okay this is interesting.

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:24.191
What is the length of the
floor of the bank, in meters?

00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:25.085
This is a picture of a bank.

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:27.082
I guess this is the big
money in the bank (laughs).

00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:29.520
Those are big dollar bills,
and those are big coins.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.157
Drag the ruler to make the measurement.

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:34.280
And this is in meters,
so I can click on this,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.521
and then I can put it, remember I wanna,

00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:38.622
I don't wanna do this,
this would be wrong,

00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:42.024
because I wanna start
measuring right at the edge,

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:43.893
right at the edge of the bank.

00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:45.890
So I wanna do it like that.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.456
And I see, okay, the length of the bank,

00:02:48.456 --> 00:02:49.454
well how much is that?

00:02:49.454 --> 00:02:51.126
Well you see this right
wall right over here,

00:02:51.126 --> 00:02:55.456
it's right at four, right at four meters.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:58.986
So this is going to be four meters long.

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:00.855
Let's do another one.

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:03.386
What is the length of
Maria's back yard in meters?

00:03:03.386 --> 00:03:05.418
Drag the ruler to make the measurement.

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.357
So once again, you don't
wanna do something like this,

00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:10.027
where you're starting
to measure, before the

00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:11.594
garden even starts or you're starting to

00:03:11.594 --> 00:03:12.823
measure too late.

00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:16.422
You wanna measure right at
the edge, right over there.

00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:17.722
So that's where the
guard starts, so that's

00:03:17.722 --> 00:03:19.156
where your ruler should start, measuring

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:23.521
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:24.926
looks pretty close.

00:03:24.926 --> 00:03:29.350
Let's see, it looks pretty close to eight,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.554
eight meters right over here.

00:03:32.554 --> 00:03:36.257
So, yea, this length of
this is eight meters.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:38.821
Looks pretty close, I'll say eight.

00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:41.484
Alright, let's do one more of these.

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:45.256
What is the length of the tray
of cookies in centimeters?

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:47.018
Now when they say "length,"
they mean the longest,

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.657
"length" actually means
the longest dimension.

00:03:48.657 --> 00:03:50.062
If you have a width and a length.

00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:51.593
And so the longest dimension of a tray

00:03:51.593 --> 00:03:54.020
of cookies is gonna be
this side right over here.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.284
You don't wanna measure,
you don't wanna measure

00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:59.453
that side up there, that
would not be the length.

00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:01.392
The length, if people
don't tell you otherwise,

00:04:01.392 --> 00:04:02.925
it's the longest dimension.

00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:06.025
So we wanna measure, so we wanna measure,

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.882
let me make sure I don't lose my ruler.

00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:12.120
We wanna measure, we wanna
measure along the top

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.594
or along the bottom.

00:04:13.594 --> 00:04:17.727
And we see that it is, once
again, we don't wanna do this,

00:04:17.727 --> 00:04:20.084
that would be starting the
ruler too far to the left,

00:04:20.084 --> 00:04:21.582
and you don't wanna do
this, starting the ruler

00:04:21.582 --> 00:04:22.906
too far to the right, you wanna put it

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:25.820
right at the edge, right over there.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.654
My ruler isn't perfectly straight.

00:04:27.654 --> 00:04:30.591
And we see that this cookie tray is,

00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:34.318
it is right at about eight centimeters.

00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:36.385
Eight centimeters.

00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:38.144
And we're done.
