00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.900
Welcome to the presentation
on finding sums of integers.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.670
You're probably wondering why
are we doing this within

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.150
the context of averages.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.240
Well, if you think about it,
all an average is is you take

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.030
a sum of a bunch of numbers
and then you divide by the

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.930
number of numbers you have.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.770
What we're going to do here is
do a couple of algebra problems

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.230
that involve just the sum parts
first, and actually they can

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.550
carry over into average
problems as well.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.360
Let's get started
with a problem.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.800
Let's say I told you that I had
the sum of five consecutive

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:48.580
integers is equal to 200.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.005
What is the smallest -- I
apologize for my handwriting

00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:03.300
-- what is the smallest
of the five integers?

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.750
Well there's a couple of ways
to do this, but I guess the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.760
most straightforward way is
just to do it algebraically,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.080
I would say.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.315
So let's say that x is the
smallest of the integers,

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:16.650
right, so x is actually
what we're going to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.610
want to figure out.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.810
Well if x is the smallest, what
are the other four going to be?

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.090
We have a total of five.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.580
Well, they're consecutive.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.620
Consecutive just means that
they follow each other,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.100
like 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.040
All of those are consecutive
integers, right?

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.140
And if you remember, integers
are just whole numbers, so it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.110
can't be a fraction
or a decimal.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.420
So if x is the smallest, so
then the next integer is

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.260
going to be x plus 1.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.360
And the one after that's
going to be x plus 2.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.400
And the one after that's
going to be x plus 3.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.050
And the one after that's
going to be x plus 4, right?

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.150
It might seem confusing I'm
writing all of these x's.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.920
But if you think about it, if x
was 5, then this would be 6,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.030
this would be 7, this would
be 8, and this would be 9.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.150
And that's all I'm
writing here, right?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.960
So these would be, assuming
that x is the smallest of the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.550
integers, the five integers
would be x, x plus 1, x plus

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.320
2, x plus 3, and x plus 4.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.030
And we know that the sum
of these five consecutive

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.900
integers is 200.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.620
What is the sum of these
five, I guess we could say

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.110
numbers or expressions?

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.670
Well let's see, we have
five x's -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.662
So x plus x plus x plus x
plus x is equal to just 5x.

00:02:36.662 --> 00:02:38.920
Or you could just
say 5 times x.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.540
And then that's plus 1
plus 2 is 3, 3 plus 3

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.600
is 6, 6 plus 4 is 10.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.490
So the sum of these five
integers is going to be 5x plus

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.520
10, and all I did is add up the
x's and added up the constants.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.450
And we know that that
is going to equal 200.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.330
Now this is just a level
two linear equation.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.440
We can just solve for x.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.250
So we get 5x is equal to 190
-- I just subtracted 10

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.020
from both sides, right?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.090
And then x is equal to --
let me divide 5 into 190.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.870
5 goes into 19 three
times, 3 times 5 is 15.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.160
9 minus 5 is 4,
bring down the 0.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.500
5 goes into 40, eight times.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.940
So x is equal to 38.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.010
Pretty straightforward
problem, don't you think?

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.790
Now what if I were to ask you
what is the average of the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.770
five consecutive numbers?

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.020
Well now, there's two
ways of doing this.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.250
Now that we already know that x
is 38, we know that the other

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:52.130
numbers are going to be -- well
this is 38, 39, 40, 41, 42.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.960
Well we could just average
these four numbers.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.900
You could just say 38 plus
39 plus 40 plus 41 plus 42.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.360
And well we already know
what those -- I don't

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.060
even have to do the math.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.320
You already know that they
average up, they sum up to 200

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.860
and then we divide the sum by
5, because there are 5 numbers.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.310
So the average is 40.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.490
There are a couple ways you
could think about that.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.420
One, you see 40's just a middle
number so that makes sense.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.230
And the only time we can really
say it's the middle number

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.800
is when the numbers are
distributed evenly around 40.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.620
If we had a number that was
much smaller than 40 or

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.270
something, you couldn't
just necessarily pick

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.740
the middle number.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.090
But in this case these are
consecutive and makes sense.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.230
Another way we could have done
this problem, if you were, say,

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.840
taking the SAT and they were to
ask you the sum of five

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.500
numbers is 200, what's the
average of the numbers?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.800
Well you say, well, all I have
to do is divide that 200

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.270
by 5 and I'll get 40.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.700
Let's do another problem
and I'll make it a

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.070
little bit harder.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:05:08.540
Let's say the sum of seven odd
numbers, and let me make up a

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.060
good -- I hope this one works,
I'm going to try to do it in

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:27.535
my head -- is 217, what
is the largest number?

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.640
I shouldn't say number
-- seven odd integers.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.210
Actually it becomes a much
harder problem if it was just

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.840
seven odd -- well actually, the
only thing that could be odd

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.900
are integers anyway, so you
could almost assume it.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.400
But the sum of seven
odd integers is 217.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.160
What is the largest
of the integers?

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.200
As you can tell I'm
doing this on the fly.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.750
Actually my wife just diagnosed
me with, she thinks I

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.030
have benign vertigo.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.490
I got very dizzy this morning
when I went to work, so you

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.850
have to forgive me
for that as well.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.010
That's impairing me even more.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.080
So let's do this problem.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.385
Let's say that x
is the largest.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.400
Then what would the
number right below x be?

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.550
Would it be x minus 1?

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.990
Well, if x is an odd
number, x minus 1 would

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.750
be an even number.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.850
So in order to get the number
right below it, we have to

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.290
do x minus 2 to get
another odd number.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.630
My apologies -- it should
say the sum of seven

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.170
consecutive odd.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.160
I don't know if
you assumed that.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.130
I'm trying my best
today to confuse you.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.840
The sum of seven consecutive
odd integers is 217.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.530
What is the largest
of the integers?

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.420
So if x is the largest, then to
next smallest one would be x

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.030
minus 2, right, because it's
consecutive odd numbers,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.250
not just consecutive.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.020
So consecutive odd numbers are
like 1, 3, 5, 7 -- you're

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.050
skipping the evens, right?

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.470
So that's why you're going up
or down by two, depending

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.740
how you view it.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.345
So the next one down would be
x minus 2, then we'll have x

00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:13.450
minus 4, x minus 6, x minus
8, x minus 10, x minus 12.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.060
I think that's it.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.700
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, right.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.060
Those are seven numbers.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.300
They're separated by two.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.990
X is the largest
of them, right?

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.210
We can assume that they're
odd because apparently

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.310
the problem will work
out so that they're odd.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.320
So what is the sum of
these seven numbers?

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.850
Well the seven x's
just add up to 7x.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:38.630
And then let's see, 2 and 4 is
6, 6 and 6 is 12, 12 and 8 is

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.330
20, 20 and 10 is 30,
30 and 12 is 32.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:51.840
So 7x minus 32 is equal to 217.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.520
We just solved for x.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.310
7x is equal to -- let's see,
if we add 32 to both sides

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:04.380
of this equation we get 249.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:10.070
Let's see, 7 goes into
249 -- is that right?

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.750
Right.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.685
So 7 goes into 249 -- did I
do this addition properly?

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:19.070
I want to make sure.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:28.770
2 plus 4 is 6, 6 plus 6 is 12,
12 plus 8 is 20, 20 plus 10

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.820
is 30, 30 plus 12 is 42.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.210
Oh, here you go.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.320
See, my mathematical spider
sense could tell that something

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.090
was fishy about this.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.470
So that's 7x minus 42.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.870
So if we add 42 to both sides
it's 7x is equal to 259.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.900
See how brave I am, I do
this thing in real time.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.680
259.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.530
So 7 goes into 259 -- let's
see, 7 goes into 25 three

00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:01.900
times, 3 times 7 is 21, 49 --
it goes into it 37 times.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.530
So we get x is equal
to 37 and we're done.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.630
So just to review because I
think had a lot of errors in

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.460
this problem when
I presented it.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.830
The question was the sum
of seven consecutive

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.900
odd integers is 217.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.830
What is the largest
of the integers?

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.390
I said x is the largest, and
then if x is the largest, the

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.650
next smaller one
will x minus 2.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.140
Because we're not saying
just consecutive integers,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.010
we're saying consecutive
odd integers, right?

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.320
So if x is 37, which is what we
solved for, then x minus 2 is

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.490
35, this is 33, this is 31,
this is 29, this is

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.490
27, this is 25.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.050
And then we just added up all
the x's and I'll add up all

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.910
the constants and said,
well they add up to 217.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.600
And then we just solved for x.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.460
I think you're now ready to
try some of these problems.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.940
Have fun.
