like you someone take an IQ test and you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
like you someone take an IQ test and you

like you someone take an IQ test and you
average together their performance on

average together their performance on
 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.999
average together their performance on
the entire test well it shows that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
the entire test well it shows that
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.249
the entire test well it shows that
students are twice exceptional our

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
students are twice exceptional our

students are twice exceptional our
students who have learning disabilities

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530
students who have learning disabilities
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.730
students who have learning disabilities
that's not the good reflection of their

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740
that's not the good reflection of their
 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.800
that's not the good reflection of their
true intelligence just averaging

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
true intelligence just averaging
 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.810
true intelligence just averaging
together their performance on a testing

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820
together their performance on a testing
 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.850
together their performance on a testing
session because their learning

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860
session because their learning
 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.770
session because their learning
disability can mask and pull down

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780
disability can mask and pull down
 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.410
disability can mask and pull down
certain areas but they could still show

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420
certain areas but they could still show
 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.540
certain areas but they could still show
extraordinary high areas in other ways

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550
extraordinary high areas in other ways
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.520
extraordinary high areas in other ways
that and that gets lost when you average

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
that and that gets lost when you average
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.650
that and that gets lost when you average
it all together so there are new

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660
it all together so there are new
 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.390
it all together so there are new
methodologies that are that are be

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400
methodologies that are that are be
 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880
methodologies that are that are be
created that are that we're using to not

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890
created that are that we're using to not
 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.650
created that are that we're using to not
just measure Solon's intelligence or

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660
just measure Solon's intelligence or
 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.330
just measure Solon's intelligence or
creativity just through a testing

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340
creativity just through a testing
 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.340
creativity just through a testing
session we are first of all we're using

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350
session we are first of all we're using
 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.810
session we are first of all we're using
IQ IQ tests to look at specific

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820
IQ IQ tests to look at specific
 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.370
IQ IQ tests to look at specific
abilities and patterns of strengths and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380
abilities and patterns of strengths and
 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.320
abilities and patterns of strengths and
weaknesses so not looking at that global

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330
weaknesses so not looking at that global
 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.300
weaknesses so not looking at that global
or total IQ score we're also going

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310
or total IQ score we're also going
 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.010
or total IQ score we're also going
beyond the IQ test and we're getting

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020
beyond the IQ test and we're getting
 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.990
beyond the IQ test and we're getting
teacher ratings you know the more you

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000
teacher ratings you know the more you
 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.150
teacher ratings you know the more you
can triangulate lots of different

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160
can triangulate lots of different
 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.199
can triangulate lots of different
information from lots of different

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209
information from lots of different
 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.570
information from lots of different
sources you get a much better reflection

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580
sources you get a much better reflection
 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.650
sources you get a much better reflection
of Seoul's intelligence and creativity

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660
of Seoul's intelligence and creativity
 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.890
of Seoul's intelligence and creativity
and get to parent parent ratings you ask

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900
and get to parent parent ratings you ask
 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.390
and get to parent parent ratings you ask
parents what's a child like at home you

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400
parents what's a child like at home you
 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.979
parents what's a child like at home you
know is the child really curious is the

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989
know is the child really curious is the
 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:09.370

constant asking questions ask teachers
 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.030
constant asking questions ask teachers
is that is the child seem like they're

bored with the material that you're
 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.430
bored with the material that you're
teaching are they ready for more

teaching are they ready for more
intellectual challenges do they seem to

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709
intellectual challenges do they seem to
 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.990
intellectual challenges do they seem to
question assumptions a lot a lot of the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000
question assumptions a lot a lot of the
 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.229
