1
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.940
Hey freaks sampling friends.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.920
People offended by freak you to training.
Fuck's going on?

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.000
Don't say training.
You know how to say that anymore.
That's another new one.

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.930
They removed tranny tranny's ban.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.160
Now even money saying that right now is very danger.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.840
<v 1>You removed to make a tranny also.
Oh,
you son of a bitch.</v>

7
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.740
You rearrange your free range.
They're not supposed to say that anymore.

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.520
It's transgender.
You recycle.
Even if you love transgender people,

9
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:32.390
you're not allowed to say that.

10
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.290
Like even if you have nothing but love in your heart trainees out now it's

11
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:40.820
offensive.
I'll never be able to embrace it.
I accept it and I honor it,

12
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.740
but I fucking,
it does not me.
My head can't wrap around it.

13
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.280
<v 0>You know what?
You had Ken rep around Greg Fitzsimmons and tell him,
God,</v>

14
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.080
I need to tell your kid.
Don't.
Um,

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.440
if you ever have had to do anything,
uh,
legal involving,

16
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:01.500
like saying like setting up a corporation,
it's kind of a pain in the ass.

17
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.960
You've got to go to someone's office,
you got to pay some dude.
A lot of money.

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.670
Cost me a ton of money.
Yeah.
Well,
you can do it on legal zoom for 99 bucks.

19
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.430
They'll,
they'll talk you through it.
If you run into troubles,

20
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.610
they can connect you with the independent attorney if you need additional

21
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:15.900
guidance,
independent attorney.

22
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.690
So if you get to one of those situations where you're like,
you know what,

23
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:19.980
I think I might be fucked.

24
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.140
And you're looking at all you've created and you're like,

25
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.990
I don't think this is legal.
I don't think I know what I'm doing.
Like,
ah,

26
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.930
they'll hook you up.
And um,
legal zoom,

27
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.000
they want to emphasize that it's not a law firm.

28
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.450
They provide self help services at your specific direction.

29
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.280
But if you need things like,

30
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:38.550
if you need to write a will or need to do something along those lines,

31
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.700
you can do that online with legal zoom with legal zoom.com and it makes it much

32
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:48.240
easier than,
than going somewhere.
I mean,
this is where the world is coming.

33
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.240
Eventually you're gonna be able to do everything on your fucking computer.

34
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.630
I mean,
just like stamps.com this is the same kind of thing.

35
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:57.210
You're going to be able to do these things on your computer and legal.

36
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:00.450
zoom.com is an excellent example that the past 12 years,

37
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:04.440
over 2 million Americans have used it and they take,
they saved a ton of money.

38
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.510
It's an excellent,
excellent service.
So coach

39
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.650
Greg Fitzsimmons and use a codename Rogan in the referral box for even more

40
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:14.550
savings.
All right,

41
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:19.551
my friends boom shall lock lock boom on at.com that's [inaudible] the sponsor.

42
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.400
If you go to Oh and and it and use a codename Rogan,

43
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:25.710
you will save 10% off any and all supplements.

44
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.350
That's Mike Dolce and he knows a lot about food,

45
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.460
but apparently he thinks he can eat wheat.
I've got to talk to them about that.

46
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.710
Kind of find out what if I'm wasting my time not eating wheat.
I'm old

47
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.740
<v 1>free right now.
Greg Fitzsimmons,
I heard weed is the shit.</v>

48
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:44.180
That's the new thing is it is the complete food source.
Really?
Yeah.
That's all.

49
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.550
That's all you need,
but that's that.

50
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:50.570
It's the best food source that is the the best in terms of the amount of

51
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:53.930
different nutrients and fiber.
It's a,

52
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.430
you go drink shots of wheat grass.
That's true.
Yeah.

53
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.040
Yeah.
That is true.

54
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.410
<v 0>Is that the same though as we cross the same as wheat?
I don't think it does.</v>

55
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.500
Doesn't it?
Liccardo Brown

56
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.770
<v 2>shit that we have in Ohio that you chew on and when you're thinking about
things,</v>

57
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.390
when you want to look [inaudible] right.
Um,

58
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.600
<v 0>uh,
I don't know.
I'm trying gluten free for awhile,
seeing how it works so far,</v>

59
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:24.220
so good.
But Mike [inaudible],
Scott,
uh,
ultimate grocery guide up there on,
on it.

60
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:26.630
You can learn more about that.
Mike Dolce is a,
a,

61
00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:30.600
a guy that a lot of the MMA fighters use for uh,
their,
uh,

62
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.260
nutrition counseling.
He said it's a really smart guy when it comes to a diet.

63
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.741
Uh,
I saw,

64
00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:39.580
I got to ask him about this wheat thing to find out what's good or bad about it.

65
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.560
But mostly what we sell on,
on it is things that can enhance human performance.

66
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.500
All stuff like strength and conditioning equipment,

67
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.490
supplements like hemp protein powder and things along those lines.

68
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.290
It's all just things that if you use them on a regular basis,

69
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.320
they can enhance human performance.
Whether it's medicine,

70
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:03.610
balls are weighted vests or Kettlebell Cardio,
DVDs,

71
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.540
all the stuff that we sell.
The idea is that it's going to enhance.

72
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.680
If you use it and you work out with it,
it'll enhance the way your body works.

73
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.590
If you take the supplements and it'll enhance the way your body functions.

74
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.570
I want big muscles.
You should get some.
I need some might need bigger mosques.

75
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:22.210
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Commit.
Yeah,
because that's got all the time though.

76
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.360
<v 2>Big Mouth.
I need to start backing it up and almost 50 like pocket.</v>

77
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.630
Right?
I have to really knuckle up.
I'm not gonna calm down.

78
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.210
I'm tired of being the guy.

79
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.370
<v 0>The sand kicked in his face.
O.
N.
N I t use the code name,
Rogan.</v>

80
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.860
Save yourself 10% off any and all supplements.

81
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.720
Greg Fitzsimmons is in the fucking house.

82
00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:45.950
My friends too at Brian [inaudible],

83
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.620
the Joe Rogan experience.

84
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.490
<v 3>Let's try my day.
Joe Rogan block gas all day.</v>

85
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.760
<v 2>Sweet,
Sweet Greg Fitzsimmons.
You beautiful savage.</v>

86
00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:04.820
You always get to see my friend.
What a,
what a hang.

87
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.190
This is going to be baby kicking back.

88
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.000
Got some girl scout cookies and your special coffee,
what's it called?

89
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.420
It's called bulletproof coffee.
Oh Man.
That goes down smooth.

90
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.550
It's a Dave Asprey creation.
He,

91
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.910
he invented created and coffee with grass fed butter and MCT oils.

92
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.330
Medium triglyceride or oil.
It's,

93
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:28.430
it gives you a caffeine high and it's a lip balm.
Yeah.

94
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.470
It keeps it greasy.
Um,

95
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.400
the idea with it is that because it has the caffeine,
um,

96
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.660
blended in with the butter and the MCT oil,

97
00:05:38.661 --> 00:05:41.030
that it's more of a slow release effect.
Right.

98
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.020
Takes your body awhile to digest it as opposed to like coffee just go right into

99
00:05:45.021 --> 00:05:49.370
your bloodstream and you don't get the crash with this.
Exactly.
Yeah,

100
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.301
exactly.
Yeah.

101
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:53.840
That's much less than it could be a medicinal marijuana stuff is in the butter,

102
00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:58.100
right?
Yes.
Yes.
I do not know the,
I've never anything and they're cooked

103
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.900
<v 0>anything.
I don't know the process,</v>

104
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.550
but I know there's something involved cooking it to,

105
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.030
to activate the THC in an edible form.

106
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.780
I think though that you can get high with it if you just,

107
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.670
if you just eat it on its own.
Yeah,

108
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.180
but I think you have to eat an ass load of it.
I think it's no joke.

109
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.100
You have to like have salads.

110
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.390
Then maybe you can catch like a little bit of a buzz.
That's the new wheat man.

111
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:24.830
Yeah,
callous salads.
Did you hear about Sanjay Gupta?

112
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.940
CNN?
Fucking incredible.
I mean,
first of all,

113
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.040
props to CNN for Aaron.
This is guy for coming out with this.

114
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:37.880
This is incredibly controversial stance.
This guy,
Sanjay Gupta,

115
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.180
he went and over the last year he was working on a documentary called weed and

116
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.370
even he's,
he,
before he started this project,

117
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.420
he thought that marijuana was bad for you.
He thought marijuana was addictive.

118
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.080
He thought that marijuana was,
you know,
something that should be avoided.

119
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.820
And at the end of this project,
he's writing this story apologizing.

120
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.120
He says,
I apologize because I didn't look hard enough until now.

121
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:06.200
I didn't look far enough.

122
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.250
I didn't review papers from smaller labs and other countries doing some

123
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:11.084
remarkable,

124
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.500
remarkable research and I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate

125
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.230
patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis.

126
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.180
Instead I lumped him in with the high visibility mal liners.

127
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.840
Is that how you say that in a line or liners?
Just looking to get high.

128
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.620
I mistakenly believed that Drug Enforcement Agency listed marijuana as a

129
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:34.040
schedule one substance because of sound scientific proof.

130
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.970
Surely they must have quality reasoning as to why marijuana is in the category

131
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:42.971
of the most dangerous drugs that have no accepted medical use and use a high

132
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:46.460
potential for abuse.
So he wrote this long article,

133
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:49.730
I want to keep reading it and he also really limited.
He was wrong.

134
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:54.200
That's the really as a doctor to go on on Cameron say I was wrong.

135
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.800
I wonder though this,
this almost makes me wonder,
it's,

136
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.860
it's almost seems like some sort of a shift in policy because the reality of CNN

137
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:10.190
and Msnbc and Fox News,
these are giant companies.

138
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.680
They're huge companies.
They don't just say things,

139
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.540
they don't just say whatever the fuck they want to say.
None of that gets done.

140
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.060
They'd all go.

141
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.030
It has to go through a bunch of people and they have to decide what are we doing

142
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:21.830
this?
What are we doing?
Are we going to print this?

143
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.500
Is this going to Piss off Ted Turner?
Yeah.
Who's going to,

144
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.780
who's going to get upset by it?
This is going to cost anybody money.

145
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.990
Are we okay with this?
Should we move in this direction?

146
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.100
And then they printed a story like this because I just got to think that

147
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.080
something is big as CNN.

148
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.440
Like they could have said like maybe in the 80s if you tried to print the story,

149
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:41.210
they would have been like,
bitch,
get the fuck outta here.
Right.

150
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.500
We're not putting this on the air.

151
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.520
Well especially cause Nancy Reagan had just declared the war on drugs.
Yes,

152
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.870
exactly.
That just say no era.
That's when you and I started doing comedy.

153
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:55.530
It was like what a beautiful like kickstart everybody had to their act,
right.

154
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.010
There was always a drug war joke because it was so preposterous.

155
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.860
<v 4>Kitty Dukakis drinking,
rubbing alcohol and war Andrea,</v>

156
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.500
<v 0>nobody remembers that story.</v>

157
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.510
That was when Mike Dukakis was running for president and he is,
he had done it,

158
00:09:10.511 --> 00:09:13.660
he had a couple of blunders,
that tank thing,
tank thing,

159
00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:17.500
heard them got in a tank and put like a soldier's out front and let them take

160
00:09:17.501 --> 00:09:19.600
pictures of them.
And everybody was like,
what the fuck?

161
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.940
<v 4>Fuck us.
He was the wimpiest human being of it.
He was like worse than Ross.</v>

162
00:09:22.941 --> 00:09:27.920
Parral yeah,
they,
they've wanted to improve his image as a leader.

163
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.760
And so that was the end looked like,
um,
you look like a snail,

164
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.640
like this little wrinkly necks sticking out.

165
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:38.840
It was like Pale white face and he was one of this guys.
He is,

166
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.340
he's like,
um,

167
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.750
Ralph Nader in that he doesn't give a fuck that his suit isn't from Brooks

168
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.500
brothers.
Well Taylor's like asshole,
you're running for president.

169
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:51.860
You actually have to take the time to get a decent suit.

170
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.940
There's the picture.
Oh my God,
look at him.

171
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.670
Look at that shit.
Who told you that

172
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.860
<v 0>did do that?
He's Kinda like a full helmet on and shit.
What does he do now?</v>

173
00:10:02.861 --> 00:10:05.710
I haven't heard anything about him in a long car ride.
Professor,

174
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.410
it's a good question.
Oh my God.

175
00:10:08.411 --> 00:10:11.710
Can you imagine if doc that was your teacher in school while he's obviously a

176
00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:16.420
brilliant man,
you know,
I think the,
the,
the idea of running for president,

177
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.380
it must be so fucking incredibly stressful.

178
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.630
I mean that you see a woman just completely lose it and start drinking,

179
00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:28.450
rubbing alcohol.
I mean she just,
she's so,

180
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:31.180
she needs to get tanked up so bad and there's nothing in the house.

181
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.160
She's drinking aftershave.
Betty Ford.
Ah,

182
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.570
fuck man.
They were all drunks.
Imagine the pressure of the White House.

183
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.380
Just wrap your head around the pressure of making all the decisions of pressure

184
00:10:44.381 --> 00:10:48.820
being the guy.
Everywhere you go,
this fucking six security everywhere around you.

185
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.720
Bulletproof cars and getting on jets and flying to other countries and you're

186
00:10:52.721 --> 00:10:57.721
like the center of the representation of the conflict in the world.

187
00:10:58.001 --> 00:10:58.834
Like fuck.

188
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.480
<v 4>Not only that,
people were talking about like,
um,
those,</v>

189
00:11:02.481 --> 00:11:07.160
this fishermen that go out in the,
in Alaska and it's the most dangerous job.

190
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.870
How about this?
How about this statistic?
I looked this up,
I counted,

191
00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:12.740
maybe I counted wrong,

192
00:11:12.741 --> 00:11:17.741
but I think 10% of presidents have been killed in office or died in office.

193
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.470
So what other job would have a 10% chance of you dying in four years?

194
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.700
Not In the life of the job.
So you know,

195
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.060
you've got that hanging over your head.

196
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.440
<v 0>The two best ones ever assassinated,
right?
Lincoln,
Kennedy.</v>

197
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.550
I mean those are the heroes.
Those are the James Deans of of presidents.
Right.

198
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.870
If you look back at like who's the,
who's the bad motherfuckers a,

199
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.210
it was the guys that got killed.
Yeah,
those are the ones we miss.

200
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.970
Those are the ones that David Dads,
I was the one,
they were going to do it.

201
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:48.810
They were going to fix it.

202
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.060
<v 4>Well,
and on the other side,
Reagan was that guy and they tried to kill him.</v>

203
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:57.190
Well Reagan Wagan was a totally different animal.
You know,

204
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.050
it's interesting how Reagan like over time has become like something that's much

205
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:06.700
more acceptable to like absolutely.
Well time always whitewashes.
I mean,

206
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.980
Henry Kissinger,
that guy is,

207
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.060
he can't leave the country because he would be arrested as a war criminal in,

208
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.570
I forget how many countries it is,
but this motherfucker,

209
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.950
Kissinger ordered eee illegal bombings in Cambodia.

210
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.180
You know,
he,
I mean,
you're talking about genocide.
You if you are,

211
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.420
if you are flat out bombing carpet bombing a population that you're not at war

212
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.730
with,
that's a fucking war crime.

213
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.640
And now I just saw him on,
um,
curl a nut Corolla Kobe,

214
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.180
or last night they did a sketch with Kissinger and it's like,
no,
it's not funny.

215
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:46.030
It's not okay.
He's a fucked up human beings.

216
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.730
<v 2>Wow.
I had no idea that he had done that.
Yeah.</v>

217
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.220
I don't have any knowledge of 1970s politics.
I know.

218
00:12:53.221 --> 00:12:57.360
Almost nothing.
I know a little bit about the,
uh,

219
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.320
the campaign that a hunter Thompson covered for fear and loathing on the

220
00:13:01.321 --> 00:13:03.640
campaign trail,
which was great.
Yeah.

221
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.630
That's about my extent of my knowledge of 1970s politics.

222
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.160
Yes.
Have you ever looked into it though?
1970s period is,
uh,
eh.

223
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.690
I must've been molested

224
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.220
<v 5>because I got nothing.
Well,
it's,</v>

225
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.240
<v 2>we were kids,
you know,
we're about the same age.
I'm 45 I'm already seven.</v>

226
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:26.650
I'll be 46 soon.
Yeah.
Are you getting fucked in the ass by a neighbor?
Right.

227
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.450
You know,
we blocked it.
I was like [inaudible] maybe.
No,

228
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.490
I think just go fuck me in the ass.

229
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.330
So I just blocked out the 17th did you remember when you were really,

230
00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:37.901
really young,

231
00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.890
like going to dance clubs and trying to meet girls at the palace in revere?

232
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.730
Oh my,
it's not your place.
Well,
it was everybody's place.

233
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.560
If somebody wanted to go somewhere and try to meet a girl.
Yeah.

234
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.070
But the nice thing is so ridiculous.

235
00:13:51.071 --> 00:13:54.370
I only went a couple times to those places with my friends and I always remember

236
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:56.110
being like,
what the fuck are we doing?

237
00:13:56.111 --> 00:13:59.460
Like this kind of a crazy way to meet human beings.

238
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.780
<v 4>Did you ever try country?
That was even worse.
Where you like go like,
wait,</v>

239
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.460
you're supposed to square dance?
No.

240
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.960
<v 5>Do do you remember the time we went to North Carolina with me at Charlie</v>

241
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.160
Goodnight's?
We went next door to that bar.
That bar.
There's a bar,
right?

242
00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:19.020
And they are all singing along to a song you never fucking heard in your life.

243
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.533
God,

244
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:26.230
the porch and health and there's singing this shit and they're going all around

245
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.850
the dancing,
that step dancing that they all do together that they did that.

246
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.550
They definitely did that too.
But this was another thing,

247
00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:38.580
this is just another song that Brian and I had never fucking heard of him,

248
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:43.200
but apparently it's sold like 100 million,
you know,
albums in the south.

249
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.980
So we're in the south and this is like,
it comes on.
They're like,
whoa.

250
00:14:46.981 --> 00:14:51.980
It was like,
I'm like,
we're in another country.
Like when you going to like

251
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.610
<v 2>a place where their country fans,
that is a whole nother country.</v>

252
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.900
That's the people who know who won Nascar.
Then you hear Dale did it again.

253
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.790
Did you hear he did it again.

254
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.060
And then there's fucking everybody that lives in that area.

255
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:06.740
I mean this is a different part of the world.

256
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.950
There's songs that they love that you have never fucking heard of and they'll be

257
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:16.070
like,
you ain't heard a clip driven.
No.
Clinton,
[inaudible] crip,
feminine,

258
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:20.230
so 14 million albums and you're like,
what?
He like Fuck is Clinton forever?

259
00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:25.650
Like Pearl Jam sold 1 million and they are just as ridiculous as like Uber Golf

260
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:30.440
guys.
Cause you know how like Uber Golf guys to like wearing like black bake up.

261
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:35.510
You know they're like really like completely like posing and this bizarre thing

262
00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:38.630
that they're doing.
What are you doing with a fucking cowboy hat?

263
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:43.310
Shithead with a turquoise belt buckle and slippery ass boots.

264
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.370
Those things are dumb.
What century you live in,
in?
What do you,

265
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:47.440
what are you doing?
He's like,

266
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.140
it's like people that maybe they love Halloween and they wanted to ground all

267
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.280
year.
You know,
I'm a cowboy.
No,
go on the porch.

268
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.160
What if the music doesn't even sell that well,
it's just that they're so dumb.

269
00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:00.770
They keep on losing their cds that have to keep on buying them over and over.

270
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:04.730
Well look,
as far as outfits go,
cowboys,
a cool ass outfit.

271
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.760
That's one thing I have to admit.
Like if you dress not by your cowboy,

272
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:12.890
if you're a dude and you got the balls to rock cowboy boots and a Stetson going

273
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.350
ass jeans,
but even or not or not,
you know,
that is a ballsy move.

274
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:22.340
That's a ballsy look to commit to in the year 2013 I see.

275
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:25.970
Got then why not?
I know I'm not hating.
I just want to be clear about that.

276
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.050
I'm not hating.
If that's how you like to dress,
why not?
Why not?
Look at me.

277
00:16:30.051 --> 00:16:33.320
I'm almost 50.
I dressed like a 15 year old.
Always have,

278
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.540
I dress like I dress like a junior coach.

279
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.340
I wear fucking varsity.
Coach has sweat fans.
Yeah.

280
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:41.660
You get to a certain point you like,

281
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:43.910
that's what's comfortable fucking most comfortable thing.

282
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:49.060
And then I think about people that you think about the possibilities in your

283
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:54.320
wardrobe.
They are limitless.
A woman could dress up as you know,

284
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:59.210
uh,
Queen Elizabeth every day as a guy.
Yeah.
These goth guys.
There you go.

285
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:02.990
Fuck it.
I'm painting my nails,
the whole thing.
I'm going to grow one.

286
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:07.430
I'm going to grow my pinky nail really long and he just fucking,

287
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.840
and it's like you could blow people away with that shit,
but I don't.

288
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.950
It's like the last thought in my head is to even make an impression with my

289
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:19.520
clothing.
I want it to be a zero.
But you should wear a whistle.

290
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:24.380
That would be funny.
It's why not?
That'd be hilarious.

291
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:28.960
Not just where a whistle.
Everything [inaudible] hilarious.
Not The coach man,

292
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:33.200
but now then you want to get somebody that tight channel.
That's great.

293
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.070
You're buying me a fucking whistle for my birth.
Right.

294
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.590
You imagine them dudes just started wearing whistles,
became the new cross,

295
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.740
like a cool whistle.
A whistle on.
Look.

296
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.890
It easily could be like you have a whistle and you're like,
Damn Bambi.

297
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.810
Like that could be the thing in clubs like,
oh you see how good he whistles.
Yeah.

298
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.470
And guys would be like a mating thing.

299
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.730
We would be like birds chirping at each other.
It's the rape,
strange whistles.

300
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.450
That lid on rape culture.
Whistle,
stop visit.
It's the meeting hall was short.

301
00:18:01.451 --> 00:18:04.950
I was like,
she wants you to stop people in with the dance of noise.

302
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.290
If we can make cool noises,
like a whistle with our mouths.

303
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:10.650
I guess some people probably can.
There's dudes like Michael Wilson Woods,

304
00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:13.740
low type dudes that can make strong water drop.

305
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.940
Isn't it funny though that that's such a,
it's such a valued skill.

306
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:23.290
<v 6>All right,
that's pretty good.</v>

307
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:33.560
<v 2>You guys are fucking 12 years old.
That's what men get it.
That's what men do.</v>

308
00:18:33.561 --> 00:18:35.780
If you leave them alone,
leave them alone long enough.

309
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.500
They fucking sit in front of each other making stupid noises and then they buy

310
00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:40.334
whistles.

311
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.800
Isn't it funny that like making cool sounds with your mouth is like a valued

312
00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:52.850
thing?
Hell yeah.
I mean that's why like singers are so valued.

313
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.430
When someone does a really good singer,
you're like,
Whoa,

314
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.560
you know it makes you like step back.
Like Holy Shit.

315
00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.220
Like Peter Frampton doing that.
We're
like,

316
00:19:01.221 --> 00:19:05.240
that was the biggest fucking thing.
We thought that was the coolest.

317
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.120
And now you look back and you're like,
what was that wax paper and a calm.

318
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.090
That was when he had that thing that he put in his mouth.
Yeah.

319
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.450
You remember you put what was,
um,
what's the,
what are those things called?

320
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.260
<v 6>What?
Talk about</v>

321
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.460
<v 2>talkbox.
Yeah,
yeah.
Whatever that thing is that rappers use all the time now.</v>

322
00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.970
The auto tuner.
Yeah.
Like little little Wayne eats through that thing.

323
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.050
He eats all his food through that thing here.
He uses it all the time,

324
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.340
but like Peter Frampton when he was doing it,
I guess it was like,

325
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:38.610
was it the eighties or seventies it must be the 79 I'm guessing that's what song

326
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.500
do you feel like I do?
Oh my God.
Yeah.

327
00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.860
He was one of the first times anybody had ever done that and people were going

328
00:19:47.861 --> 00:19:50.380
nuts.
Yeah.
They were going nuts.
Right.

329
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.300
I just remember like when I had a picture of a rock star,
just that line,

330
00:19:55.301 --> 00:19:58.510
he had a woke up this morning with a wine glass in my hand.

331
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.850
Where the hell did I done?
That's all we want it.

332
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.290
We want it to become that guy who's in a penthouse suite with a wine glass in

333
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:10.240
his hand.
Yeah,

334
00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.950
that's a great song.
Right.
Fucking song.
That was one song that defined that guy.

335
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.540
Yeah.
Like if you think of Peter Frampton,

336
00:20:19.541 --> 00:20:22.900
Dan is the song you think of right away.
Cheap trick.

337
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:25.090
I want you to want me live at Buddha con.

338
00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:30.150
What's crazy about Peter Frampton is it Peter Frampton was a guy who got famous

339
00:20:30.251 --> 00:20:33.460
because of his live shows.
Is that right?
Yeah,

340
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:38.380
his live show was so fantastic.
He was such a showman that too.

341
00:20:38.381 --> 00:20:42.580
Really appreciate his brilliance.
You had to see him rock a crowd.
Right.

342
00:20:42.581 --> 00:20:43.720
And so when he does,

343
00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.220
do you feel like I do in front of a crowd and he's got 20,000

344
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.460
<v 5>people tuned in to him singing along with them.
Yeah.</v>

345
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.150
It is some fucking magical shit.
And that's,

346
00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.440
<v 2>and he was one of the Florentine while he's dealing.
Yeah.</v>

347
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.850
<v 5>Beautiful.
He's a beautiful man.</v>

348
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:03.010
And because he was like one of the first guys to put out like a live album like

349
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:06.890
that and that,
that was like one of his first big success,
right.

350
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.290
Was the live album.
That was really rare.
Right.

351
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.560
Usually people got a studio album and then maybe,

352
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.990
I think kiss was one of the first guys that said fuck it,

353
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.440
let's do a live one kiss a lot.
Cause they knew how to rock a show.

354
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.910
Like those shows were wild.

355
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.900
But Peter Frampton that do you feel like I do when he's got full control of that

356
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:26.790
crowd and they're singing along with them,
that is fucking magic.

357
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.670
That's a magic moment app.
Can you play a little bit of that?

358
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.920
<v 2>Well play a little bit of that,
that Jim Morrison mystique where he was like,</v>

359
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.940
you wanted to follow him into this world.
Yeah.

360
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.700
Predimed he was a bad mother fucker and he was uh,

361
00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.500
who's a rock star in the mysterious days.
Right.
So completely different world.

362
00:21:46.501 --> 00:21:48.010
Back then,
you know,
they could,

363
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.860
they didn't have Twitter where they said stupid shit and then had to delete it.

364
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.890
Like,
is this right?
These were wild dudes and they had no accountability.

365
00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.090
It was like,
did you see almost famous?
Yes.
That was kind of like that I think in,

366
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.470
I think in the movie they're supposed to be following the almond brothers.
But,

367
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.790
but it was kind of a,
he said it was a mixture of a few different bands,

368
00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:11.120
but it was from that exact time.
That's the limit.

369
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.730
<v 5>Skinner,
Dara.
Right.
I mean that's,
those are,</v>

370
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.330
those were wild motherfuckers,
man.
Right.
In my opinion,

371
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.210
the greatest guitar solo the world has ever known was Freebird.

372
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.860
Yes.
Freebird live.
Have you ever seen the one,

373
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.660
it's free bird live and they're jamming in front of a,
it's a football arena,

374
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.291
right?
So I don't know.

375
00:22:31.291 --> 00:22:36.291
What is that 100,000 people and they are dirty white guys from Florida and

376
00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:41.940
they're perfect.
They're perfect.
Every note is perfect.

377
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.140
Every fucking string is hit on the right time.
The fucking,

378
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.310
just the magical impact of that music.

379
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.120
<v 2>Confident.
It's guys that have played teeth like the [inaudible] brothers.</v>

380
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.560
This is,
these are the post post death.

381
00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.520
You've got to go and get those underrated band by mainstream rock fans.

382
00:23:00.521 --> 00:23:01.440
I Maynard.
Yeah.

383
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.380
<v 5>Ban.
People have heard sweet home Alabama too many times.
That's the problem.
Yeah,</v>

384
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.910
we've heard it so many times.
You're like,
oh,
get this off the air.
No,
no,
no,
no.

385
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.690
You need to step back.
And with fresh eyes.
Listen to sweet home Alabama.

386
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.630
Cause that is a bucking beautiful,
simple man.
Yeah.

387
00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:22.270
For Ballew to fall.
Beautiful.
Beautiful telling.
Your son had to grow up.

388
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.320
And one of my favorite things about skin is that they were ugly as fuck.

389
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.880
And almost every song was about getting away from women.

390
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.350
<v 3>I got to juggle every song is they call me the breeze.
I got gotta go,</v>

391
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:39.990
I see you.
I need to be free.
Right.
Gimme gimme three steps.

392
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.780
Yeah.
Get the fuck out of here.
Fucking song was like,

393
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:46.860
I gotta get Outta here.
See Ya.
[inaudible]

394
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.990
<v 2>right.
You know,</v>

395
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:51.980
and they even made songs about their friends trying to get them to settle down.

396
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:57.680
Well,
it was classic blues,
you know,
ugly.
Getting away from women.
Yep.
You know,

397
00:23:57.681 --> 00:24:01.700
being at the crossroads and a lot of it is about the devil.

398
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.510
There's just so many knuckleheads that love scattered.
Yeah.
That's the problem.

399
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:09.830
That's the problem.
The problem is it,
it,
you know,
they died young.
Okay.

400
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.120
And you,
you have an issue when you have so many knuckleheads,
like a band,

401
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.650
you can get diluted.
Oh,
that's for knuckleheads.
No,
no,
the grateful dead.

402
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.980
I actually liked the grateful dead.
Grateful dead.
Don't do it for me.

403
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.530
They're fans are a,
they,

404
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.530
they their buzz killed my cousin and followed them around for like years.

405
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.540
Like was a deadhead.
Yeah.
She uh,
she,
her and her boyfriend would like sell food.

406
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.060
I'm just going to say they always have like a little business take care of some

407
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:38.330
gallon.
Yeah.
And just go from show to show.
And they were just,

408
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.220
I guess they were just enjoying that community.

409
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.010
It must be very strange to be like an outlaw like that.

410
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:47.480
Just to a rebel from society going from concert to concert with the little tiny

411
00:24:47.481 --> 00:24:50.950
mini ecosystem of selling scrambled eggs out of the back of your car,

412
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:55.040
meeting with all these people and I'll fucking tripping together and always

413
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:58.940
trying to get a ticket.
They would have signs up.
I need a miracle.
Oh Wow.

414
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.170
That was the sign that you were a real dad had not just some dude,

415
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.260
I need a miracle.
And then the,
and then they'd get them and you know,
it was,

416
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.550
it was just like a living from Vegan Tofu.
Patty.

417
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:14.600
Just making enough to get that fucking ticket.
It's so weird,

418
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.190
but I get it.
I get it.
I totally get it.
You know what I get?
I get,

419
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.970
there's a lot of people doing it and it looks like fun.
I get that.
It's like,

420
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:24.470
well this is like an ecosystem.

421
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.960
This is like a little community that you can link up to.

422
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.120
And these guys actually like it.
Like,
you know,

423
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:33.080
it's like everybody's happy and they're all meet together and at the,

424
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:37.370
they perform these four fucking hours shows and everyone's on acid dancing.

425
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:40.220
I mean,
I,
I'm telling you,
Springsteen is a,

426
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:42.440
is a fucking experience live.

427
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:47.660
I heard you two is but a grateful dead concert.
I mean,
your,
first of all,

428
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:52.430
you tripping.
Every single person is dancing,
not bouncing back and forth.

429
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:57.550
Fucking are doing the backstroke and looking at the sky like that is really

430
00:25:57.651 --> 00:26:01.250
intense to be surrounded by that for four hours.

431
00:26:01.251 --> 00:26:05.630
So is that what it's all about?
Yeah.
It's letting go into this energy.

432
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.070
Is it,
is it a show that requires drugs?
Yes.

433
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.850
Yes.
Does.
Yeah.

434
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.200
And is it a show that you don't understand until you do it with drugs and then

435
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:19.520
you understand it 100% like you ever the worst feeling in the world.

436
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:22.010
Young words give or go to a concert like pipe.

437
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:26.920
My wife made me go to fucking Dave Matthews band.
Oh God,

438
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.890
right son.
That's the ugly one.
And the word wife made me go to is always bad.

439
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.451
But then when you say,

440
00:26:32.451 --> 00:26:36.900
I shouldn't say the only thing worse than Dave Matthews is John Meyer.
Oh,

441
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.030
John Meyer.
And she was just like John Mayer Meyer and she,

442
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.000
and she was just like just enthralled by him.
[inaudible] Huh?

443
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.520
I could do John Mayer will know.
I can do to,
no,
I think he's great.

444
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.370
I think he's very talented.
But if your wife is really into going,
oh,

445
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.010
I know what I'm saying.
Like she dragged you there and just stares at him,
right?

446
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.910
And you're like,
I made for this ticket.
You paid to have your wife close.

447
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:02.220
Arise later and think about him.
Boop.
Ley,

448
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.370
you notice she's not clapping because one of her hands slipped down or James

449
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.470
<v 3>knuckle deep.
Oh,
Dave Matthews.</v>

450
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.300
He's so sad today.
She's clapping

451
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.270
<v 2>being with one hand.
Yeah.
It's just like,</v>

452
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.820
it sounds like something stabbing of seal.
Just what

453
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:21.841
it sounds like.

454
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:25.670
One of those martial arts movies where they rip the guy's heart out.
[inaudible]

455
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:31.590
she's just fist of herself.
She's all the way to right elbow.

456
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:34.980
Just written her teeth and Brown it in there.
Get the wedding ring off.

457
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:38.610
She's just fucking strafing the,
you can see her rib cage

458
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.520
<v 3>ban is a Fisk goes up there,</v>

459
00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.960
John Meyer.
I fucking love you.

460
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.260
Okay,
let's go here.
Then you realize it's in her asshole.

461
00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:00.850
You thought it was bad.
It's all fucking shit up to her elbow.

462
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:06.310
What is this the fuck are you doing?
I thought we were going to see a concert.

463
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:11.410
She starts licking your arm.
Oh,
John Mayer.

464
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.220
<v 2>Oh,
John.
Uh,
you make me eat my shit.
Lo.</v>

465
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.390
Meanwhile,
that's not the craziest person that ever lived.
Nope.

466
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.700
That's not even close.
Nope.
Don't even call close.

467
00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:24.140
If you work in an insane asylum,

468
00:28:24.141 --> 00:28:26.240
that's all they do is clean shit up off the walls.

469
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.540
It's all about feces in the mental institutions.
Yeah.

470
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:33.380
What does that they say that has something to do as a territorial proud.
Oh,

471
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.110
I didn't hear that.
I've heard a lot of,

472
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.880
there's a lot of connections between like feces,
abuse and sexual abuse.
Right.

473
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.850
Read that though.
Online.
Obviously I'm not a doctor.

474
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.220
I know when I think about the seventies and I take a shit,

475
00:28:46.221 --> 00:28:50.180
I cry when you think about the 70s and you'd take your shit.
Yeah.

476
00:28:50.181 --> 00:28:54.410
Cause I was molested in the 70s and then when you're taking a shit,
no,

477
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.100
we're just making that joke before.
Remember

478
00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.200
<v 3>good.
But we were been met.</v>

479
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.190
<v 2>He thought that would be edited out.</v>

480
00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.950
I thought we were figuring out a way to move past that.

481
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.510
Do you guys know a band named one direction?
Oh No.
Yes.
It's a,

482
00:29:08.511 --> 00:29:12.620
it's a kid's band.
Like if Tiger beat had had a cover story.

483
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.240
Oh look at these cute little bastards.
Yeah.

484
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.030
But I guess they're staying at the hotel across the street from the comedy
store.

485
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.540
There's all these little kids that are just hanging out there late at night,

486
00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:22.230
just like in groups like,
like,

487
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:25.670
like an apple products about to get released at midnight type shit.
Oh,

488
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:30.710
and they're just mobbed everywhere.
Like how fucked up is that is these guys,

489
00:29:30.711 --> 00:29:30.981
you know,

490
00:29:30.981 --> 00:29:35.180
they're trying to make them look like they're 17 but they're probably 25 right

491
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.990
after days or whatever.

492
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:42.030
Find out even if they're 21 the fans 11 to

493
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.960
<v 4>1314 and they want to fuck you or they don't know what they want.</v>

494
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.810
They want to let you do what you want with them.

495
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:54.380
So I was wondering if these guys are like looking for that one older sister who

496
00:29:54.381 --> 00:29:58.720
is into it log or that you should be and she's like 1718 and you want to pluck

497
00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:01.210
her out because otherwise it's a nightmare.

498
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.300
All these people are screaming for you and you can't go near them.

499
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.430
<v 0>Do you think the girls actually want them to do what they want to them?</v>

500
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.490
I think they have no idea what the fuck they want.

501
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.850
They want to hug them or something.
You know,
you're talking about an 11 year old.

502
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.070
I don't think.
I don't,
you know,

503
00:30:17.071 --> 00:30:21.570
I think they don't even realize what a guy liking you means,
you know?

504
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.200
But some of them are dressed like dirty whores.
They're like 13,
but they,

505
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.670
you know,
maybe 13.
Yeah.
Then you start kind of figuring it out.
What is it,

506
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.060
11 how many kids at 11 no.
What's going on?

507
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.560
<v 4>What if your wife though?
Like it was the opposite.</v>

508
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:38.100
What if your wife was in love with like Justin Bieber?
Like,

509
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.180
like just a huge Bieber fan.

510
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.630
There was parents that were hanging out with these kids and they were like,

511
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.400
all like with the t shirts,
I'm like,
like freaking out off.
It was just as creepy.

512
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.930
Hmm.
Makes Sense.
I mean,
he's a,
he's a handsome ambassador that Justin Bieber,

513
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:56.560
Justin Bieber is cute,
just adorable.
And he never breaks character.

514
00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.340
He's always that fucking positive guy,
you know?

515
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:03.470
But now you hear he's starting to fuck up.
He was,
uh,
he,

516
00:31:03.471 --> 00:31:07.720
he pissed in a janitor's bucket behind it and a nightclub.

517
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.370
<v 0>I think the pressure that dude must be under must be staggering.</v>

518
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.640
And it's staggering.
He was,
what,
12 six yeah.

519
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:19.650
So we never had a chance to develop an in any normal way.
Yeah.
To for him,

520
00:31:19.651 --> 00:31:22.230
the,
the struggle is going to be so strange.

521
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.250
And you know who gave me some insight into that is a Ricky Schroder.

522
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.870
Ricky Schroder was famous when he was like six.
Yeah.

523
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.200
Isn't like that movie the Champ,
I think he was like six,

524
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.100
six or seven or something like that.
Get nominated for an Oscar.
Dude,

525
00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:39.960
he fucking deserved it.
He was amazing in that,
but he,
the way he describes it,

526
00:31:39.961 --> 00:31:42.630
when he did the podcast,
he talked about,
he's like,
that's my world.

527
00:31:42.631 --> 00:31:44.340
I've never known another world man.

528
00:31:44.341 --> 00:31:47.630
I've never known a time where I wasn't famous.
So it's normal to me.
Yeah.

529
00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.960
And I go,
oh,
all right.
I'm like,
what is an interesting way to grow?

530
00:31:51.961 --> 00:31:54.660
Is Justin Bieber about to kick some ass?
Is that what's going on?

531
00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:00.340
What is he going?
Who is he going after?
A reporter.
A reporter.
Yeah.

532
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.170
Well that seems like it could have been handled a little better,

533
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.820
<v 4>but there's a lot of big actors to start as child actors.
You know,</v>

534
00:32:09.821 --> 00:32:13.660
like Tom Cruise and,
oh,
what's his name?
Uh,

535
00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:18.650
Leonardo Dicaprio.
You know,
he was probably 11 when he started.
Yeah.

536
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.590
And I think in a way,

537
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:25.060
maybe you can't stay at the level that a Tom cruise does unless you just were

538
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.720
indoctrinated into it early and it's all,
you know,

539
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.640
<v 0>maybe.
I mean there's some that seem to have gotten through it.
Like,
I don't know,</v>

540
00:32:32.641 --> 00:32:34.470
I've never had a conversation with Jodie Foster,

541
00:32:34.471 --> 00:32:37.800
but she strikes me as someone who got through it like fairly unscaved.

542
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.980
She's a lesbian.
Yeah.
Is that what it is?
Like

543
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.260
<v 5>that made it easier?
It's a better transition.</v>

544
00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:43.740
<v 4>No,
I,
I,</v>

545
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:47.560
I think that being a lesbian makes you from the lesbians I've known and I've

546
00:32:47.561 --> 00:32:50.050
known some really well.
I worked for,

547
00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:55.051
Alan did generous for two years and I think that it makes you an outlier.

548
00:32:55.361 --> 00:32:56.980
You're born into being an outlier.

549
00:32:56.981 --> 00:33:00.130
You're already thinking about things knowing you,

550
00:33:00.131 --> 00:33:04.810
you don't need people's approval cause you're not going to get it categorically.

551
00:33:04.811 --> 00:33:05.830
So you stopped seeking it.

552
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.840
<v 5>Hmm.
That's interesting.
You know,</v>

553
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:12.970
because one of the things that I always admire about,
uh,

554
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.180
talking to a fun lesbians is how they're very much like,

555
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:21.170
guys don't make jokes and you don't give a fuck.

556
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.350
Like Melissa Etheridge.
She's like a dude.
Yeah.
I mean,

557
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:26.450
and I say that in the nicest way possible.
The,

558
00:33:26.451 --> 00:33:28.850
the broadest sense of the compliment.
She was,
uh,

559
00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.230
she was talking about divorce and alimony and stuff like that,
and she goes,
hey,

560
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.780
you know,
look,
the bottom line is women are fucking crazy.

561
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.410
She's just talking about getting divorced and she's talking like a dude.

562
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.440
You know what I mean?
And I don't mean all women are crazy.

563
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:48.860
Some of them are great,
don't,
don't put,
the lesbians are less crazy.

564
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:53.010
But once beings are more like dudes,
right?
Like there's something anybody,

565
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.900
he doesn't believe that that is a natural part of the,
the,
you know,

566
00:33:56.901 --> 00:34:01.520
the broad spectrum of,
of sexual attraction is a natural part of life.

567
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.520
It's never met like a badass lesbian,
you know,

568
00:34:04.521 --> 00:34:07.940
you never met like a Melissa Etheridge.
If you met,
met a Melissa Etheridge,

569
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:10.280
you'd be like,
Oh yeah,
oh yeah,
that's,

570
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:12.960
that's a lesbian [inaudible] we have so many

571
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.850
<v 4>same sex parents and my,
in my kids' school,
it's crazy.</v>

572
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:22.090
They have absolutely no concept that to gay people shouldn't be together any

573
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.710
more than like when they heard about that,
they,

574
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:28.220
that the supreme court overruled that same sex marriage act.

575
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.320
They were like clapping in the back of the car.
Wow.
They're just like,
would,

576
00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.220
why would to like Jeremy's parents,
you know,
uh,

577
00:34:37.221 --> 00:34:40.400
Evans mothers,
like it's just fucking normal.

578
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.350
<v 5>Yeah.
It's,
it's,
you know,</v>

579
00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.770
people have this idea somehow or another that there's,

580
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.360
there's different teams that there's a conservative team against the liberal

581
00:34:50.361 --> 00:34:55.190
team.
Really what you should look at this,
the simplest way,

582
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:57.890
simplest ways.
Does it hurt you?

583
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.470
And if it doesn't support it,
does it,
does it,
does these people enjoy it?
Well,

584
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:05.020
there's some important,
like the,

585
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:09.410
the idea that you would restrict people's behavior that they enjoy because for

586
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:13.730
some reason it's distasteful to you,
that's just being an asshole.

587
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.820
That's all that is.
That he's ain't nothing worse.
It falls under that category.

588
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.830
Abortion gets tricky because you're dealing with human life and it's also tricky

589
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:26.831
because it's one of those clear pattern decision things like if you're a right

590
00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:31.280
wing person,
you are pro life.
If you're left wing person you are pro choice.

591
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:35.690
It's almost like cut and dry like you have to adopt these opinions to be one

592
00:35:35.691 --> 00:35:36.524
side or the other.

593
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.820
I think I have no business to tell anybody what they can and can't do with their

594
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:44.040
body.
I have no business,
I'm not a doctor.

595
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:49.041
I don't know when life begins but it you look at like a of couple cells together

596
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:52.830
and then you look at a forming fetus.

597
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.580
They become very different things as it becomes larger and older.

598
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.590
So then it starts to be when it's,

599
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:02.640
when does it become life and I think that's a real question and I don't think

600
00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:04.860
it's a left wing question or rightwing question

601
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.490
<v 4>to question.
It gets people and asking in a written way.</v>

602
00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:08.111
<v 5>Exactly.</v>

603
00:36:08.111 --> 00:36:12.910
It's an honesty question and it's a question that we avoid in this discussion.

604
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.980
It's,
you're either,
if you're left wing person,

605
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:19.480
you are a pro choice and you want women to be able to do this safely and you

606
00:36:19.481 --> 00:36:20.890
want it to be,
uh,

607
00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.710
where they don't have to worry about being harassed in the parking lot.

608
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.140
And if you're a right wing person,
oftentimes the views,

609
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.910
the polar opposite that you're taking a human life,
it's against the Bible.

610
00:36:30.911 --> 00:36:33.020
If you're,
you know,
a Christian,
especially he,

611
00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:35.980
there's a lot of people that believe this is a terrible,
terrible thing.

612
00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:40.420
So terrible that there's the extremists when you get on their spectrum,

613
00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.820
the extremists that shoot the fucking abortion doctor,

614
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:47.640
<v 4>which is totally logical to me and I understand it.
If I believe,</v>

615
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.900
if I believe that absolutely that human lives are being taken,

616
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.340
it will be the same to me as if I knew that there was a guy that was going to

617
00:36:56.341 --> 00:37:01.050
work every day and they were killing people.
I would,
I would kill that person.

618
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.130
I would be within my moral authority,
not by the United States law,

619
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.850
but I feel the same way.
If somebody hurt someone in my family,

620
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.310
rape or murder,
I would get a gun and I would go find that her,

621
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.790
I would arrange to have them killed.

622
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:18.510
And I would feel like that wasn't wrong of me to do that if I was absolutely

623
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:22.920
sure it was,
it was them.
Right.
But in terms of when a life begins,

624
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.350
you remember Jonathan Katz is joke,
he goes,

625
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:28.470
I believe life begins after the Second Cup of coffee.

626
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:35.950
<v 5>Jonathan Katz is awesome.
But yeah,
it's a real question.</v>

627
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.620
And if you bring it up like that,

628
00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.040
I had a discussion with this guy that I really kind of respected,

629
00:37:42.041 --> 00:37:44.200
I don't want to say his name,
but I was uh,

630
00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:49.240
who was the most preposterous discussion on the idea that it's just a seed and

631
00:37:50.231 --> 00:37:53.170
that,
uh,
you know,
having an abortion is just to seed.
I'm like,

632
00:37:53.171 --> 00:37:56.860
it's not just a seed,
it's a growing thing.
Like if you leave it alone,

633
00:37:56.861 --> 00:37:59.620
it's going to be a person.
We both know that like,
we can't play games with this.

634
00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.110
And then you start accusing me of being right wing like immediately.

635
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.560
And I was like,
okay,
I'm not,
I'm not right wing at all,

636
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.320
but you're saying you're equating it to a seed.

637
00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.660
It's not a seed like a fetus.

638
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.300
Something growing inside of your body will be a human.

639
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.430
A seed does not necessarily become a tree.
Okay.
You have to fucking plant it.

640
00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:19.081
You got to water it.

641
00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:22.240
Then it becomes a sapling and then it's on its way and if it gets the moisture

642
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.520
then it becomes,
it becomes a tree,

643
00:38:24.521 --> 00:38:26.470
but a seed can just sit around for a long time.

644
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:29.470
Once you have a baby that started to grow,

645
00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.730
then the ethical process begins.
The ethical question process.

646
00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:36.010
When is it a person?
Is it a person a day

647
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.680
<v 0>in when it's two sales or three sales or a hundred sales,</v>

648
00:38:38.681 --> 00:38:41.290
whatever the fuck it is.
Is it really?
Are you sure?

649
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.510
Like if I just pulled that out of there real quick,
aren't we good?

650
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:47.250
<v 4>Yeah.
The discussion seems to me off.</v>

651
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:52.340
It's off point because it really is like very logically it is the second it

652
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:59.971
becomes two cells and anything in between that and birth is life.

653
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:00.840
Yeah.

654
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:05.840
Then the question really is about when is it less of a bad thing?

655
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.980
Is it sooner?
You know,
cause to me it feels like to say,

656
00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:15.510
well once it has eyes or to say once it starts to delineate limbs,

657
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.210
then you start to go like,
well now you're splitting hairs.

658
00:39:18.211 --> 00:39:21.910
I mean either you are stopping,
uh,
you know,
uh,

659
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.410
an entity from fully forming or you're not.

660
00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:28.590
And it doesn't matter how far down the line is.

661
00:39:28.591 --> 00:39:30.900
And this isn't to say I'm against abortion,

662
00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:35.310
but like I do a joke about it now where I say,
you know,
women are like,

663
00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:39.600
first I asked the women who,
how many women are pro choice?
They all clap.

664
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.930
How many of you have had abortions?
Nobody clapped.
I go,

665
00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.970
there's the problem with your fucking cause.

666
00:39:44.971 --> 00:39:46.830
How are you going to really fight for a cause?

667
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.090
You won't admit that you actually do.
I said,
you should be proud of it.

668
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.130
This should be,
you should see like,
uh,

669
00:39:53.131 --> 00:39:55.920
you should see like a those silhouettes of the family members in the back of

670
00:39:55.921 --> 00:39:59.550
your minivan with just an x three one of them and says not a good time.

671
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:06.240
And it just,
to me it feels like I,
now that might come off as anti abortion,

672
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:10.470
but it's not.
It's anti put your head in the sand.
It's like own it.

673
00:40:10.471 --> 00:40:13.440
If you're gonna fucking do it,
own it.

674
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.100
The same way that I would own masturbation.
If you tried to make it illegal,

675
00:40:17.101 --> 00:40:19.800
I'd be like,
fuck you.
I may be ashamed of this,

676
00:40:19.801 --> 00:40:21.270
but I'm fighting for my right to have.

677
00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.780
<v 0>I can see the cover of the article you're writing on Joseph Bell right now.</v>

678
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:29.570
Emmy Award winning writer
connects masturbation with them.

679
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:33.940
<v 4>Abortion.
Look,
we're all ashamed,
ladies.</v>

680
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.750
They were both cleaning up afterwards.
Oh God,

681
00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:41.840
<v 0>how dare you.
This is where women who are like really militant,</v>

682
00:40:41.841 --> 00:40:43.670
we'll get furious.
Like,
you know,

683
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.330
you can never fucking have a conversation about it because the option isn't

684
00:40:47.331 --> 00:40:48.460
available to you.
Okay?

685
00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.560
You're not going to have a fucking body growing inside of your body and you're

686
00:40:51.561 --> 00:40:53.480
not going to be the person who gives birth.

687
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.700
<v 4>And my answer would be,</v>

688
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.660
I've never dropped seat in a chick with that protection dummy.
Oh,

689
00:40:58.690 --> 00:40:59.530
how'd you get pregnant?

690
00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.670
<v 0>Dare you?
How dare you yell at someone so vulnerable in</v>

691
00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:09.740
the middle of a crisis.
You exploding on a stranger.

692
00:41:09.741 --> 00:41:14.420
I know I have to meet it with love.
I have to be gentle of love.
It's hard to do,

693
00:41:14.421 --> 00:41:17.950
but sometimes we need to do to fix the world.
Sweet.
Well you can't,

694
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:21.710
you can ever say,
why didn't you just about the past and having sound good?

695
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.630
Why didn't you just get your shit together?
Oops.
Just

696
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:30.530
<v 4>call me because I was fucking suicidal.
I don't want to talk to anybody.</v>

697
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.890
Well,
not allowed to say it's dark

698
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.010
<v 5>when you say,
uh,
if you say suicidal around people,</v>

699
00:41:37.011 --> 00:41:41.060
that's the best way to get the party stopped.
Everyone's having a good time.
Well,

700
00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:43.640
ever since I've been suicidal cricket,

701
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:47.300
oh no,
no,
no.

702
00:41:47.301 --> 00:41:51.380
Nobody wants to be around somebody who wants to end life on their own terms for

703
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:55.760
some reason.
That's very disturbing to us.
Yeah,
most likely.
Because if you're,

704
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.640
if you're looking to kill yourself,
what do you give a shit?
If I die too?

705
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.720
I don't know.
Not committed suicide.
Bomb Yourself.
Right.
Did you,

706
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.460
did you watch that show?
Um,
uh,
fuck the Patriot show.

707
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.720
Uh,
ha.
Steelers won on no Herron teacher.
The one,

708
00:42:11.721 --> 00:42:16.010
the fucking the homeland.
I've seen every episode.

709
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:21.170
Fascinating fucking show.
Fuck.
Yeah.
And I don't want to spoiler alert,

710
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:25.430
but the,
those suicide vest scene.
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

711
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.410
<v 4>That's an Emmy Award winning performance right there and shit.</v>

712
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.230
<v 5>I don't want to say anything more than that.</v>

713
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:36.030
<v 4>You're about to watch one of the best actors out there.
Holy Shit.
What a scene.</v>

714
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.850
I mean,
they,
they the cast and that's your Mandy Patinkin.

715
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.680
I'd always heard his name,
but I thought he was like some theater.
Huh?
He's not,

716
00:42:43.681 --> 00:42:47.100
he's a fucking,
well,
he's that too.
I know,

717
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:50.340
but that made me think that he was just like,
uh,
you know,

718
00:42:50.341 --> 00:42:54.510
for lack of a better word,
like a,
you know,
a homosexual.
Oh,

719
00:42:54.511 --> 00:42:58.080
Hey Zov which isn't bad.
I just met,

720
00:42:58.081 --> 00:43:00.540
I dismissed him as like a cabaret singer.
Oh.

721
00:43:00.541 --> 00:43:05.190
And I didn't realize he was like a brilliant fucking actor.

722
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.940
<v 5>Yeah.
Mandy Patinkin beast man.
He's a beast.</v>

723
00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.290
He was also in the princess bride.
He was legal Montoya.
Right,

724
00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:17.320
right on my father prepare to die.
He was a bad mother fucker.

725
00:43:17.321 --> 00:43:19.890
Mandy Potemkin has been a bad mother fucker for a long time.

726
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:25.110
He's a brilliant actor and he plays that character.
Just,
it's just a work of art.

727
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:29.580
It is a work of art.
I mean the,
the subtlety in his delivery side,
the,

728
00:43:29.581 --> 00:43:34.500
the real moments when he actually gets upset be that tangible feeling that you

729
00:43:34.501 --> 00:43:38.970
have when this really measured guy has to cut loose and get crazy.
Right.

730
00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:43.370
<v 4>Fuck what a show.
And you know,
you talk about characters being layered,</v>

731
00:43:43.371 --> 00:43:47.180
it's like there's so many different things going on with him between his

732
00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:50.180
troubled marriage,
his relationship with Claire Dane,

733
00:43:50.181 --> 00:43:54.740
which he knows is wrong and yet he believes in her and he's a company man.

734
00:43:54.741 --> 00:43:56.480
In the end,
it's,

735
00:43:56.481 --> 00:43:59.180
there's so many different things going on with him and he plays all of them at

736
00:43:59.181 --> 00:43:59.970
the same time.

737
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:04.650
<v 5>Yeah,
it's so,
it's so hard to believe that.
I mean,
and again,
spoiler,</v>

738
00:44:04.651 --> 00:44:05.320
I'm not going to say,

739
00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.920
but it's so hard to believe the plot lines they've pulled off.

740
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.280
Like the idea that they put forth that,

741
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:15.120
that they're actually playing that out and then I'm not running away from the TV

742
00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:16.800
going get the fuck out of here.

743
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.110
Like they haven't had me go get the fuck Outta here once.

744
00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:24.540
<v 4>Well I th I felt 24 was like that 24 you had to suspend your disbelief a little</v>

745
00:44:24.881 --> 00:44:28.930
bit more because it was a little bit more of action.
It was physical action more.

746
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:32.040
Right.
But it was the same kind of shit that

747
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.300
<v 2>you would really go like and I,
that's why I love that genre.</v>

748
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:39.780
I love Bourne supremacy.
I like it when you got to go like,
yeah,

749
00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:43.080
they're not riding a motorcycle truss and roof,
but fuck man,
this,

750
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:46.650
this is fun to watch.
Yeah.
I mean,
even if it's preposterous,

751
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.570
the Bourne identity one,
what's the latest one?
The latest one is the,
the not,

752
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.720
it's the one that's not Matt Damon.
It's the other guy.
Oh,

753
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:59.150
I didn't see the new guy.
I can see Jeremy Renner.
Jeremy Renner.
Yeah,
that's,
yeah.

754
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.900
Um,
and he's like jumping off the top of buildings and landing on people's necks,

755
00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.410
twist to them on the way down.
I mean,
it's the most ridiculous shit of all time.

756
00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:08.483
He's like this.

757
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.650
These are like the greatest Olympic athletes the world has ever known.

758
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.080
This dude got do.
Yes.
Yes.

759
00:45:13.081 --> 00:45:17.040
The thing he can say like in the movie for kind of stuff,
anything,
everything.

760
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:20.880
He does,
whatever he flashed through the Lens.
I mean,
it's preposterous.

761
00:45:20.881 --> 00:45:24.000
Like the way he can more than Matt Damon.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He's on,

762
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:28.830
he's the hyper level.
They kicked it up.
So it's more like bond.
Yeah,
no,
no.

763
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:33.030
He's more like a superhero.
Like what he can do with his body is ridiculous.

764
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.270
He literally jump off buildings and land on people's heads,

765
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.430
catch himself and buildings on the way down.

766
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:40.610
Trop on their head and snap them and fucking flip off.

767
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:45.050
Flip over a speeding Ferrari that's coming at them under this arm.
Grab that guy,

768
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.670
turn it towards up.
Don't Joe jumped chill.
Everybody in front of him.

769
00:45:47.671 --> 00:45:50.970
Flip over him when the car's coming at him.
I mean it's just,
I always like,

770
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:54.630
you know,
have your leg broken and in the next scene chase somebody down.

771
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.860
That's always my favorite.

772
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:58.770
I'm always keeping track of how injured because at at my age,

773
00:45:58.771 --> 00:46:01.800
like I get injured just getting up,
taking a shit,

774
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.520
I can get injured and I'm watching this guy,
oh,
you know,

775
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:07.920
finger must be broken from that.
I got gouged out from that.

776
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:10.840
And he's still at the top of his game in the last scene.
Yeah.
They,

777
00:46:10.841 --> 00:46:12.900
they heal well no,
those shows,

778
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.480
they always get that streak of blood that comes off the eyebrow.

779
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:20.250
And it was a big one.
You know what the key is?
Is the,
the acting.
I mean,

780
00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:24.840
Matt Damon is just a guy,
he can do comedy,
drama,
Romance.

781
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.150
He's fucking unbelievable.
He's a beast.

782
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.680
And so you put him into a role like that and he raises the stakes if you

783
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:33.930
believing in it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well,

784
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:38.130
he was so good that he played Liberace's lover.
And you believed that God,

785
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:40.850
you know?
Yeah.
You meet Matt Damon is a bad motherfucker.

786
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:45.710
Lisia so is that what it's called?
The new futuristic movie?
Elysium Elise.

787
00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.870
Elisa may see him.
At least him.
That looks awesome.
Yeah.

788
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.790
I don't know what that is.
I don't know if it's good,

789
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.430
but at least one of those few actors where you know,

790
00:46:53.431 --> 00:46:54.780
some of these guys get paid 20,

791
00:46:54.781 --> 00:46:57.480
$25 million a picture and you think that's not worth it.

792
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.720
There's very few people that I will go see,

793
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.450
like fucking don't need to read a review with the movie.

794
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:06.270
Don't care who the director is.
Matt Damon's in it.
I will go say it.
Yeah.

795
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:09.710
He always makes a good choice.
Right.
The movies are always there.
So,
oh,

796
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.600
something really good about the movie.
Yeah.

797
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:16.530
What was the one movie where he played a complete total liar?
Oh,
about,

798
00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:20.520
he was,
uh,
he was flying around a lot.
Right.

799
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:25.840
The curious of what the fuck was that?
Oh God damn it.

800
00:47:25.841 --> 00:47:30.220
Now I've got to go to is yeah,
that I am DB,
which I never liked to do.
That

801
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.960
<v 5>was bad.
What's your I MTB man.
Really not impressed hoes.</v>

802
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.920
That's what people like to say.
It's like a,
yeah,
that's a Hollywood douche thing.

803
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.480
I had been to your imdv bro.

804
00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:43.860
<v 4>Not only that,
I am,
DB has a star ranking.</v>

805
00:47:43.861 --> 00:47:48.720
Here is the most grit task Hollywood sign.
You can pay extra,

806
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:52.410
you pay an extra 10 bucks a month for IMD be pro and you can,

807
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.590
I can look up Joe Rogan and it will you,

808
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:59.620
you will be numbered from one to like 10 million in Hollywood based on the

809
00:47:59.791 --> 00:48:03.780
amount of searches for your name.
Um,
you know,

810
00:48:03.781 --> 00:48:07.590
time spent on your website.
It's all factored in and you get a ride.
Like usually,

811
00:48:07.591 --> 00:48:08.780
you know,
like,
uh,
uh,

812
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:14.180
Matt Damon might be number three and I might be like number 46,000 or something.

813
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:20.780
So I know this 46,000 people higher up in the food chain in Hollywood than I am.

814
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.670
And you can look up any,
you have a meeting with somebody,

815
00:48:23.671 --> 00:48:26.280
you can look up what their fucking ranking is in Hollywood.

816
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.660
<v 5>That's so ridiculous.</v>

817
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:31.710
That's just something that people would get caught up in and then it would wind

818
00:48:31.711 --> 00:48:33.840
up becoming really gross.
Right.

819
00:48:33.841 --> 00:48:36.510
You'd just get caught up in it and lose your fucking marbles.

820
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.440
<v 4>Hire a marketing team to search you.
So you go up in the,
yeah,</v>

821
00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:39.901
<v 5>ranking.</v>

822
00:48:39.901 --> 00:48:44.901
I need to get my public internet profile higher in the rankings.

823
00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.780
It's very important.
I can't find the name of this fucking movie.

824
00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:53.150
<v 4>What's so crazy is like with
with Twitter,</v>

825
00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.250
there's times where I go through Tweets,
I,

826
00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.380
I stumble on something that makes me laugh and I'll write out like five,
six,

827
00:49:00.381 --> 00:49:04.340
seven tweets in 20 minutes and then I won't tweet for like five days.

828
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:09.670
And then I'll see like the number of people that follows you will jump when you

829
00:49:09.801 --> 00:49:12.370
write tweets and then it doesn't at all.
When you don't see,

830
00:49:12.371 --> 00:49:16.190
you realize like you really,
it's great that people are,

831
00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.930
they really are reading that shit.

832
00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:20.330
<v 5>Oh yeah man.
If you are,
if you're interesting to follow,</v>

833
00:49:20.331 --> 00:49:24.620
like people send you interesting things as well.
Look,

834
00:49:24.621 --> 00:49:27.620
one of the beautiful things about Twitter is that it's like an exchange.
Yeah.

835
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:32.120
Like I retweet a lot of shit and I retweet things that people send me that that

836
00:49:32.121 --> 00:49:32.661
are interesting.

837
00:49:32.661 --> 00:49:35.780
Like someone will send me some crazy story about some new scientific discovery

838
00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:37.430
and then I'll immediately retweet that.

839
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.820
And so it encourages people to do that because they like being retweeted cause

840
00:49:40.821 --> 00:49:44.060
they get more followers that way.
And if you have cool shit on your tweet,

841
00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:47.510
your Twitter page,
like people who have,
you know,

842
00:49:47.511 --> 00:49:51.390
no show business connections at all,
they just have developed a following,

843
00:49:51.391 --> 00:49:55.790
have like significant numbers of Twitter followers just based on their own
input.

844
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:56.661
Denny's.
Yeah.

845
00:49:56.661 --> 00:50:00.350
Someone finds out about it or you tweet something to someone famous and they

846
00:50:00.351 --> 00:50:01.850
retweet it.
Someone finds out about it.

847
00:50:01.851 --> 00:50:04.340
And then before you know it you have like this little community that you've

848
00:50:04.341 --> 00:50:05.110
developed.

849
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.990
<v 4>Well writer is on TV are getting jobs from,</v>

850
00:50:07.991 --> 00:50:12.520
from Twitter feeds more than SPEC script.
That's amazing.

851
00:50:12.521 --> 00:50:17.500
You hear about it all the time.
This dude,
you know,
he went to uh,
um,

852
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:22.420
you know,
Colorado State University and he just used to tweet a lot and then he,

853
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:27.180
he,
he just gets fucking,
they solicit him.
You know,
you guys,

854
00:50:27.181 --> 00:50:30.010
I'll have a 200,000 followers and they'll say,

855
00:50:30.011 --> 00:50:32.050
do you want to write on a how I met your mother?

856
00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.450
And the guy does it and then he kills himself.

857
00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.610
<v 5>That's amazing.</v>

858
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.500
<v 4>You imagine writing on how I met your mother,</v>

859
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:43.220
one of those shows sitting in a room with 12 other people fighting to get one

860
00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:45.290
line into a horrible script.

861
00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.640
<v 5>But folks don't know that.
Everyone's like,
yeah,</v>

862
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:53.020
must be really fucking hard working on TV must be terrible.

863
00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:57.120
Excuse me while I go to the coal mine.
Right?
That's obviously worse,
right?

864
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:01.870
But doesn't take away from the fact that being on a show that sucks is torture.

865
00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:06.510
<v 4>Well,
and I only say that because as Comedians we get to say whatever the fuck we</v>

866
00:51:06.511 --> 00:51:09.720
want,
we can,
uh,
we can get immediate feedback.

867
00:51:09.721 --> 00:51:14.240
Nobody's giving us notes or criticism.
And then you take that and you go into,

868
00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:18.660
uh,
you have an office and then some pa will come by and go,
okay,

869
00:51:18.661 --> 00:51:22.950
everybody in the writer's room and you have to stand up and walk in and sit down

870
00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:27.690
and stay in there for the four hours until they go,
okay,
you guys can have lunch.

871
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:31.890
It's just your whole life turns upside down.
Yeah.
And again,

872
00:51:31.891 --> 00:51:34.830
that this isn't a complaint about it.
I'm just saying compared to stand up.

873
00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.400
<v 5>Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Stand up is the greatest job the world has ever known.</v>

874
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:42.180
An hour a night.
Yeah.
And just writing during the day.

875
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:46.230
And usually it's fun.
Even the,
even the stuff you're like,
God,
I gotta right.

876
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:50.550
When you start writing and it clicks,
that's a fun feeling.
Right?
It's really fun.

877
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:50.991
<v 4>And the,</v>

878
00:51:50.991 --> 00:51:54.860
and the excitement of then knowing like you're driving to the club and you got

879
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:55.490
like three

880
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:58.740
<v 5>is a new shit.
Yeah.
You got like a little bomb that you know you can drop.</v>

881
00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:03.300
That's a great feeling.
It's so fun and you're,
it's also,

882
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:08.310
people love that feeling.
I loved that feeling of laughing at someone.

883
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.100
Like I'm still a huge fan of standup.

884
00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.270
Like one of my favorite things to do is to go watch standup.

885
00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.820
This is one of the reasons why it was really fun.

886
00:52:14.821 --> 00:52:16.260
Those dates that you and I did together.

887
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:19.890
I got to watch you and laugh and I hadn't seen a lot of your stuff in a while.

888
00:52:19.891 --> 00:52:24.060
It was really fun.
Yeah.
Stand up is just a,

889
00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:25.890
it's a beautiful exchange.

890
00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:29.760
<v 4>I was just the Montreal comedy festival I saw cause all these dudes that I'd</v>

891
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:33.850
heard about and hadn't seen for whatever cause you know we're on the road at the

892
00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:37.990
same time.
But you know Kyle Kinane.
Yeah,
I don't know him.
I know who he,

893
00:52:37.991 --> 00:52:42.040
I guess the same thing.
I hadn't seen him and he was fucking great.
Like uh,

894
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:44.500
like a Stan hope to kind of guy just,
you know,

895
00:52:44.501 --> 00:52:49.340
a boozer who talks really honestly about the darkness of his life and his butt

896
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.110
but has the chops of a real stand.

897
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:52.400
<v 5>Yeah,
I saw him do,</v>

898
00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:55.790
I've seen him do one set and it was at the Improv and it was very fun.
Yeah.

899
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.460
But it was a long time ago.
It was several years ago.

900
00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:01.610
It's hard for him to remember his Twitter Avatar is,
it's my cat.

901
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:06.310
It's your cat would really,
oh,
that's funny.
You mean the photo,

902
00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.710
the drawings are you of him holding techie?
Oh,
that's hilarious.

903
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:11.750
Well it's tough to beat a cute cat.

904
00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:15.940
<v 4>And then I went and we did,
we,
I did a appealing to look at,
you know,</v>

905
00:53:15.941 --> 00:53:19.780
they have that Gallo where you got to go and perform for like 3000 people and if

906
00:53:19.781 --> 00:53:23.200
they show it around the world.
Oh yeah.
So I paid that.

907
00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:26.010
And a Dane Cook was like,
they have a host for

908
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.030
<v 1>it,
you know,
a celebrity host.
And Dane Cook was the host when I was doing the,</v>

909
00:53:30.031 --> 00:53:30.864
you know,

910
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:36.120
and usually you draw old people cause it's like a seven o'clock show in

911
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:38.190
Montreal,
a second old Jewish town.

912
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:43.380
And I have fucking choked on my own semen in front of these crowds.

913
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.850
And this time it was like Dane's fans and they were young and fucking excite.

914
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:52.050
He went out and killed first and it was all Boston guys was Bobby Kelly,
me,

915
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:55.970
Gary Gulman,
Dane,
um,
uh oh.

916
00:53:55.971 --> 00:54:00.630
And Alonzo Boden and Harland Williams.
Everybody had a great time.

917
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.460
It was such a fucking relief.

918
00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:03.810
<v 5>Oh that's cool.
Yeah.</v>

919
00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:07.930
I think that whole old people thing or that's from a different era.

920
00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:11.200
I've been hearing that the,
the,
the comedy festivals have um,

921
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:13.600
skewed younger and younger these days.
No,

922
00:54:13.601 --> 00:54:15.450
just this one particular shot of the gala.

923
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:17.700
<v 1>TV taping?
No,
no,</v>

924
00:54:17.701 --> 00:54:22.620
I'm saying they do like seven Gal during the week and each night they do one.

925
00:54:22.621 --> 00:54:25.620
So the one I was on had a much younger crowd than the other ones.

926
00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.430
<v 5>Oh.
So they did have ones with a lot of older folks cause it's a tape TV show.</v>

927
00:54:29.431 --> 00:54:31.340
So they buy the tickets way in advance.

928
00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:35.750
Oh see cause I always felt like the people that had been going to the comedy

929
00:54:35.751 --> 00:54:40.110
festival,
we're sort of,
there was a lot of like,
um,

930
00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.860
when we started going,
I,
the first time I went,

931
00:54:42.861 --> 00:54:47.861
I think it was 93 and there was still that push to be TV clean.

932
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:50.240
Right.
And they were also,

933
00:54:50.241 --> 00:54:54.680
like the gala was only TV clean so I never got to work at.
So I,

934
00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:59.660
but from what I would think now is that you see all these clips from the thing

935
00:54:59.661 --> 00:55:01.820
and then it's on the internet and then stand up.

936
00:55:01.821 --> 00:55:03.470
Comedy becomes more and more popular,

937
00:55:03.471 --> 00:55:07.970
which I think stand up comedy is probably at,
at one of its more popular times.

938
00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:10.970
If you stop and think about like how many really good comedians there are right

939
00:55:10.971 --> 00:55:13.240
now,
it's unbelievable.
That's,
it blew me away

940
00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:17.390
<v 1>trail.
I was like,
this is a 100 comics here and they're all fucking good.</v>

941
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:17.761
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

942
00:55:17.761 --> 00:55:20.760
And I would think that it would be a lot of young people that would show up now

943
00:55:20.761 --> 00:55:23.820
to these things.
I think the other ones,
like I did moon tower,

944
00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:28.180
<v 1>which is in Austin,
Texas back in like April or May and that was very young.</v>

945
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:32.770
And then you've got south by South West.
I mean Coachella does a comedy stage.

946
00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:36.930
Bumbershoot in Seattle.
Chicago has a big one.
Um,

947
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.760
San Francisco has a sketch fest.
Um,

948
00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:41.890
<v 5>did you know there's a million of them.</v>

949
00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:45.360
It's hilarious that some of them don't pay the artists they did.

950
00:55:45.361 --> 00:55:50.260
They'd literally a mantra I'll pays.
Yeah,
Montreal pays.
Yeah.
They've always paid.

951
00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:53.170
They paid back in 1993 when I first started doing it.
Right.

952
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.050
But like south by southwest doesn't give you anything

953
00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:56.621
<v 1>now.</v>

954
00:55:56.621 --> 00:56:00.610
And the only reason I did Moontower is I was headlining cap city in Austin that

955
00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:00.611
week.

956
00:56:00.611 --> 00:56:03.730
So I was making my headline or money and I was part of the festival at the same

957
00:56:03.731 --> 00:56:04.140
time.

958
00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:07.860
<v 5>Did you do shows before or after your shows at Cap City?</v>

959
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:12.870
<v 1>I know I would do,
you know,
eight o'clock show Thursday to Friday to Saturday,</v>

960
00:56:12.871 --> 00:56:16.830
but then beef.
But then after my shows I would go do like midnight shows.

961
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:21.190
But then also the people at the festival with the,
you know,
the,
the,
um,
the,
um,

962
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:25.840
customers,
they,
Dave would have a laminate and they'd go see my show maybe,

963
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:29.110
and then they see posts sane show after that.
It was part of the whole thing.

964
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.490
<v 5>Wow,
that's awesome man.
Sounds like a good time.</v>

965
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:37.410
<v 1>You should do it because they do some theater shows and it is a fucking cool</v>

966
00:56:37.411 --> 00:56:40.800
vibe.
It likes Stan Hope.
Was there hung out with standard?
No,

967
00:56:40.801 --> 00:56:42.810
I'm thinking Tom Rhodes was there like guys,

968
00:56:42.811 --> 00:56:47.370
I never fucking see and,
and the crowds are,
I mean,

969
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:51.390
you work Austin though.
The greatest crowds.
I was just there.

970
00:56:51.391 --> 00:56:54.690
I guess those are like five or six months ago he got to do Moontower.

971
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.710
I'll do it if I can.
I don't know.
I'm so fucking busy these days.
Yeah.

972
00:56:58.711 --> 00:57:03.510
But this one is,
this is a rejuvenative week where yous,
you chill,
you feel,

973
00:57:03.511 --> 00:57:07.770
you walk away,
you've seen some good new comedy,
reconnected with some friends,

974
00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:08.160
Dunston.

975
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.150
<v 5>So like a a comedian meeting hub,
right?
Yeah.</v>

976
00:57:12.151 --> 00:57:16.350
That's what Montreal always felt like.
That bar,
that co to the delta,

977
00:57:16.351 --> 00:57:19.140
is that what it's called?
Right?
Yeah.
That bar.
That's right.
Yeah.

978
00:57:19.141 --> 00:57:21.330
That bar is always been,
you know,

979
00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.070
<v 1>it can be landmines though,</v>

980
00:57:23.071 --> 00:57:25.680
because you never know where you're gonna run into that one shitty club on or

981
00:57:25.681 --> 00:57:29.550
who's going to be in your face or gay comedian who's drunk and ruthlessly

982
00:57:29.551 --> 00:57:33.450
aggressively pursuing you.
He's the only time I've ever done my rarer.

983
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:37.220
<v 5>No,
Tom can kiss me anytime you want.
I don't let them penetrate,</v>

984
00:57:37.221 --> 00:57:41.020
but she wants a kiss me and jerk off.
I love him.
Um,

985
00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.600
I'm playing pool with dom on Sunday.
Looking forward to it.

986
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.840
<v 1>I love seeing him.
Somebody I always see at the clubs too.</v>

987
00:57:47.841 --> 00:57:49.790
Like I'll be at the Improv at one in the morning.
You walk.

988
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:55.090
<v 5>Yeah.
Dom's legit to the,
to the end.
He's a legit standup comedian.
Always working.</v>

989
00:57:55.091 --> 00:57:58.810
Always has a notebook with them.
I always got new shit,
you know,
he's just awesome

990
00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:02.730
<v 1>and he's got that energy before he goes on.
Just the way good comics did.</v>

991
00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:06.600
Still not nervous,
but yes.
Asked up,
hyper focused.

992
00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.320
<v 5>He loves it and he's always loved it.
We've been friends.</v>

993
00:58:09.321 --> 00:58:12.770
Dom and I have been friends since [inaudible] 93 I met him in [inaudible] 93

994
00:58:12.771 --> 00:58:13.720
when I did a,

995
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:18.200
the festival in Montreal and then we became friends after we ran into each other

996
00:58:18.201 --> 00:58:22.940
at Amsterdam billiards.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Cause I had just done that show with them.

997
00:58:22.941 --> 00:58:25.430
But that was the first time I'd ever met him.
And he's the host of it.

998
00:58:25.431 --> 00:58:29.530
It was a showtime thing.
And then when we went,
uh,
to play at Amsterdam,

999
00:58:29.531 --> 00:58:33.800
I found out he could play pool angel like renders club.
Yeah.
The,
and the old one,

1000
00:58:33.801 --> 00:58:36.560
remember the old one that was on the upper west side?
That one was awesome.

1001
00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.920
He would,
so I've been friends with dom since,
uh,
I guess it was like 93.

1002
00:58:39.921 --> 00:58:42.300
He's always been that way.
It's always been like a real comic.

1003
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:46.820
<v 1>And he's like the Don Gavin of La.
He will talk to any young comic,</v>

1004
00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:50.930
be funny with them,
bust their balls and uh,
treats you with,

1005
00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.270
he says nice things to you.
You don't get enough of that.

1006
00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:56.660
He's compliment you if you do a new bit that he likes.
He's a beautiful person.

1007
00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.950
<v 5>Yeah.
I love dot Merera with,
with all my heart.
He's beautiful.</v>

1008
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:04.740
I love being around him.
He's fucking hilarious.
He goes,
sweet,
warm guy.

1009
00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.610
<v 1>Some say the other night,
he goes,
ah,</v>

1010
00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:10.520
I'm at the age where if I died of natural causes,
people go,
hmm.

1011
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.830
<v 5>And the other one he said,
he said,
I wish I was gay.</v>

1012
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:21.350
Just so I could come out of the closet.
That's how little I give a fuck.

1013
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:27.550
I'm bored.
I need something fun to do with Edo.

1014
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.890
He really does not care what people think about him.

1015
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:35.360
And he's happy with who he is.
He's not struggling with that.
So,
but yet,

1016
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.620
plus he's on Xanax,
so he's like,
whatever.
I don't give a fuck why.

1017
00:59:38.621 --> 00:59:41.360
I knew he quit drinking for a little while.
I don't know if you've asked it.
Well,

1018
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:46.120
he got a little out of the,
he was a little out of control slightly,

1019
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:47.750
but he not nothing.

1020
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:51.590
He's smart enough to like pull back on his own and then he resumed casual

1021
00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:55.490
drinking.
All right.
But,
uh,
I think,
uh,
look,
it's easy.

1022
00:59:55.491 --> 00:59:56.690
You're a single guy.

1023
00:59:56.691 --> 00:59:59.990
You're in clubs every night and he's in clubs almost every night.

1024
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.290
It's easy to start drinking a lot.
It's fun.
Fun.
Yeah,
it's fun.

1025
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.360
You're having a good time.
Then you have a couple of shots.

1026
01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:07.130
Now you're having a great time.
Woo.

1027
01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:12.340
But you know that the crushing effect that has on your body over and over and

1028
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:14.120
over again,
it's right.
Bad for him.

1029
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.390
<v 4>All right.
I Miss Drinking,
man.
Fuck.
I just had my family stay with me for a week.</v>

1030
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:23.220
My sister,
her husband who drinks and uh,

1031
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:26.300
my niece and nephew and my mother all stay into my,

1032
01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.640
my house with my wife for two,
nine of us.
Oh cry.
But you know what?

1033
01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.330
And I miss drinking because they would all drank a lot at night.

1034
01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.980
They'd go through bottles and bottles of wine and my uh,

1035
01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:40.890
brother-in-law go through a couple of six pack of Budweiser and uh,

1036
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.780
and so you start to really feel it.

1037
01:00:42.781 --> 01:00:45.640
Like even my wife who doesn't drink a lot was drinking everyday.

1038
01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.080
So I'm all alone.
I'm drinking non alcoholic beer is,

1039
01:00:49.081 --> 01:00:53.070
and I'm playing fucking playstation when my kids,
cause I can't relate to people,

1040
01:00:53.071 --> 01:00:57.660
get people get fucking dumb and boring when they drink.
I'm sorry,

1041
01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.690
it's nice at first,
but if you're the sober one,

1042
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:05.870
everybody gets emphatic about their point of view and an overly zealous about

1043
01:01:05.911 --> 01:01:10.080
simple thoughts.
And uh,
you just start to feel yourself squeezed out.

1044
01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:14.910
They start to feel like people are looking at you like you're the uptight guy

1045
01:01:14.911 --> 01:01:17.070
and you can't have a good time.

1046
01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.330
And so I want to go to counterpoint on what you just said.
Unless,

1047
01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:23.700
unless everyone drinks the Kool aid,
it's not fun.

1048
01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:26.560
<v 5>Well,
it depends on who you're drinking with.
If you drink it with idiots,</v>

1049
01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:28.270
you're going to have that product.
And about my family.

1050
01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:31.750
I'm talking about your phone.
I'm calling them idiots.
I'm calling mine too.

1051
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:36.640
My wife,
everyone's an idiot.
I'm an idiot.
You're an idiot as well.

1052
01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:41.050
It's all in the level of idiot,
right?
And with a certain level of idiot,

1053
01:01:41.051 --> 01:01:44.200
when they get drunk,
it becomes really boring because it becomes,
oh,

1054
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.990
you're not really good at this.
Oh,
I see what we're doing.
So we're going to,

1055
01:01:46.991 --> 01:01:47.250
we're,
we're,

1056
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:49.540
we're going to do here is we're going to play a game that you suck at.

1057
01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.510
It's like two fat guys playing basketball.

1058
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:55.940
Neither one of them have any experience.
Bounce it around looking stupid.
And,

1059
01:01:56.110 --> 01:02:00.940
and for a person that can communicate well and is sober,
it's a real problem.

1060
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.760
It's,
you're dragging me into the mud.

1061
01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.890
<v 4>You want to say to them,
look at the top of your game.
I struggle to find you.</v>

1062
01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:10.320
Interesting.
Now you're drunk.

1063
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:14.750
<v 5>But then towards counter point is some people are cool as fuck when they're</v>

1064
01:02:14.751 --> 01:02:17.450
drunk.
Some people are fun to talk to when they're drunk,

1065
01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:20.220
they tell you hilarious stories and they flow good.

1066
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.160
It just loosens him up enough so they can catch a wave.

1067
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.760
<v 4>Yeah.
You don't judge yourself as much.
So the rail,
you can come out.
Yeah,</v>

1068
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.420
<v 5>you can catch a wave and if you can catch like one of those social waves,</v>

1069
01:02:30.421 --> 01:02:31.400
it can be really fun.

1070
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:33.980
<v 4>And then you've got to maintain that wave correctly.
Correct.</v>

1071
01:02:33.981 --> 01:02:36.680
You have to know don't underfeed it.
Don't overfeed it.

1072
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:40.050
<v 5>Yeah.
It's um,
it's a tricky thing,
man.</v>

1073
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:43.860
Drinking correctly is like something so much teach you.

1074
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.390
<v 4>Yeah.
I really envy you because you seem to really enjoy it when I see you do it,</v>

1075
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.900
but yet you don't have to do it all at a time.
That must be so nice.

1076
01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:56.880
<v 5>Yeah.
I,
and I recognize that it's most likely a genetic thing.</v>

1077
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.290
The most of my friends

1078
01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:02.500
<v 4>father died at 53.
He was an alcoholic,
three out of four of my grandparents,</v>

1079
01:03:02.501 --> 01:03:03.910
all my aunts and uncles.

1080
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:08.220
<v 5>And there's so much evidence as far as like American Indians who didn't have a</v>

1081
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.040
ta and exposure to

1082
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.110
<v 4>La.
It's also their livers and Irish livers.</v>

1083
01:03:13.111 --> 01:03:15.600
Process of alcohol better.

1084
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:18.820
<v 5>Yeah.
Well because they have a long history of use.
Yeah.</v>

1085
01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:22.850
What happened with the native Americans is they weren't drinking as much alcohol

1086
01:03:22.851 --> 01:03:26.000
and not nearly as much as westerners that came here.

1087
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:27.380
So when they introduced it to them,

1088
01:03:27.381 --> 01:03:30.110
this is like a drug they had no social experience with,

1089
01:03:30.111 --> 01:03:32.360
which is always a big one,
you know?
So maybe it's like,

1090
01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.760
remember when you were a teenager,
the first time you got drunk,

1091
01:03:34.761 --> 01:03:39.680
how terrible you were at.
It takes a long time to know where your tolerances are,

1092
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:42.920
how to do it,
how not to be a sloppy bitch.
It takes a while.

1093
01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.780
<v 4>Fit shots in general are not a good idea.
Yeah.</v>

1094
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:50.400
<v 5>When you just go straight to hard liquor and you're 30 and you've been eating</v>

1095
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:54.340
fucking deer that you chase down and killed.
Right.
Peo,
yeah.
And all.

1096
01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.780
And then all of a sudden you're just drowning in whiskey and they,

1097
01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:00.640
you have no experience,
no cultural experience to fall back on.
Oh,

1098
01:04:00.641 --> 01:04:02.850
Grandpa told me what this was about.
When you get drunk,

1099
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.100
which you've got to do is start off slow.
Boy,

1100
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:07.280
make sure you got food in your stomach that's gonna fill.

1101
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.870
There's none of that going on.
No one even knows what the fuck it is.
Yeah.

1102
01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:13.780
<v 4>And then the white man forces it on them because they realize that pliant they</v>

1103
01:04:13.781 --> 01:04:15.850
become when they're drunk.
Yeah.
So it was like,

1104
01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:19.090
we'll pay you in whiskey and then sign this fucking treaty.

1105
01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.510
Give me New York for a nickel.
A lot of,

1106
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.880
a lot of bad real estate deals were done drunk,

1107
01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:28.210
whether it's at a high class hotel and you know,

1108
01:04:28.211 --> 01:04:31.360
Donald Trump just fucking sauced you up or you're an Indian.

1109
01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.610
<v 5>Well,
how much did they pay for Alaska?
Was that a good deal?</v>

1110
01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:37.540
Where'd they buy from?
The Russians believe they bought it from the Russians.

1111
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:40.580
The Russians like,
listen,
we've got more than we can handle.

1112
01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:44.060
You want to take that spot right?
Good.
Take that spot.
And when you look at a map,

1113
01:04:44.061 --> 01:04:47.930
it's one of the most ridiculous ideas ever that that's somehow or another as a

1114
01:04:47.931 --> 01:04:48.620
part of it.

1115
01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:52.490
<v 4>Oh,
no second most ridiculous idea.
Hawaii.
Yeah.</v>

1116
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.310
He's pretty ridiculous telling me there's like a hundred countries closer to

1117
01:04:55.311 --> 01:04:59.660
Hawaii than the United States.
And we treat it like,
and somehow like,

1118
01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:05.120
I don't know the history,
I mean,
it's almost like we sought and we went,
uh,

1119
01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:09.320
yeah,
we're going to take that.
And you guys,
you guys can be citizens.

1120
01:05:09.321 --> 01:05:11.450
You can vote,
you can come here.
Meanwhile,

1121
01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:14.240
we've got Mexico lined up against the board of her.
Like,

1122
01:05:14.241 --> 01:05:17.980
you can't fucking come here.
But Hawaiians,
come on.

1123
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.750
<v 2>Well,
Mexico is way bigger.
Hawaii's,</v>

1124
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:25.000
it's just a few little tiny islands and people seem nice and they know how to

1125
01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:27.340
cook a pig in the ground.
Let's just fucking work this out.

1126
01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:31.390
And that's where the missiles,
have you seen the feed on their women defeat?
Oh,

1127
01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.060
beautiful.
Little feet.
Yeah.
And they,
they do that.
A Hula dance.
Whoa.
Hey,

1128
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:39.520
hula dance.
Is that what they call it?
Um,
yeah,
isn't it?
I was there,

1129
01:05:39.521 --> 01:05:41.140
I suppose skirts,
the grass skirts.

1130
01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:44.260
My wife took me to Luau and we were in Hawaii and I fucking,

1131
01:05:44.261 --> 01:05:46.200
I hate anything commercial and tourist the,

1132
01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:49.150
especially when you're in Hawaii and you're hiking in the rain forest and

1133
01:05:49.151 --> 01:05:53.440
fucking serving as,
she's like,
we're going to a Luau.
So,
um,
I was pissed.

1134
01:05:53.441 --> 01:05:57.130
So I smoked a joint and not even a joint.
I smoked a couple of heads,

1135
01:05:57.131 --> 01:05:58.660
you know what I mean?
And uh,

1136
01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:03.340
and then I just fucking sat in the front row of the Luau and you're their feet.

1137
01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.710
The women's feet were like three feet in front of me,
you know,

1138
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.600
they're kind of like rolling on the toes and moving around on them.
I

1139
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:17.230
did.
You get hard.
Yeah.
Wow.
Just by looking at the feet,
you don't like nice fee.

1140
01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:20.530
Yeah,
absolutely.
I feel you.
I hear where you're coming from.

1141
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.850
It's a weird thing that like,
uh,
we,
we valued that.
Like what is that genetically?

1142
01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:28.810
Is that,
what does that to me,
it's that they're hidden.

1143
01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.650
People wear shoes.
So it's almost like nudity today.
Like,

1144
01:06:32.651 --> 01:06:36.310
I'm not supposed to see your little toes and it's,
they move around like fingers,

1145
01:06:36.311 --> 01:06:38.290
but they're weird cause she hide them most of the time.

1146
01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:42.070
Their fingers at your ride.
I got leather,
the creepy,
right.

1147
01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:45.790
I got a massage yesterday and I had my head in the little doughnut thing and I

1148
01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:50.660
was looking down and this Asian woman,
she,
she was barefoot and she had I,

1149
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:54.640
I'm sorry,
but Asian feed or better white women's feet are all fucked up.

1150
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.540
They're like the,
you know,
one toe is like an inch longer than the other one.

1151
01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:01.990
Did you jerk off to this?
Yes.
Right.
Yeah,
I will for sure.
Yeah.

1152
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.400
You know what's really sad to me is when women get that thing where their toes

1153
01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:10.840
start pointing towards the big toes towards pointing left or right towards the

1154
01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:12.540
other toe.
Hammer toe.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1155
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:17.290
From jamming their feet into shoes that just smoosh them.
Well,
it's genetic also.

1156
01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.800
Is it really?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you can get it without those shoes,
right?

1157
01:07:20.801 --> 01:07:24.850
It's just a bone that grows out and it's like a bone issue.

1158
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:28.600
So the same thing or it can happen both ways.

1159
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.840
So either you can get it naturally or you can get it from shoes.

1160
01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.620
I know you can get it naturally,
but he does.
I've seen it run in families.

1161
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:39.040
You get it from shoes.
I think it's all natural because like I have,

1162
01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:41.860
I think some people have like that ridiculous small toe.

1163
01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:46.740
Like the retarded toe that goes over got barely has a nail.
The nail.

1164
01:07:46.741 --> 01:07:51.010
It's like taking the right turn right turn or it's stacked on the one next door.

1165
01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:54.400
Stacked like that.
And I'm like,
why are you wearing flip flops?

1166
01:07:54.401 --> 01:07:58.900
Your toe is all fucked up.
Put some shoes on.
I saw this one lady at the beach,

1167
01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:02.680
she was this old lady and uh,
she had,
it was,
it was like,

1168
01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:06.070
it was a sketch in an in living color moving,
you know,

1169
01:08:06.071 --> 01:08:10.420
like her toes were so fucked up.
Like they were going over each other.

1170
01:08:10.421 --> 01:08:14.350
I crossing fingers.
I mean I had never seen anything like it.
Yeah.
It was like a,

1171
01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.980
like a picket fence that got hit

1172
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.140
<v 5>with a missile.
I mean,
the whole thing was just,</v>

1173
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:22.220
it was all just collapsed over itself.
And I like this is the most,

1174
01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.620
it was like she's throwing gang signs with their feet.

1175
01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.450
It was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in my life.
Like,

1176
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:33.550
and she's wearing red locks off her feet.
I mean her teeth hurt,

1177
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:34.460
they were tangled.

1178
01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:39.240
<v 4>And it is true.
I think you've got to earn a pair of flip flops.
You got to,
uh,</v>

1179
01:08:39.570 --> 01:08:43.620
you got to really take a good look at your feet like an Asian foot.
The toes are,

1180
01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:44.850
does a perfect arc.

1181
01:08:44.851 --> 01:08:48.210
It's like a 33 degree curvature from the big toe to the pinky.

1182
01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:52.320
That pinky is well laid out with a full nail.
There's,
um,

1183
01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:56.310
there's no fucking discoloration on the nails themselves,
a thin ankle.

1184
01:08:56.790 --> 01:09:00.600
And then you get on a real,
on a good southeastern Asian,

1185
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:05.780
you get like a brownish tannish on the top and then the sides,

1186
01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:10.020
it becomes very light,
like almost like a Nilla vanilla wafer.

1187
01:09:10.650 --> 01:09:13.410
And uh,
is that from the lack of the will to live?

1188
01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:17.120
<v 5>Hey,
we have a,
we have,
we're wrong.
It's been running.
And Napalm.</v>

1189
01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:22.300
Bunyan Bunyan on that Hammertoe is when girls,

1190
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:25.460
the very end of their,
um,
their digit,

1191
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:30.560
they protrude the kind of bulge up right.
That is from shoes.
Got To hammer toe.

1192
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:34.040
That's a different thing kind of Bunyan is when the big tail has a curve on the

1193
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:38.510
side.
Yeah.
The total takes a turn towards the,
towards the other toes,

1194
01:09:38.511 --> 01:09:41.780
the big toe hooks,
right or left and it gets worse.

1195
01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:45.770
This is actually disagreement among medical medical professionals about the

1196
01:09:45.771 --> 01:09:46.670
cause of Bunyan's.

1197
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:50.810
Some see them as primarily caused by longterm use of shoes,

1198
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:53.930
particularly tight fitting shoes with pointed toes.
While other belief,

1199
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:58.580
the problem stems from genetic factors that are exacerbated by shoe use.

1200
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:02.480
Hmm.
Yeah.
You know,
could be very possibly it's,

1201
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.020
I would tend to think that it might be shoes because uh,

1202
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.110
I think it's way more on women that I see it on men.

1203
01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:14.380
<v 4>I cannot believe women put on those stiletto type shoes.
I mean,
I like it,</v>

1204
01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:18.700
but I look at them and I go,
man,
what a,
what a price to pay all.
Like,

1205
01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:22.060
even when I'm out at a club all night,
my feet are fucking tired.

1206
01:10:22.061 --> 01:10:23.170
I'm wearing sneakers.

1207
01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.820
And then to think that you're perched up on this thing that your toes are jammed

1208
01:10:27.821 --> 01:10:31.150
into and you're at a 45 degree angle,
it's just,

1209
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:33.460
it's really archaic to me.

1210
01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:35.580
<v 5>It's crazy.
Well,
Brian,
what was that last one?</v>

1211
01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:39.330
The woman had like fingers for toes.
Would it pull that video back on again?

1212
01:10:39.331 --> 01:10:44.280
That was ridiculous.
That's how black women,
black women grow.

1213
01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:46.950
They showed three seconds ago was like,
I can find it.

1214
01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:51.780
Boss can get some other the do it,
man.
Black women tend to grow.

1215
01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:55.580
There we go.
So what the fuck,
man,
listen,
I don't want to see this.

1216
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.630
Some guys are into,
I want to see some dude.

1217
01:10:57.631 --> 01:11:02.460
She just came from the gym or like they walk in dirt and really guys let them,

1218
01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.520
yeah,
they liked that.
Hey,
come on for real.
I don't want to see this,
but the,

1219
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.020
<v 4>um,
black women tend to grow the big toenail longer,
which bothers me.</v>

1220
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.980
Sexy.
Do you like that case?

1221
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.270
<v 1>They want to snort some coke off
and I'll let you know.
They're ready to party.</v>

1222
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.010
Yo Baby,
you want to tell blast?

1223
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:24.510
<v 5>Have you ever seen the photo where a woman and African American woman has a</v>

1224
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:28.650
gigantic toenails?
All of them.
And it says ghettos.

1225
01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:35.760
They do.
You never seen that look up ghettos?
Yes.
Wait,
no,

1226
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:37.410
no,
no.
That's not what we're looking at.
Look,

1227
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.830
there's images do a Google image search.
He's just trying to sneak in.

1228
01:11:40.831 --> 01:11:42.680
Dude's sucking on total creep.

1229
01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:45.750
But Duncan Trussell said the funniest fucking thing the other day.

1230
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:50.070
He was a joking around about someone,
someone,
uh,

1231
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.230
who is attractive but was mean.

1232
01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:55.740
It was saying something stupid on Fox News and he was like,
she goes,

1233
01:11:55.741 --> 01:11:58.980
stop talking and just put your feet in my mouth.

1234
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.830
<v 1>I'm telling you crying,
laughing on the phone.</v>

1235
01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:10.670
[inaudible] that's ghettos.

1236
01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:15.670
Okay.
Can you mention here at this walking like on a wooden floor?

1237
01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:19.450
Just the sound of her nails hitting my could.
It'd be hot.

1238
01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.850
No one she's about a foot fetish is going to take off.

1239
01:12:21.851 --> 01:12:25.900
And I believe it started with me.
I've been talking about the two years publicly.

1240
01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.660
Oh.
[inaudible] been around for a long time.
Been around.

1241
01:12:28.661 --> 01:12:31.990
I'm talking about it going mainstream and talking about it longer than two
years,

1242
01:12:31.991 --> 01:12:36.370
man,
maybe five.
Have you ever had a foot in you,
Greg?
Now

1243
01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:40.180
<v 5>one of the Times that we did your serious show,
you were,</v>

1244
01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:42.400
you were talking about having a foot foot and it was a long time

1245
01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.770
<v 1>and the funny thing is I don't act on it.
Like I,
I've never,</v>

1246
01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.790
I've never liked sucked on someone's toes and it's just,

1247
01:12:49.791 --> 01:12:50.810
I enjoy looking at them.

1248
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:55.010
<v 5>So do you enjoy looking at them in real life?
As much as on video or on video?</v>

1249
01:12:55.011 --> 01:12:56.210
More than real life.
Which one?

1250
01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:58.680
<v 1>In real life?
I'm on the lookout all the time.
All the time.</v>

1251
01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.220
She just store the memories.
I'm looking down a lot and I,
here's what I also do,

1252
01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.930
if I see a woman I predict in my head whether she has open toed sandals and what

1253
01:13:07.931 --> 01:13:10.870
the feet are going to look like and I'm,
I'm pretty right on it.

1254
01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.650
<v 5>If a woman has like really pretty feet,</v>

1255
01:13:13.651 --> 01:13:16.230
will you store that and then jerk off to them later?

1256
01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.950
<v 1>No,
never.
I can't store shit for jerk off.
I need immediate high center</v>

1257
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.200
<v 5>right in front of you.
Right.</v>

1258
01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:25.290
There's never been a time where you took a few days off and you really had a

1259
01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:26.124
build up?

1260
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.260
<v 1>Nope.
No.
Now when I only watched foot porn because I'm friends with gross shit,</v>

1261
01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:33.160
man affected pus coming down.

1262
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:37.350
What I want to say that I only watched it because Bella,

1263
01:13:37.351 --> 01:13:39.240
Donna is a friend of mine and she,
you know,

1264
01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:43.260
she does a six foot foot foot soldiers as her whole.

1265
01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:47.730
She singled her.
She just got single no shit that maybe that's not known,

1266
01:13:47.731 --> 01:13:51.750
but wow,
that's a good news.
Yeah.
Her husband's a good dude,

1267
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:56.700
but he managed so that's always a bad thing.
He what?
He managed her,

1268
01:13:56.730 --> 01:14:00.840
which is always a bad thing.
It's a tough sell.
Right?
Yeah.
That's so strange.

1269
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:07.310
It happened with Tara Patrick and that due to the rocker dude.

1270
01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:12.240
Yeah.
It was in all of our porn.
He was bad news.
Fascinating when?

1271
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.020
When guys like,

1272
01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.740
<v 5>not like Mary a porn star,
but she still works,
but no,</v>

1273
01:14:15.741 --> 01:14:18.830
he fucks her and all the films,
like a couple of mainstream.
Yeah.

1274
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:21.620
<v 1>You know who he's with now.
He's with that little loop.
Hey girl,</v>

1275
01:14:21.621 --> 01:14:24.710
they drill a peanut like within,

1276
01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.320
within a month that he broke up a terror.
Patrick,

1277
01:14:27.321 --> 01:14:32.170
he's with another porn star managing her and likes it crazy.
Yeah.

1278
01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:35.680
Does he only banger or does she bang other dudes?
I have no idea how to talk.

1279
01:14:35.690 --> 01:14:36.141
It's tricky.

1280
01:14:36.141 --> 01:14:41.100
He yelled at me cause I w I cohosted the porn awards with Tara Patrick.

1281
01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:44.600
So I went to her house one time and he was there and I asked him,
I go,

1282
01:14:44.601 --> 01:14:47.690
so are you allowed to fuck around?
He's like,
no I don't.
He goes,

1283
01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:51.530
this one massage place I go to right over here in the valley.
And uh,
you know,

1284
01:14:51.531 --> 01:14:53.930
I get jerked off at the end,
but that's it.

1285
01:14:53.931 --> 01:14:57.770
And he's like in goes there from massages too.
And I was like,
you know,

1286
01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.700
that ain't fucking true.
But that was their press release on the issue.

1287
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:06.860
Who Cares?
That could easily be true.
That could be true.
I did it with my ex.

1288
01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:10.400
We both went to the same at the same time.
Why did I do get mad at you?

1289
01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:16.210
<v 7>Cause I said to LoopPay because I noticed that she was back in town.
I was like,</v>

1290
01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:16.391
Hey,

1291
01:15:16.391 --> 01:15:20.210
I would really like to get you on a that that podcast I do with Dan and Dearman

1292
01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:24.760
a triple x squad.
And uh,
he wrote back,
look,

1293
01:15:24.761 --> 01:15:27.730
mother Fucker,
I told you she does not want to do your stupid shit,
blah,
blah,

1294
01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.010
like just start going off on me like five tweets.

1295
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:32.470
And then I wrote back something like,
Dude,
sorry,

1296
01:15:32.471 --> 01:15:34.810
just asked her if she wanted to do a podcast,
I would help her out.

1297
01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:38.260
And then like all these people on Twitter just started like going,
what the fuck?

1298
01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:41.350
It was like six months ago.
And then he eventually apologized,

1299
01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:45.100
sent me a direct message like,
sorry man,
here's my email address and blah,
blah,

1300
01:15:45.101 --> 01:15:46.480
blah.
I thought you were somebody else.

1301
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:50.290
<v 1>Oh.
And I think some guy,
I think he gets,</v>

1302
01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.330
she gets harassed a lot by him.
Of course.
She knows man.
Just being,

1303
01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.330
<v 5>of course.</v>

1304
01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:58.340
Could you imagine being a porn star on the Internet and having everyone just be

1305
01:15:58.341 --> 01:16:02.920
able to tweet you?
Yeah.
Oh,
the fucking shirt for women must have to deal with.

1306
01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.560
Yeah.
Because of the sexual repression that we have.

1307
01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:10.880
Like they take the brunt of it.
Like,
like if anybody in this country,
it's,

1308
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:14.480
if you're allowed to call them a slut or a cunt,
it's like a porn star.

1309
01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.910
It's like the things that guys say to porn.

1310
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:20.270
I've seen some of this shit guys have said to porn.
So I was like,
well,

1311
01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:23.610
will yield some girl being your feed complaining.
Like it's,

1312
01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:27.920
it's hard to believe some of the fucking creeps that tweet me.
And then,
you know,

1313
01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:30.350
and then you'll go to her Twitter page and see her responding.

1314
01:16:30.351 --> 01:16:34.670
Then you read the things that they're saying mean fucking heartless,

1315
01:16:34.671 --> 01:16:38.750
creepy shit that you're
exactly,

1316
01:16:38.751 --> 01:16:41.470
you're only allowed to see in their mind.
Like it's,

1317
01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.970
it's rare that I think a girl,
like,

1318
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:48.590
let's pick a name of a famous actress who's feel around who's on Twitter though.

1319
01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:54.140
Jenny McCarthy.
Jenny McCarthy gets hate because of like the,
the virus thing,

1320
01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:57.950
right?
A vaccination thing.
Or she gets a lot of heat because of that.

1321
01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.160
I just read some whole article about this.
Uh,

1322
01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:04.850
this the doctor was actually reading an article about how unfair it is and how

1323
01:17:04.851 --> 01:17:09.000
much a heat she takes for having a controversial assessment on,
uh,

1324
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:09.920
on vaccination.

1325
01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.880
<v 1>Yeah.
I think that it was irresponsible</v>

1326
01:17:11.890 --> 01:17:15.850
<v 5>for her.
It's a very responsible,
but it's also what she really believed.
You know,</v>

1327
01:17:15.851 --> 01:17:18.790
she really believes that at the time,
you know,
I don't know if she still does,

1328
01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.880
but then I looked up all the things that have been caused by vaccinations and

1329
01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.550
that's where it's another one of those abortion type things.

1330
01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:32.560
It's like vaccinations for sure are not just beneficial.

1331
01:17:32.561 --> 01:17:35.800
They probably extended the life of many people in this country.

1332
01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:40.660
They've stopped diseases like polio,
nip that shit.
Right.
Basically in the bud,

1333
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:44.080
you know,
stopped measles in bump mumps in a lot of places because of it.

1334
01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.440
I'm a firm believer,
I'm a firm believer,
don't get me wrong,

1335
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:51.400
but people have been damaged by vaccines.
That's a fact too.

1336
01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:55.360
It's a small percentage and most scientists believe that it's worth the risk.

1337
01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.400
But there's people that have been damaged by vaccines that are no longer on the

1338
01:18:00.401 --> 01:18:02.040
market and no longer available.
Right.

1339
01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:07.050
Glaxo Smith Klein used to have a vaccine for Lyme disease,

1340
01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.800
but the problem is if you have,
you're only,
you can only,

1341
01:18:11.801 --> 01:18:14.290
you only safely can take this vaccine.

1342
01:18:14.291 --> 01:18:17.740
If you have a certain gene or if you're lacking a certain gene and they have to

1343
01:18:17.741 --> 01:18:21.670
run this like Jean examination on you.
They have to find out what it is.

1344
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:23.080
I'm sorry for butchering this,

1345
01:18:23.081 --> 01:18:28.081
but my friend's dad got Lyme disease from the fucking vaccine.

1346
01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.490
They were going to,
they were going to be hiking.

1347
01:18:30.491 --> 01:18:32.850
They're going to live in Connecticut though.
He took it preemptive.

1348
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:37.000
You took it preemptively and it gave him fucking Lyme disease and all of a

1349
01:18:37.001 --> 01:18:38.050
sudden the guy's like,
bones

1350
01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:38.530
<v 1>heard.</v>

1351
01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:43.530
He came to you is is the most poorly prescribed a disease you can get.

1352
01:18:44.031 --> 01:18:44.690
They,

1353
01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:49.190
they can go after it with cycle after cycle of hardcore antibiotics as sometimes

1354
01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:53.810
they're just chasing it and they can't get it and it fucks you up.
They,
they've,

1355
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:56.240
they need a lot of research on that because it's getting worse.

1356
01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:01.310
<v 5>You know,
the first case of it was less than 20 years ago,
is that right?
Yes.</v>

1357
01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:05.930
In Lyme,
Connecticut.
Lyme disease is reported Lyme disease,

1358
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:08.810
I believe less than 21 years old.
Wow.

1359
01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:14.080
I think they had never had it before or was undiagnosed before or it mutated.

1360
01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:16.550
No one knows exactly,

1361
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:19.960
but it's also connected to this weird thing called [inaudible].

1362
01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.380
Have you ever heard of more general ones?

1363
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:25.640
It's one of the things that we investigated on the pot on this a Scifi show.

1364
01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:30.080
And what was interesting about it was doctors dismiss it right away.

1365
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:33.620
Like you tell someone about more Jones.
I talked to like a really smart doctor.

1366
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:36.470
Like what do you think about more jealous?
I like,
ah,
more challenge.
You know,

1367
01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:37.430
those people are kind of crazy.

1368
01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.050
And I had been to a more Jones conference and I talked to doctors who have more

1369
01:19:42.051 --> 01:19:42.770
challenge.

1370
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:47.150
And one of the weird things is that almost all of them also have Lyme disease.

1371
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:49.640
So this Lyme disease,

1372
01:19:49.641 --> 01:19:54.641
when ticks are such nasty cunts that they have a host of pathogens that they

1373
01:19:55.341 --> 01:19:58.280
carry with them.
Lyme disease being one of them.

1374
01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:03.370
But there may be a bunch of undiagnosed tag alongs and more jealous might be one

1375
01:20:03.561 --> 01:20:07.040
of these.
He's poor fucking people,
man.
They helped us of it.
First of all,

1376
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:10.500
it makes you crazy.
There's,
it fucks with your head.
The lymes disease.

1377
01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:13.980
Does that taste neurological?
Yes,
it uh,
it,
it hurts their,

1378
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:15.360
the way they look at the world.

1379
01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.620
And one of the doctors that I talked to was talking to me about neuro toxicity,

1380
01:20:19.621 --> 01:20:21.510
about how it has a certain amount of neuro toxicity.

1381
01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:26.400
We go pretty deep into it on this show.
Um,
it's,
it's incredibly fast

1382
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:31.420
<v 1>and meanwhile we don't fucking need deers while other being carried now in mice</v>

1383
01:20:31.421 --> 01:20:32.320
as much as dear dog

1384
01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:37.030
<v 5>to,
you know,
the people who have never been around a,</v>

1385
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.160
an area where this is a real issue,
would never understand it.

1386
01:20:40.161 --> 01:20:44.100
But like upstate New York,
it's a real fucking problem.
Like how many deer?

1387
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:47.420
A lot of deer and they carry ticks and those ticks get on people and you get

1388
01:20:47.421 --> 01:20:51.200
Lyme disease and you're fucked and you,
you know,
you like bright lights hurt,

1389
01:20:51.201 --> 01:20:53.900
your joints hurt.
Like it couldn't fucking sleep.

1390
01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:59.020
<v 1>My aunt got it.
And she had to go in once a week for antibiotics.
And,
uh,</v>

1391
01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:01.330
she got diabetes from it,

1392
01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.310
a whole list of shit plus extreme exhaustion.
She could,
she would be up six,

1393
01:21:06.311 --> 01:21:11.200
seven hours a day.
And so,
you know what got rid of it?
What a hysterectomy.

1394
01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:14.860
Oh my God.
She needed a hysterectomy.
And so she got it.

1395
01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.150
And then they found her Lyme disease was gone a few months ago and the doctor

1396
01:21:19.151 --> 01:21:23.020
went,
oh yeah,
yeah,
that happens.
And she's like,
so for 10,

1397
01:21:23.021 --> 01:21:26.620
15 years I've been walking around exhausted in pain,
getting disease.

1398
01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:28.930
And as a woman who was,
you know,

1399
01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.960
50 obviously not having more kids and the doctor didn't bring up that

1400
01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:37.720
hysterectomy would get rid of this disease.

1401
01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.850
How does the hysterectomy get rid of the disease?

1402
01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:43.660
I think it changes your estrogen levels or something.
Wow.

1403
01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.700
I don't know exactly.
Uh,
and again,

1404
01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:50.320
I always have to do a preamble when I do any sort of a recorded spoken thing.

1405
01:21:50.770 --> 01:21:54.220
Um,
I don't know.
As much as I say I do.

1406
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.490
So many times I will put out information that's wrong,

1407
01:21:57.491 --> 01:22:00.130
but I will do it with full confidence.
So yeah.

1408
01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:05.110
So if you want to Google this entire interview,
you will find,
uh,

1409
01:22:05.290 --> 01:22:07.930
no less than three major errors in what I've said.

1410
01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.460
And if you want to tweet me about it,
it's at Greg Fitz show,
point them out.

1411
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:16.930
And I will acknowledge like Sunday [inaudible] who's a doctor,

1412
01:22:17.050 --> 01:22:21.340
Sanjay Gupta.
I will admit I was wrong.
Let's beautiful.
Greg.

1413
01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:26.950
Why not?
Why I changed my mind on weed by Sanjay Gupta.
Oh,
by the way,

1414
01:22:26.951 --> 01:22:28.780
can I plug my dates?
Yeah.
When are you a,

1415
01:22:28.781 --> 01:22:32.440
somewhere I'm going to be coming up in a standup live.

1416
01:22:32.441 --> 01:22:37.180
Do you know the club in Phoenix?
Arizona price is huge when either,
well,

1417
01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:41.120
I'm there next week.
It'll be August,
uh,

1418
01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:46.780
15 through 17,
15 to 17.
And uh,
yeah,

1419
01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.700
I just booked the date a couple weeks ago,
so I need,

1420
01:22:48.701 --> 01:22:52.840
I need the fucking [inaudible] squad people let me know.
I'll tweet,

1421
01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:55.960
tweet something to me.
I'll tweet it.
I will.

1422
01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:00.580
And then I have a one hour special on comedy central coming out on August 18th

1423
01:23:00.581 --> 01:23:03.310
at midnight.
Did you film it?
Tarrytown,
New York,
where?

1424
01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:06.280
I grew up as a theater from 85

1425
01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:09.040
<v 2>wow.
That was in disrepair when I was growing up.</v>

1426
01:23:09.041 --> 01:23:10.270
So it used to be a movie theater.

1427
01:23:10.271 --> 01:23:14.560
I went to see fucking Herbie the love bug there and then they restored it and

1428
01:23:14.561 --> 01:23:15.100
it's this,

1429
01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:20.100
it's got like all the orange h shit and the balcony and it's credible.

1430
01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:22.420
So it was like my family was there,

1431
01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:26.200
my friends and Westchester just fucking turned out.

1432
01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:29.230
Kids I went to grammar school with in high school and college.

1433
01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:33.520
It was an amazing night.
Really Magic.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1434
01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:37.480
You really getting into doing stand up again.
Like you really love it.
And again,

1435
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:39.850
yeah,
a long time.
You did a lot of writing,
right?

1436
01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:42.490
We weren't doing nearly as much stand up now.

1437
01:23:42.491 --> 01:23:45.220
And you know it's funny I talked to Dana Gould recently about it cause you know

1438
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.230
he took time off entirely.
I mean,

1439
01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:51.130
he stopped entirely when he did the Simpsons and now he's back in at the last

1440
01:23:51.131 --> 01:23:53.110
five,
six years.
And you know,
as everybody knows,

1441
01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:57.490
just one of the most respected comics among comics but does not have the,

1442
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.050
the um,
a claim around the country that he should,
because he was,

1443
01:24:02.051 --> 01:24:04.570
he stopped the grit.
He stopped when he was like,

1444
01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:08.660
he was like really respected when we were coming up.
Right.
He was like,
oh,

1445
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:13.240
special,
great comics.
Just a really an interesting comment.
Right.
You know,

1446
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:17.800
I mean interesting points of view.
Yeah.
And a very unique guy.
Yeah.
He stopped,

1447
01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:19.990
it was writing for the Simpsons,
right?
Yeah.

1448
01:24:19.991 --> 01:24:23.120
One Amy's made a ton of fucking dope and also like,
you know,

1449
01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:27.970
had kids wanting to be around a bit.
So,
um,
so for me,
I feel like I never stopped,

1450
01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.400
but I was splitting my time.

1451
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:34.300
Like for 12 years I've worked on TV shows every year,

1452
01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.690
but I've also done on a slow year,

1453
01:24:37.691 --> 01:24:41.500
still 12 weekends a year.
And on a good year I'm still,

1454
01:24:41.501 --> 01:24:46.420
like this year I'll do 26 weekends.
26 is nice.

1455
01:24:46.421 --> 01:24:50.110
That's every two weeks ago on the road.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's how it should be.

1456
01:24:50.111 --> 01:24:53.020
That's good.
That's,
that keeps you from freaking out,
right?

1457
01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:53.854
If you're one of those,

1458
01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:57.610
maybe when you were 21 you could go on the road for like a month and a half or

1459
01:24:57.611 --> 01:25:01.450
two months,
but I can offer those things like let's do a bus tour.
I'm like,

1460
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:03.430
fuck you.
Yeah Dude.

1461
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:07.270
We should do one bus tour for how many of the week do do a week?

1462
01:25:07.271 --> 01:25:10.750
We go to fucking Madison,
Wisconsin and Chicago.
Just route it.

1463
01:25:10.751 --> 01:25:13.630
So you got like two hours between each gig.

1464
01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:16.200
Bill Byrd wanted to do something like that.
He wanted to go to Rick.

1465
01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:20.320
Really shitty places.
Yeah.
He like found a bunch of really shitty places.

1466
01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.770
It to me,
I was like,
I looked at the texts,
I'm like,
bitch,
I ain't going to

1467
01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:29.620
places that are not worth going to write.
We could mix it up.

1468
01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.900
You do a really good city and then you do a small one.

1469
01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:35.260
I would do it just to do shows with him.
Yeah.
Or do them with you.

1470
01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:39.280
We could do them together.
You,
Brian,
you open your Austin?
I'll do one,
two,

1471
01:25:39.281 --> 01:25:42.250
three punch.
I want to do a Dallas,
Houston,
Austin,

1472
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:44.620
like just the dude just go up texting.

1473
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:47.380
I think Dallas and Austin are too much the same market.

1474
01:25:47.381 --> 01:25:50.680
They're only an hour away.
No,
they're not the same market.
Now.

1475
01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:53.620
A lot of fucking people,
people in Texas will come out.

1476
01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:55.960
If you really know Greg Fitzsimmons is only going to be in Austin,

1477
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:59.370
they'll drive from Dallas.
Right?
There's on the same market.
This is,

1478
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.760
they're both big ass cities.

1479
01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:04.160
There's plenty of people in Austin and plenty of people in Dallas.
Right.
That cap

1480
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.620
<v 5>city in Austin's,
one of the greatest clubs in the history of the world.</v>

1481
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:09.980
<v 4>It's such a great fucking club.
And the people that run it are cool.</v>

1482
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:13.670
<v 5>Yeah,
well it's a real,
like they support the art form,
you know,</v>

1483
01:26:13.671 --> 01:26:18.140
it's like a legit support of the art form club.
And when I tell a town needs,

1484
01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:21.230
you need a club like that and then you need a community and then you know you

1485
01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:23.210
need an open Mike night and then boom,
you got it.

1486
01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:26.090
<v 4>Well,
you need a manager that is going to,
you know,</v>

1487
01:26:26.170 --> 01:26:29.090
it's the effort to make an open mic night and they don't make money on it.

1488
01:26:29.091 --> 01:26:33.710
So it's an investment in the local talent.
Basically.
You're saying,
uh,
you know,

1489
01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:37.040
the way the Way San Francisco does in Denver does,

1490
01:26:37.041 --> 01:26:39.560
you're saying we're going to have our farm team locally.

1491
01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:41.870
We're going to teach guys how to do it on an open mic nights,

1492
01:26:41.871 --> 01:26:44.360
support them and make them opening acts when they're good enough.

1493
01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:48.410
And then they start to create their own satellite rooms and coffee houses and

1494
01:26:48.411 --> 01:26:51.680
whatever.
And then you've got a scene in it and a club owner knows that.

1495
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.660
I know this comic,
he knows me.

1496
01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:57.230
You see people that go back to the San Francisco Punch line,
myself included,

1497
01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:01.100
I go in for way less money than I work anywhere else because it's a small room.

1498
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:05.090
But I fucking do it because I love it.
I love Molly and it's just,

1499
01:27:05.091 --> 01:27:07.460
and you're in a city you love and the middle of it.

1500
01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:12.800
And so I think that it's smart for club owners to establish these relationships

1501
01:27:12.801 --> 01:27:15.110
and give the support to the community because it pays back.

1502
01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.720
<v 5>Yeah.
No it does pay back.
It does.</v>

1503
01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.640
And I think that it's the best way to support stand up and to keep the art form

1504
01:27:22.641 --> 01:27:23.030
alive.

1505
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:27.290
Cause it's hard for a person to go from being like just a guy who wants to go on

1506
01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:31.400
stage for the very first time say in Indianapolis,
you know,

1507
01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:32.793
it's fucking hard.

1508
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:37.700
It's not easy to like develop a comedy career out of there and try to even get

1509
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:38.540
time locally.

1510
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:42.350
It's very difficult unless you're doing your own rooms and then we just start

1511
01:27:42.351 --> 01:27:44.450
getting booked nationally.
Good fucking luck.

1512
01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.610
You have to have some sort of a draw to get booked.

1513
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:49.780
You mean unless you find someone to piggyback with like someone thinks you're

1514
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:52.010
funny that it takes you with him as a middle act or an opening act.

1515
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:53.570
Good fucking luck getting booked anywhere

1516
01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:56.780
<v 4>and you,
you would think,
cause I think for a lot of feature acts,</v>

1517
01:27:56.890 --> 01:27:59.960
they come in with somebody with a headliner.

1518
01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:04.640
Club owners sometimes resent that and you don't get booked back as a feature.

1519
01:28:04.641 --> 01:28:08.120
You think that you're going to showcase for them as a feature for the headliner.

1520
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:10.860
But you know,
depending on the club,

1521
01:28:10.861 --> 01:28:13.400
sometimes they would rather book their own features and they,

1522
01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:14.990
so they have a chip on their shoulder.
Yeah.

1523
01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:19.880
<v 5>Is that person?
Yeah.
Thomson girl was telling me this story about this,
this guy,</v>

1524
01:28:19.881 --> 01:28:24.520
um,
someone couldn't make a show,
so they had to,
uh,

1525
01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.820
call for a replacement and timeline or use.
Well,

1526
01:28:28.821 --> 01:28:31.640
Tom was the headliner and the Middle Act couldn't make it.

1527
01:28:31.641 --> 01:28:35.420
And so Tom wanted to use his buddy who's in town and uh,
the manager's like,
no,

1528
01:28:35.421 --> 01:28:39.410
no,
no.
I've already got someone coming.
And she's like,
uh,
you know,

1529
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:42.440
I prefer to use them.
And he's like,
but I already,
I'm in touch with this guy.

1530
01:28:42.441 --> 01:28:44.450
He's five minutes away.
He can be here.
Well,

1531
01:28:44.451 --> 01:28:47.330
it turns out the other guy was someone that she was fucking right.

1532
01:28:47.331 --> 01:28:50.630
So she wanted to get her boyfriend to work as the middle,
but he's like,
well,

1533
01:28:50.631 --> 01:28:53.330
this is,
do you understand?
This is my show.
Like,
I don't want this guy.

1534
01:28:53.331 --> 01:28:56.120
He's terrible.
Yup.
And so Tom was forced to work with this guy.

1535
01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.050
The last time you worked with him,

1536
01:28:57.051 --> 01:29:00.110
he said he did 45 minutes and then was selling tee shirts at the end.

1537
01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:03.720
Like had this big pitch for people to go by his shirts and it was like the

1538
01:29:03.721 --> 01:29:05.780
grossest thing ever.
Yeah.
And so,
you know,

1539
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:07.680
he's gotta fucking work with this guy again.

1540
01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:09.930
It's one of the big bummers about doing the road.

1541
01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:12.210
If you don't have full control of the show,
it's like you can't,

1542
01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.100
if you do the road,
like I do the road,
we do the road,

1543
01:29:14.101 --> 01:29:17.370
it's all our friends and then it becomes a party.
It's like we,

1544
01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:21.870
we might as well if we're in Montreal or if we're in Florida,

1545
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.720
it's the same party,
you know,
it's like we're moving all over the place,

1546
01:29:24.721 --> 01:29:25.554
but it's the same party

1547
01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:28.900
<v 4>and it forces you to get out of your room and go to a decent restaurant for</v>

1548
01:29:28.901 --> 01:29:33.460
dinner and things become more of an event.
Whereas if I'm alone,
yeah.
I,

1549
01:29:34.090 --> 01:29:38.860
I will eat at Starbucks breakfast and lunch.
That's how pathetic I am.

1550
01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:43.410
<v 5>It's a very lonely thing working on the road alone for like three or four days</v>

1551
01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:44.820
in a row.
It's very lonely.

1552
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:48.180
<v 4>Yeah,
I like it because,
you know,
like you,</v>

1553
01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:50.790
I got kids in the house and even though I have an office,

1554
01:29:50.791 --> 01:29:54.210
it's different when I'm on the road,
I fucking,
I get up late,

1555
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:59.510
but I'm awake when I'm up and then I work out and then I listened to my show

1556
01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:01.620
from the night before.

1557
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:06.020
I take copious notes and then I work on the set for that night and then I,

1558
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:08.850
we'd all my fucking emails and,

1559
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:13.000
and then I just go to the show like with total focus.
Yeah.

1560
01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:15.760
<v 5>That's a big one man,
that a lot of comics don't like to do,</v>

1561
01:30:15.761 --> 01:30:17.920
listening to the show and take notes.

1562
01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:20.290
But I have gotten so much out of doing that.

1563
01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:24.910
Like that's like one of the best warm ups too for me.
Um,
when I,
uh,

1564
01:30:24.970 --> 01:30:29.020
if I'm going to do a show somewhere,
I'll go over all of my notes,

1565
01:30:29.050 --> 01:30:30.580
like everything for like,

1566
01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:33.610
I'll set aside like two hours where I just go over notes.

1567
01:30:33.611 --> 01:30:37.060
Usually the plane ride for me is that it's perfect plane rides.
Perfect.

1568
01:30:37.061 --> 01:30:37.631
You're focused,

1569
01:30:37.631 --> 01:30:40.480
you're sitting there and not go anywhere and get coffee anytime you want.
Boom.

1570
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:43.930
But going over those notes,
that's number one.

1571
01:30:44.050 --> 01:30:49.050
Then listening to a set and like trying to figure out like what order things

1572
01:30:50.381 --> 01:30:54.910
should be in or what I I forgot to do or what could be a good tag here.

1573
01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:58.750
Like sometimes like you'll have like a little thing in the recording that

1574
01:30:58.751 --> 01:31:03.320
becomes this blossom takes off.
It's just one

1575
01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:07.170
<v 4>whatever.
The genesis of the joke was sometimes falls away entirely.</v>

1576
01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:10.300
<v 5>Yeah.
It's so weird.
It's like the the way you get to an idea.</v>

1577
01:31:10.301 --> 01:31:14.830
Sometimes it's just like in in that sense it's almost a living thing,

1578
01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:19.600
like it's kind of growing and finding its own form as you're working it out on

1579
01:31:19.601 --> 01:31:20.434
stage

1580
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:25.070
<v 4>and it's so subtle that you have to listen to the tape right away because then</v>

1581
01:31:25.071 --> 01:31:29.660
you can remember where your energy was at that moment and what thoughts you were

1582
01:31:29.661 --> 01:31:34.640
having at that moment.
You can connect it all because the changes are so small

1583
01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:39.840
<v 5>and sometimes you'll hear doors that opened up that you didn't follow through
on.</v>

1584
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:43.200
Thank you.
Like,
oh,
there's another whole bit there.
Oh my God.

1585
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.790
Like that happens all the time.

1586
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:48.360
Or you'll go off on a little tangent and you just think after you went off.

1587
01:31:48.361 --> 01:31:51.170
Thank God I got that recorded because I don't even remember exactly what

1588
01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.470
everything,
when I get off stage.

1589
01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:57.520
Well people would never know that the weird sort of mindset if,

1590
01:31:58.410 --> 01:32:00.310
unless they've done it unless they've tried to do stand up.

1591
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:04.090
But that weird mindset when you're locked in in the groove,

1592
01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:08.860
it's almost like you're there and you're,
you're focused and your,

1593
01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:09.880
you're in the moment,

1594
01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:14.710
but you're also like completely blank and it's all just common out of your mouth

1595
01:32:14.711 --> 01:32:17.350
with no,
you know,
you're not clinging on to anything.

1596
01:32:17.351 --> 01:32:20.590
It's all just flying out of your mouth.
You're locked into it.

1597
01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:23.050
And it's almost like being a passenger in that sense.

1598
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:27.350
<v 4>Yeah.
You're,
you're an active passenger.
It's almost like,
um,</v>

1599
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:29.570
I guess like sports when you know,

1600
01:32:29.571 --> 01:32:33.950
when you know the fundamentals well enough that you let go and you find,

1601
01:32:33.951 --> 01:32:38.090
what do they call it,
the zone.
You're doing the zone and uh,

1602
01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:40.640
and it because you're so in the moment,

1603
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:45.410
you don't have that perspective of later on remembering what exactly you said

1604
01:32:45.710 --> 01:32:46.760
and then you listen to it.

1605
01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:50.630
I'll listen to it on tape and completely forget that I,

1606
01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:54.620
that I went into this place or somebody from the audience yell something out.

1607
01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:56.720
And I think,
um,
you and I are similar.

1608
01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.270
I don't go counter when somebody yells something out.

1609
01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:02.810
I try to take it and use it if I possibly can.

1610
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:05.420
And sometimes it's fucking great because it came out of,

1611
01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:07.460
they were in the moment too when they yelled something.

1612
01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:11.760
<v 5>Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's,
it's such a fun balance.</v>

1613
01:33:11.761 --> 01:33:14.910
Like sometimes it's not a problem at all when people yell out something in the

1614
01:33:14.911 --> 01:33:15.870
right time.
Right.

1615
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:20.370
And sometimes it's like a huge problem because you get one idiot who won't stop

1616
01:33:20.371 --> 01:33:23.190
doing it.
Right.
And he's annoying everyone around them.
It's,

1617
01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:28.140
it's almost like it's a very fine line you walk cause occasionally someone will

1618
01:33:28.141 --> 01:33:29.880
yell something and it's hilarious.

1619
01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:34.810
<v 4>Well especially if it's clearly when you're between bits.
Yes,
that's right.</v>

1620
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.560
Yelling out that I've gone and get a sip of water.
You yell at an idea.

1621
01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:43.540
But if I'm like that abortion bit,
I'll fucking set that thing up.
Which is,

1622
01:33:43.690 --> 01:33:44.230
that's a,

1623
01:33:44.230 --> 01:33:49.230
that's a 9.8 difficulty level doing an abortion joke that's pro a pro life

1624
01:33:50.231 --> 01:33:54.040
somewhat.
And you build it up and it's fragile man.

1625
01:33:54.041 --> 01:33:57.190
You're standing on a house of cards cause you haven't gotten to the laugh yet.

1626
01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:00.700
And then someone yells something and you want to go out and punch him in the

1627
01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:02.750
face because now you got to,
you got to lose.

1628
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:04.120
<v 5>Yeah.
That,</v>

1629
01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:08.040
that'd becomes a real problem when people just can't keep quiet long enough to

1630
01:34:08.041 --> 01:34:09.300
let someone do their thing.

1631
01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:12.900
It's also like the combative nature of people when it comes to controversial

1632
01:34:12.901 --> 01:34:15.900
ideas because the ideas become very,

1633
01:34:15.901 --> 01:34:18.420
the become very emotionally invested in the ideas,

1634
01:34:18.630 --> 01:34:21.960
whether if it's abortion or a war or being a Vegan.

1635
01:34:21.970 --> 01:34:23.730
And a lot of times you'd get that same sort of reaction.

1636
01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:27.660
So it's not just a matter of being attached to the idea,

1637
01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:32.220
it's being emotionally connected to that idea of succeeding and that,
you know,

1638
01:34:32.221 --> 01:34:33.840
you being against that idea,

1639
01:34:33.841 --> 01:34:37.850
they'll in your face and screaming and pointing fingers.
Yeah.
You know,

1640
01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:41.870
becomes a weird human characteristic.
That's a,
uh,

1641
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:45.540
an unfortunate aspect of people when it comes to certain ideas.
It says like,

1642
01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.610
it's a,
there's a,
I mean,
I've felt it myself.

1643
01:34:47.611 --> 01:34:51.230
There's like a natural inclination to stay competitive.
Right,
right.

1644
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:53.030
<v 4>Yeah.
And um,</v>

1645
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:57.680
it sort of feels like when you go to that place and you're trying to be at the

1646
01:34:57.681 --> 01:34:59.990
same time,
you want to say to the audience,
Hey,
listen,

1647
01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:04.250
I'm not a professor at a university.
You're paying tuition at,

1648
01:35:04.251 --> 01:35:06.980
I'm not a speaker on NPR.
I'm,
I'm,
uh,

1649
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:10.280
I tell Dick Jokes in front of drunks.
And if you,

1650
01:35:10.281 --> 01:35:13.130
if you have to challenge what I'm saying,
you're,

1651
01:35:13.131 --> 01:35:15.080
you're really taking everything too seriously.

1652
01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.470
<v 5>But there is a point though,</v>

1653
01:35:16.471 --> 01:35:21.471
as an audience member where we've all seen this one guy who goes on stage and

1654
01:35:22.651 --> 01:35:24.930
it's just essentially preaching,
right?
I mean,

1655
01:35:24.931 --> 01:35:28.110
we've all seen that and it gets to be this,
you know,

1656
01:35:28.230 --> 01:35:30.390
women should be the only ones.

1657
01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:33.690
You get to choose what they do and don't do to their body.

1658
01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.670
And they're like pace in the stay away from making laws break after.

1659
01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:39.900
And the problem is these points to me,
or Duh,
yeah,

1660
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:42.720
of course they should of course murder's it bad.

1661
01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:45.900
Of course you shouldn't rob people.
Of course you shouldn't kick babies.

1662
01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:49.650
Of course.
Duh.
You don't have to say that.
I mean,
in my world,

1663
01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.650
you don't have to say those things.
In my world,
those things are a given.

1664
01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.460
So let's start there.
Right?

1665
01:35:54.570 --> 01:35:58.210
You don't have to just preach some really obvious shit that everyone's gonna

1666
01:35:58.230 --> 01:35:59.250
fucking agree with.

1667
01:35:59.470 --> 01:36:04.150
<v 4>And also to me it's like if you're doing a joke that is about an issue that's</v>

1668
01:36:04.151 --> 01:36:07.030
about gun control,
that you're,
you're about gun control.

1669
01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.080
Do what joke about a detail that you have a point of view on.

1670
01:36:11.110 --> 01:36:16.110
Don't announce we are now going to take on gun control and here's my take on it.

1671
01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.250
To me it's like bury that.

1672
01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:20.530
<v 5>Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's also,</v>

1673
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:25.950
I want to hear about it from a guy like you who I know is doing the work.

1674
01:36:27.490 --> 01:36:29.530
I know that if you're going to go on stage,

1675
01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:33.730
you have my full confidence that if you're going to present an idea on state,

1676
01:36:33.731 --> 01:36:38.560
especially a very controversial one,
like a pro life sort of a pro,

1677
01:36:38.561 --> 01:36:42.610
a pro fetus,
sort of an argument in a joke form like,

1678
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.640
Woo,
I know that you have put together a little dance,
right,

1679
01:36:46.690 --> 01:36:48.910
and I have to wash this dance completely play out

1680
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:50.600
<v 4>and then I may have some turns in it.</v>

1681
01:36:50.650 --> 01:36:51.850
<v 5>Exactly.
But that,</v>

1682
01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:55.530
that knee jerk thing where people attach themselves to ideas of it.

1683
01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:59.050
You're talking about abortion or you talking about it almost like they get a

1684
01:36:59.051 --> 01:37:03.580
green light to be a dick.
This guy's an asshole.
Green Light,
no wrong,

1685
01:37:03.820 --> 01:37:07.900
not true propaganda,
liberal,
you know,
whatever.
Whatever they want to say to you.

1686
01:37:08.110 --> 01:37:08.590
Whatever.

1687
01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:12.580
<v 4>I was in Lake Tahoe and I was talking about how we've been brainwashed to</v>

1688
01:37:12.581 --> 01:37:16.390
support billionaires in this country and in every other society when this few

1689
01:37:16.391 --> 01:37:19.240
people had this much of the money,
they were dragged in the straight,

1690
01:37:19.241 --> 01:37:22.660
had their heads chopped off when we split their shit and we should start killing

1691
01:37:22.661 --> 01:37:26.230
billionaires.
Well,
it's obviously a ridiculous bit,

1692
01:37:26.231 --> 01:37:30.130
but it's based in a feeling that I have of resentment of these people.
Right?

1693
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:35.200
Clearly a comedic extrapolation on a,
on an idea and a,

1694
01:37:35.201 --> 01:37:40.201
this dude fucking stands up in a casino and re in Lake Tahoe walks towards the

1695
01:37:42.941 --> 01:37:47.140
stage screaming at me that I'm a,
that I'm a socialist,
which by the way,

1696
01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:51.700
I am.
I do believe we should share the shit more.

1697
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:56.910
So he walks up and somebody grabs him from coming up on stage and so,

1698
01:37:57.541 --> 01:37:59.490
and I just keep baiting him.
Now I'm like,

1699
01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.080
I want this motherfucker on stage so bad I am getting in his head.

1700
01:38:04.081 --> 01:38:05.340
I'm making him implode.

1701
01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:08.610
So then they have to drag him out as soon as he gets thrown out,

1702
01:38:08.710 --> 01:38:10.800
no other dude in the back row is up.

1703
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:14.580
He's pacing back and forth and I do the same thing.
I just looked at him,
I go,

1704
01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:17.040
that's right.
I'll kill him.
My bare fucking ads.

1705
01:38:17.041 --> 01:38:20.900
I'll pull them out of a Ferrari and a,
and they just keep going and,

1706
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:25.830
and it was like does instinct,
I had to create chaos because they,

1707
01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.090
they are not going to take my show no matter what it takes.
If I'm on a stage,

1708
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:32.490
that's my fucking stage and I will,

1709
01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.940
I will burn the place down before you take it.

1710
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:35.850
<v 0>Controlling my shell.</v>

1711
01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:40.110
It becomes a real issue with folks who are not familiar with your material,

1712
01:38:40.111 --> 01:38:44.040
that just going out to a quote unquote comedy show that's a casino.
Yeah.

1713
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:47.130
That's the problem is there's going to be a big difference between that and who

1714
01:38:47.131 --> 01:38:49.950
comes to see you at the Bray Improv,
for example.
You know,

1715
01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:52.520
most likely there's going to be Greg Fitzsimmons fans are going to come,

1716
01:38:52.521 --> 01:38:55.380
they're going gonna know what you do and they're gonna enjoy it.
But when you,

1717
01:38:55.381 --> 01:38:58.980
when someone's just going out to see comedy and you're giving them some really

1718
01:38:58.981 --> 01:39:03.981
heavy duty subversive shit wrapped up and sarcasm and it's like what?

1719
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.650
It's like they're a little feeble.
Brains can't handle it.
Right,
right.

1720
01:39:07.651 --> 01:39:10.770
And Til billionaires,
what the fuck?
You know,

1721
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:15.360
billionaires made this fucking country what it is because they believe they're

1722
01:39:15.361 --> 01:39:17.540
going to be one.
Yeah.
It's always broke.
People who they were like,

1723
01:39:19.110 --> 01:39:19.870
what is that about?

1724
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:23.130
<v 4>Boy Did they fucking,
boy,
they do a brainwash job on them.</v>

1725
01:39:23.150 --> 01:39:28.150
That is why I applaud the Republican party because I should say just to conserve

1726
01:39:28.331 --> 01:39:29.920
as in general,
the,
the,

1727
01:39:30.250 --> 01:39:34.720
the mind control that they have pulled off and now the Koch Brothers just

1728
01:39:34.721 --> 01:39:39.550
purchased like 11 and Tribune newspapers,
like big ones.

1729
01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.740
<v 0>That shouldn't be a problem.
Right.
What's,</v>

1730
01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:46.220
what's it sounded like Rupert Murdoch editorialized news at all.

1731
01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:49.050
[inaudible] own coca cola by the way.
The Koch now there's no,

1732
01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.890
it's into a textile.

1733
01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:55.900
Think what's fascinating too about the idea of someone getting upset,

1734
01:39:56.750 --> 01:40:00.470
like a,
a poor person getting upset about,
you know,

1735
01:40:00.471 --> 01:40:04.430
about billionaires and like calling you a socialist or calling you a communist.

1736
01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:09.431
Like you're the people that would benefit the most from this not being the case.

1737
01:40:09.831 --> 01:40:11.900
Like this idea,
pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

1738
01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:15.470
Those guys almost never do because the billionaires,

1739
01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:18.710
if they're in a situation in,
in you,
you're saying something disagree with,

1740
01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.550
they don't stand up and scream.
They get the fuck out of there.
Right.

1741
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:24.770
You know why?
Because they don't want anybody knowing they're a billionaire.

1742
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:28.760
When you,
you're a fucking billionaire and you're just walking around,

1743
01:40:28.761 --> 01:40:33.020
you're like a bank on wheels,
right?
You can't just go places,
you know,

1744
01:40:33.021 --> 01:40:35.120
you can't like Oprah Winfrey.
Do you think Oprah Winfrey,

1745
01:40:35.121 --> 01:40:37.540
you can just go places everywhere.
Oprah goes,

1746
01:40:37.541 --> 01:40:39.200
you must have some sort of protection with her.

1747
01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:43.880
She must have some big men and cars that ricochet bullets off of main.

1748
01:40:43.881 --> 01:40:46.850
Do you know how many lawsuits are filed?
Like I talk,
I'm not going to say who,

1749
01:40:46.851 --> 01:40:47.391
but it really,

1750
01:40:47.391 --> 01:40:52.391
really rich famous prison fucking 14 lawsuits at that time against them.

1751
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:53.840
Wow.

1752
01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.880
<v 1>Because it's,
it's why wouldn't you?</v>

1753
01:40:55.881 --> 01:41:00.340
You have any contact with this person that doesn't go well,
fuck it.
You know,

1754
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:03.140
they'll settle out of court.
I'll grab a couple of hundred thousand dollars.

1755
01:41:03.610 --> 01:41:05.770
<v 0>What happened,
uh,
with Oprah Winfrey recently,</v>

1756
01:41:05.771 --> 01:41:09.130
she said that she was subjected to racism while shopping in Switzerland.

1757
01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:12.700
She's former talk show host tells entertainment tonight.

1758
01:41:12.701 --> 01:41:16.480
She was in a zoonotic store when she asked an employee if she could examine a

1759
01:41:16.481 --> 01:41:18.010
large purse.
According to Winfrey,

1760
01:41:18.011 --> 01:41:21.130
the employee repeatedly refused saying that the purse was too expensive.

1761
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:26.350
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
The employer told her,
no,

1762
01:41:26.351 --> 01:41:27.520
you don't want to see that one.

1763
01:41:27.530 --> 01:41:29.770
You want to see this one because that one cost too much.

1764
01:41:29.771 --> 01:41:33.860
We won't be able to afford that.
And I don't want to hurt your feelings.
Well,

1765
01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:36.520
those are the whitest people in the world.

1766
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:41.550
But could you imagine what a colossal fuck up it is to say that to Oprah Winfrey

1767
01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:47.130
bad for the country?
Well,
Jay sucked it up for their whole country.

1768
01:41:47.131 --> 01:41:52.131
Stomp and think just for a moment of all the people that you didn't think was

1769
01:41:52.211 --> 01:41:56.620
rich,
right?
Oprah fucking Winfrey.

1770
01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:01.480
She's one of the richest humans that have ever walked the face of the planet

1771
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:05.830
with one of the biggest platforms to communicate what you just did on the
planet.

1772
01:42:05.890 --> 01:42:09.280
Unbelief,
I mean is,
I mean how many women are richer than Oprah Winfrey,

1773
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:11.170
especially like self-made without,

1774
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:15.220
<v 1>there's a woman in Australia who I think is the richest person in Australia and</v>

1775
01:42:15.221 --> 01:42:16.210
she's,
she's worth it

1776
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:20.270
<v 0>more than Oprah.
She wanted to buy for Tina Turner,</v>

1777
01:42:21.050 --> 01:42:23.390
so it's a double whammy.
You know,

1778
01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.720
God,
she was in Switzerland for Tina Turner's wedding,

1779
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:34.700
just trying to buy a beautiful purse.
Wow.
That's fucking crazy.
Crazy.

1780
01:42:34.701 --> 01:42:38.480
What a dummy it gets.
That's a racist thing.
I,
when I,

1781
01:42:38.481 --> 01:42:41.630
when I first heard about it and I was like,
oh,
come on,
it's probably not racist.

1782
01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:44.900
That is a hundred percent racist.
When I first heard about it,

1783
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:49.910
this is how fucking gross I am.
I immediately dismissed it.
I was like,
Eh,
racism.

1784
01:42:49.911 --> 01:42:54.770
She recommends that plane and your Roper Winfrey.
Right?
And then I went,
oh,

1785
01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.960
then you actually read the story and you go,
Oh yeah,
that's racism.
That's it.

1786
01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:01.220
That isn't this a fucking store.
There's a store,
right,

1787
01:43:01.221 --> 01:43:03.650
and you're selling shit and someone wants to see it because they want to buy it.

1788
01:43:03.651 --> 01:43:04.850
And you're like,
no,
not you.

1789
01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:07.830
<v 1>Yeah,
but what if like a white woman came like two minutes later and they said,</v>

1790
01:43:07.831 --> 01:43:09.660
she's like,
no,
this is too expensive.

1791
01:43:09.690 --> 01:43:12.990
You can look at why do they have the person that should be something you have to

1792
01:43:12.991 --> 01:43:16.650
get a meeting with.
You have to like put down a credit card.

1793
01:43:16.651 --> 01:43:20.130
It's probably some kind of,
you know,
might be that expensive where they're like,

1794
01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:23.750
it's not even really for sale.
It's just like this to happen.

1795
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:28.130
It's a purse or needs a shit to happen because her life is so insulated.

1796
01:43:28.131 --> 01:43:31.080
Like you said,
there's always bodyguards around.
He can't just walk out.

1797
01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:33.180
She doesn't get shit like that,

1798
01:43:33.181 --> 01:43:36.600
that she can then go on TV and talk about she loved.

1799
01:43:36.601 --> 01:43:40.710
Yet you think she's not looking for that?
Not to dismiss it.
I'm with you gel.

1800
01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:45.480
This is racism.
But her fucking twat wedded up when this happened.

1801
01:43:45.481 --> 01:43:50.481
Did you hear what Chung's a daughter called Oprah and she was very rude.

1802
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.430
Tommy Chong Chong

1803
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:56.630
<v 2>defended,
or did he really?
Yeah,
there's a video of him just saying,
you know,</v>

1804
01:43:56.631 --> 01:43:59.300
like she would be,
well,

1805
01:43:59.301 --> 01:44:03.380
what she said was about that Oprah would be the first person to run to the most

1806
01:44:03.381 --> 01:44:07.460
powerful person in the room and kiss their ass and become their best friend.

1807
01:44:07.461 --> 01:44:11.150
And you know,
does he know,
I think she called her,

1808
01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:16.180
she did just did a movie with her and I think she called her a house and word of

1809
01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.020
field and we owe a field and word.
Yeah.
That worse than a House Edward?
Yeah,

1810
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.970
outside.
Yeah.
It's not even in the house.
It's the house ones.

1811
01:44:25.971 --> 01:44:30.140
I think that we're seen as more compromise by the white man.
Oh,
okay.
Awesome.

1812
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:33.370
That makes sense.
Well,
yeah,
then it's even then it's mean,

1813
01:44:33.371 --> 01:44:36.050
and then when she says to me that she used to sell out to white people,

1814
01:44:36.051 --> 01:44:39.260
how can you be upset about someone who's a slave?
That doesn't even make sense.

1815
01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.590
It's funny because you have white people that black audiences and nobody calls

1816
01:44:42.591 --> 01:44:46.160
them a sell out.
That's true,
right?
Yeah.
Or there's no,

1817
01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:50.680
or what about white people with white audiences?
Right.
You know,

1818
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:54.890
if any,
just because she's black and she has a white audience,

1819
01:44:54.891 --> 01:44:57.290
like so fucking what does a lot of black woman like her too?

1820
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:59.870
She obviously taps into a vein.
It's not my vein.

1821
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.590
It's not your vein and it's the on it.
Yeah,
but guess what?

1822
01:45:03.810 --> 01:45:06.380
The people are different than you and I,
it's nothing wrong with that.

1823
01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:09.950
Like I like Oprah.
I think Oprah is like a really positive person,

1824
01:45:09.951 --> 01:45:13.340
which she promotes to me despite the fact that she's like a super billionaire,

1825
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:16.880
she promotes to me is that you could think positive,
you can make shit happen,

1826
01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:20.420
you could do things.
You'd be nice to people like you could promote good causes.

1827
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:22.220
She said food,

1828
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:26.810
she's at multinational corporation and she chooses to spend a lot of that money

1829
01:45:26.811 --> 01:45:30.200
on schools in Africa,
learning programs here.

1830
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:35.330
She's a role model for women and black people and she interviews a lot.
She did.

1831
01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.130
I mean,
she had a lot of like gossipy sort of interviewed,

1832
01:45:38.131 --> 01:45:41.360
especially back in the day,
like bill burr had a great joke about her,

1833
01:45:41.630 --> 01:45:44.420
like how she actually made her career.
You know,

1834
01:45:44.421 --> 01:45:47.450
about like she can't get all high and mighty now because we remember how you got

1835
01:45:47.451 --> 01:45:51.410
there in the first place.
So she had like a crazy Maury Povich type show.
Right.

1836
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:53.260
You know,
if you go to get that one,
we,

1837
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:56.840
I was hanging out with al magical is when the first time I ever met them.

1838
01:45:56.841 --> 01:46:00.770
When Al was a,
uh,
he was the host at the old cops.

1839
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:04.160
Do you remember the old cops?
Right?
Did you ever do it?
Yeah,
it's like a hundred.

1840
01:46:04.161 --> 01:46:07.970
I was there the night it burned down.
I was on stage when it burned down.
Right.

1841
01:46:08.210 --> 01:46:10.790
Oh my God.
How many seats was that?

1842
01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:15.620
1005020520 five what a great room you were there.
Actually,

1843
01:46:15.621 --> 01:46:16.900
when the fire broke out,
right?

1844
01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:21.740
Firemen ran in and told everybody to get out of the building.
Helmets on access.

1845
01:46:21.741 --> 01:46:24.650
People ran out.
There was fucking shit caught the buildings,

1846
01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:27.680
holy shit in the street.
And I watched the thing burned to the ground.

1847
01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:32.480
It was crazy what started that fire next door was a hotel they were renovating

1848
01:46:32.481 --> 01:46:34.940
and it was like an oily rag kind of thing.

1849
01:46:34.941 --> 01:46:39.380
And then it crossed over cause it was called the cannery and it was,
it's an old,

1850
01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:42.410
you know,
walkway with the building's pretty close together.

1851
01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:47.150
And you know those San Francisco buildings or from like the 1820s and always

1852
01:46:47.151 --> 01:46:50.040
been,
the problem with San Francisco is that there's a fire.

1853
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.250
<v 0>All buildings are connected.
Like a lot of those buildings on those hills,
windy.</v>

1854
01:46:53.251 --> 01:46:56.970
So it's blowing the flame and it's hills.
So everything goes up.
It's like,

1855
01:46:57.030 --> 01:47:01.830
I mean it's the,
they have terrible fires.
The um,
earthquake and fire,

1856
01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:05.100
what was it like the 18 hundreds then they have that other one in [inaudible]
94.

1857
01:47:05.101 --> 01:47:08.550
Right.
There were some fires at attached to that one too,
wasn't there?
No,
no.
89.

1858
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.550
Right.
It was at 89,
I think that was the earthquake.
Canadian.

1859
01:47:11.551 --> 01:47:14.340
I wasn't where they got hit really hard.
It was that [inaudible] 91.
Um,

1860
01:47:14.370 --> 01:47:19.140
they usually by earthquake and fire during the world series.
Serious fuck.
Yeah,

1861
01:47:19.141 --> 01:47:23.370
that's right.
I remember that.
That was nuts.
Yeah.
That's a crazy place to live.

1862
01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:26.180
San Francisco's up bad ass city though.
I,

1863
01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:30.120
I was there without magical and we just worked together and we were smoking pot

1864
01:47:30.121 --> 01:47:32.970
with him and his friends and we're sitting in his parents house.

1865
01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:36.510
His parents had this dope house on the hill and we were watching Oprah Winfrey

1866
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:40.950
old school,
Oprah Winfrey,
and I'll never forget,
I like,
we were sitting there,

1867
01:47:40.951 --> 01:47:43.510
I was looking the first time it's ever met Al,
and we'll watch that show.

1868
01:47:43.511 --> 01:47:46.380
And we were like,
damn,
look how crazy hope or at least to look,

1869
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.480
she had this crazy hair and she was interviewing Liza racists,

1870
01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:54.420
like these real,
like heavy duty white supremacists.

1871
01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.160
And it wasn't like the chastising holier than now Oprah of today.

1872
01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:02.590
It was like the scared Oprah who's like just starting to,
was like a,

1873
01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:07.650
almost like a newspaper report,
you know,
or a news camera,
you know,
newscaster,

1874
01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:12.480
it wasn't like the confident,
powerful,
iconic figure.
Oprah.
It was weird.

1875
01:48:12.481 --> 01:48:15.410
It's like the wow,
this woman,
like she worked her way up.
Yes.

1876
01:48:15.411 --> 01:48:17.100
She became like a lioness.

1877
01:48:17.101 --> 01:48:21.010
She became more graceful and powerful as she got older.
And uh,

1878
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.890
it's still forgets you won an Oscar for color purple.
Yeah,
no shit.
She,
um,

1879
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.830
I mean if you stop and think about it like how many other women who've ever done

1880
01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:32.820
like that and like risen to that level,
they get close and then they fucking,

1881
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:34.260
they Rosie O'Donnell lit.

1882
01:48:34.290 --> 01:48:35.960
<v 7>This is right.
I mean,
Alan,</v>

1883
01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:39.180
Alan looked like she was going there and then the show kind of flat lined a

1884
01:48:39.181 --> 01:48:41.520
little bit.
I mean,
I think it's a successful show,
but it didn't,

1885
01:48:41.521 --> 01:48:43.290
it didn't grow into the empire that open

1886
01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:47.890
<v 0>for has Rosie had a good show on the Oprah Winfrey network,</v>

1887
01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:52.510
but the,
for whatever reason,
TV show or radio show,
she was a TV show.
I did it.

1888
01:48:52.810 --> 01:48:57.760
Oh yeah,
she's in Chicago,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.
She was brutal boss.

1889
01:48:57.761 --> 01:48:59.490
I know some people that worked on that show.
Really?

1890
01:48:59.530 --> 01:49:04.150
Apparently they just cleaned house one day.
Everybody.
Oh,
really?
Yeah.

1891
01:49:04.810 --> 01:49:09.230
She's a tough boss.
Well now that she's a lesbian,
she's like a dude,
right?

1892
01:49:10.050 --> 01:49:14.710
Lesbian.
That's what I've heard.
No,
Rosie O'donnell.
Oh fuck.
I'm sorry.

1893
01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:18.580
Who are you talking about?
Oprah.
Oprah.
Oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1894
01:49:18.610 --> 01:49:22.000
I thought you were talking about Rosie.
Rosie is a yes,
I believe at a lesbian.

1895
01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:26.830
So powerful lesbian.
Yeah,
I did.
She had a big conspiracy theorist.
Hey Shea.

1896
01:49:26.890 --> 01:49:29.560
Oh yeah.
Tower seven tower seven.

1897
01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:32.950
<v 7>I just watched another tower,
seven video with Ed Asner.
I was like,
all right.</v>

1898
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.641
I was like,

1899
01:49:33.641 --> 01:49:37.860
if ed as nurses now that they're getting involved with tower seven videos and
it,

1900
01:49:37.861 --> 01:49:41.890
you know,
it was like there's,
it was the most legit tower seven video.

1901
01:49:41.891 --> 01:49:46.510
I saw it as there's onboard.
Yeah.
And Wow,
but it's still,

1902
01:49:46.511 --> 01:49:49.520
it's like they talk about the,
they always like the,

1903
01:49:49.530 --> 01:49:51.040
the whole video is very believable.
They,

1904
01:49:51.041 --> 01:49:54.400
they'd never talked about the humongous chunk of building that was missing on

1905
01:49:54.401 --> 01:49:56.890
one side.
You know,
like they always,
they always talk about,

1906
01:49:56.891 --> 01:49:59.080
well this is like impossible cause the other,
you know,

1907
01:49:59.081 --> 01:50:01.540
this happened and this happened the way it melted.
Yeah.

1908
01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:05.200
There's like there's no office fire that's ever been taken down though,
you know,

1909
01:50:05.201 --> 01:50:07.450
building and how the columns like you know,

1910
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:10.760
just one was damaged in that that made everyone all of the money.

1911
01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:12.250
But they also don't talk about the big,

1912
01:50:12.251 --> 01:50:15.420
humongous whole that's missing in the building.
Not once in that video.

1913
01:50:15.421 --> 01:50:18.270
Who did they talk about the big hole in the middle of the road and you're taking

1914
01:50:18.271 --> 01:50:18.710
the towers

1915
01:50:18.710 --> 01:50:23.000
<v 5>that was most certainly a giant hole and diesel fires through the whole
building.</v>

1916
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:24.140
That said,

1917
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:28.460
I have never seen a building collapse into its foundation like that.

1918
01:50:28.461 --> 01:50:30.950
That wasn't a controlled demolition.
Right.

1919
01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:34.160
It doesn't mean that it can't happen because obviously I'm not an architect,

1920
01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:38.660
but I know that they have that architects and engineers from nine 11 truth.

1921
01:50:38.710 --> 01:50:42.070
This is like 2000 people involved in that second.
They all have a,

1922
01:50:42.071 --> 01:50:45.830
this belief that that would have never happened under natural circumstances,

1923
01:50:46.130 --> 01:50:50.480
but how many,
but out of those 2000 how many more thousands?
Disagree?

1924
01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.530
I don't know that.
I don't have that information.
I [inaudible] believe that,

1925
01:50:54.531 --> 01:50:58.700
but it might be 150,000 think it's nonsense.
Because of x or y?

1926
01:50:58.870 --> 01:51:01.240
<v 4>Well the government pointed to this,
uh,</v>

1927
01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:04.150
or might've commissioned a popular mechanics,
I believe,

1928
01:51:04.151 --> 01:51:08.050
did the definitive report which said that,
you know,
everything was legit,

1929
01:51:08.051 --> 01:51:10.510
but that felt,
that felt a little too neat.

1930
01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:13.090
<v 5>Yeah.
That's a hurst publication man.
William Randolph first,</v>

1931
01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:16.750
the same guy made marijuana illegal.
That's the same guy who put pate stories.

1932
01:51:16.751 --> 01:51:19.960
I mean,
Hurst publication in 1930.
Yeah,
30,
whatever it was,

1933
01:51:19.961 --> 01:51:22.780
35 or something like that.
I mean he,
he put in,
uh,

1934
01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:26.230
stories about these blacks and Mexicans raping,

1935
01:51:26.231 --> 01:51:29.110
raping white women because they got hooked on this marijuana.
Right.

1936
01:51:29.130 --> 01:51:32.200
That's where the term marijuana came from.
Before that,

1937
01:51:32.201 --> 01:51:37.180
marijuana was a slang for a wild Mexican tobacco.
No,
Shit.
Yeah.
Oh,

1938
01:51:37.181 --> 01:51:40.870
he's a bad motherfucker.
It was all because of hemp hemp,
the commodity.

1939
01:51:40.871 --> 01:51:43.870
He was going to have to switch to paper over who's going to switch his paper

1940
01:51:43.871 --> 01:51:46.510
over to him because hemp is a superior paper.
And uh,

1941
01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:47.500
he was going to have to switch,

1942
01:51:47.501 --> 01:51:50.190
hit forests that he would chop down and make trees out of it.

1943
01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:52.870
Cause he had paper mills because he not only had newspapers,

1944
01:51:52.871 --> 01:51:56.610
you also had paper mills.
So in this battle over the commodity of him,

1945
01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:01.800
he demonized it as being connected to this drug that was making black and

1946
01:52:01.811 --> 01:52:03.190
Mexicans rape white women.

1947
01:52:03.610 --> 01:52:03.881
<v 4>Right.</v>

1948
01:52:03.881 --> 01:52:08.881
And then in 1970 they commissioned a big study the government did and then they,

1949
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:10.250
I think they made it

1950
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:11.840
<v 7>another law or,</v>

1951
01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:12.010
<v 5>well,</v>

1952
01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:17.010
1970 was a sweeping psychedelic act that made everything illegal category

1953
01:52:17.031 --> 01:52:19.280
Western drugs,
everything.
Because yeah,

1954
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:22.070
actually what's really fascinating is the category one,

1955
01:52:22.071 --> 01:52:26.240
drugs are less dangerous in a lot of ways.
Then category two drugs,

1956
01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:28.100
like category one is marijuana,

1957
01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:33.400
but to schedule two is cocaine and heroin because they're considered less

1958
01:52:33.801 --> 01:52:37.880
addictive.
No,
they're way more addictive.
Way More dangerous.
Way more toxic.

1959
01:52:37.881 --> 01:52:42.650
LD 50 rate's much higher or much lower with lethal dose at 50%.

1960
01:52:42.651 --> 01:52:45.620
Like you could kill yourself pretty easy on either one of those heroin,
cocaine,

1961
01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:46.570
nobody

1962
01:52:46.570 --> 01:52:49.490
<v 0>marijuana if time has ever oded on marijuana.
Exactly.</v>

1963
01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:53.060
Marijuana is not gonna kill you.
So the idea that one of them is a schedule one,

1964
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:55.070
which is marijuana,
which is the most illegal.

1965
01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:59.060
And those two are scheduled to is one of the kookiest filling of those crazy.

1966
01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:02.140
And also in this,
and this we'd movie,
um,

1967
01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:07.040
gooped at talks about how the level of addiction with marijuana was way

1968
01:53:07.041 --> 01:53:07.791
overstated.

1969
01:53:07.791 --> 01:53:12.791
And every new study shows that it's like a 10% rate as opposed to like a 30 or

1970
01:53:13.311 --> 01:53:15.230
40% rate with heroin and cocaine.

1971
01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:17.150
And there's people that are addicted to everything.

1972
01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:19.020
You can get into that until the sun comes on.

1973
01:53:19.021 --> 01:53:21.710
There's people that are addicted to playing online poker,
physically addictive.

1974
01:53:21.711 --> 01:53:24.170
I've been addicted to playing video games.
I know that feeling.

1975
01:53:24.171 --> 01:53:25.700
It is very much like an addiction.

1976
01:53:25.730 --> 01:53:29.360
It's a compulsive gnawing away at your consciousness feeling.

1977
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:32.520
And that could happen with almost anything can certainly happen.

1978
01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.910
But psychological versus physiological,

1979
01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:39.200
psychological versus physiological and psychological is a real issue.

1980
01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:42.920
It's a real issue.
But it's an issue for almost everything that exists.

1981
01:53:43.130 --> 01:53:46.280
And when you're dealing with giant numbers,
like how many people smoke marijuana?

1982
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:47.480
Jesus Christ,

1983
01:53:47.481 --> 01:53:50.480
you're talking about millions and millions and millions of fucking people in

1984
01:53:50.481 --> 01:53:54.710
this country.
Millions.
So out of those you're going to get a couple of losers.

1985
01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:57.290
Okay.
You're going to get a few people that can't keep the shit together.

1986
01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:00.140
You're going to get a few people that would have fallen off the rails.

1987
01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:03.020
It was sniffing glue or huffing Doritos.
Yeah.

1988
01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.350
So is it tricky for even intelligent people?

1989
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:08.480
Certainly can be conditions.

1990
01:54:08.481 --> 01:54:13.310
Very biology varies but for the most part we've been sold a package shit.
Yeah.

1991
01:54:13.311 --> 01:54:14.144
And uh,

1992
01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:18.500
and it feels pile of shit and it feels like I'm,

1993
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:23.780
the tide is changing,
right?
I mean it's a yes,
this was a big one.
Yeah.

1994
01:54:23.781 --> 01:54:26.150
This is huge.
That Sanjay Gupta,

1995
01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:29.750
that's the guy who was also accused of being a shill because he was getting paid

1996
01:54:29.751 --> 01:54:33.050
millions of dollars by or thousands of dollars.
Excuse me.

1997
01:54:33.051 --> 01:54:37.040
I'm an exaggerated thousands of dollars by the pharmaceutical companies.

1998
01:54:37.110 --> 01:54:40.370
So blood pressure medication or something.
I don't know what it was.

1999
01:54:40.371 --> 01:54:44.200
But Dr drew apparently it got it got a little cash on a sack too.
You know,

2000
01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:45.500
dog lucky man.

2001
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:50.240
Hang just running shit on TV for my own personal benefit.
I got to wet.

2002
01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:55.040
I Bake motherfucker love,
nice cause dog.
I like pretty shiny shit.

2003
01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:57.080
Give the doctor tastes.
Now,

2004
01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:02.270
I don't think there's anything wrong with the good doctor getting consultations

2005
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:05.840
or giving consultations are making some money.
Nothing wrong with that.

2006
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:09.320
It's just like it's against the hippocratic oath.
But when it isn't,

2007
01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.540
I would think so.
I mean,
they're supposed to,

2008
01:55:11.930 --> 01:55:15.830
they're supposed to be as neutral as possible.
If scientists,

2009
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:20.840
and I think if they're dispensing advice that can affect your life,
your health,

2010
01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:25.910
but,
but,
but,
but these people have taken an oath,
surely they would only do good.

2011
01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:30.530
And just the fact that this company's making them hundreds of thousands of

2012
01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:30.800
dollars a year,

2013
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:34.580
that doesn't mean that they'd be willing to say things they wouldn't ordinarily

2014
01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:35.781
say it's true.

2015
01:55:35.781 --> 01:55:39.830
They would only sign on for the ones that they absolutely believe that's the

2016
01:55:39.831 --> 01:55:40.810
only way they do it.
Right.

2017
01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:44.070
Some doctors role doctors are different than all other people

2018
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.570
<v 5>that have ever existed in fact,</v>

2019
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:47.430
<v 4>and judges,
yes.</v>

2020
01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:51.480
Judges are all completely unaffected by the political party that got them into

2021
01:55:51.481 --> 01:55:52.314
office.

2022
01:55:53.450 --> 01:55:55.640
<v 5>Oh,
we're fucked.
It's a stupid system in it.</v>

2023
01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:59.100
<v 4>It's a crazy system.
But,
um,
you know,</v>

2024
01:55:59.101 --> 01:56:02.160
it seems to me that this pot thing I feel,

2025
01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:05.940
I feel really excited about some of the trends that we're getting with legalized

2026
01:56:05.941 --> 01:56:09.840
gay marriage with uh,
you know,
legalized marijuana.
I think these are,

2027
01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:13.020
these are big fucking cracks in the,
uh,
in the wall.

2028
01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:15.560
<v 5>I think so too.
I think it's also,</v>

2029
01:56:15.561 --> 01:56:19.670
there's an understanding that people are finally getting that we've been sort of

2030
01:56:19.671 --> 01:56:23.810
sold this bill of goods that it's conservative versus liberal.
Okay.
Look folks,

2031
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:28.640
when now we have a liberal president and everything is exactly the same.
Exactly.

2032
01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:29.660
It's got to stop.

2033
01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:34.810
Like at this point in time when a guy who is a fucking half black son of a

2034
01:56:34.881 --> 01:56:35.990
single parent,

2035
01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:40.340
when that guy is doing the same shit and it's running exactly the same way

2036
01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.440
horribly wrong,
we've been sold a bill of goods,
right?

2037
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:47.870
We're duking it out with each other over gay marriage and nonsense.

2038
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:50.180
Let's just get married.
Who gives a fuck?

2039
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:55.100
And then I think slowly but surely as people realize that this immediate

2040
01:56:55.101 --> 01:56:59.390
connection with homosexual,
we in like liberal De de,

2041
01:56:59.410 --> 01:57:03.800
De,
De,
De,
De,
de vi,
something wrong with the way.
Uh,
they're,

2042
01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:05.690
they've been raised,
you know,

2043
01:57:05.691 --> 01:57:08.960
a delinquent evil and yeah,

2044
01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.780
<v 4>Christian aids because they deserved it.</v>

2045
01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:16.030
<v 5>Like these ideas or these are ridiculous and at certain point in time people</v>

2046
01:57:16.031 --> 01:57:18.720
going,
oh yeah,
yeah I know.
I decided,

2047
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:21.670
I thought gay people were trying to recruit people.

2048
01:57:21.671 --> 01:57:25.720
Like people are slowly starting to like realize that it's stupid.

2049
01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:30.720
<v 4>But if you could put three things on the table that should be dealt with and</v>

2050
01:57:30.941 --> 01:57:35.170
talked about and change to be made versus all these window dressing things,

2051
01:57:35.470 --> 01:57:40.270
even abortion,
there's are all they affect,
people deal with it,

2052
01:57:40.271 --> 01:57:41.140
how they want to deal with them.

2053
01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:43.650
What are the things that you think should be in the,

2054
01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:45.550
in the public discourse right now?

2055
01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:50.370
<v 5>The biggest one would be people being able to vote on everything.</v>

2056
01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:55.960
Everything that gets done,
every war.
Electoral.
Unless it's in,
in,

2057
01:57:56.340 --> 01:58:00.690
you know,
immediate defense of life.
You know those situations like Pearl Harbor,

2058
01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:03.530
you know,
there'd been attack,
get the boats are there,
shoot back,
and you know,

2059
01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:06.090
that type of a scenario.
Everything.
Other than that,

2060
01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:11.280
I think there should be an educated discourse and that's the only way that you

2061
01:58:11.281 --> 01:58:16.281
have a government that acts in representation of the people itself.

2062
01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:21.390
So most people would not be for most of the things that happen,

2063
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:25.250
especially if they were educated about the ramifications.
This is the,

2064
01:58:25.251 --> 01:58:29.850
the actual motivation.
Here's the pros and cons.
Here's the conspiracy theory.

2065
01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:32.820
If we looked at at all,
like from an educated standpoint,

2066
01:58:32.850 --> 01:58:35.580
much less would slip through the cracks,
but because,

2067
01:58:35.930 --> 01:58:39.800
<v 4>and they have to make it easy because what it comes down to is who will be</v>

2068
01:58:39.801 --> 01:58:42.130
motivated to actually to the polls and vote.

2069
01:58:42.131 --> 01:58:46.330
It's gotta be on your fucking laptop with a code.
You've,
well,

2070
01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.490
there's votes.
What once a week.

2071
01:58:48.610 --> 01:58:51.850
<v 0>Yeah.
People say that.
Oh,
you can fucking,
someone's going to hack into it.</v>

2072
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:56.200
Guess what else you can do online bank.
Okay.

2073
01:58:56.201 --> 01:58:57.610
You can bank online.

2074
01:58:57.611 --> 01:59:02.611
It's the nutty that's way nuttier than check left for yes and right for no

2075
01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:04.900
putting your money,

2076
01:59:04.901 --> 01:59:09.901
your fucking ones and Zeros in some weird account somewhere and moving around.

2077
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:14.170
It's on plastic and you're one through the machine at the gas station that's

2078
01:59:14.171 --> 01:59:18.310
fucking way nuttier than voting way daddy act into,
you know,

2079
01:59:18.311 --> 01:59:20.560
you look at what they've hacked into with wikileaks online,

2080
01:59:20.561 --> 01:59:25.210
they've got national secret,
you know,
nuclear codes are online.

2081
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:29.560
I think about the number of transactions to take place banking wise every day

2082
01:59:29.561 --> 01:59:33.880
online and then add to those stock market transactions.

2083
01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:38.410
Add to those long people are getting loans online.
You know,
I mean there's,

2084
01:59:38.590 --> 01:59:42.430
the amount of transactions that are taking place are fucking staggering.

2085
01:59:42.490 --> 01:59:46.840
Trillions probably every day probably.
So that seems like,
yeah,

2086
01:59:46.841 --> 01:59:47.674
if you could.

2087
01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:50.850
<v 4>Problem is like with the voting booths,
it turns out there was a Republican,</v>

2088
01:59:51.150 --> 01:59:56.070
one of the main Republican fundraisers in Florida was the guy that designed the

2089
01:59:56.071 --> 01:59:58.620
voting booths for Florida.
It's like,
all right,

2090
01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:02.130
we got to pick a fucking company to set up the software to vote.

2091
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:06.000
That is from Switzerland.
They don't like black people

2092
02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:09.380
<v 0>but they,
they're neutral to us voting well it's just one person.</v>

2093
02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:13.040
This is not represent the entire stretchy.
One person fucked up with Oprah,

2094
02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:16.660
maybe Oprah of like tries to fuck with people and she goes and gets made up like

2095
02:00:16.661 --> 02:00:21.590
go homeless lady puts like a sake scabs.
Yeah.
Yo Yo.
Very obnoxious.
Sort of like,

2096
02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:23.630
like a Kung Fu master might,
you know,

2097
02:00:23.631 --> 02:00:27.110
pretend to be like a drunk and stumble into a bar to get people to push them

2098
02:00:27.111 --> 02:00:30.050
around.
Fuck people up.
I've met people who've done that before.

2099
02:00:30.210 --> 02:00:33.760
Maybe that's what Oprah did.
She's leaving out part of this story,
right?

2100
02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:36.920
People used to think the ACA get to debt purse.

2101
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:40.800
Oh man,
that person does shit.

2102
02:00:41.050 --> 02:00:44.670
<v 4>Y'All give me a of Rome bow and one of those</v>

2103
02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:49.220
<v 0>purses to imagine if Oprah was a troll and she just goes around.</v>

2104
02:00:49.221 --> 02:00:50.570
She's bored with it being a billionaire.

2105
02:00:50.750 --> 02:00:55.050
So she goes around just trying to get people to talk shit in trapping people

2106
02:00:55.051 --> 02:01:00.020
like pitch.
I'm Oprah smack.
That's her new show,

2107
02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:04.160
bitch.
I'm Oprah,
which is at a certain point in time,

2108
02:01:04.161 --> 02:01:07.880
if she really wants to go out gangster,
now's the time to really go for it.
Bitch,

2109
02:01:07.881 --> 02:01:11.000
I'm Oprah.
Should it be the name of her next show?
Right.
You should run it.

2110
02:01:11.570 --> 02:01:14.700
<v 4>I would run that because I understand the black people.</v>

2111
02:01:15.630 --> 02:01:19.380
I have written on about five black shows and I don't know why,

2112
02:01:19.381 --> 02:01:24.381
but my first writing job was on Cedric the entertainer presents Cedric St Louis

2113
02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:28.740
Black Guy who fucking sings and dances.
I get hired to write his monologues,

2114
02:01:28.770 --> 02:01:32.700
just me.
Wow.
Then I go on.
I wrote on a

2115
02:01:32.770 --> 02:01:35.130
<v 0>kind of,
let me ask you that before you stop,
how did you do that?</v>

2116
02:01:35.330 --> 02:01:36.720
Like what was the process?

2117
02:01:37.150 --> 02:01:40.130
<v 4>Well,
Louis C K was on the show and I told them,
look,
I haven't</v>

2118
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:43.010
<v 1>seen my one year old son and a year because I've been on the road so much.</v>

2119
02:01:43.011 --> 02:01:43.970
I need a writing job.

2120
02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:47.720
So he sets up a meeting with Cedric and I came in and I pitched him a few ideas

2121
02:01:47.721 --> 02:01:50.540
for monologues and I said,
well,
why are black people,

2122
02:01:50.541 --> 02:01:53.450
I was the first ones kicked off reality shows if there's a vote,

2123
02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:56.240
if it's survivor,
you gotta be like Tyrone,

2124
02:01:56.241 --> 02:01:59.450
I know you were a green baret you saved us from that Barracuda.

2125
02:01:59.630 --> 02:02:03.920
You set up the tent during storm but you black man hit the pavement.

2126
02:02:05.570 --> 02:02:08.990
So I gave him like three ideas like that and he was like sold.

2127
02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:13.340
And then we would sit a,
the shows were taped on Friday nights.
On Monday.

2128
02:02:13.610 --> 02:02:16.460
I just hang out in his office with him for like an hour and we would just shoot

2129
02:02:16.461 --> 02:02:19.940
the shit,
you know,
not topical ideas,
just you know,
anything.

2130
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:23.180
And we'd shoot the shit and a writer's assistant would sit there,
tap,
tap,
tap,

2131
02:02:23.181 --> 02:02:25.070
tap writing,
everything we said down.

2132
02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:29.690
And then I'd have a couple of days to kind of compile it,
tweak it,
punch it up,

2133
02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:33.380
show it to him,
and then he'd go,
yeah,
I like this,
I like that.

2134
02:02:33.790 --> 02:02:38.060
And that was it.
Friday,
getting makeup put on me.

2135
02:02:38.061 --> 02:02:38.894
While you've got to remember,

2136
02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:43.040
he would rehearse and choreograph an entire dance number.
He was incredible.

2137
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:45.830
And so he would come out on stage,

2138
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:49.700
do a dance number with the sensei sensation dancers finish,

2139
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:52.490
hit his mark and do the monologue.

2140
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:56.720
No teleprompter,
no cue cards.

2141
02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:59.030
All he had was me after Wednesday.

2142
02:02:59.031 --> 02:03:02.630
I would sit in is a makeup room while he was getting made up.

2143
02:03:02.631 --> 02:03:06.380
And I would be like a given like a one sheet of paper.
You know,

2144
02:03:06.381 --> 02:03:10.040
we're going to talk about the Amish and ut hit this,
beat this,
beat this,

2145
02:03:10.041 --> 02:03:14.540
beat this beat.
You go out on this Joe.
Got It.
Okay.
Thanks Greg.
Thanks.

2146
02:03:14.541 --> 02:03:18.290
Fits dog.
Nail it every time.

2147
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:20.290
<v 5>Wow.
So that was,
that's,</v>

2148
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:23.270
that must've been a fun Gig to write in someone else's voice.

2149
02:03:23.370 --> 02:03:27.270
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah,
it was.
And then what was great is I was surrounded by,
you know,</v>

2150
02:03:27.271 --> 02:03:29.690
it was Louis C,
k and j Johnson and uh,

2151
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:34.500
so all black writers except for me and Louie.
And so it was like on tape night.

2152
02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:38.520
It was fucking crazy.
We would,
uh,
every,

2153
02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:41.880
every guy's office was a different vibe.

2154
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:46.290
You know what one guy had the fucking bong go.
It was just pot.

2155
02:03:46.291 --> 02:03:49.890
And the next one,
there were these girls called the,
the dangerous dimes,

2156
02:03:50.190 --> 02:03:53.280
cause dimes with black people as she's a 10.
And they were,

2157
02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:56.400
they were these girls and all of a sudden on tape night you'd see it looked like

2158
02:03:56.401 --> 02:03:58.380
prostitutes that just got off the bus,

2159
02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:02.820
walking through with fucking micro mini dresses and those thick black thighs,

2160
02:04:03.370 --> 02:04:07.810
<v 5>stiletto heels and makeup was a door and walk went off.
I'll fuck.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

2161
02:04:07.811 --> 02:04:10.900
Tell me no,
I mean,
not with one.
I mean I used to,
no,
no,

2162
02:04:10.901 --> 02:04:15.280
I mean like close the door like right into a sink,
right on your feet

2163
02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.580
<v 1>on that show.
I was jerking off in the men's room one time and uh,</v>

2164
02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:21.330
my is the first week of work

2165
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:28.080
and the men's room had a urinal and a,
a and one,
a stall stall.

2166
02:04:28.230 --> 02:04:32.760
And I'm in there and I'm jerking off and I'm just climaxing and the door to the

2167
02:04:32.761 --> 02:04:37.050
stall opens and it's my boss show runner.

2168
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:41.100
Did he know you were jerking?
I doubled over anyone.
Oh.

2169
02:04:41.101 --> 02:04:45.780
And he walked out and I waited like 15 minutes and I came back in the writers'

2170
02:04:45.781 --> 02:04:46.021
room,

2171
02:04:46.021 --> 02:04:50.660
just looked at my computer fucking and nothing said about it for like a week.

2172
02:04:50.690 --> 02:04:52.700
I'm like,
am I going to get fired?
And then we're,

2173
02:04:52.701 --> 02:04:56.520
we're taught every talking one day and somebody is talking about taking shit and

2174
02:04:56.521 --> 02:05:00.720
he goes,
Jesus,
I walked in on Fitzsimmons the other day.
He was,
he was rich.

2175
02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:04.290
He was like doubled a,
you know,
I locked the door next time and I was like,

2176
02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:08.610
thank you.
You thought I was taking a shit.
Oh,

2177
02:05:08.611 --> 02:05:10.000
that's so funny.
So,

2178
02:05:10.001 --> 02:05:14.110
so you were sitting down jerking off right on the toilet seat.
Wow.
Yep.

2179
02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:18.740
Well he thought you were just struggling.
He thought I was struggling.
[inaudible]

2180
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:21.070
<v 5>legal.
Are you shooting one onto the floor?
Where were you coming?</v>

2181
02:05:21.700 --> 02:05:26.140
I would take toilet paper and I'd put it over the crown and I would just kind of

2182
02:05:26.170 --> 02:05:29.050
slowly,
that would look like you're about to wipe.
Like you walked in,

2183
02:05:29.051 --> 02:05:30.520
you're about to wipe.
Right.
Wow.

2184
02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:33.410
And that's a very anal move to cover it with a low,

2185
02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:36.580
the cover your load with toilet paper.
She catch it.
It never happened.

2186
02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:40.930
That's right.
You never see it and happened.
Shane be gone.
It's a good idea.

2187
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:44.710
This would do at the end of a fleshlight should be all tissues to catch it.

2188
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:48.420
<v 1>Doesn't it seem like there should be a condom in a fleshlight that you can just</v>

2189
02:05:48.421 --> 02:05:49.890
remove like a liner?

2190
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.730
You'd lose the feeling that patented rubber is patent for a reason.

2191
02:05:55.810 --> 02:05:59.740
<v 5>Yeah.
It's too mushy to be that thin.
If it was that,</v>

2192
02:05:59.741 --> 02:06:01.300
then it probably won't.

2193
02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:03.750
<v 1>You're no longer a spokesperson for the fleshlight.
Correct.</v>

2194
02:06:06.290 --> 02:06:09.410
<v 5>Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Um,
that was,
uh,</v>

2195
02:06:09.710 --> 02:06:12.860
one of the things where more people told me not to do it.

2196
02:06:14.090 --> 02:06:17.790
Then almost anything I've ever done more people like you regret.
It

2197
02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:23.460
doesn't,
it's something you fuck.
Who Cares?

2198
02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:27.470
Like the idea that it's evil or CD or what are you pretending you don't like

2199
02:06:27.471 --> 02:06:30.500
something touching your penis?
We really pretending that.

2200
02:06:30.670 --> 02:06:33.380
Or are we pretending it's only noble if you do it with your hands?

2201
02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:36.860
Are you allowed to use lube?
Are you allowed to do?
No,
no,
no.

2202
02:06:36.861 --> 02:06:38.900
You can only jerk off out of necessity.

2203
02:06:39.050 --> 02:06:42.890
You have to dry ticket in the shower to just be upset with yourself the entire

2204
02:06:42.891 --> 02:06:45.390
time.
Let's just a hit over what's really quickly now.

2205
02:06:45.391 --> 02:06:49.730
People look forward to jerking off and that's why there's a a billion porn tapes

2206
02:06:49.731 --> 02:06:52.460
out there.
And that's why fleshlight sell like hotcakes.

2207
02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:53.621
<v 1>You know what's crazy?</v>

2208
02:06:53.621 --> 02:06:56.290
As you think about all the sexual positions you'll have with your partner,

2209
02:06:56.291 --> 02:06:58.600
you're always trying to be creative,
try something new.

2210
02:06:58.601 --> 02:07:02.910
It's exciting and most people jerk up.
Most people.
Hell,
how the fuck do I know?

2211
02:07:02.911 --> 02:07:06.370
[inaudible] I know that I,

2212
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:11.260
I don't try anything.
Kick him out as a teenager,
you know,
I'd fuck everything.

2213
02:07:11.261 --> 02:07:12.280
You know,
my pillow.

2214
02:07:12.670 --> 02:07:16.330
I now it's just like same type of porn.

2215
02:07:16.331 --> 02:07:19.330
Usually the same spot.
Oh Man.
Yeah.

2216
02:07:19.770 --> 02:07:22.450
Do you like that you get into the Webcam stuff?
Have you tried that?

2217
02:07:22.451 --> 02:07:23.284
Never liked the web.

2218
02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:26.290
<v 5>I remember one time I,
uh,
had a date with this chick.</v>

2219
02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:29.740
It was just after high school and I kind of had a thing for her in high school.

2220
02:07:29.741 --> 02:07:33.700
We never did anything.
They were going to meet up and she was like DTF,

2221
02:07:33.730 --> 02:07:36.010
like completely down to fuck and I was working,
I was

2222
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:39.350
<v 2>doing construction and I was so horny thinking about it all day because it's</v>

2223
02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:44.230
been a while since I got some that I jerked off twice at work.
Not once,

2224
02:07:44.530 --> 02:07:45.850
twice,
twice.

2225
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.150
I jerked off once in a bathroom at one time I shot a load out of the door.

2226
02:07:49.580 --> 02:07:50.413
Who working,

2227
02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:54.790
where can the unfinished basement and it had like a basement door and I just

2228
02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:59.020
looked around but then that night when I hooked up with the girl I could barely

2229
02:07:59.021 --> 02:08:02.620
get it up.
I was tired from work cause I had a construction jobs.

2230
02:08:02.650 --> 02:08:06.670
Like at the end of the day you were beat and I was beating off all day so that

2231
02:08:06.671 --> 02:08:09.790
made me tired and I just like,
my desire was gone.

2232
02:08:09.791 --> 02:08:14.740
I had already come twice in a day like an idiot.
Like once is a good move.

2233
02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:18.910
I twice as ridiculous to do that.
I'm one time Charlie.
I was like,

2234
02:08:19.450 --> 02:08:21.550
I was working this club early on.

2235
02:08:21.551 --> 02:08:25.680
I was like the opening act to catch a rising star down at Princeton,
New Jersey.

2236
02:08:25.681 --> 02:08:29.710
Oh,
I remember that Gig.
Yeah.
Near the college near the college.

2237
02:08:29.711 --> 02:08:32.140
And you stayed in a hotel and it was a beautiful high at,

2238
02:08:32.141 --> 02:08:35.920
so it was a Gig that all the New York comics like you to take the train an hour

2239
02:08:35.921 --> 02:08:39.380
and 20 minutes down and you stay in a nice hotel,
good room.
Anyway,

2240
02:08:39.381 --> 02:08:41.050
so there was this one chicken and you know,

2241
02:08:41.051 --> 02:08:44.800
there's always the one girl that people know,
Oh yeah,
when you're there Jenny,

2242
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:46.900
she'll take care of it,
you know,
she's the one that fucks.

2243
02:08:48.190 --> 02:08:51.760
So we'd go out to like a Red Robin restaurant after the show and she's flirting

2244
02:08:51.761 --> 02:08:53.270
with me.
And uh,
she's,

2245
02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:57.340
she was like a physical therapist with short blonde hair and it was really rock

2246
02:08:57.341 --> 02:09:02.310
hard body.
I'm taking my pants off right now.
Good rack,
good solid rack.
And uh,

2247
02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:05.320
so she says,
so we're talking,
I go,
well,
you want to go to my eye?
She goes,

2248
02:09:05.321 --> 02:09:08.110
I can't really go in the hotel because I worked there.
And she goes,

2249
02:09:08.111 --> 02:09:09.940
you know what,
just let me in the back door.

2250
02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:14.380
So I let her in the back door and she comes up to my room and uh,
she is,

2251
02:09:14.381 --> 02:09:17.530
what do you call down to fuck?
She is e t t.
F.

2252
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:21.430
So she goes down and she blows me and I,
and I,
and I blast.

2253
02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:26.950
And then she,
she wants to make love with me too,
like,
and I,
and I,

2254
02:09:26.951 --> 02:09:30.970
for the only time in my life I couldn't give it up and she got pissed and yelled

2255
02:09:30.971 --> 02:09:34.900
at me and left.
She yelled at you not yelled,

2256
02:09:34.901 --> 02:09:38.980
but she was frustrated and disappointed in me and it came through.

2257
02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:45.270
We felt like,
were you sober at the time?
Yeah.
So it was just,

2258
02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:48.690
you just had nothing left.
I just can't,
I can't do that.
I never,

2259
02:09:48.691 --> 02:09:50.680
I've never been able to do that.
Huh.

2260
02:09:52.650 --> 02:09:56.190
It's funny that she got mad.
Yeah.
I would get mad too if I was a girl.
I get it.

2261
02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.810
Well that's why I would say likely with oral sex,
there's no upside for women.

2262
02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:04.080
Right.
For us,
does it help side?
Because if we go down on her,

2263
02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:09.240
she's ready to rock.
After that,
everyone's getting laid after you go down on her.

2264
02:10:09.241 --> 02:10:12.090
If she goes down on you,
you may just leave.

2265
02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:16.470
So I had to be a woman.
I know it is,

2266
02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:21.020
but think of having babies growing signed yet.
That's the benefit.
That's the,

2267
02:10:21.050 --> 02:10:25.130
that's the upside.
Yeah.
If you give a guy a blow job,
you can't get it up again,

2268
02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:27.530
but you can make people with your pussy.
Right.

2269
02:10:29.190 --> 02:10:33.500
Did you guys hear which take Virgin Airlines is doing comedy now on the actual

2270
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:34.200
no plane

2271
02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:37.460
<v 1>please.
They used to do that on the,
on the flights to London.
Right.</v>

2272
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:39.040
Please tell me that.
Yeah.

2273
02:10:39.050 --> 02:10:42.500
And you can let go on their Twitter page and to find out who's playing and
stuff,

2274
02:10:42.501 --> 02:10:44.120
but can you imagine that with your job?

2275
02:10:44.121 --> 02:10:47.630
Like I'm playing for the next week in the air.
You know what?

2276
02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:49.730
That would be hilarious.

2277
02:10:49.731 --> 02:10:54.731
Bring a friend and videotape it and just do fucking crazy shit.

2278
02:10:55.340 --> 02:11:00.170
Yeah,
that would be awesome.
Member of the time,
me and Joe got hired to do,

2279
02:11:00.171 --> 02:11:04.070
to just be funny at an aquarium in Boston for a corporation.

2280
02:11:04.071 --> 02:11:07.040
It was like their Christmas party and we got hired and we're like,
oh great,

2281
02:11:07.041 --> 02:11:10.070
we're going to do stand up at this Christmas party.
And then they tell us no,
no,

2282
02:11:10.071 --> 02:11:10.311
no,
no.

2283
02:11:10.311 --> 02:11:15.260
Just just walk around and do funny stuff like no one knew we were comedians

2284
02:11:15.261 --> 02:11:17.240
cause it was like,
you know,
a couple of hundred people.

2285
02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:22.190
So everybody had know each other and like we're eating off people's plates and

2286
02:11:22.191 --> 02:11:25.820
making fun of their ties.
And we were just,
people fucking hated us.
It was,

2287
02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:29.670
it wasn't working.
Say for the record.
I did not eat up anybody's plate.

2288
02:11:30.610 --> 02:11:32.280
Greg did.
I did.

2289
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:36.500
<v 5>He was just being funny with a big smile on his face to the guys strawberry and</v>

2290
02:11:36.501 --> 02:11:39.890
this guy wanted to kill.
Right.
And I was like,
Oh my God,

2291
02:11:39.891 --> 02:11:41.870
this guy's going to hit him.
Something's going to go out.
And the guy just goes,

2292
02:11:41.871 --> 02:11:45.530
you're a fucking asshole.
And it was like,
whoa.

2293
02:11:45.531 --> 02:11:47.060
Like this just got real.

2294
02:11:47.150 --> 02:11:48.890
<v 1>So I just,
so I just went in the corner,</v>

2295
02:11:48.891 --> 02:11:51.800
it started eating fucking hors d'oeuvres and then all of a sudden I hear on the

2296
02:11:51.801 --> 02:11:56.450
loudspeaker,
I hear Joe on that.
He found the microphone and he's like,

2297
02:11:56.750 --> 02:12:00.890
I've tension.
Uh,
uh,
any parent with a child with a blue sweater,

2298
02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:04.970
he's now floating in the shark tank.
Please report to security.

2299
02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:09.320
And people thought it was real.
It was fucking,
I don't,

2300
02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:11.870
did we get kicked out or just laughing like that happened?

2301
02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:16.430
I know I didn't get paid.
I didn't get paid.
I don't think I was like 200 bucks.

2302
02:12:17.530 --> 02:12:20.910
<v 5>We should,
it should have never happened.
No one should have ever liked.</v>

2303
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:23.200
Got a bunch of 20 year old comedians and said,

2304
02:12:23.201 --> 02:12:25.510
go do whatever you want to do at this aquarium.

2305
02:12:26.170 --> 02:12:29.500
It was an ad agency trying to be creative,
trying something new.
You dummies.

2306
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:33.460
I think the plane thing would be fine as long as you didn't have to be a part of

2307
02:12:33.461 --> 02:12:36.280
the show.
Like what if you're trying to get some work done?
And the guy's like,

2308
02:12:36.281 --> 02:12:40.370
where are you from sir?
I,
they're like,
oh no.
Like I'm sorry.
I have an hour for,

2309
02:12:40.420 --> 02:12:43.650
oh,
somebody said Nas whole doesn't want to play along.
Like,
oh,
he's got an hour,

2310
02:12:43.710 --> 02:12:46.150
I've got to work.
I have to write things I have to do.

2311
02:12:46.151 --> 02:12:47.860
I didn't know I was going to have to react to you.

2312
02:12:48.290 --> 02:12:53.270
<v 1>It's almost like you should be in a soundproof booth and the people that want to</v>

2313
02:12:53.271 --> 02:12:56.060
hear you put on their headphones,
but if you don't want to hear it,

2314
02:12:56.061 --> 02:13:00.560
you can't hear it.
Like,
or like a whack off booth.
You're a comedian.
Yeah,

2315
02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:04.220
and if you don't have the headphones,
he's just like,
ugh.

2316
02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:09.000
<v 5>That's too complicated.
Where,
where do you think the comic was stand?
I guess.</v>

2317
02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:12.300
What about cat first class?
People would probably pissed.

2318
02:13:12.570 --> 02:13:14.640
That'd be the most likely to say this is bullshit.

2319
02:13:14.641 --> 02:13:17.550
I want to see a fucking comedian.
I got to do my spreadsheet.

2320
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:21.420
So maybe it would be like in the middle,
like when FirstClass separates to coach,

2321
02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:24.230
they'll stand right there and do their little app.

2322
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:26.410
<v 1>Meanwhile FirstClass if they want to do it right.</v>

2323
02:13:26.411 --> 02:13:29.500
I don't know if this has been done.
I think playboy or Hooters,

2324
02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:32.230
Hooters had a plane at one point.
Who does that?
A plane.
Yeah.
Yep.

2325
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:34.110
That was my dream to take it.

2326
02:13:34.111 --> 02:13:36.520
But like there was like one flight and it was like Oklahoma.

2327
02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:38.820
It's totally loved all the time.

2328
02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:45.990
Like people would fly to Oklahoma just to fly to Florida to error.
Well you know,

2329
02:13:45.991 --> 02:13:50.830
more transfer over to a Hooters.
Got To stop shop.

2330
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:54.840
But imagine getting a lap dance and first class on a flight,

2331
02:13:57.390 --> 02:14:01.080
right eyes.
Oh,
that'd be amazing because I could,
I could have,
you know,

2332
02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:06.450
five hours of really high and strippers just walking around gently giving lap

2333
02:14:06.451 --> 02:14:10.490
dances.
Not No fucking van Halen blasting,
just just cool,

2334
02:14:10.930 --> 02:14:12.650
cool lap dances to sleep.

2335
02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:17.120
<v 0>Really slow music,
nice and central.</v>

2336
02:14:17.121 --> 02:14:21.110
Sit through growing the tits in your face and just gently knocking them back and

2337
02:14:21.111 --> 02:14:23.820
forth way sit there and go,
ah,

2338
02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:27.800
the lap dances.
A very strange creation.
It is.

2339
02:14:27.801 --> 02:14:32.801
Eddie Bravo has a fucking hilarious story about the birth of the lap dance about

2340
02:14:34.191 --> 02:14:38.990
he was working in a comedy club and he saw the lap dance become a feature and

2341
02:14:38.991 --> 02:14:40.010
that before that it was just,

2342
02:14:40.011 --> 02:14:44.330
the women would dance on stage and then it was like,
well we got a new thing,

2343
02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:47.540
you're going to be able to do lap dances.
And most of the girls were like,

2344
02:14:47.541 --> 02:14:51.530
fuck that.
I'm not sitting on anybody's fucking loud.
Big Line to cross.
Yeah.

2345
02:14:51.531 --> 02:14:56.531
But one girl did and the first day this one girl made just fucking ass piles of

2346
02:14:57.441 --> 02:14:58.190
money.

2347
02:14:58.190 --> 02:15:03.190
And so after that there was like one extra girl the next day and then two girls

2348
02:15:03.921 --> 02:15:06.490
and then four.
And before you know it,
they were all doing it.
Yeah.

2349
02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:07.970
But it took a while.
It's just they,

2350
02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:10.610
they had to just start bringing in money and they only grow.

2351
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:11.720
I mean people would be like,

2352
02:15:11.721 --> 02:15:14.660
be like waiting in line to get lap dances from this one girl.

2353
02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:18.410
And this one girl was just sitting on everybody's Dick Bear Pussy.

2354
02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:19.430
Like they're allowed to do that.

2355
02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:24.140
They sent me your Dick Bear Pussy where everywhere.
No Shit.
Everywhere.

2356
02:15:24.141 --> 02:15:26.720
That doesn't serve alcohol.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

2357
02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:29.930
<v 1>Have you seen people when I was in Montreal and Montreal is pretty famous for</v>

2358
02:15:29.931 --> 02:15:34.250
the Strip clubs [inaudible] and um,
I was there for six nights.

2359
02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:38.930
I didn't go to one and I just had no,
fuck.
I figured I might go,
who knows?

2360
02:15:38.931 --> 02:15:42.350
People go as a group,
right?
I Dunno.
I think,
I think that

2361
02:15:43.050 --> 02:15:43.883
<v 0>you were over it.</v>

2362
02:15:44.170 --> 02:15:45.400
<v 1>I think I'm over it.
I don't know why.</v>

2363
02:15:45.401 --> 02:15:46.900
I don't know if it's cause I have a daughter

2364
02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:51.020
<v 0>or it just,
I don't know.</v>

2365
02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:52.840
Massage parlors are so much cheaper.

2366
02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:56.610
<v 1>It is.
If you think about the actual,</v>

2367
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:59.500
if you go to the right ones and get the actual result you're looking for,

2368
02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:02.210
how much does that cost?
Oh,
depends what you want.

2369
02:16:02.211 --> 02:16:06.530
What do you want going to jerk you off?
There's some where you gotta go.
Okay,

2370
02:16:06.531 --> 02:16:08.210
come on back.
They're gonna open up the curtain.

2371
02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:10.190
Brian's got a table set up back there.

2372
02:16:11.090 --> 02:16:14.060
You'd get a lot more guests on the podcast come back with a wig on.

2373
02:16:14.150 --> 02:16:16.000
There'd be like 10 guests in here every day.

2374
02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:21.200
It's handjobs places are much more common,
but blow job places are pretty easy.

2375
02:16:21.201 --> 02:16:25.010
And Florence sex places,
there's about 20 that I know of here in Los Angeles.

2376
02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:30.070
How much is it to go get a massage and a hand job,
a saw and a hand job?
You'll

2377
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:33.490
<v 7>be in and out with a hour massage for like 80 bucks.
Cheap.</v>

2378
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:36.300
<v 0>It would be nice if it also came with a magic wand.</v>

2379
02:16:36.301 --> 02:16:38.610
You presses the back of their head and they would forget everything that

2380
02:16:38.611 --> 02:16:39.680
happened.
Yeah.

2381
02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:44.900
They develop the ability to Zap someone and you lose the last 30 minutes of,

2382
02:16:45.151 --> 02:16:48.150
of memory just to complete full eraser.
Oh,
you don't want the,

2383
02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:50.700
you don't want them as Seuss.
Remembering who you are,

2384
02:16:50.730 --> 02:16:51.870
where you could sneak out that way.

2385
02:16:51.871 --> 02:16:54.180
You don't have to feel the shame like nothing ever happened.
Right.

2386
02:16:54.530 --> 02:16:56.550
To knows nothing ever happened.

2387
02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:59.380
<v 7>They usually say,
I go to,</v>

2388
02:16:59.381 --> 02:17:04.030
I go to massage places that are like 39 bucks,
45 bucks,

2389
02:17:04.031 --> 02:17:08.410
places usually do those places offer the happy ending.
Well,

2390
02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:09.430
like I've said before,

2391
02:17:09.431 --> 02:17:13.400
you can go to rub maps.com to find out exactly which places to go to.

2392
02:17:13.410 --> 02:17:16.920
Pub Map rub.
Like are you be right?
It could be a Dick and PAS,

2393
02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:20.830
but don't go to the rug map maps.
This is a confusing fucking website.

2394
02:17:20.831 --> 02:17:23.850
What does Brian Redman talking about?
Right.
But most places do that.

2395
02:17:23.851 --> 02:17:27.340
The big thing is,
is that when you usually go to these $40 places,

2396
02:17:27.341 --> 02:17:30.880
you're usually keeping your underwear on.
Your usually putting a towel over you.

2397
02:17:30.881 --> 02:17:31.270
You're,

2398
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:35.490
you're not doing anything to make them think that you want anything different.

2399
02:17:35.491 --> 02:17:38.530
Right?
So what you do is,
the easiest thing is just to take off all your clothes.

2400
02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:40.630
That's the big thing.
Like just take it all off,

2401
02:17:40.690 --> 02:17:42.460
throw all your towels on the floor,
don't,
you know,

2402
02:17:42.730 --> 02:17:46.070
just let her put a towel on you if she wants to.
And then if she's,

2403
02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:49.270
she'll start rubbing and you know,
and then you just kind of like,
you know,

2404
02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:52.810
moving around,
looking,
wondering,

2405
02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:57.460
he's giving a seminar on how to get chirped off really seedy.

2406
02:17:57.461 --> 02:18:01.370
My start rubbing her,
you know,
does she say it'll cost you this much?
Uh,

2407
02:18:01.390 --> 02:18:05.920
usually it's just given like you just tip,
like you just look up.

2408
02:18:06.250 --> 02:18:08.350
If she's going to give you a hand job that's like 40 bucks.

2409
02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:12.010
Just it's kind of like a,
a law,
like you know,
40 bucks.

2410
02:18:12.011 --> 02:18:16.540
I gave her 10 blowjobs sats,
sexist 100.
What if you just gave her a 10?

2411
02:18:16.541 --> 02:18:19.470
When she say something?
Maybe some places.
Well,

2412
02:18:19.471 --> 02:18:22.900
she probably would if she's an older person.
Like a lot of the older ladies,

2413
02:18:22.901 --> 02:18:26.000
they've been around so long,
they're hands are the softest.
Okay.

2414
02:18:26.670 --> 02:18:31.000
<v 0>Oh God,
he's doing material now.
I'm not,
I don't know.</v>

2415
02:18:31.170 --> 02:18:34.410
It's true.
They had the softest hands on the road.
It's like a little kid's hand.

2416
02:18:34.470 --> 02:18:36.450
They'd been jerking guys off forever.

2417
02:18:36.451 --> 02:18:40.110
That's like climbing up a rope for a year of your life.
But opposite.

2418
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:45.420
It's opposite.
Yeah,
because it's just skin and oily cock.
That's right.

2419
02:18:45.421 --> 02:18:48.360
There's an oil on our hand every day.
He's rubbing it back.

2420
02:18:48.630 --> 02:18:52.200
But it doesn't matter if your skin gets more brittle as you get old.

2421
02:18:52.201 --> 02:18:53.690
There's no way getting around it.
You can't do it.

2422
02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:55.350
Get around it with soaking it in oil.

2423
02:18:55.620 --> 02:19:00.270
They're going to have a leathery old soft omit,
greasy,

2424
02:19:00.271 --> 02:19:02.430
leathery softball,
mint jerk and you up.

2425
02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:08.880
It's like Tom cost soup.
You know,
that's why you should have them use their feet.

2426
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:11.820
Why isn't this someone's breath like someone would?

2427
02:19:11.821 --> 02:19:15.840
Stinky breath is one of the worst turnoffs in the history of the world.

2428
02:19:15.841 --> 02:19:19.380
Without a doubt.
Someone's talking to you in that breath stinks you,
I mean,

2429
02:19:19.410 --> 02:19:23.370
even like for having a conversation with someone,
even nonsexual.

2430
02:19:23.371 --> 02:19:27.130
But if you're attracted to a girl and you start talking to one of her breasts

2431
02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:28.460
and he's like,
Oh

2432
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:32.420
<v 1>God,
what do you do?
What do you do?
Do you tell her?
Did you try to be polite?</v>

2433
02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:36.080
That's funny you say that because I had a really good friend for a lot of years

2434
02:19:36.081 --> 02:19:38.420
and she was,
she was cute.
You know,

2435
02:19:38.421 --> 02:19:42.820
she was like a solid seven and a half to change shit.

2436
02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:47.960
Breath,
great personality.
Fucking single,

2437
02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:51.770
no dates and her breath stank.
Oh,
and I didn't know.

2438
02:19:51.980 --> 02:19:56.810
I think I erred in not just anonymously sending her a note or an email to never

2439
02:19:56.811 --> 02:19:59.690
told you.
You never told her.
I never said anything.
And you know,

2440
02:19:59.691 --> 02:20:02.700
a lot of times I think it's probably like tooth decay or something.
Yes.

2441
02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:06.650
Ginger Vitus I mean if it smells like an antique bookstore,
that's usually,
yeah,

2442
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:08.800
<v 5>it means that you have some kind of like ginger bitus.</v>

2443
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:13.250
It's a bit of a like a run hour,
like a rotting smell.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2444
02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:16.890
It's really bad.
I mean,
you see people with like if you have,
um,

2445
02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:19.640
I had a root canal once I had an old filling,

2446
02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:22.220
I cracked my tooth and then they'd filled it in,

2447
02:20:22.221 --> 02:20:23.690
but then someone another under the filling,

2448
02:20:23.691 --> 02:20:26.720
it's sort to go bad so they could drill in and give me a root canal.

2449
02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:31.550
And as he went through the tooth,
it popped into the,
the Reese,

2450
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:36.470
the abscess and it made this horrible smell.
It was so nasty,

2451
02:20:36.471 --> 02:20:39.920
man.
It like,
I could smell like rot.
I go,
Ooh,

2452
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:42.650
I goes down like the rotten tooth that smells like that.
He goes,
yeah,

2453
02:20:42.651 --> 02:20:47.240
that's what they smell like when you opened them up.
[inaudible] nasty.
Yeah.

2454
02:20:47.241 --> 02:20:50.150
It was like that Shit's just living in your inside my tooth.

2455
02:20:50.210 --> 02:20:54.800
Like you had to drill through my tooth.
My,
I had cracked underneath.
Um,

2456
02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:58.730
I have some cracks on my teeth from lifting weights from grinding your teeth.

2457
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.631
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2458
02:20:59.631 --> 02:21:03.620
Like I went to the doctor once and the the dentist and he was like,

2459
02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:06.380
do you like grind your teeth at night when you sleep?

2460
02:21:06.381 --> 02:21:10.040
Like if you were in a car accident,
like your teeth are all cracked,
like,

2461
02:21:10.050 --> 02:21:13.910
and then I go,
no.
He goes,
do you lift weights?
And I go,
yeah.
He goes,
okay,

2462
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:16.790
you got to get a mouthpiece or something.
Look what you're doing your teeth.

2463
02:21:16.791 --> 02:21:21.380
And he shows me like the microscopic view of my teeth are all cracked like all

2464
02:21:21.381 --> 02:21:22.214
over the top of them.

2465
02:21:22.430 --> 02:21:26.540
And so apparently one of the filters had gotten like a loose or something and

2466
02:21:26.541 --> 02:21:30.560
some,
some deposits or something or they got in through the bottom of the filter.

2467
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:34.010
Like there had been an opening somehow or another just enough to get the party

2468
02:21:34.011 --> 02:21:38.870
started and that's all you need is some form of decay underneath the filling or

2469
02:21:38.871 --> 02:21:41.810
inside a gum line and then just rots right through.

2470
02:21:41.930 --> 02:21:46.520
<v 1>You're this tooth right here got knocked out when I was about 15 years old and</v>

2471
02:21:46.521 --> 02:21:48.590
they did a root canal and put this calf on

2472
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:54.830
fucking 31 years later.
No problem.
Strong as it ever was.

2473
02:21:55.170 --> 02:21:56.900
And it's a bottom tooth so you don't really see it.

2474
02:21:57.420 --> 02:22:02.370
<v 5>Um,
Mike,
um,
Mike Goldberg,
the guy do the UFC with,
he's got his front teeth.</v>

2475
02:22:02.371 --> 02:22:04.500
They had to actually drill posts.

2476
02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:07.380
I think you got them knocked out playing hockey.
Yeah,
mine has a post.

2477
02:22:07.410 --> 02:22:09.540
Oh that's right.
Yeah.
But his was like,

2478
02:22:09.541 --> 02:22:13.230
he had a one that was clip on with a magnet for awhile when they were in the

2479
02:22:13.231 --> 02:22:15.570
middle of doing it.
Have you seen those really?
Yeah.

2480
02:22:15.571 --> 02:22:20.460
May Slides Klink who would clip on with a magnet and you're like,
what the hell?

2481
02:22:20.490 --> 02:22:24.630
Like you know,
like a piece of metal in his fucking jaw.
This screwed in there.

2482
02:22:24.631 --> 02:22:25.950
Like the for this

2483
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:28.110
<v 0>and it has to sit there for a while.
Right.</v>

2484
02:22:28.111 --> 02:22:30.990
Is that what the deal is that has to grow into your bone and actually has the

2485
02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.070
menu with your,

2486
02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:36.540
your bone is titanium rob telling you they put a post on this?

2487
02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:40.590
I it has no wiggle whatsoever after all these years.

2488
02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:43.260
Did you make you some bad ass teeth?
That's right.
That's nice.

2489
02:22:43.470 --> 02:22:46.650
That's the saddest thing in the world when people have no fucking teeth.
Yeah,

2490
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:50.310
and it's expensive too.
And then if you get a bad job done,
then fucking,

2491
02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:53.670
you get coffee stains on it or if you smoke and it's a different color.

2492
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:56.340
I had a friend,
I had a friend who was a pool player.

2493
02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:59.390
His name was Mount Vernon Tommy,
who was like a,

2494
02:22:59.490 --> 02:23:03.840
one of the best pool players around white plains,
New York,
like would gamble,

2495
02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:06.930
like spend like all this money.
He's worked.

2496
02:23:06.930 --> 02:23:11.930
He worked as a dispatch guy for a tax cab company and we work insane hours,

2497
02:23:12.211 --> 02:23:13.860
like 20 hours a day,

2498
02:23:13.890 --> 02:23:17.340
16 days in a row and build up a pile of cash and then come in and play pool.

2499
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:20.640
I'm trying to put together a bank rules so I can get some action.

2500
02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:24.390
He didn't have a tooth in his mouth and this poor guy used to,

2501
02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:29.370
he used to like occasionally.
Oh,
got me a few layman you own.
I go,
how do you eat?

2502
02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:32.520
How do you your steak?
And he goes,
well yeah,
kind of a problem.

2503
02:23:32.521 --> 02:23:34.950
I couldn't chew it up.
So what I'll do is I'll just put it in a blender,

2504
02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:38.760
blend it all up nice.
And then I'll just eat it like that.
No Shit.

2505
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:43.470
He literally couldn't chew anything.
He had zero teeth.
He had no teeth.

2506
02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:47.310
What happened to his tea?
Just disease could be anything.
It could be fights.

2507
02:23:47.311 --> 02:23:52.050
I'm sure lost some in fights,
bad.
Uh,
dental hygiene.
You know,

2508
02:23:52.051 --> 02:23:55.590
there was a time where people just weren't brushing their fucking teeth all the

2509
02:23:55.591 --> 02:23:59.730
time.
Some people,
you know,
and this guy was,
you know,

2510
02:23:59.790 --> 02:24:03.210
part of that and he just had terrible teeth.
Hygiene,
lost all his teeth.

2511
02:24:03.390 --> 02:24:06.830
How often do you floss?
I'd never flossed.
He never flossed never floss.

2512
02:24:07.060 --> 02:24:10.740
I brought the shit out of my teeth,
but I don't floss.
I floss like once a week.

2513
02:24:10.820 --> 02:24:13.920
Then once a week,
if I have a steak dinner,
if I feel like I got,

2514
02:24:13.970 --> 02:24:18.960
I got like a couple of spaces between my Maulers and like every meat meal I got

2515
02:24:18.961 --> 02:24:23.520
a nice fucking chunk and I,
and I'll try to suck it out sometimes for 35 minutes,

2516
02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:27.450
you know,
just going after it,
sucking,
sucking.
And then when it comes out,

2517
02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:29.940
it's like so tender,
you know,

2518
02:24:29.941 --> 02:24:33.330
it's like been completely tenderized and your molars and that you shoot with

2519
02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:38.110
your front teeth and it's delicious.
I was watching this,
uh,
special,
uh,
or,
uh,

2520
02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:41.190
a television show on these bear hunters.

2521
02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:43.230
They were going hunting grizzly bears.

2522
02:24:43.330 --> 02:24:47.490
So very strange thing to watch because you're part of you is like,
man,

2523
02:24:47.491 --> 02:24:49.770
I don't know.
Like you're,
you're not going to eat that.
Like you're,

2524
02:24:49.771 --> 02:24:52.890
you're shooting this animal for its health.
Like this is fucking crazy.

2525
02:24:53.490 --> 02:24:57.900
And then the other part,
when you see the actual animal dead and you like,

2526
02:24:57.901 --> 02:24:59.400
you look at its jaw,

2527
02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:04.520
you open its mouth and you see these fucking massive teeth of this enormous

2528
02:25:05.101 --> 02:25:09.690
head.
And it just really puts into perspective how weird teeth.

2529
02:25:09.691 --> 02:25:14.370
All right.
You know,
we have these flats,
stupid,
shitty ones that crack real easy.

2530
02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.270
This motherfucker is something that can eat trees like these are,

2531
02:25:18.330 --> 02:25:22.900
these are giant swords like embedded in his brain.
You know,

2532
02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:27.910
these huge fucking slicing swords that are attached to his face with it.

2533
02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:33.970
Yada could crush a fucking anvil.
It's,

2534
02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:38.530
they're just incredibly powerful.
Meanwhile,
while I'm kind of on the bear side,

2535
02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:42.230
that's what's fucked up.
I'm watching this.
I'm like,
I don't see Matt.

2536
02:25:42.250 --> 02:25:46.240
Unless you have to manage a population.
Like you're having a problem with them.

2537
02:25:46.241 --> 02:25:50.080
Like killing people's animals are going after people.

2538
02:25:50.081 --> 02:25:54.130
Like you're going to a place where there's no people and you're fucking up these

2539
02:25:54.170 --> 02:25:58.390
barriers.
It's like a weird sort.
If you're eating it,
I get it.
I get it.

2540
02:25:58.391 --> 02:26:00.940
If you want to eat like black mayor,
people eat black bear,

2541
02:26:01.090 --> 02:26:03.310
but I don't think people really eat grizzly bears.

2542
02:26:03.610 --> 02:26:05.260
I think they only shoot them for their pelts.

2543
02:26:05.261 --> 02:26:07.840
I think they probably tastes like shit.
We should find out,
oh,

2544
02:26:07.841 --> 02:26:12.100
it's like a miracle man of beast like that.
Or a lion to see them asshole.

2545
02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:13.001
It's just like,

2546
02:26:13.001 --> 02:26:17.380
it's in its nature expressing itself in the coolest fucking way,

2547
02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:21.580
but still terrifying.
Like I um,
did you,
uh,

2548
02:26:21.581 --> 02:26:25.090
there's a story about,
uh,
these,
uh,

2549
02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:29.770
Japanese soldiers that had an enter these mangrove swamps and uh,

2550
02:26:30.010 --> 02:26:34.330
I'm not sure where it happened.
I put it on my Twitter,
uh,

2551
02:26:34.390 --> 02:26:38.980
two days ago.
It's a terrifying fucking story.
1,000 soldiers,

2552
02:26:38.981 --> 02:26:43.981
one of the swamps and 20 got out what they were all eaten by crocodiles and the

2553
02:26:44.441 --> 02:26:49.180
there no that,
no,
there was no Rico's nothing to do,
but just keep going.

2554
02:26:49.450 --> 02:26:54.450
And so all around them they're hearing thrashing where a crocodile will grab a

2555
02:26:55.031 --> 02:26:59.920
guy and then you hear screams that eventually go under water where the CROC is

2556
02:26:59.921 --> 02:27:02.560
like flipping them in role in them and it's pitch black.

2557
02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:07.720
So it's pitch black and these guys are walking through crocodile infested

2558
02:27:07.721 --> 02:27:12.220
swamps.
Thousand thousand men went in,
20 got out long ago,

2559
02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:16.960
1940s.
Let me find it.
Yeah,
you're going to shit your pants.

2560
02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:19.090
It is a crazy fucking story.

2561
02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:24.370
It's why somebody should compile the 10 events in life that most resemble what

2562
02:27:24.371 --> 02:27:27.820
hell would be.
Yeah.
Here it is.
Um,
I should keep the guy prompts or send it to me.

2563
02:27:27.940 --> 02:27:31.450
I'm a dude named Van Dave van Dave sent it to me.

2564
02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:35.200
And so death in the swamps of Ram Murray is the article.

2565
02:27:35.201 --> 02:27:39.730
It's on my Twitter feed from 15 hours ago.
Um,

2566
02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:43.840
so it was in Burma,
rolling jungles of Burma.

2567
02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:45.730
So in World War Two,

2568
02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:51.000
these Japanese soldiers when into a southern Burma and between 900 and a

2569
02:27:53.141 --> 02:27:54.850
thousand imperial infantry,

2570
02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.090
they were treated approximately 10 miles through the mangrove swamps.

2571
02:27:58.091 --> 02:28:01.210
In an effort to sync up with a larger defensive force.

2572
02:28:01.930 --> 02:28:04.810
And this is a fucking,
I don't want to read you too much on this.

2573
02:28:04.811 --> 02:28:07.270
This is a fucking crazy story.
It says,

2574
02:28:07.271 --> 02:28:11.890
the scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of

2575
02:28:11.891 --> 02:28:12.730
wounded men,

2576
02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:17.710
then crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles and the blurred worrying around

2577
02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:22.740
blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made for a cacophony of hell that

2578
02:28:23.901 --> 02:28:27.170
has rarely been duplicated on earth.
At dawn,

2579
02:28:27.171 --> 02:28:31.460
the vultures arrived to clean up with the crocodiles had left of about a

2580
02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:33.630
thousand Japanese soldiers that had entered the swamps of Ram.

2581
02:28:33.631 --> 02:28:38.390
Re only 20 were found alive.
What a great way of describing that.

2582
02:28:38.450 --> 02:28:41.120
The scattered rifle shots at um,

2583
02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:44.020
Gary Mortenson acid.

2584
02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:49.250
Good fucking rights is an excerpt from a book,
um,

2585
02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:53.630
to get you to nope.
No,
it's just a,
a historical account.

2586
02:28:53.631 --> 02:28:56.660
World War II history,
World War Two history blog.

2587
02:28:56.990 --> 02:29:00.650
It's a World War III blog.

2588
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:05.600
World War i.com.
Forward Slash blog.
I love shit about World War II.

2589
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:10.280
I love just Google death in the swamps of [inaudible]. [inaudible] is actually

2590
02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:14.210
by a Steve Terje.
Listen,
that's the gentleman who wrote it.

2591
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:18.780
Steve [inaudible].
But in the bottom it says written by Gary Gary Mortenson.

2592
02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:24.560
And then,
okay,
that last thing that I said,
the scattered rifle shots,

2593
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:28.700
that's even written by a different guy.
British naturalist Bruce.
Right.

2594
02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:31.550
I'm attached to a Royal Marine Division.

2595
02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:34.320
Made the following notes of what he witnessed.
Ooh,

2596
02:29:34.350 --> 02:29:38.270
that was a night where Mr. Count.
Oh my God.
That's amazing.

2597
02:29:38.271 --> 02:29:39.710
What a great imagine your life.

2598
02:29:39.740 --> 02:29:43.550
If you're one of the 20 that survived the survivor guilt that you would have the

2599
02:29:43.551 --> 02:29:45.380
terror.
Yeah.
Terror.

2600
02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:48.560
I mean the terror that your nervous system to be,

2601
02:29:48.561 --> 02:29:53.561
go to a heightened state of everything that was just described for probably an

2602
02:29:57.020 --> 02:30:00.650
hour.
Oh,
more than that man didn't,
didn't win.
Then they talk about 10.

2603
02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:05.240
How many miles did they said it was two miles?
I think 10,

2604
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:08.180
10,
10 miles through the mangrove swamps.

2605
02:30:08.210 --> 02:30:13.070
So how fast do you walk to walk through mangroves?
Yeah,
three miles an hour.

2606
02:30:13.071 --> 02:30:15.350
If you're lucky,
that's like a three hours.

2607
02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:21.050
Do you even walked three miles an hour through swamps?
Proudly less.

2608
02:30:21.170 --> 02:30:26.090
Probably less.
Jesus Christ.
Fuck Dude,
I'm shitting my pants right now.

2609
02:30:26.210 --> 02:30:30.560
Just thinking about that.
Not to mention Burma.
Burmese pythons.
Oh yeah.

2610
02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:34.820
Did you hear about that python that got loose in Montreal?
Yeah.
Montreal.

2611
02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:39.530
Is that where it was somewhere somewhere you boys or something?
Yeah.
No,

2612
02:30:39.531 --> 02:30:43.860
it wasn't Montreal.
Somewhere in Canada went through,
uh,

2613
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:47.720
in a ceiling and killed these boys got out of like this reptile shop,

2614
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:52.160
19 foot fucking python.
And Jesus.
I mean that's,

2615
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:56.000
they said it's big enough to swallow an antelope pole and you've got this thing

2616
02:30:56.001 --> 02:30:59.990
just laying around.
Think about how big that is.
Can swallow an antelope poll.

2617
02:30:59.991 --> 02:31:04.880
It's like,
oh my waist,
my waist and a snake.
Yeah.
What the fuck man,

2618
02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:08.420
that's incredible.
Yeah,
I see those,
those things you should have,

2619
02:31:08.650 --> 02:31:11.570
you should have to have like really special,
precautionary,

2620
02:31:12.540 --> 02:31:16.280
like fail safe sort of ways to keep something like that contained.

2621
02:31:16.281 --> 02:31:17.690
If you're going to keep something like that alive,

2622
02:31:17.870 --> 02:31:20.070
you might have to put up muzzle on

2623
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:21.240
<v 4>it unless they're feeding.</v>

2624
02:31:21.460 --> 02:31:24.190
<v 0>But even then,
well,
how do I know if that muscle's gonna to stick?</v>

2625
02:31:24.191 --> 02:31:27.190
What if the thing figures out how to get the muzzle off right?
You know,

2626
02:31:27.191 --> 02:31:30.940
you gotta you gotta a donkey eating monster on your hands,
right.

2627
02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:33.370
Wandering around.
Yeah.
And it needs to eat.

2628
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:36.580
They have a real problem with those fucking things in Florida.

2629
02:31:36.581 --> 02:31:40.120
They're offering all sorts of rewards.
They had a thing in the everglades.
Yeah,

2630
02:31:40.121 --> 02:31:43.290
they had a thing recently where they offered rewards on the people bringing them

2631
02:31:43.291 --> 02:31:45.820
back.
I'm like,
fucking nobody was catching.
Nobody's catching them.
No.

2632
02:31:45.821 --> 02:31:48.030
I read about that.
And they're like,
this is a real problem.
Well,

2633
02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:49.060
we know they're there

2634
02:31:49.140 --> 02:31:50.790
<v 4>and knows our,
um,</v>

2635
02:31:52.530 --> 02:31:55.620
<v 0>what kind of snakes for that?
Oh,
those are pythons.
Are they pythons?
Yeah,</v>

2636
02:31:55.770 --> 02:31:59.130
Florida is so fucked up.
They found Nile crocodiles in Florida now,

2637
02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:02.310
and there's only one way for them to get there.
Someone had to let him go.

2638
02:32:02.730 --> 02:32:04.800
So they don't think there's a breeding population of them yet.

2639
02:32:04.801 --> 02:32:08.400
But there's a shoot to kill order on Nile crocodiles.
Like if you see them,

2640
02:32:08.401 --> 02:32:11.790
you have to fucking kill them like right away because they're aggressive and

2641
02:32:11.791 --> 02:32:15.600
they get to be 28 fucking feet long.
Like you got to kill those things.

2642
02:32:15.601 --> 02:32:18.150
These are not like the American crocodiles that exists now.

2643
02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:21.360
American crocodiles are much smaller,
very aggressive,

2644
02:32:21.390 --> 02:32:25.770
much more aggressive than alligators,
but much smaller.
But these Nile crocodiles,

2645
02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:29.460
holy fuck,
they're Willdabeast eaters.
You know,
that.

2646
02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:31.490
They're really aggressive,
really

2647
02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:32.830
<v 4>alligators.
I mean,</v>

2648
02:32:32.831 --> 02:32:35.350
I've been around alligators a lot because we used to have a house down in

2649
02:32:35.351 --> 02:32:39.190
Florida and it had,
um,
it had a pond across the street that had alligators in it.

2650
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:42.520
So we're very aware and we saw them a lot and uh,

2651
02:32:42.521 --> 02:32:45.520
I saw the way they moved and they check you out,

2652
02:32:46.390 --> 02:32:49.990
but they'd ultimately swim away or not move crocodiles.

2653
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:52.660
They're going to come up and go after you.
Yeah.

2654
02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:57.270
<v 0>They see you and they'll lock on you and come after you.
Right.
Fuck lizards,
man.</v>

2655
02:32:57.450 --> 02:33:02.160
Fuck all those creepy reptiles.
They that the people that think they're cute.

2656
02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:04.830
I th I see monsters.
That's all I see.
I see.

2657
02:33:04.831 --> 02:33:08.190
Heartless monsters that don't give a fuck about you or anybody.

2658
02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:10.840
<v 4>They don't.
Yeah.
And you can own that thing for 20 fucking years.</v>

2659
02:33:10.841 --> 02:33:13.750
It's never going to give a shit.
It's a cold blooded.

2660
02:33:13.950 --> 02:33:18.810
<v 0>Yeah.
But they're beautiful.
I see that.
Yeah.
They're fascinating.
I see that.</v>

2661
02:33:19.020 --> 02:33:23.970
Absolutely fascinating.
Yeah.
All,
all the reptiles to me,
when I look at them,

2662
02:33:23.971 --> 02:33:27.260
even chicken,
you know,
I've chickens,
even chickens,
I see my chickens.
Oh,

2663
02:33:27.270 --> 02:33:32.010
I see something that existed millions of years ago.
Weird life form.

2664
02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:34.710
We just think it's normal because we,
you know,

2665
02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:38.010
get eggs from them and they go [inaudible] we all seen chickens.

2666
02:33:38.011 --> 02:33:40.830
We've all seen it seems normal.
That's not normal.
At all.

2667
02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:45.090
What the fuck is that thing?
Some weird bird that can barely fly,

2668
02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:48.090
can only like get like three or four feet above the ground and then it falls

2669
02:33:48.091 --> 02:33:51.970
down and it's all plump and weird with dinosaur feet.
Yeah.
They're,

2670
02:33:52.050 --> 02:33:56.790
they're monsters,
man.
And they just live from fear.
They just run from Shit,
peck,

2671
02:33:57.300 --> 02:34:00.280
peck at everything,
just clean up.
They just clean up everything

2672
02:34:00.700 --> 02:34:03.890
<v 4>and we just see them as food on legs.
It's just pure food.</v>

2673
02:34:03.891 --> 02:34:06.710
You eat almost the entire fucking thing.
Yeah.

2674
02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:09.590
It's the most efficient food source among animals.

2675
02:34:09.670 --> 02:34:13.810
<v 0>Well,
what's efficient about chickens is that they make eggs and you eat the eggs</v>

2676
02:34:13.811 --> 02:34:16.960
every morning.
Do you do that every day?
They're,

2677
02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:21.370
they're delicious because we feed him vegetables too.
Like leftover vegetables.

2678
02:34:21.371 --> 02:34:24.390
We feed them to the chickens too.
They're there,
but they're omnivores.
They worms.

2679
02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:29.010
We feed them warm sometimes.
Right.
But the what people,
what I didn't know,
um,

2680
02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:31.350
I laugh at this because I've talked about this in the podcast.
People said,

2681
02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:33.070
what a fucking idiot I am.
But I didn't know this,

2682
02:34:33.071 --> 02:34:35.420
but I really didn't know until like,
oh,
I don't know,

2683
02:34:35.930 --> 02:34:39.970
a little more than a year ago maybe that a chicken doesn't make a baby with

2684
02:34:39.971 --> 02:34:43.780
those eggs that I thought,
I didn't know they made an egg every day.

2685
02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:46.450
No matter what.
I thought the only way to eggs,
if they fuck,

2686
02:34:46.690 --> 02:34:49.210
they make an egg every day and there's no rooster.

2687
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:52.260
So none of these eggs are fertilized.
So they're just food.
Yeah.

2688
02:34:52.270 --> 02:34:56.500
So they're just food machines.
They make protein and it doesn't hurt them at all.

2689
02:34:56.530 --> 02:35:01.150
Like nobody gets hurt.
It's a natural process.
They do it every day and it's like,

2690
02:35:01.151 --> 02:35:03.640
it's one of the,
the best ways to acquire.

2691
02:35:03.730 --> 02:35:06.520
Like you can think it's like completely Karma free.

2692
02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:08.780
Like these no one's getting hurt.
Right.
This,

2693
02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:12.790
these eggs are just a natural process.
They don't stack them and fucking cages.

2694
02:35:12.791 --> 02:35:16.780
It's disgusting when you see these themes.
Corporate.
Yeah,
chicken farms.
But you,

2695
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:19.530
you know,
you can do it in your yard is what I'm saying.
Right.

2696
02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:21.720
And it'll give you food every day.
Right.

2697
02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:24.850
I ran into a friend of mine when I was there.
I,
the dude,

2698
02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:28.480
well I shouldn't say friend,
that dude that I know from a Jujitsu and uh,

2699
02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:32.470
we were talking about like,
you know,
he's got,
he's got a rooster and uh,

2700
02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:36.770
they have eggs too and,
but they're a actually no,
no,
no.
They,
they have ag,

2701
02:35:36.771 --> 02:35:40.090
she has a rooster and he has two chickens.
Right.
But his chickens,

2702
02:35:40.091 --> 02:35:43.420
he's got a whole ecosystem gone.
His chickens can make chickens.

2703
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:47.080
Like he's got the full setup up.
So like if with his eggs,

2704
02:35:47.290 --> 02:35:50.710
if the rooster fucks the hands,
those eggs can become checks.

2705
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:55.810
So that gets real weird,
you know?
And that's like wow.
Like portion.
We got it.

2706
02:35:55.811 --> 02:35:58.750
You got,
well there's Balut you know,
that's the,
the Philippines eat,

2707
02:35:58.840 --> 02:35:59.950
the Filipinos eat,

2708
02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:04.780
it's like a duck embryo and you boil a duck embryo.

2709
02:36:04.781 --> 02:36:09.340
We served it on fear factor.
They love it.
They said they cook it in the egg.
Yes.

2710
02:36:09.370 --> 02:36:11.620
And then they open it.
Neat.
Yes.
Ambria yeah.

2711
02:36:11.621 --> 02:36:14.800
It was funny when we served it to people on fear factor in,
you know,

2712
02:36:14.801 --> 02:36:16.720
I know a lot of Filipino dudes from pool,

2713
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:19.300
you know a lot of like high end pool players,

2714
02:36:19.301 --> 02:36:22.810
like some of the best in the world are Filipino and they love Balut.

2715
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:25.180
They're like,
oh,
give it to me man.
I'll eat that shit.

2716
02:36:25.210 --> 02:36:28.180
Like they'd love Balut like volutes at Tri city.
No,

2717
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:33.520
I don't need to you to be my friend Ross Broccoli is this comedian.
Great Name.

2718
02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:35.560
Yeah,
he's this really look this up.

2719
02:36:35.561 --> 02:36:38.070
If you can drive the getaway carrot top and make a salad shop,

2720
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:41.020
is there another vegetable guy?

2721
02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:41.993
<v 1>Uh</v>

2722
02:36:42.510 --> 02:36:43.343
<v 9>hmm.</v>

2723
02:36:45.170 --> 02:36:48.770
<v 1>Well they call me.
They accidentally a at the Faneuil hall comedy connection.</v>

2724
02:36:48.771 --> 02:36:53.390
A black woman called the club and she say,
who on the show tonight?
She was from,

2725
02:36:53.900 --> 02:36:57.860
she was from the 18 hundreds and a and they said,
well it's Anthony Clark,

2726
02:36:57.861 --> 02:37:01.910
Jackie Flynn and Greg Fitzsimmons and a lady goes,
is Great Fruit Simmons,

2727
02:37:01.911 --> 02:37:06.650
the headliner.
That's a great name.
Call me.
Yeah.

2728
02:37:06.700 --> 02:37:10.150
<v 0>Grapefruits.
And is to this day all the comics in Boston coming grapefruit,</v>

2729
02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:14.830
Grapefruit Simmons.
I should have changed my name.
Right.
That's a great name.

2730
02:37:15.650 --> 02:37:16.483
Like,

2731
02:37:16.510 --> 02:37:18.560
<v 5>like emo Phillips.
I know that's not his real name.</v>

2732
02:37:18.930 --> 02:37:22.070
<v 2>It doesn't offend me.
Try [inaudible] on his real name.</v>

2733
02:37:22.071 --> 02:37:25.160
Either shaped fruit Simmons.
Right,
but look up Ross,

2734
02:37:25.161 --> 02:37:28.100
Broccoli and a and chicken truck.

2735
02:37:28.280 --> 02:37:32.300
Maybe you could go out from here on out as grape Simmons,
grapefruit Simmons,

2736
02:37:32.390 --> 02:37:34.490
the artist formerly known as Greg Fitzsimmons.

2737
02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:37.520
I need something for people to talk about it.
That's,
that's the kind of shit.

2738
02:37:37.521 --> 02:37:39.890
That's brilliant marketing.
If you're into that kind of thing,

2739
02:37:40.310 --> 02:37:44.810
just change your name every 15 years and have people,
you know,

2740
02:37:44.811 --> 02:37:48.200
I have to get the Twitter account,
change everything.
Grapefruit Simmons.

2741
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:51.830
Well that's one of the ways that Madonna sort of stayed relevant all these years

2742
02:37:51.831 --> 02:37:54.470
is constantly changing.
She changed what she looked

2743
02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:58.210
<v 5>like.
She changed her hairstyle.
She changed her singing style,</v>

2744
02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:03.090
<v 2>but always in intervals that allowed the public to,
you know,
adjust.</v>

2745
02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:05.010
Yeah.
David Bowie did the same thing.

2746
02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:07.870
<v 5>Yeah.
Yeah,
you're right.
Yeah.
David Bowie did a lot of that.</v>

2747
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:10.240
He did some weird shit,
man.
You know,

2748
02:38:10.241 --> 02:38:14.200
one time on the podcast we played dancing in the street.
Him and Mick Jagger,

2749
02:38:14.380 --> 02:38:17.980
we forgot like how insane that video is.

2750
02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:23.400
It's might be the weirdest like rock and roll video of all time because it's

2751
02:38:24.911 --> 02:38:28.690
Mick Jagger and David Bowie and they are dancing together.

2752
02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:33.960
And one of the most peculiar ways I've ever seen two men dance together.

2753
02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:39.660
Like even rock stars that are like singing songs together and they'll like lean

2754
02:38:40.181 --> 02:38:42.580
in together and use one mic,
you know,

2755
02:38:42.581 --> 02:38:45.490
so they're like go on face to face and sing in each other's eyes.

2756
02:38:45.850 --> 02:38:50.850
That's not as gay as Mick Jagger and David Bowie dancing and looking at each

2757
02:38:51.101 --> 02:38:55.900
other and like wiggling back and forth and like hopping up on like light footed

2758
02:38:55.901 --> 02:39:00.220
on one foot to one foot in like this weird display

2759
02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:03.830
<v 2>for ability and a light light.</v>

2760
02:39:03.831 --> 02:39:08.570
Footedness it's a very strange way of see,
just play the video of them dancing.

2761
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:13.250
It's one of the weirdest place.
Pop and Bowie and Jagger.

2762
02:39:13.251 --> 02:39:14.930
I mean that whole gay thing.

2763
02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:20.000
I was probably what in like the early eighties late,
no,

2764
02:39:20.001 --> 02:39:21.620
earlier set up seventies I think.

2765
02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:25.400
I think there's a lot of guys that experimented.
Yeah,
they just,

2766
02:39:25.530 --> 02:39:29.060
it was really accepted.
Yeah.
I think those artists too,

2767
02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:32.270
like there was a lot of artists that wanted to open themselves up.

2768
02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:34.870
They wanted to find out,
you know,
like what are the boundaries?

2769
02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:37.470
Like what's holding me back creatively.
Yeah.
You know,

2770
02:39:37.550 --> 02:39:40.090
everyone's partying and everyone,
it's like almost like a,
an uh,

2771
02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:44.510
showing an openmindedness by trying to have sex.
Like there's a,
there's Jagger.

2772
02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:47.930
Oh,
in those eighties close.
Yeah.
It was weird with the cuffs.

2773
02:39:47.931 --> 02:39:51.680
That jacket with the cuffs pulled up the forearm Haslacker play some more of

2774
02:39:51.681 --> 02:39:54.330
that.
That's wild.
There's

2775
02:39:54.420 --> 02:39:58.500
<v 5>w there was a weirdness to it the way they were dancing around.</v>

2776
02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:03.750
Yeah.
Look at them.
I mean,

2777
02:40:03.751 --> 02:40:06.300
look at David Bowie's get this weird jacket on.

2778
02:40:06.301 --> 02:40:11.301
Like he's a lab assistant and Mick Jagger's got like high waisted pants,

2779
02:40:11.431 --> 02:40:14.130
a mullet and they're staring at each other's eyes

2780
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:18.990
<v 1>singing and there.
Oh,
he's grabbing his holy.
Yeah.
It's incredibly gay.</v>

2781
02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:20.370
Whoa.

2782
02:40:20.490 --> 02:40:22.860
<v 5>Now there,
but to but sing it.
Every guy,</v>

2783
02:40:22.861 --> 02:40:27.270
grab a girl everywhere around the world.
I mean,

2784
02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:30.930
and nothing wrong with that,
but it's really what my point is,

2785
02:40:30.931 --> 02:40:33.120
is that it's very unusual behavior.

2786
02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:38.220
Not even done that it's gay because if it was gay,
like openly gay,

2787
02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:41.580
it would almost be less weird if there was like two guys and they had their

2788
02:40:41.581 --> 02:40:45.550
hands on each other's hips and they were singing and kissing each other.
I go,
oh,

2789
02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:48.930
I see.
That's how gay guys are.
They're gay.
They're attracted to each other,

2790
02:40:48.931 --> 02:40:51.930
so they're,
they're making out.
That's what gay guys making out.
That's normal.

2791
02:40:52.170 --> 02:40:55.200
That's not normal.
What is that thing?
That weird mating dance.

2792
02:40:55.201 --> 02:40:55.710
They're doing it right.

2793
02:40:55.710 --> 02:40:56.880
<v 1>We think it's like date.</v>

2794
02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:01.400
They both got to the point where they had fucked so many models and done so
many,

2795
02:41:01.401 --> 02:41:06.401
three ways that the sexual energy is just pouring out and they're just there.

2796
02:41:07.230 --> 02:41:09.870
Like you said,
it's like a mating dead.
There's strutting it out.

2797
02:41:10.290 --> 02:41:13.020
It's not really about fucking each other.

2798
02:41:13.021 --> 02:41:16.320
It's about both of them celebrating their raw sexuality.

2799
02:41:16.650 --> 02:41:18.720
<v 5>Well,
it's,
it's weird as what it is.</v>

2800
02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:23.010
It's weird sort of movement doesn't even seem sexual because it doesn't

2801
02:41:23.011 --> 02:41:24.420
represent any,

2802
02:41:24.930 --> 02:41:28.770
like when you see a woman dancing and a woman who's real sexy,

2803
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:31.890
one of the things that you're seeing is when a woman's dancing,

2804
02:41:31.891 --> 02:41:33.660
you're seeing how she would fuck.
Yeah.

2805
02:41:33.780 --> 02:41:38.780
Like you're seeing a sensual sort of an appeal when a woman is like gyrating.

2806
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:43.140
It's very attractive because what you're seeing,
you're thinking of movement,

2807
02:41:43.141 --> 02:41:47.010
you're thinking of making love and you're thinking of like bodies touching and

2808
02:41:47.011 --> 02:41:50.580
how good it would feel if she moved like that while she was touching you and how

2809
02:41:50.581 --> 02:41:54.480
what a turn on it would be just a blow away turnout.
That sexy.
Right.

2810
02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:59.190
But this is weird.
This is not sexual.
Like it's not gay.

2811
02:41:59.250 --> 02:42:03.030
I mean I'm calling it gay because it's just odd.
It's more queer than gay,

2812
02:42:03.210 --> 02:42:05.370
but it's not gay.
Cause if it was gay,

2813
02:42:05.371 --> 02:42:09.180
they'd be looked Rustin and grabbing Cox and looking at each other and holding

2814
02:42:09.181 --> 02:42:12.330
each other to pulling clothes.
But it's just weird.
It's like,

2815
02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:16.430
<v 1>it's almost like boy George,
who we knew was gay.</v>

2816
02:42:16.431 --> 02:42:20.510
So that added a sexuality to it because in people's minds,

2817
02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:25.540
gay and you just thinking about sex and yet he played it like a child

2818
02:42:25.911 --> 02:42:26.421
entertainer.

2819
02:42:26.421 --> 02:42:30.350
He dressed like a clown and there was nothing he did that was sexual in any way.

2820
02:42:30.351 --> 02:42:33.960
But he danced like that really fucking sensual.

2821
02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:38.810
Well Boy George was actually a good dancer.
Fuck yeah,
great movie.

2822
02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:39.800
It was a great singer.

2823
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:43.870
<v 5>That song.
Do you really want to hurt me?
That was a brilliant song.</v>

2824
02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:46.060
Well I remember when that song came out,

2825
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:50.890
how many dudes I knew who were angry watching that video.

2826
02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:56.170
They got angry.
Like you see this fucking guy,
she's Christ.

2827
02:42:56.260 --> 02:43:00.190
They would get mad cause boy George was in this like Puffy,

2828
02:43:00.370 --> 02:43:05.290
nondescript sort of like non body outlining sort of outfit,

2829
02:43:05.291 --> 02:43:10.210
this little puffy outfit and he's like gyrating and moving in slowly and

2830
02:43:10.211 --> 02:43:10.690
singing.

2831
02:43:10.690 --> 02:43:13.750
<v 0>Amanda has makeup on a lot of makeup on and he's singing,</v>

2832
02:43:13.751 --> 02:43:17.470
do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?

2833
02:43:18.070 --> 02:43:22.840
I mean it's like wow,
it's heavy.
It's heavy.

2834
02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:27.160
Yeah.
And defining,
you know,
wake me up before you go.
Go.

2835
02:43:27.161 --> 02:43:28.270
I was just going to bring that up.

2836
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:34.590
I remember I was working at Papa Ginos when the song became popular.

2837
02:43:34.660 --> 02:43:38.840
I was working at Papa Ginos in Newton,
Massachusetts and I was uh,

2838
02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:42.430
I was a cook there.
I was making like Spaghetti and whatever the fuck they sold.

2839
02:43:43.270 --> 02:43:48.220
And there was a girl who worked there who was in love with this guy and she was

2840
02:43:48.221 --> 02:43:52.210
describing this song,
wake me up before you go go.
And she was like,

2841
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:55.570
he's so beautiful.
Like I can't even look at him.

2842
02:43:55.870 --> 02:44:00.870
He's so beautiful and like the song is a basing and so I went home that night

2843
02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:05.170
and I saw it on television and I was like,

2844
02:44:05.171 --> 02:44:08.380
that might be the gays human than ever walked the face of the planet and this

2845
02:44:08.381 --> 02:44:10.900
girl can't even see it.
Right.
She couldn't sit.

2846
02:44:11.210 --> 02:44:15.470
<v 1>I think the damage girls are attracted to clearly gay guys like that because</v>

2847
02:44:15.610 --> 02:44:19.910
they're non threatening their friends.
Yeah.
I think that,
you know,

2848
02:44:20.100 --> 02:44:21.830
w something that's that gay,

2849
02:44:21.831 --> 02:44:26.660
you think of Liberace and how many like frustrated Midwestern women would go see

2850
02:44:26.661 --> 02:44:31.540
him in Vegas and actually feel something while he's the bridge between

2851
02:44:31.630 --> 02:44:35.820
<v 0>what a woman really would like a man to be.
What a man really is.
Yeah.</v>

2852
02:44:35.980 --> 02:44:39.970
You know Richard,
Bill Cosby said something really funny once.
He said,

2853
02:44:39.971 --> 02:44:42.130
women don't want to hear what a man thinks.

2854
02:44:42.131 --> 02:44:45.040
Women want to hear what a woman thinks,
but in a deeper voice.

2855
02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:46.913
<v 1>Okay,</v>

2856
02:44:48.930 --> 02:44:53.150
<v 0>brilliant.
Is Bill Cosby?
That is such a brilliant line.
That's good.
That is a,</v>

2857
02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:55.440
that was a goddamn brilliant Laura.
Right?

2858
02:44:55.620 --> 02:45:00.090
But every now and then you have a bridge and the bridge is like a,

2859
02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:03.140
like a George Michael Sort of a guy's beautiful man,
you know?

2860
02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:05.910
But he's dancing around and he's,
you know,

2861
02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:10.940
he's got perfect hair and earrings to hoop earrings and a shirt that says choose

2862
02:45:11.071 --> 02:45:11.770
life

2863
02:45:11.770 --> 02:45:16.000
<v 1>India.
Yeah,
that's what could rent.
Whose hand and an earring.</v>

2864
02:45:16.420 --> 02:45:18.940
<v 0>Yeah,
you left me sleeping in my bed.</v>

2865
02:45:19.650 --> 02:45:22.750
She in the bed with you instead of wake me up.

2866
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.361
<v 1>Well,</v>

2867
02:45:23.361 --> 02:45:28.070
you remember a certain comedian that we know who was gay who I don't think is

2868
02:45:28.071 --> 02:45:32.610
out of the closet and he used to sing.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
wake me.

2869
02:45:33.730 --> 02:45:35.510
You'll,
you give them away.
I don't give a shit.

2870
02:45:35.570 --> 02:45:38.510
Oh dare you wake me up before you go.
Go.

2871
02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:41.180
Cause I'm nothing but a fucking homo.

2872
02:45:41.730 --> 02:45:45.710
And this guy used to sing that clot and this is the guy who later on blasted

2873
02:45:45.711 --> 02:45:49.460
other comics who did homophobic stuff.
Well,
he was a little tortured.

2874
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:53.030
Very tortured.
Yeah.
Meanwhile,

2875
02:45:53.090 --> 02:45:55.360
there's another perfect example of someone who just came out of the closet.

2876
02:45:55.380 --> 02:45:58.970
Nobody would give a fuck.
People don't want this line of work.
You.
Yeah,

2877
02:45:58.971 --> 02:46:02.540
you're a comedian,
man.
That's why you think about that guy,
Jason Collins,

2878
02:46:02.541 --> 02:46:04.450
the basketball player who came out.
People say,

2879
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:07.130
that's really brave and you've got to stop and go.

2880
02:46:07.131 --> 02:46:10.010
Why is it so bright like a comedian come out and act or

2881
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:14.210
<v 4>can come out?
Um,
you know,
in any facet of life,</v>

2882
02:46:14.211 --> 02:46:17.510
you're an accountant and somebody came out,
people would adjust and deal with it.

2883
02:46:17.810 --> 02:46:22.810
But it's brave for a basketball player because athletes tend to be jocks,

2884
02:46:23.870 --> 02:46:28.100
ignorant,
hateful guys that don't like Gig.
They say fags a lot.

2885
02:46:28.101 --> 02:46:30.620
You know Kobe Bryant said that thing.
I think it's,

2886
02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:34.620
it's a bigger deal to come out in that environment than it is in other,

2887
02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.430
<v 5>no doubt.
It's much as a very courageous.</v>

2888
02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:39.630
And there's also the locker room element,
right?

2889
02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:42.830
There's the element of the fact that these guys get together in the locker room

2890
02:46:42.890 --> 02:46:46.550
and they fucking,
they're naked together.
Right?
Okay.
They're showering.
Would you,

2891
02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:49.190
I mean it's not the same thing,

2892
02:46:49.191 --> 02:46:52.910
but how much different with the dynamic of a locker room change.

2893
02:46:52.940 --> 02:46:57.940
If a woman came in and she was attractive and she was showering and she was

2894
02:46:57.981 --> 02:46:59.660
showering with men naked,

2895
02:47:00.170 --> 02:47:02.900
which completely changed the dynamic of the locker room,
right?

2896
02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:08.200
Well a gay guy who is in a locker and seeing all these yummy dicks and seeing

2897
02:47:09.681 --> 02:47:13.910
all these dudes soaping up their cocks like that for,
for,
for him,

2898
02:47:13.911 --> 02:47:17.720
like him being there would really change the dynamic of the locker room if he

2899
02:47:17.721 --> 02:47:20.690
wasn't professional.
And of course he would be professional and understand.

2900
02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:23.450
But most men would be professional too if they were hanging around a woman.

2901
02:47:23.451 --> 02:47:27.370
They want to fuck and I'm not,
I'm not playing.
So the theory is that

2902
02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:29.720
<v 4>he's going to jerk off thinking about my dick.</v>

2903
02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:32.510
<v 5>Oh,
the fear is that he's going to fuck you while you're taking a shower.</v>

2904
02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:36.620
That's the real fear.
No one know that.
It's real nice.
It's going to happen.

2905
02:47:36.690 --> 02:47:40.450
<v 4>Press outside.
It's $1 billion arena.
They've got their own stalls.</v>

2906
02:47:40.580 --> 02:47:45.020
<v 2>Somehow he's going to to see your ass in your ass up like prison.</v>

2907
02:47:45.230 --> 02:47:46.580
He's going to fucking hold you.

2908
02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:50.740
<v 4>It's so amazing that that's the fear because my whole thing is if he jerks off</v>

2909
02:47:50.741 --> 02:47:52.600
thinking about,
you'll never know

2910
02:47:52.910 --> 02:47:55.310
<v 2>unless he tells you and then he makes it super uncomfortable.</v>

2911
02:47:55.311 --> 02:47:58.310
It's just you and him and you go back because you forgot your sneakers and

2912
02:47:58.311 --> 02:48:02.930
you're like,
hey man,
hey man,
I'll tell you a draft off to you last night.

2913
02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:06.470
It was fucking amazing.
Have a good game.
We were together,
we were shaving.

2914
02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:10.310
Should we have our bodies and what?
Hey Man,

2915
02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:14.930
I want you showering behind me anymore.
Fucking creep.
I mean that's,

2916
02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:17.810
well they say,
I don't want him,
he's going to be looking at my deck.

2917
02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:20.780
Here's a news flash.
If you're in a shower,
the bunch of other guys,

2918
02:48:20.781 --> 02:48:23.720
they're all like [inaudible] like I look at the decks,
but this is a different,

2919
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:26.960
it's a different thing because it's not yummy and delicious to you.

2920
02:48:27.260 --> 02:48:28.670
You look at a dick and I'm like,
well there's something.

2921
02:48:28.671 --> 02:48:31.280
I don't want to have anything to do weird.
I just look at it cause it's weird.

2922
02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:33.750
You never see them.
I don't need to see your Dick.

2923
02:48:33.751 --> 02:48:36.110
You don't need to do anything with it.
You thanks.
Take care guys.
Yeah,

2924
02:48:36.111 --> 02:48:38.970
I saw you dick.
But no big deal.
Like in Jujitsu,
the

2925
02:48:38.970 --> 02:48:42.960
<v 5>locker room and in the locker room,
everybody takes her clothes off and showers.</v>

2926
02:48:43.250 --> 02:48:46.150
It's just normal.
But is it after the run and shower?
They're staunch.

2927
02:48:46.270 --> 02:48:48.240
There's the stall,
but there's only one.

2928
02:48:48.270 --> 02:48:51.390
So we all wait in line for it and we hop out.
You see someone's Dick,

2929
02:48:51.630 --> 02:48:54.690
they grab a towel there,
wrap it up,
whatever.
Nobody gives a shit.

2930
02:48:54.691 --> 02:48:57.360
You take your clothes off and put dry ones on.
You got to see your Dick,

2931
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:59.400
it's just a normal part of everyday life.

2932
02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:04.710
But if you were there and it was by,
you know,
um,

2933
02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:07.660
what's the word?
Coed and uh,
there was in there,

2934
02:49:07.690 --> 02:49:11.430
it was changing as well and they were hot women and they came out naked.

2935
02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:15.220
Like that would be a weird dynamic if you're sexually attracted to them.

2936
02:49:15.380 --> 02:49:19.110
And I'm not saying that gay people would take advantage of you or they'd be

2937
02:49:19.111 --> 02:49:22.080
weird you.
But what I do believe about gay men,

2938
02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:27.320
unequivocably without a doubt equivocable is that their men and men can be great

2939
02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:31.380
or they can be creepy as fuck.
Both

2940
02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:32.400
<v 2>since we're on the table.</v>

2941
02:49:32.430 --> 02:49:36.390
Thank he knows he's so under the microscope as the gay guy in the shower,

2942
02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:38.220
then he would be completely control.

2943
02:49:38.250 --> 02:49:41.670
What is this bill with Tami Sagher getting some guys grabbing his dick.

2944
02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:44.720
Patrick Melton.
What is it is a sketch they did?
Yeah.

2945
02:49:44.721 --> 02:49:47.190
It's called feeding the rabbit and it's,
what's it about?

2946
02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:48.420
How long has it got loud?

2947
02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:52.160
<v 0>It's a two minutes.
Play it.
Okay.</v>

2948
02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:56.440
It's got,
what's that?
Uh,
yeah.
Let me turn it over real quick.

2949
02:49:57.610 --> 02:50:01.810
That's my play music on.
It's still rebirthing.
Yeah.
Okay.

2950
02:50:02.260 --> 02:50:06.580
Here's one mere cat nearby who doesn't have the luxury of group protection.

2951
02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:12.600
Tosca is very much on her own was two guys sitting on a couch watching a nature

2952
02:50:12.601 --> 02:50:14.130
show.
The toast pops up,

2953
02:50:14.990 --> 02:50:18.600
but it's likely she'll never be allowed to join her family again.

2954
02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:23.580
For the folks listening,
rabbit or solitude is fine.
Feeding the rabbit,

2955
02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:27.720
he says time to feed the rabbits and alive so he pops the stars,

2956
02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:30.060
the toes back in and they both get up.

2957
02:50:30.270 --> 02:50:35.270
First she tells time to take off is just to find an unrelated roving mail for a

2958
02:50:36.631 --> 02:50:37.464
mate.

2959
02:50:38.470 --> 02:50:39.303
<v 10>Let's do this</v>

2960
02:50:40.170 --> 02:50:43.230
<v 0>perhaps for luck.
Isabel the change.</v>

2961
02:50:44.850 --> 02:50:46.780
Carlos a roving mail from them.

2962
02:50:46.810 --> 02:50:50.850
<v 2>I'm looking at each other in the eyes a lot of times how to tell to the whiskers</v>

2963
02:50:50.851 --> 02:50:54.660
and Risa time looks like he's about the Pew.
Always in this guy's mind.

2964
02:50:54.750 --> 02:50:58.310
It's guys like making,
who's the other dude?
Patrick Melton.
Nobody likes.

2965
02:50:59.190 --> 02:51:00.930
He's making these horrible faces.

2966
02:51:02.100 --> 02:51:06.780
This looks like an opportunity like he's or gas.
Yeah,
nodding his head.

2967
02:51:06.781 --> 02:51:10.970
Medicine,
right.
Maniacal.
Icontact.

2968
02:51:12.850 --> 02:51:15.940
Deference to shame.

2969
02:51:18.310 --> 02:51:20.790
Understanding.
Regret.

2970
02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:26.290
It's early morning and the whispers of Tom's causes shaking his head no,

2971
02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:30.010
he doesn't like it a little ground.
God,
how long has this been

2972
02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:34.980
confusion?
Yeah,
this is really a visual bit.
We're not doing this thing.

2973
02:51:34.990 --> 02:51:38.520
Any justice.
Put the descriptions there.

2974
02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:40.120
There's the promise of a good,

2975
02:51:40.121 --> 02:51:44.560
and so he's making this crazy and they're both grabbing their decks,

2976
02:51:44.620 --> 02:51:48.260
the grabbing each other's Dicks,
and they're smushing them.
Oh,

2977
02:51:48.380 --> 02:51:53.380
there with the grab and the dicks with the underwear outside of the pants for

2978
02:51:53.741 --> 02:51:56.830
the toast.
Three pops and then with the toast pops up,
they'd done.

2979
02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:59.680
That's when they end it.
It isn't just beautiful.

2980
02:52:00.430 --> 02:52:03.550
It means that rain is formed and then sitting down and not going to talk about

2981
02:52:03.551 --> 02:52:05.540
it.
They don't get the toast.

2982
02:52:08.050 --> 02:52:12.430
Who the fuck of that?
That is an unbelievably weird sketch.

2983
02:52:12.790 --> 02:52:15.910
That's like,
you know how that's get started?
I want to grab this guy's Dick.

2984
02:52:16.060 --> 02:52:19.240
I'm going to write a sketch.
That's like,
they went for it.

2985
02:52:19.340 --> 02:52:23.380
<v 5>Oh Man.
They took a deep and they didn't just take a deep,
they'll like they,</v>

2986
02:52:23.430 --> 02:52:26.650
they hung in there for a long time.

2987
02:52:26.690 --> 02:52:28.250
<v 2>You know,
it's weirder than grabbing the deck.</v>

2988
02:52:28.251 --> 02:52:33.050
Is the eye contact from four inches away the whole time?
Yeah.

2989
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:36.920
I guess though,
if you were gay,
that'd be hot,
right?
Yeah.
Gig.

2990
02:52:36.921 --> 02:52:39.930
I would watch it and he goes,
what's so funny,
right?
It was hot as fuck.
Yeah.

2991
02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:44.480
These two bears jerking each other off when the toast pops up.
I love it.
Bears.

2992
02:52:44.750 --> 02:52:48.220
I know bears.
That's my,
my second favorite.

2993
02:52:48.680 --> 02:52:51.050
Like Sexual Thompson,
Agora video.
My other ones,

2994
02:52:51.051 --> 02:52:53.630
the one rug with him and Bert Kreischer where they're shaving each other with no

2995
02:52:53.631 --> 02:52:56.390
shirts on.
Yeah.
You know,
I met,

2996
02:52:56.720 --> 02:53:00.960
I met Bert Kreischer for the first time in Montreal.
Oh,
I don't really know.

2997
02:53:00.980 --> 02:53:03.410
We were both looking at each other like,
how do we never fucking meat?

2998
02:53:03.530 --> 02:53:04.710
He's a great guy.
Yeah,

2999
02:53:04.850 --> 02:53:08.330
<v 5>he's fun,
man.
It's fun,
Dude.
He's a different kind of the guy,
you know,</v>

3000
02:53:08.331 --> 02:53:11.360
he's like a great party starter,
host type guy.
You know,

3001
02:53:11.361 --> 02:53:13.730
he's a different kind of guy.
He's got his own little thing going on.

3002
02:53:13.731 --> 02:53:14.340
Bert Kreischer,

3003
02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:16.530
<v 2>should I have him on my podcast bird?</v>

3004
02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:21.210
If you're out there a email me dog radio@gmail.com is awesome.
He's awesome.

3005
02:53:21.211 --> 02:53:23.280
He's got some diarrhea stories too.
Yeah.

3006
02:53:23.340 --> 02:53:26.960
Did you see the video of him and Ralphie may on stage or something?
Sad.

3007
02:53:27.360 --> 02:53:30.270
It made me sad.
They both have their shirt off and they're singing songs.

3008
02:53:30.430 --> 02:53:34.590
It's like,
okay boy.
Okay,
you guys need the hug.

3009
02:53:35.020 --> 02:53:36.490
Hold on here.
I just talked to Ralph.

3010
02:53:36.500 --> 02:53:40.290
I made the other day still not smoking the weed or anything like that.
He's wow.

3011
02:53:40.650 --> 02:53:42.060
He's not smoking.
We don't think so.

3012
02:53:42.410 --> 02:53:47.410
I'm sure he knows back Brian Post saying welcome back pitch welcome bags.

3013
02:53:47.790 --> 02:53:49.860
Oh that's right.
I had him on the podcast

3014
02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:54.790
<v 5>and he was,
we caught him right when he was done.
He was a,
it was no,
uh,</v>

3015
02:53:54.850 --> 02:53:57.370
he wasn't,
wasn't smoking any weed.
He's taken a big break.

3016
02:53:57.371 --> 02:53:58.450
It was trying to get his shit together.

3017
02:53:58.690 --> 02:54:03.130
I think though he was one of those dudes that much like your friend Mc Chris,

3018
02:54:03.180 --> 02:54:08.080
he just,
you know,
run over when went off the pot deep end kind of re,
you know,

3019
02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:12.280
catch your breath,
refocus,
shake it off.
Right.

3020
02:54:12.730 --> 02:54:17.560
Live a sober life for awhile and then slowly get back in with a more defined

3021
02:54:17.561 --> 02:54:18.670
sense of parameters.

3022
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:20.570
<v 2>Yeah.
Especially when you have a young kid.</v>

3023
02:54:20.571 --> 02:54:24.230
I think he's really into his kid and I think it was probably affecting that on

3024
02:54:24.231 --> 02:54:26.900
some level.
Even if it wasn't,
you feel like it is

3025
02:54:27.100 --> 02:54:30.640
<v 5>well,
especially if you're using it as an escape,
which sometimes guys do,</v>

3026
02:54:30.641 --> 02:54:34.720
especially under stressful situations where it's like maybe have a kid or

3027
02:54:34.900 --> 02:54:38.320
worrying about your career.
There's people that will use it to,

3028
02:54:38.350 --> 02:54:40.720
instead of like dealing with their situation,

3029
02:54:40.721 --> 02:54:42.730
they'll sort of hide behind the pot.

3030
02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:46.450
Like they'll start smoking pot all the time and avoid dealing with like things

3031
02:54:46.451 --> 02:54:48.580
that they need to deal with.
That is a possibility too.

3032
02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:53.780
<v 2>They can use pot actively or passively.
Yeah,
you could fuck up with anything,
man.</v>

3033
02:54:53.781 --> 02:54:57.730
That's what I think.
I think it's Great Fruit Simmons

3034
02:55:00.370 --> 02:55:04.040
to cover over your next,
sandy gave me great.
Whoever made that.
Who

3035
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:05.570
<v 1>made that give,
give them some prompts.</v>

3036
02:55:06.530 --> 02:55:11.270
Falling art or maybe falling ardor tell that story before and yeah,

3037
02:55:11.271 --> 02:55:13.940
I've met a couple of fans,
sent me artwork.
Oh that's slowly.

3038
02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:15.830
I got one up on the wall in my office.

3039
02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:20.570
That's the one that's on the wall in my office.
That's hilarious.

3040
02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:25.040
Oh,
that's so funny.
That's a good one to write your face.

3041
02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:29.600
That's got sort of a,
that's really similar.
Rawling at a fair.

3042
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:33.080
That is really funny.
And so yeah,
I need,
I need a new brand.

3043
02:55:33.081 --> 02:55:35.950
That's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to change the grapefruit sevens.

3044
02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:39.860
How often do you do in your podcast?
You put her down every week.
Twice a week.

3045
02:55:39.861 --> 02:55:42.770
For four years now.
Wow.
How many episodes do you have?

3046
02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:48.520
400 or so,
but the back ones you have to get the premium membership for I,
I give,

3047
02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:50.750
I think the first 20 are free,
the most recent.

3048
02:55:50.751 --> 02:55:53.390
And then the back ones are premium membership.

3049
02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:56.720
<v 5>And you have your show on Sirius errors at what time?</v>

3050
02:55:56.980 --> 02:56:01.390
<v 1>At seven o'clock on the west coast.
On Howard 101 on Monday nights.</v>

3051
02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:04.800
And that's been going on for a long plus.
Six years.
Six years?
Yeah.

3052
02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:08.530
First sounded like five years ago.
You were like my first or second guessed.

3053
02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:13.050
Really?
Yeah.
Fucking great.
Oh Wow.
That's cool.
Yeah,
and it was a,

3054
02:56:13.060 --> 02:56:15.950
it was back when we hadn't hung out much.
We had,
you know,

3055
02:56:15.970 --> 02:56:18.880
we just hadn't been in each other's radar for awhile and it was like this

3056
02:56:18.881 --> 02:56:23.050
connection,
it was like fuck man,
that was like a electric,
it was so good.

3057
02:56:23.051 --> 02:56:25.090
Just you know,
focus,
talk in for an hour.

3058
02:56:25.430 --> 02:56:25.761
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

3059
02:56:25.761 --> 02:56:30.140
Thank God for podcasts and radio shows and shit where people can just sit down

3060
02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:33.170
and shoot the shit.
Like I was saying to someone on Twitter the other day,

3061
02:56:33.410 --> 02:56:36.230
someone who was saying they liked the podcast,
I was saying,

3062
02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:41.360
I love doing it too because one of the benefits for me is besides knowing that

3063
02:56:41.361 --> 02:56:44.050
people are enjoying is that I get to have these conversations,
right?

3064
02:56:44.090 --> 02:56:48.260
Like how often would we have the time to sit down for three hours and just shoot

3065
02:56:48.261 --> 02:56:48.710
the shit,

3066
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:51.680
<v 1>no cell phone calls and checking.</v>

3067
02:56:51.681 --> 02:56:54.100
Nobody here in this room has checked the fucking text.

3068
02:56:54.150 --> 02:56:58.980
<v 5>Nope.
Since we started.
No,
nothing.
You know,
and I think that makes for,</v>

3069
02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:00.660
it makes for a good break.

3070
02:57:00.661 --> 02:57:04.350
And it also makes for like a deep intense conversation that maybe you wouldn't

3071
02:57:04.351 --> 02:57:05.280
have the time to do

3072
02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:09.600
<v 1>otherwise.
Yeah.
I mean how many of your opinions like my opinions to me are,</v>

3073
02:57:10.020 --> 02:57:14.040
that's who I am and the only way you're going to get ones that are legitimate

3074
02:57:14.130 --> 02:57:18.900
are to go deeply into it with somebody.
A couple of people that you respect.

3075
02:57:18.990 --> 02:57:22.110
<v 5>Yeah,
and just and challenge each other.
Fuck around.</v>

I saw that that material in Seattle and San Francisco is fucking hilarious man.

Um,
I will,

3091
02:58:17.250 --> 02:58:21.910
let you know soon and all those podcasts that you see on the TV show,
uh,

3092
02:58:22.020 --> 02:58:24.060
people have been asking me,
those are real podcasts.

3093
02:58:24.090 --> 02:58:26.580
They look like people would go to fig hurt my soul.

3094
02:58:26.730 --> 02:58:29.820
They're actually real podcast.
That's the only way we were willing to do it.

3095
02:58:29.850 --> 02:58:34.850
Duncan and I did real podcasts and they will be released as podcast eventually.

3096
02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:40.080
Uh,
but until the show stops,
Aaron,
it'll all just be just out recorded.

3097
02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:42.510
We got it though.
Don't worry.
All right,
we'll see you guys soon.

3098
02:58:42.780 --> 02:58:46.320
Thanks for all the love.
Big Kiss,
big hug,
big love.
So yeah.

3099
02:58:51.550 --> 02:58:56.550
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
