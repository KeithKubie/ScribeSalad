00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:12.526
&gt;&gt;Where does hope go when
amazing grace becomes graceless

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:15.846
and the only hands left to hold
are sweaty and quivering in fear?

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.206
Questions that come
from two little boys...

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:22.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like Jesica, many
students enter Global Writes as early

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:23.916
as sixth grade or younger.

00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:27.816
The Bronx-based nonprofit pairs
working poets with local schools.

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:31.886
In 32 weekly sessions a
year, during English class,

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:33.556
they teach kids the art

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:36.536
of competitive performance
poetry, or "slam."

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:39.276
&gt;&gt;I find my tongue,
tumble over my teeth

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:42.126
as I tell him those questions
weren't meant for me, and now,

00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:43.266
his eyes are silently screaming

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.786
that I'm the only person
that can answer him.

00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:50.066
&gt;&gt;Jesica: Writing, it gives me a
reason to, I guess, better myself

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:54.806
and to hold myself as a better
person behaviorwise and in class.

00:00:54.886 --> 00:00:58.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The poets and classroom
teachers help students develop their

00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:01.736
writing and performance skills
using lot of class discussion

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:03.206
and taking inspiration

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:05.596
from professional slammers,
like Steve Coleman.

00:01:05.806 --> 00:01:09.116
&gt;&gt;Steve: I want to hear a poem about
revolution, about fists raised high

00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:11.376
and hips twisting in
a rumble like a rumba.

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:14.536
I want to follow the footsteps
of Che and hear the truth

00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:17.046
about the day the CIA killed Lumumba.

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:19.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The chance to
express themselves lights a fire

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:22.146
under these kids, as
does the prospect

00:01:22.146 --> 00:01:24.496
of eventually competing
school-to-school.

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:25.866
&gt;&gt;Steve: I want to feel the poem.

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.026
I want to taste the poem.

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:29.946
Give me your spot on the mic
if you want to waste a poem.

00:01:29.946 --> 00:01:31.496
I want to hear a moan.

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:36.806
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:40.386
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, so things
that you guys have pointed out.

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:41.786
He varies his volume.

00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:43.906
He varies his speed.

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:47.546
Anything else you're noticing
about how his poem is written?

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:48.966
&gt;&gt;His rhymes.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.576
They're not like "bad, sad, mad."

00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:57.126
It's like more detailed, more bigger
words, and it has something to do

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:59.526
with what he's talking about.

00:01:59.726 --> 00:02:01.676
&gt;&gt;Robert: In the South Bronx,
you look at the obesity rate,

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:05.856
the suicide, the asthma rates, these
things that children keep bottled in,

00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:08.956
so this is like a release for
them, to be able to come to school,

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:11.986
forget about everything
else, and just write.

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.826
&gt;&gt;Jesica: If you have a closed
bottle and it has soda in it

00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:17.986
and you shake it up, when you open
it, all the pressure is released,

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:20.446
and it's like that's how it feels
when you write out what you feel.

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:23.896
&gt;&gt;She's the writer of her
pain, but got no vein of shame.

00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:26.016
Cry at night, hold her pillow tight.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.826
The tears of a tiger roll
down her cheek into the ocean

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:33.156
that holds the tears of a
teenage girl, of her screams,

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:37.946
of her sorrows, of
her joy, of her pain.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:41.926
&gt;&gt;Robert: Part of the whole idea
of the poets in my school is

00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:45.446
that the kids want to be here,
so our attendance is good,

00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:48.926
they score well academically,
and they achieve something.

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:52.266
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:56.146
&gt;&gt;Taylor: It builds confidence
for the kids that students,

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:59.146
that when I met them, didn't have.

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:01.946
They couldn't get their eyes from
their notebook, and they would stand

00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:04.946
at the furthest point away from the
audience possible and they would talk

00:03:05.046 --> 00:03:06.126
as quietly as they could,

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:09.826
and now it's like they've
thrown their notebooks down

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:12.616
and they enjoy every second of it.

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:15.666
I see that through their writing
they're using a lot more poetic

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:17.216
devices, literary devices,

00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:19.516
and they're not just
throwing them in there.

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:21.026
It's not about plopping
them in there anymore.

00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:23.976
They actually make sense and
they make the writing stronger.

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:28.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To gear up for the
competitive slams, students practice

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:32.486
by performing via videoconference
for their classmates and peers

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:35.666
in the six cities Global Writes
serves across three states.

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:36.936
&gt;&gt;Can you hear me now?

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:39.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Today, it's a
friendly practice session

00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:41.426
between The Bronx and nearby Yonkers.

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:42.336
&gt;&gt;"Why I Recognize."

00:03:42.816 --> 00:03:46.506
Why? Because "real eyes
realize real lies."

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:49.156
You lyrical cliche reciter.

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.556
I should tear your
eyes out with a spoon.

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:53.636
Maybe then you'll be recognized.

00:03:53.636 --> 00:03:56.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers push them to
develop their constructive criticism

00:03:56.416 --> 00:04:01.046
as rigorously as their writing, and
as the kids get older, their poems

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:03.496
and their critiques
grow more sophisticated.

00:04:03.636 --> 00:04:08.046
&gt;&gt;When you're going to go slam, you
have to not only speak like it comes

00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:11.236
from the heart, but you have
to perform it, like its body

00:04:11.236 --> 00:04:13.316
and words are one when
you are slamming.

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:17.076
&gt;&gt;Jesica: When you find out that
words can actually change the world

00:04:17.076 --> 00:04:19.916
and that the words that change
the world come from you,

00:04:20.486 --> 00:04:22.666
then it just makes
you feel so important.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.766
&gt;&gt;I can't ever imagine how
hard it must be to hold images

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:27.576
of your mother's passing
in your pupils,

00:04:27.576 --> 00:04:31.096
and I want to sing these boys a
sweet melody that could tap dance

00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:34.276
across the rainbows of the better
side of everything, but the logic

00:04:34.276 --> 00:04:36.796
and their scars force
me to let them mourn.

00:04:37.886 --> 00:04:40.026
