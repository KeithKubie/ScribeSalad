put it than this show manages to snatch

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000
put it than this show manages to snatch
 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.750
put it than this show manages to snatch
defeat from the jaws of victory yeah

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760
defeat from the jaws of victory yeah
 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.790
defeat from the jaws of victory yeah
like that's what it does I'm like you

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800
like that's what it does I'm like you
 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.740
like that's what it does I'm like you
you had victory and then somehow you

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750
you had victory and then somehow you
 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.350
you had victory and then somehow you
snatched defeat from that yeah so so

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360
snatched defeat from that yeah so so
 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.390
