studied structural changes after

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540
studied structural changes after
 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.130

slunk is a learning sea slug is learning
and then I could believe also in my own

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850
and then I could believe also in my own
 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.160
and then I could believe also in my own
data because i had read his work so in a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170
data because i had read his work so in a
 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.430
data because i had read his work so in a
lot of different locations these people

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440
lot of different locations these people
 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.900
lot of different locations these people
have been important and also when we

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910
have been important and also when we
 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.780
have been important and also when we
were master students
