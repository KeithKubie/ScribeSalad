00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
something very similar but I think I
 

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.610 align:start position:0%
something very similar but I think I
think<00:11:30.330><c> it's</c><00:11:30.630><c> the</c><00:11:30.690><c> same</c><00:11:30.870><c> thing</c><00:11:30.900><c> like</c><00:11:31.050><c> watching</c>

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
think it's the same thing like watching
 

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.290 align:start position:0%
think it's the same thing like watching
Lion<00:11:31.890><c> King</c><00:11:32.160><c> or</c><00:11:32.310><c> Cinderella</c><00:11:32.790><c> a</c><00:11:32.910><c> lot</c><00:11:33.150><c> of</c><00:11:33.240><c> these</c>

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
Lion King or Cinderella a lot of these
 

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
Lion King or Cinderella a lot of these
Disney<00:11:33.660><c> films</c><00:11:33.930><c> where</c><00:11:34.020><c> it's</c><00:11:34.140><c> like</c><00:11:34.260><c> okay</c><00:11:34.530><c> are</c>

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:34.650 align:start position:0%
Disney films where it's like okay are
 

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.620 align:start position:0%
Disney films where it's like okay are
they<00:11:34.800><c> technically</c><00:11:35.190><c> breaking</c><00:11:35.490><c> the</c><00:11:35.730><c> moral</c><00:11:36.000><c> yeah</c>

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:36.630 align:start position:0%
they technically breaking the moral yeah
 

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.290 align:start position:0%
they technically breaking the moral yeah
but<00:11:37.050><c> I</c><00:11:37.260><c> think</c><00:11:37.890><c> it's</c><00:11:38.130><c> very</c><00:11:38.370><c> clear</c><00:11:38.820><c> what</c><00:11:39.120><c> the</c>

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
but I think it's very clear what the
 

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
but I think it's very clear what the
moral<00:11:39.510><c> is</c><00:11:39.720><c> I</c><00:11:39.870><c> think</c><00:11:39.930><c> most</c><00:11:40.230><c> kids</c><00:11:40.410><c> can</c><00:11:40.860><c> catch</c><00:11:41.100><c> on</c>

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.250 align:start position:0%
moral is I think most kids can catch on
 

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
moral is I think most kids can catch on
and<00:11:41.340><c> I</c><00:11:41.400><c> think</c><00:11:41.640><c> my</c><00:11:41.760><c> thing</c><00:11:42.000><c> is</c><00:11:42.120><c> it</c><00:11:42.360><c> didn't</c><00:11:42.840><c> wreck</c>
