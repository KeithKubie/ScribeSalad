[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.900
So there's a great essay
written by Sigmund Freud called

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.270
"On Transience."

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.700
And in it, he cites
a conversation

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.830
that he had with
the poet, Rilke,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.460
as they were walking along
this beautiful garden.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.262
And at one point, Rilke looked
like he was about to tear up.

00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:38.470
And Freud said, what's wrong?

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.300
It's a beautiful day.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.758
There's beautiful
plants around us.

00:00:40.758 --> 00:00:41.970
This is magnificent.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.710
And then Rilke says, well,
I can't get over the fact

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.360
that one day all of
this is going to die.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.200
All these trees,
all these plants,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.470
all this life is going to decay.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.140
Everything dissolves
in meaninglessness

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.330
when you think about the
fact that impermanence

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.790
is a really real thing.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.390
Perhaps the greatest existential
bummer of all is entropy.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.780
And I was really struck by
this, because perhaps that's

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.530
why, when we're in love,
we're also kind of sad.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.260
There's a sadness
to the ecstasy.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.525
Beautiful things sometimes
can make us a little sad.

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:15.790
And it's because
what they hint at

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.210
is the exception, a
vision of something

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.010
more, a vision of a
hidden door, a rabbit

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.940
hole to fall through,
but a temporary one.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.680
And I think, ultimately,
that is the tragedy.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.490
That is why love simultaneously
fills us with melancholy.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.070
That's why sometimes I feel
nostalgic over something

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.770
I haven't lost yet, because
I see its transience.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.580
And so how does one
respond to this?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.720
Do we love harder?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.730
Do we squeeze tighter?

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.710
Or do we embrace the Buddhist
creed of no attachment?

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.000
Do we pretend not to care that
everything and everyone we know

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.340
is going to be
taken away from us?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.150
And I don't know if
I can accept that.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.950
I think I more side with the
Dylan Thomas quote that says,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.950
I will not go quietly
into that good night,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.960
but instead rage against
the dying of the light.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.240
I think that we defy
entropy and impermanence

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.440
with our films and our poems.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.780
I think we hold onto each
other a little harder and say,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.920
I will not let go.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.390
I do not accept the ephemeral
nature of this moment.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.730
I'm going to extend it forever.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.580
Or at least I'm going to try.
