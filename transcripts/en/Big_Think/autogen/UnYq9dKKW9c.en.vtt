00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.580
I mean I think the most important thing

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:06.590
I mean I think the most important thing
 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.289
I mean I think the most important thing
to say about green architecture right

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:08.299
to say about green architecture right
 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.320
to say about green architecture right
now is that it's becoming less and less

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330
now is that it's becoming less and less
 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.619
now is that it's becoming less and less
of a big deal not because we're not

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629
of a big deal not because we're not
 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.720
of a big deal not because we're not
doing it but because we are doing it in

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730
doing it but because we are doing it in
 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.240
doing it but because we are doing it in
other words I'm saying that to make the

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250
other words I'm saying that to make the
 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.370
other words I'm saying that to make the
point that we're not marginalizing it

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380
point that we're not marginalizing it
 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.490
point that we're not marginalizing it
it's becoming so central to the making

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500
it's becoming so central to the making
 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.339
it's becoming so central to the making
of architecture that I don't even know

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349
of architecture that I don't even know
 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.650
of architecture that I don't even know
that we have to talk about it so much

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660
that we have to talk about it so much
 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.240
that we have to talk about it so much
and one of the reasons is that we've

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250
and one of the reasons is that we've
 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.020
and one of the reasons is that we've
learned how to make traditional by

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030
learned how to make traditional by
 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.580
learned how to make traditional by
traditional I don't mean historical I

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590
traditional I don't mean historical I
 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.279
traditional I don't mean historical I
just mean regular buildings in a much

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289
just mean regular buildings in a much
 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.779
just mean regular buildings in a much
more energy efficient way than we used

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789
more energy efficient way than we used
 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.479
more energy efficient way than we used
to so the question about how will green

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489
to so the question about how will green

saying not very much but not because

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559
saying not very much but not because
 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.619
saying not very much but not because
green architecture isn't happening it's

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629
green architecture isn't happening it's
 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.689
green architecture isn't happening it's
because we've learned to integrate it so

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699
because we've learned to integrate it so
 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.100
because we've learned to integrate it so
well that it doesn't change the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110
well that it doesn't change the
 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.690
well that it doesn't change the
appearance as much as we thought I mean

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700
appearance as much as we thought I mean

an example might be glass years and

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240
an example might be glass years and
 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.110
an example might be glass years and
years ago when the first serious

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120
years ago when the first serious
 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.900
years ago when the first serious
attempts were made to make buildings

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910
attempts were made to make buildings
 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.940

more energy-efficient people you say oh

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950
more energy-efficient people you say oh
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.470
more energy-efficient people you say oh
well that's the end of glass buildings

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480
well that's the end of glass buildings
 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.700
well that's the end of glass buildings
because you know nothing's worse than

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710
because you know nothing's worse than
 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.860
because you know nothing's worse than
glass and that's that and we're going to

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870
glass and that's that and we're going to
 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.110
glass and that's that and we're going to
see you know lots of masonry buildings

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120
see you know lots of masonry buildings
 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.090
see you know lots of masonry buildings
again or lots of this if I said that in

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100
again or lots of this if I said that in
 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.620
again or lots of this if I said that in
fact we now have more glass buildings

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630
fact we now have more glass buildings
 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.990
fact we now have more glass buildings
than ever and that's because glass

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000
than ever and that's because glass
 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.660
than ever and that's because glass
itself has changed and manufacturers

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670
itself has changed and manufacturers
 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.880
itself has changed and manufacturers
have learned how to make glass into

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890
have learned how to make glass into
 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.710
have learned how to make glass into
what's almost a different material and

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720
what's almost a different material and
 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.990
what's almost a different material and
that it's much more energy efficient

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000
that it's much more energy efficient
 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.780
that it's much more energy efficient
than it was before it has it performs in

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790
than it was before it has it performs in
 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.540
than it was before it has it performs in
a way that's much closer to opaque

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550
a way that's much closer to opaque
 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.630
a way that's much closer to opaque
material to stone or something like that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
material to stone or something like that
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.350
material to stone or something like that
not literally the same but closer than

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360
not literally the same but closer than
 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.310
not literally the same but closer than
it used to be and so we're seeing plenty

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320
it used to be and so we're seeing plenty
 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.680
it used to be and so we're seeing plenty
of glass buildings after all but they're

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690
of glass buildings after all but they're
 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.480
of glass buildings after all but they're
much more energy responsive they're much

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490
much more energy responsive they're much
 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.150
much more energy responsive they're much
more green than a generation ago so in a

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160
more green than a generation ago so in a
 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.779
more green than a generation ago so in a
way it's kind of like the situation with

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789
way it's kind of like the situation with
 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.950
way it's kind of like the situation with
cars you know

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960
cars you know
 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.510
cars you know
it's all well and good to talk about

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520
it's all well and good to talk about
 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.560
it's all well and good to talk about
hybrids and hybrids have been a

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570
hybrids and hybrids have been a
 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.830
hybrids and hybrids have been a
incredibly positive addition to the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
incredibly positive addition to the
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.680
incredibly positive addition to the
roads let's say but what's less talked

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690
roads let's say but what's less talked
 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.410
roads let's say but what's less talked
about is how much more efficient

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
about is how much more efficient
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.140
about is how much more efficient
conventional engines have become so you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
conventional engines have become so you
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.730
conventional engines have become so you
know you can buy a hybrid but you could

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740
know you can buy a hybrid but you could
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:40.770
know you can buy a hybrid but you could
also buy a BMW or Audi that in fact gets

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780
also buy a BMW or Audi that in fact gets
 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.810
also buy a BMW or Audi that in fact gets
almost as good mileage through a much

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820
almost as good mileage through a much
 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.490
almost as good mileage through a much
more efficient conventional engine and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500
more efficient conventional engine and
 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.520
more efficient conventional engine and
we're seeing that in architecture to an

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530
we're seeing that in architecture to an
 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.830
we're seeing that in architecture to an
awful lot of buildings that are just may

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840
awful lot of buildings that are just may
 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.390
awful lot of buildings that are just may
look like a different an older kind of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
look like a different an older kind of
 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.770
look like a different an older kind of
building but in fact are much more

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780
building but in fact are much more
 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.540
building but in fact are much more
efficient they don't necessarily have to

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550
efficient they don't necessarily have to
 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.150
efficient they don't necessarily have to
be totally different the way the hybrid

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160
be totally different the way the hybrid
 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.010
be totally different the way the hybrid
is totally different and of course even

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020
is totally different and of course even
 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.500
is totally different and of course even
within the realm of the hybrid you know

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510
within the realm of the hybrid you know
 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.540
within the realm of the hybrid you know
this the Prius which looks different or

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550
this the Prius which looks different or
 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.760
this the Prius which looks different or
then there's a hybrid engine inside a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770
then there's a hybrid engine inside a
 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.330
then there's a hybrid engine inside a
Toyota Camry that looks the same so in

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340
Toyota Camry that looks the same so in
 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.920
Toyota Camry that looks the same so in
architecture too there's an analogy I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930
architecture too there's an analogy I
 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.780
architecture too there's an analogy I
mean you can sort of the building can

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
mean you can sort of the building can
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.690
mean you can sort of the building can
express how green it is if the architect

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
express how green it is if the architect
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.390
express how green it is if the architect
and the client wanted to or it cannot

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400
and the client wanted to or it cannot
 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.380
and the client wanted to or it cannot
express that but still be just as green

nature of the city in about the city
being an organic living thing and the

being an organic living thing and the
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.330
being an organic living thing and the
thing capable of constant regeneration

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340
thing capable of constant regeneration
 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.790
thing capable of constant regeneration
and the street being so important those

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800
and the street being so important those

have almost become the common wisdom
 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.560
have almost become the common wisdom
today they're not considered radical

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570
today they're not considered radical
 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.360
today they're not considered radical
quite the contrary they're considered

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370
quite the contrary they're considered
 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.950
quite the contrary they're considered
very mainstream almost now but as with

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960
very mainstream almost now but as with

lining there's a cloud you could say you
know there's a downside to even this

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540
know there's a downside to even this
 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.670
know there's a downside to even this
very good thing and that's that when

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680
very good thing and that's that when
 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.060
very good thing and that's that when
someone's ideas become mainstream

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070
someone's ideas become mainstream
 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.330
someone's ideas become mainstream
there's always the tendency of people

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340
there's always the tendency of people
 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.370
there's always the tendency of people
who are not so responsible to exploit

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380
who are not so responsible to exploit
