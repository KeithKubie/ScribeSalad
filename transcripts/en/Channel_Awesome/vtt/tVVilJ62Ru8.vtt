00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.440
Of all the Disney sequels I've reviewed so far

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.600
Lady And The Tramp 2 seems to be the closest in spirit to the original.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.740
Now that's not saying a ton seeing how I thought  the original was only okay,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.980
but to be fair, I think it was meant to be kinda a smaller movie anyway.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.400
As soon as its sequel starts you'd swear you were in the exact same film:

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.740
the animation is really top notch

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.260
and looks eerily similar to the original.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.500
I don't know why they throw all their effort into these Lady And The Tramp films -

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.900
they're just DOGS walking around, why would you make them look this good?

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.420
But they do, and it's beautiful to look at.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.480
The story itself ranges from generic, to actually kinda okay,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.580
but again, for a Lady And The Tramp movie, it's not like I'm expecting anything spectacular here.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.740
The film takes place not even a year after the original:

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.580
Lady and the tramp still had puppies and they seem to be a happy family,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.740
but one of them seems to get into a lot of trouble.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.640
That being Scamp, voiced distractingly so by Scott Wolf.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.240
Yeah, look at this thing, you'd expect a cute little kid voice to come out of it,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.840
something high pitched.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.260
But instead, what do we get?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.280
*twenty year-old puberty voice*

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.440
"But I want to run wild, and free, like a REAL DOG!"

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.800
GOD does that Not fit.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.400
*twenty year-old puberty voice*

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.540
"I go wherever I want, do whatever I please!"

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.280
You KNOW the only reason they went with this voice is so they can get a semi-celebrity in there

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.180
and it just doesn't work.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.860
But thankfully the rest of the voice actors aren't that bad.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.160
As he wants to run away from home and join a bunch of junkyard dogs

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.100
one of them, named Angel, played by Eliza Milano, takes him under her wing and shows him the ways of the outdoors.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.920
But things get tricky when Scamp doesn't know where he belongs: in the home life or the outdoor life.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.880
It looks even trickier when it looks like Angel wants a home life, and even had a home life, but has had her heart broken many times before,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.020
AND even trickier when the leader of the junk yard dogs has it in for his father.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.440
Yeeeaaahhh sounds like a semi-reversal of the first film and not really too interesting -

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.280
but, actually they did quite a bit with it.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.500
The pacing in this film is a lot slower than other Disney sequels and it's very welcome.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.380
Much like the original there's this real elegance and color to it:

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.300
the backgrounds are just glowing!

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.220
And when a character goes through something they don't just say a line and then run away:

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.640
they actually kinda sit there and let the moment sink in.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.140
The songs are actually rather fitting too -

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.780
Okay, there's an occasional lame lyric here and there

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.300
but the style matches the time period perfectly.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.880
There's even a Rag Time in it.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.160
And for these types of songs they're actually done pretty well.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.540
Does it all work? No.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.460
There's definitely the clichÃ©s that you can see coming,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.400
and certainly a groaner line here or there,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.780
and, I really didn't get what age everybody was supposed to be.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.280
I mean, okay, Scamp is suppose to be a puppy but they get an adult voicing him.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.300
Well okay, maybe he's still a little kid,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.000
but, Eliza Milano voices the other "maybe" puppy;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.280
they don't really make it clear she's a puppy, maybe she's just a small dog,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.040
but there's clearly a romance blooming between them.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.080
So okay, maybe she is a puppy, but then she talks about how she's been in and out of five families.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.920
FIVE FAMILIES?? You can't be that young and go through five families!

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.240
But okay, give them benefit of the doubt: maybe she is, maybe she is still a puppy.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.340
The leader of the Junkyard dogs, CLEARLY AN ADULT, has the hots for her,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.720
always calling her 'His Girl' -

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.100
How does this Work???

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.440
So yeah, little scenes like that and kinda a phoned-in climax

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.940
make it lame at some points.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.860
But truth be told, I was actually kinda impressed with how much it felt like the original Lady And The Tramp:

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.500
They DO try to make you feel something, they DO show the dilemmas the characters are going through, they Do take the time for it.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.500
I can't really say it's great cause I don't think the first film or this one were meant to be really great -

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.700
They're supposed to be small, elegant, pleasant little movies.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.000
And okay there's definitely problems that hold me back from liking it as much as the first one -

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.440
- I mean the first one DID have a little more of an edge to it -

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.900
but I think if you're someone that actually wanted to see a sequel to Lady And The Tramp, this'll do you fine.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.220
If this is a story you for some reason really wanted to see continued, I say check it out:

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.520
it might be an adequate spinoff to dig your paws into.
