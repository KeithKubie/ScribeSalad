00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.499
 

00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.480
We've been talking a lot
about elasticities of demand,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.550
so you were probably
wondering, can we

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.170
think about elasticities
of a supply?

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.192
And, as you can imagine, the
answer is, of course we can.

00:00:13.192 --> 00:00:14.650
And it's interesting
to think about

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.390
how does the percent
change in quantity supplied

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.250
relate to percent
change in prices?

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.620
So for example,
let's say we have

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.780
a lemonade stand of some sort.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.990
So this is price on that axis.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.430
That is quantity on that axis.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.259
And let's say that
our supply curve

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.080
looks something like that.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.250
Obviously, the higher the
price, the more quantity

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.800
we're willing to supply.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.150
And let's say at a price of
$1, the quantity supplied

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.560
is going to be 10.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.180
And this is going to
be in gallons per week.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.230
So the quantity
supplied is going

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.070
to be 10 gallons per week.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.300
And let's say that if
the price goes to $2,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.000
so when the price goes
to $2, the quantity

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.180
supplied goes to 16
gallons per week.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.110
So what is the elasticity
of supply roughly

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.440
over this period
right over here?

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.844
So the elasticity of supply.

00:01:20.844 --> 00:01:23.010
And you can imagine how
we're going to calculate it.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.570
It's going to be the percent
change in quantity supplied

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.190
over our percent
change in price.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.610
So what is our percent
change in price?

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.520
Well, we went from $1 to $2.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.660
So this part right over here is
going to be, we went up by $1.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.190
So we went up by $1 per gallon.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.290
So it's going to be up by $1.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.580
And we don't use 1, we don't use
our starting point as our base

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.190
like we would do when we're
traditionally finding a percent

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.481
change, because we want to
have the same present change

00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:01.920
whether we go from 1
to 2 as from 2 to 1.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.290
So instead, the convention when
we think about elasticities

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.220
is use the midpoint
of these two or use

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.850
the average of these two.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.750
So 1 plus 2 is 3, 3
divided by 2 is 1.5.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.490
So it's 1 over $1.50, or
you could say $1.50 is right

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.470
in between these two things.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.670
And 1 over $1.50, this
is about 67% roughly.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.120
So this is approximately 67.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.400
We have approximately
a 67% change in price

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.180
based on how we just calculated.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.180
Remember, we're using
the midpoint as our base.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:42.440
And then our percent change in
quantity supplied, that's this.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.100
So this right over here.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.860
We went from 10 to 16.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.820
So we have plus-6 over a base
of, midpoint between 10 and 16,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.515
is 13.

00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:54.850
10 plus 16 is 26,
divided by 2 is 13.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.520
6/13, which is going to
be 40-something percent.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.020
Get a calculator out.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.000
So we have 6 divided
by 13 gives us 46%.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.040
So this right over here is 46%.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.750
So we have, when we
had, based on the way

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.280
we calculated it, it's
67% increase in price,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.460
we had a 46% increase
in quantity supplied.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.794
So this is a 46% increase
in quantity supplied.

00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:30.460
And so we could see
it's going to be 40.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.530
Our elasticity of supply is
going to be 46% over 67%.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.800
So it's going to be
something less than 1.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.520
So that's going to be that
divided by-- it's actually

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.680
0.6666 and it keeps going on
forever-- gets us to 0.69.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.270
So this gives us an
elasticity of supply of 0.69.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.310
And maybe I should say
approximately 0.69,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.820
which tells us that we
get a smaller percent.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.700
At least at this price
point right over here,

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.490
we get a smaller percent
change in quantity supplied

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.660
than our percent
change in price.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.240
Now, let's think
about-- like we did

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.290
when we thought about the
elasticities of demand--

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.870
let's think about
different scenarios.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.019
So let's think about a
scenario that is inelastic,

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.360
that is maybe
perfectly inelastic.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.900
So let's say that
price and quantity.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.020
So let's take me for example.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.800
I make videos.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.950
I love making videos.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.240
This is what I want to
spend my days doing.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.090
And I don't care
how much you pay me

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.770
or how little you pay me.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.504
I guess if you paid
me enough, maybe

00:04:42.504 --> 00:04:44.670
I'd spend even a little bit
more time making videos.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.800
But let's just
assume that I don't.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.750
Whether you pay me a penny
a video or zero per video,

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.800
or whether you pay
me $1,000 per video,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.516
I'm going to just make the same
number of videos every day.

00:04:57.516 --> 00:05:02.940
So this right over here is
videos per day on average.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.030
And this is the price per video.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.270
And let's say no matter
how much you pay me,

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.520
whether you pay me nothing
or you pay me $1,000,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.940
I am just going to
produce, on average,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.530
let's just say,
three videos a day.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.760
So then you have
this right over here.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.530
You have a perfectly
inelastic supply curve.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:32.900
So this is perfectly
inelastic supply curve.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.710
Now, you could have
the other scenario

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.720
where you are a farmer.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.181
So let me do price and quantity.

00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:44.430
Now, you have the other
scenario where you're a farmer

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.700
and you can either do crop
A or crop B. Maybe it's

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.600
corn and wheat.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.715
And you can easily
swap between the two.

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:53.215
And let's just
assume for simplicity

00:05:53.215 --> 00:05:57.280
it costs you the exact same
to produce one or the other.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.890
 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.386
So let's say that the
price of wheat per-- and

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:05.010
let's say we're using
comparable units.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.960
So the price of
wheat is, adjusting

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.990
for units and all of
that, let's say it's $10,

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.402
I don't know, per bushel
or something like that.

00:06:16.402 --> 00:06:18.860
We just want to simplify it
for the sake of our model right

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.690
over here.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.560
But this right over here,
we're thinking about the corn.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.660
We're thinking about corn.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:29.780
 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.170
Let's say corn is right at $10.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.610
And right at $10, when
they're both at $10,

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.460
I will produce-- so
let me make this clear.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.390
So price of corn is $10, and
the quantity of corn-- maybe,

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.130
I don't know, I
produce 2,000 bushels.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.820
And I know these
prices are way off

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.010
for what the real price per
bushel of corn or wheat is.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.330
And same thing.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.630
My quantity for wheat
right here is 2,000.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.880
Now, if the price of corn were
to go marginally up-- so let

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.470
me put this.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.330
So this is our graph for corn.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.910
So this is $10 and this is 2,000
bushels per year or something.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.470
So let's say that's where
we are right over there.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.260
Now, if the price for
corn goes marginally up,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.585
if the price for corn goes
up to even $10.05 per bushel,

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:24.710
all of a sudden, I'm going
to shift all of my wheat

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.290
production to corn production.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.040
So this is going to
go to 0, and then this

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.630
is going to go to $4,000.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:38.150
So at just $10.05, we're going
to go all the way to $4,000.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.430
And likewise, if this
price were to go down,

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.899
if this were to go
to, like, $9.95,

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:44.690
I would shift all of
my production to wheat

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.750
and I wouldn't produce any corn.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.830
And so there you see
that the demand curve

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.860
is getting very flat.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.420
And you can see, based on
very, very small percent

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.550
changes in prices, I have
very large percent changes

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.400
in quantity supplied.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:13.250
So this right over here is
approaching perfect elasticity.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.550
Huge changes in quantity
supplied, elasticity,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.370
for small percent
changes in price.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.780
Now, the cool thing about
elasticity of supply

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.390
is it's actually much
easier to make a curve that

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.467
has unit elasticity
or even, if you

00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:30.300
want to think about it,
constant elasticity.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.470
But if you want to
have unit elasticity,

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.200
the easiest curve I can
draw for unit elasticity

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.710
is going to look like this.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.260
Well, actually, this is the
curve for unit elasticity.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.390
It will literally be a
curve that looks like that.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.200
And the reason why
it works in this case

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.150
is because it's upward-sloping.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.480
As price increases, so
does quantity increase

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.950
for the supply curve.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.950
So at any point here, the two
are going to be proportional.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.770
So a given change in quantity
and a given change in price,

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.510
they're going to represent
the same percentages,

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.080
because, as price is increasing,
when you have large price

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.660
or when you have medium price,
you have medium quantity.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.270
When you have large price,
you have large quantity.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.770
So these steps are going
to be the same percentage

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:15.750
of either one of them.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.060
When you have small prices,
you have small quantities.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.570
And so it's much easier to
construct a supply curve that

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.380
has unit elasticity than it is
to construct a normal demand

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.390
curve that has unit elasticity.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.092
