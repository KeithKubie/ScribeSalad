00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.831
In the past few months, I've been
traveling for weeks at a time

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:11.886
with only one suitcase of clothes.

00:00:12.215 --> 00:00:14.374
One day, I was invited
to an important event,

00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:17.072
and I wanted to wear
something special and new for it.

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:20.876
So I looked through my suitcase
and I couldn't find anything to wear.

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:24.386
I was lucky to be at the technology
conference on that day,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.004
and I had access to 3D printers.

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.265
So I quickly designed
a skirt on my computer,

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.434
and I loaded the file on the printer.

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:33.613
It just printed the pieces overnight.

00:00:33.952 --> 00:00:36.082
The next morning,
I just took all the pieces,

00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:38.073
assembled them together in my hotel room,

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:41.053
and this is actually the skirt
that I'm wearing right now.

00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:44.977
(Applause)

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.784
So it wasn't the first time
that I printed clothes.

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:50.173
For my senior collection
at fashion design school,

00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:54.680
I decided to try and 3D print
an entire fashion collection from my home.

00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:58.535
The problem was that I barely knew
anything about 3D printing,

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.334
and I had only nine months to figure out
how to print five fashionable looks.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.255
I always felt most creative
when I worked from home.

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:09.667
I loved experimenting with new materials,

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.900
and I always tried
to develop new techniques

00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:15.427
to make the most unique textiles
for my fashion projects.

00:01:15.832 --> 00:01:18.428
I loved going to old factories
and weird stores

00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:23.142
in search of leftovers
of strange powders and weird materials,

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.512
and then bring them home to experiment on.

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:27.396
As you can probably imagine,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.435
my roommates didn't like that at all.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:30.464
(Laughter)

00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:34.601
So I decided to move on
to working with big machines,

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:36.718
ones that didn't fit in my living room.

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:38.869
I love the exact
and the custom work I can do

00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:41.039
with all kinds of fashion technologies,

00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:44.755
like knitting machines
and laser cutting and silk printing.

00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:48.996
One summer break, I came here
to New York for an internship

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.370
at a fashion house in Chinatown.

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:55.345
We worked on two incredible dresses
that were 3D printed.

00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:58.162
They were amazing --
like you can see here.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.747
But I had a few issues with them.

00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:04.439
They were made from hard plastics
and that's why they were very breakable.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.757
The models couldn't sit in them,

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.169
and they even got scratched
from the plastics under their arms.

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:13.778
With 3D printing, the designers
had so much freedom

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:17.084
to make the dresses look
exactly like they wanted,

00:02:17.108 --> 00:02:22.701
but still, they were very dependent
on big and expensive industrial printers

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:25.882
that were located in a lab
far from their studio.

00:02:26.774 --> 00:02:30.212
Later that year, a friend gave me
a 3D printed necklace,

00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:32.371
printed using a home printer.

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:34.541
I knew that these printers
were much cheaper

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:37.821
and much more accessible
than the ones we used at my internship.

00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:39.713
So I looked at the necklace,

00:02:39.737 --> 00:02:43.200
and then I thought, "If I can
print a necklace from home,

00:02:43.224 --> 00:02:45.379
why not print my clothes from home, too?"

00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.468
I really liked the idea that I wouldn't
have to go to the market

00:02:49.492 --> 00:02:52.116
and pick fabrics that
someone else chose to sell --

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.226
I could just design them
and print them directly from home.

00:02:57.507 --> 00:02:59.374
I found a small makerspace,

00:02:59.398 --> 00:03:02.021
where I learned everything
I know about 3D printing.

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.954
Right away, they literally
gave me the key to the lab,

00:03:04.978 --> 00:03:07.996
so I could experiment
into the night, every night.

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:12.481
The main challenge was to find the right
filament for printing clothes with.

00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:13.661
So what is a filament?

00:03:13.685 --> 00:03:16.117
Filament is the material
you feed the printer with.

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:19.043
And I spent a month or so
experimenting with PLA,

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:22.228
which is a hard and scratchy,
breakable material.

00:03:22.955 --> 00:03:25.638
The breakthrough came
when I was introduced to Filaflex,

00:03:25.662 --> 00:03:27.204
which is a new kind of filament.

00:03:27.228 --> 00:03:29.568
It's strong, yet very flexible.

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:33.426
And with it, I was able to print
the first garment,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.898
the red jacket that had
the word "LibertÃ©" --

00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:38.117
"freedom" in French --

00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.654
embedded into it.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.471
I chose this word because I felt
so empowered and free

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:44.798
when I could just design
a garment from my home

00:03:44.822 --> 00:03:46.931
and then print it by myself.

00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:51.065
And actually, you can easily
download this jacket,

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:53.717
and easily change the word
to something else.

00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:56.389
For example, your name
or your sweetheart's name.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.980
(Laughter)

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:00.089
So the printer plates are small,

00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:04.191
so I had to piece the garment
together, just like a puzzle.

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:07.812
And I wanted to solve another challenge.

00:04:07.836 --> 00:04:09.381
I wanted to print textiles

00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:11.910
that I would use
just like regular fabrics.

00:04:11.934 --> 00:04:13.868
That's when I found an open-source file

00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:16.481
from an architect who designed
a pattern that I love.

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:19.224
And with it, I was able to print
a beautiful textile

00:04:19.248 --> 00:04:21.872
that I would use
just like a regular fabric.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.221
And it actually even looks
a little bit like lace.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.960
So I took his file and I modified it,
and changed it, played with it --

00:04:29.984 --> 00:04:32.578
many kinds of versions out of it.

00:04:32.977 --> 00:04:37.161
And I needed to print
another 1,500 more hours

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:40.112
to complete printing my collection.

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:43.944
So I brought six printers to my home
and just printed 24-7.

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.019
And this is actually
a really slow process,

00:04:47.043 --> 00:04:51.386
but let's remember the Internet
was significantly slower 20 years ago,

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.735
so 3D printing will also accelerate

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.742
and in no time you'll be able to print
a T-Shirt in your home

00:04:56.766 --> 00:04:59.731
in just a couple of hours,
or even minutes.

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.469
So you guys, you want to see
what it looks like?

00:05:02.493 --> 00:05:03.794
Audience: Yeah!

00:05:03.818 --> 00:05:05.669
(Applause)

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:11.132
Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing
one of my five outfits.

00:05:11.156 --> 00:05:15.973
Almost everything here she's wearing,
I printed from my home.

00:05:16.402 --> 00:05:18.653
Even her shoes are printed.

00:05:18.677 --> 00:05:19.829
Audience: Wow!

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:21.018
Audience: Cool!

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.844
(Applause)

00:05:24.868 --> 00:05:26.411
Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.149
(To audience) Thank you, guys.

00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:32.688
So I think in the future,
materials will evolve,

00:05:32.712 --> 00:05:35.893
and they will look and feel
like fabrics we know today,

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:37.853
like cotton or silk.

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:42.639
Imagine personalized clothes
that fit exactly to your measurements.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.837
Music was once a very physical thing.

00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:49.885
You would have to go
to the record shop and buy CDs,

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.559
but now you can just download the music --

00:05:52.583 --> 00:05:53.742
digital music --

00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:55.099
directly to your phone.

00:05:55.828 --> 00:05:58.289
Fashion is also a very physical thing.

00:05:58.623 --> 00:06:01.505
And I wonder what our world will look like

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:04.873
when our clothes will be digital,
just like this skirt is.

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:06.752
Thank you so much.

00:06:06.776 --> 00:06:07.976
(Applause)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.150
[Thank You]

00:06:09.174 --> 00:06:12.122
(Applause)
