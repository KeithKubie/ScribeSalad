00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.220
Ever been on one of those twirly carnival
rides?

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.040
You know, the ones where you get into a giant cylinder and stand against the wall, and then they spin you around like a wet salad?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.160
If you've had that uniquely nauseating experience, then you know that the simple act of spinning in a circle can be ... intense.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.170
It also happens to be one of the most
misunderstood concepts in Newtonian physics.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.320
It’s known as uniform circular motion, and it’s what occurs when anything moves along a circular path in a consistent way.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.960
Most of the confusion about this idea has to do with the fact that things accelerate inward as they move in a circle --

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.340
a kind of acceleration known as centripetal acceleration. But you'll often hear people talking about

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.310
centrifugal acceleration pushing things
outward as they move in a circle.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.720
That's actually where centrifuges get their name!
And centrifugal acceleration isn't wrong, exactly.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.740
It's just ... not real.
So, to explain how things really accelerate

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.280
when they move in circles, let's talk about
the physics of that ride as it spins you around

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.960
-- assuming you're willing to risk stepping
inside. I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:08.820
[Theme Music]

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.160
In 1960, NASA was getting ready
to send people to space.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.380
They knew that a big part of space flight
would involve acceleration,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.500
so they wanted to test how much acceleration people could handle before they'd black out.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.719
Because that’s what happens when too much blood is forced away from your brain for too long.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.539
So engineers tested potential astronauts by putting them in a human centrifuge --

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.219
Basically, a superpowered version
of those rides at the fair.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.080
They found that most people could withstand an acceleration of around 98 meters per second squared for 10 minutes --

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.340
That's about ten times the acceleration caused by gravity that you'd feel just by jumping in the air.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.540
With that in mind, let's say we've been asked to calculate the safety of one of those carnival rides --

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.360
which means we'll need to figure
out how much acceleration riders would experience.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.960
There are equations we can use to do that,
because just like with all the other kinds

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.929
of motion we've talked about so far, uniform
circular motion has four main qualities --

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.049
position, velocity, acceleration, and time.
And they're all related to each other.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.649
When it comes to uniform circular motion,
position is the most obvious quality:

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.840
There’s an object, and it’s on a circular path.
But velocity is a little less intuitive.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.940
At any given moment, velocity tells you how fast the object’s going, and in what direction.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.800
And that direction … is NOT along the path of the circle.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.880
It’s actually perpendicular to the radius of the circle -- along what we call a tangent.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.260
So if you draw an arrow representing the velocity on the circle, it’ll only touch the circle in one spot.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.680
OK bear with me here, as this
might seem kinda strange, but it’s true!

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.620
One of the nice things about the physics
of motion is that often,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.860
you can just try it out for yourself and see what happens.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.580
So here’s a quick way to see tangential velocity in action:

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.380
All you need is some string,
a key -- or some other small object to tie

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.420
the string to -- and a wide open space so
nobody gets hurt , by a key flying around.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.360
Move the string so the key starts twirling
around in counterclockwise circles, parallel

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.220
to the ground. Then, when the key is at the
point in the circle that’s farthest away

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.720
from you… let go of the string. The key
flies to the left!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.240
Here’s why: In earlier episodes, we’ve
talked about inertia and the idea that if

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.280
an object is in motion, it’ll remain in
that motion unless it’s acted upon by a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.390
net external force.
Which means that something moving in a straight

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.610
line is going to continue moving in a straight
line unless a force -- one that isn’t balanced

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.070
out by other forces -- turns it.
Whenever you see something turning?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.360
There’s a net external force acting on it.
That’s why, at any given moment, the velocity

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.510
of an object moving in a circle will be tangent
to it. Without a force to turn it, it just

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.180
flies in whatever direction it was moving
last. Once you let go of the string, you got

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.760
rid of the force that was making the key turn
in circles.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.150
So it kept moving with the same velocity that
it had at the exact moment you let go -- perpendicular

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.340
to the string connecting it to your hand,
which was the center of the key’s circular

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.290
path. And now, we can finally talk about the
mysterious force that was accelerating the

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.610
key -- changing the direction of its velocity
so that it moved in a circle.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.450
That force is the same reason riders on the
human centrifuge spin in a circle -- in fact,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.280
it’s the reason anything moves in a circle.
That force is known as the centripetal force,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.360
and the acceleration it causes is called centripetal
acceleration.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.510
And the important thing to remember about
centripetal acceleration is that it’s always

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.600
directed toward the center of the circular
path.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.000
That makes a lot of sense, if you think about
it in terms of how the velocity’s changing.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.320
The key was only turning in circles because
your hand was pulling it toward the center

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.810
of a circular path.
But now think about what it’s like to be

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.560
on one of those centrifuge rides -- or, if
you’ve never subjected yourself to one,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.330
what it’s like to be in a car that turns
sharply. The ride -- or the car -- is turning

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.860
in a circle, so there must be centripetal
acceleration pushing you toward the middle

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.370
of that circle.
Except, it feels like you’re being pushed

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.860
outward. People often attribute this sensation
to centrifugal force. But that’s not real.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.659
The reason that people confuse the centripetal
force with what feels like a centrifugal

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.729
force comes down to a change in perspective
-- what physicists call a frame of reference.

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.229
From the frame of reference of someone standing
outside the human centrifuge, it’s easy

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.060
to see what’s actually happening: As the
cylinder turns, it forces the people inside

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.080
it to move in a circle. And the wall is pressing
on them to keep them turning -- it’s actually

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.009
pushing them toward the center of the circle!
But the person inside the cylinder just sees

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.180
everything moving around with them.
From their frame of reference, it feels like

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.939
they’re just being squashed against the
wall -- as though there’s a centrifugal

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.479
force acting on them.
But there’s nothing there to actually create

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.310
that force. Which is why physicists call it
a fictitious force -- it doesn’t really exist.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.520
So! Now that we know how acceleration works

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.189
when you’re moving in a circle, we can finally
come up with some ways to connect position,

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:29.659
velocity, and acceleration -- and figure out
if that centrifuge ride is safe for people.

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.139
But first, we have to talk about time. When
something’s moving around a circle in a

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.789
consistent way -- in other words, its acceleration
is constant -- it’ll take a certain amount

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.979
of time to return to its starting conditions.
In this case, those starting conditions are

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.800
a particular point along the circular path.
We call that time the period of the motion,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.539
and the variable we use to represent it is
a capital T.

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.169
Which isn’t too hard to remember, as long
as you keep in mind that the period is an

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.120
amount of time. From timing the centrifuge
ride in action, we know that it takes 2 seconds

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.879
to spin around once. So we’d say that the
period of its motion is 2 seconds.

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.779
But sometimes it’s easier to talk about
the same idea in another way -- how many revolutions

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.970
does the ride make in one second? That’s
what we’d call the frequency of the motion

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.969
-- which we write as an f in equations.
That’s simple enough to figure out: if it

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.990
takes the ride 2 seconds to make one revolution,
then it’s making one half of a revolution

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.650
per second.It’s also not too difficult to
relate period and frequency with an equation:

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.740
frequency is just 1, divided by the period.
Now that we’ve gotten time out of the way,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.219
let’s talk about position. We generally
talk about distance in terms of the circumference

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:37.249
of the circle, because that tells us how many
times you’ve gone around the circle.

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:41.759
In other words, if a centrifuge rider covers
the same distance as one circumference, we

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.699
know they’ve made one revolution. And circumference
is just 2 times pi times the radius of the

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:53.399
circle. So if that human centrifuge has a
radius of 5 meters, riders would travel 31.4 meters every revolution.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.320
Now: What about their speed? Well, in our

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.069
episodes on motion in a straight line, we
talked about how average velocity is generally

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:03.379
equal to the change in position over the change
in time -- -- which turns out to be a great

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.180
way to describe the speed of uniform circular
motion.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.539
When the rider’s made one revolution around
the circle, they’ve covered a distance equal

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:15.400
to 2 times pi times r -- or, in this case,
31.4 meters. That’s how far they’ve traveled.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.349
And the amount of time it took was equal to
the period of the ride’s motion. That’s

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:21.409
their change in time.
Divide the distance they’ve traveled by

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:25.349
their change in time, and you get the speed
equation for uniform circular motion. Using

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:29.809
that equation, we can calculate the speed
of a rider on the centrifuge -- it’s 15.7

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:33.059
meters per second.
Next, getting the equation for the magnitude

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:37.729
of centripetal acceleration -- how strong
it is, basically -- is a little less straightforward.

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:42.309
That magnitude will be equal to the change
in velocity over the change in time at any given

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:46.729
moment -- in other words, its derivative.
Actually calculating the derivative can

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:51.869
get complicated, but it turns out to be equal
to the speed, squared, divided by the radius

00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:54.689
of the circle.
This equation makes a lot of sense for a few

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:58.789
reasons: First, take a look at the units.
Acceleration is measured in meters per second

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:02.960
squared, so we already know that whatever
the equation for centripetal acceleration

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.099
is, the units have to work out to meters per
second squared.

00:08:06.099 --> 00:08:10.460
And they do: square the speed, and you end
up with units of meters squared per second

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.839
squared. Just divide those units by meters,
and you get meters per second squared. You

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:19.020
can also tell from this equation that if you
increase your speed along the circular path

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.339
or decrease the radius of that path, you should
end up with a higher acceleration.

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:27.020
And that relationship between acceleration,
speed, and radius checks out in real life, too:

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.650
Try spinning the key on a string faster,
or shortening the string but spinning it at

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.060
the same speed. You’ll feel the key pulling
harder on your fingers, because it’s experiencing

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.130
more acceleration.
And now that we have an equation for the acceleration

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.860
that riders would experience on the centrifuge,
we can finally figure out if that ride is

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.800
safe. We already know that their speed would
be 15.7 meters per second, and that the radius

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.570
of the ride is 5 meters.
So, according to the equation for acceleration,

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.360
their acceleration would be 49.3 meters per
second squared. That’s about half the acceleration

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.430
that NASA found would make people black out.
So the ride is probably safe, at least for

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.570
a couple of minutes. Whether that much acceleration
would be pleasant is a different story -- but

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.660
hey, we’re just here to make sure the ride
is safe. We’re not responsible for cleaning

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.839
up the vomit once it’s over.
Today, you learned that when an object is

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:16.029
in uniform circular motion, its velocity is
tangent to the circle and its acceleration

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:20.440
is pointing inward. We also talked about the
difference between centripetal and centrifugal

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.250
forces, and derived equations for period,
frequency, velocity, and acceleration.
