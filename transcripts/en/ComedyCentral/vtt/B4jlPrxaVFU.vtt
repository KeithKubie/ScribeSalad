00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.236
Our future president,

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:05.839
slash, amazing source
of vitamin C, Donald Trump...

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:08.442
-(laughter) ...recently met
with Barack Obama

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.177
to go over the transition
of power

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.312
and also to ask
"What do presidents do?"

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:15.983
(laughter)

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.252
This is...

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.021
(cheers and applause)

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.358
This is the exact moment

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.261
of it just sinking in,
what he's got to do right here.

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:28.762
And Obama's like,

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.597
"Yeah, mother(bleep), that's
what this (bleep) is about."

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.866
-(laughter)
-According to CNBC,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.102
aides on Trump's team
were surprised to learn

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.504
the entire West Wing staff
will leave with Obama,

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.773
which is a bummer, 'cause Trump
was really looking forward

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:42.109
to saying, "You're fired!"
to a bunch of housekeepers.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.845
-(laughter) -Trump was also
reportedly planning

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.281
to split his time between
Washington D.C., Trump Tower

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:50.050
and Mar-a-Lago because he
doesn't want this job, you guys!

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.952
-He doesn't want to do it.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.554
He didn't think it through.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:55.322
-He just didn't
think it through. -Yeah.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.958
Right? This is like
a <i>Twilight Zone</i> ending for Trump

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.626
where he gets
his Faustian bargain.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.231
"You mean I actually have
to do this?! No!"

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:07.601
-Yeah, but... think about it.
-(cheers and applause)

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:11.138
He's a billionaire,
he's 70 years old.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.773
The next four to eight years

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.209
are a considerable chunk
of the rest of his life,

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.077
and he's got
to (bleep) do it now.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.046
It's hilarious. I mean, it's...

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.616
(applause and cheering)

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.552
I don't know how funny it is
to some people, <i>but</i>

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.087
it seems like
Donald doesn't know

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.555
what the presidency
actually entails.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:29.857
He's like America's drunk friend

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.491
watching <i>American Ninja Warrior,</i>
saying,

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:34.294
-"Yeah, I could do that
(bleep)." Except... -(laughter)

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:37.764
"It's not so hard.
I could do that (bleep)."

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:40.767
Except now,
60 million people were like,

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.938
"Okay, then do that (bleep),
why don't you?"

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:47.641
-(laughter,
applause and cheering) -Now,

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.976
comedians,
since the president-elect needs

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.477
some helping hints
to get started,

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.480
what are some other presidential
duties he should know about?

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:55.182
Arden Myrin.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.986
Presiding over the government
of the United States of America.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.355
-(laughter)
-All right.

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:03.357
-All right.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.592
Well, a branch of it.
Yeah. Points.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.561
-Judge Doug Benson.
-(laughter)

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.163
-I...
-(laughter)

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:13.367
I don't...

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.670
I don't know exactly
how the custom works, Chris,

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.138
but I think
around the holidays,

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:20.474
he has to choose a turkey
and grab its lady giblets.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:22.476
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: All right.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.245
-Points. Yeah.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.281
-Samm Levine.
-He's got to

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:28.749
renew trade agreements
with other countries.

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:31.552
He has to negotiate the
cease fire in the Middle East.

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:33.120
He has to reduce
the federal budget.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.521
I'm just (bleep) with you,
Donnie.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:34.621
Mike Pence will handle all that.
Don't worry about it.
