00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Based on what we learned in the
last video, let's see if

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.800
we can name these two
molecules here.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.630
Let's start with
this blue one.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.410
So the first thing we notice,
it is an alkene.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.140
It has a double bond
right there.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.750
So we can, right from the get
go, write that it's going to

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.780
end with an ene.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.470
And then we need to figure
out what the longest

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.790
carbon chain is.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.120
And it looks like it's
this one here.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.680
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven carbons.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.310
So it's going to be hept as
our prefix on the alkene.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.080
Let me write it out a little
bit further to the left.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.060
And then we have to figure out
where the double bond is.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.410
And we always want to start
numbering our carbons from the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.630
direction that bumps into the
double bond first. And so the

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.300
double bond is closer
to this end of the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.220
chain than that end.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.540
So we're going to start
numbering here.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.720
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.320
And so the double bond starts
on the three carbon.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.550
So it is hept-3-ene.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.270
And we also have a
functional group.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.550
We have a methyl group sitting
on the number four carbon.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:16.280
So it is 4-methylhept-3-ene,
which is correct.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280
But we still haven't considered
what's going on, on

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.010
either side of the
double bond.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.970
Whether the higher priority
functional group is closer to

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.960
each other on both sides of
the double bond or whether

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.690
they're farther away
from each other.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.970
And to do that we first have
to identify the higher

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.490
priority group on each side
of the double bond.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.000
So on the right side of the
double bond-- let me circle it

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.780
in magenta on each side-- so
on the right side of the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.250
double bond, we only
have one functional

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.580
group, right over here.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.160
You could view this
as an ethyl group.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.040
That's pretty obvious.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.360
There is no other functional
group bonded to the carbon.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.250
There's only a hydrogen
over here.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.540
Now on the left side it's a
little bit less obvious.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.580
We have two functional groups
from the point of

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.780
view of this carbon.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.130
You have the methyl that we
already pointed out, and you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.160
also have these three carbons
right over here.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.980
You could view that
as a propyl group.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.470
And what we need to do to
identify the highest priority

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.220
group is to use the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog namings or

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.950
priority scheme that we learned
several videos ago.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.540
And there you literally go from
this carbon, you look at

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.390
what it's bonded to, and you
compare the atomic numbers.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.570
But in both cases it's
a carbon to a carbon.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.330
This is a carbon to a carbon.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.440
So their atomic numbers
are the same.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.450
So then you go one bond further
away and you see which

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.140
one is bonded to a higher
atomic number atom.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.830
This carbon bonds to a
carbon, which is a

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.940
higher atomic number.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.850
This carbon only bonds
to three hydrogens.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.940
This one does two hydrogens
and one carbon.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.000
Because it's bonded to another
carbon, it takes priority.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.620
This propyl group is a higher
priority functional group.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.120
So now when we're trying to
decide whether it is entgegen

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.770
or zusammen, we look
at these 2 groups.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.360
And we see that they are sitting
on the same side of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.090
the double bond.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.720
They are both above
the carbons.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.680
They are closer to each other.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.030
So this molecule is zusammen.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.350
Which on some levels, you can
think of as the same thing as

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.350
cis, but cis and trans stops
applying when you start having

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.770
more than two functional
groups.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.010
In this case, we have three.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:24.570
So we would call this
Z-4-methylhept-3-ene.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.780
And that's because the higher
priority functional groups are

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.880
on the same side of
the double bond.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.390
Now let's do this
one over here.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.930
And someone pointed out,
rightly, that I had misspelled

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.150
zusammen in the last video.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.880
It's actually spelled
like this, zusammen.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.260
I had spelled it with
two s's and one m.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.350
I guess you can forgive me.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.580
I don't speak German.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.770
But anyway, I thought I
would point that out.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.820
Now let's try to label this
thing right over here.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.530
So the first thing, this once
again is an alkene.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.510
Let's identify the longest
carbon chain here.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.160
So it looks like one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.670
eight carbons.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.740
Double bonds are closer
to the left hand side.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.390
So we will start
numbering here.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.140
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.770
So just the main chain is oct--
let me make sure I have

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:21.310
some space here--
it is oct-3-ene.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.630
And then we have, well we have
one functional group sitting

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.920
off of the main chain.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.460
We have this bromine sitting
right over there

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.950
on the third carbon.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.345
So we would call this
3-bromooct-3-ene.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.400
And now we have to figure out
is it entgegen or zusammen.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.430
So if we look on the carbon on
the right hand side, it's

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.410
pretty obvious that this is
the only functional group.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.720
We just have a hydrogen there.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.130
So let me circle it
in the magenta.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.550
And then on the left hand side
we have two functional groups.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.080
We have this [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.900
bromo or we have a bromine
sitting right there.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.550
And then we have this
propyl group.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.260
And because this propyl group
is bigger, you might be

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.310
tempted to say it takes
higher priority.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.580
But remember, in the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, you

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.860
give higher priority to
the atom that has a

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.330
higher atomic number.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.100
Bromine has an atomic
number of 35.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.780
Carbon has an atomic
number of only 6.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.810
So Bromine is actually
higher priority.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.460
So this is the higher
priority functional

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.240
group right over here.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.120
So now for deciding whether it's
entgegen or zusammen, we

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.840
see that our higher priority
groups are apart.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.060
They're on opposite sides
of the double bond.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.620
This one is on top.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.190
This one is below.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.370
We are apart.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.120
So this is entgegen.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.095
Or we would write this is
E-3-bromooct-3-ene.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.850
And E is for-- just as a bit
of a refresher-- it's for

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.660
entgegen, a word that I enjoy
saying, entgegen.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.910
There you go.
