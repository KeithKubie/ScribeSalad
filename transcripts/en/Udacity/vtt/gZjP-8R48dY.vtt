00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.150
All the tests we've done so far are called parametric tests. I just felt like

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.220
writing that in cursive. They test hypotheses and make assumptions about the

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.350
parameters of the population, mu and sigma. But what happens if we ask a

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.310
question or take a measurement using a scale that's not interval or ratio? For

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.924
example, what if I asked 100 people, Yes or No? Or what if I asked 100 men and

00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:30.800
100 women if they prefer the beach or the mountains. We can't say something

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.140
like the average favorite vacation spot is the beach. Instead, we use

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.690
frequencies and proportions to describe these data. In this lesson, you're

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.920
going to learn hypothesis testing techniques that do not require parametric

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.740
information, like mean and standard deviation. These are called nonparametric

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.850
tests. I don't know why it's so fun to write parametric in cursive. I think

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.445
I'll just keep doing that. The nonparametric test you'll learn today is the

00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:04.200
chi-squared test, where chi is another Greek symbol that looks like an x.
