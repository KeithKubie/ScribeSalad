00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:01.535
- [Voiceover] So there are situations

00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:03.204
where you have some type of a function,

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:05.117
this is clearly a nonlinear function.

00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:07.936
F of x is equal to one over x minus one,

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:10.404
this is its graph or at
least part of its graph

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:11.360
right over here.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.193
But where you wanna approximate
it with a linear function

00:00:14.193 --> 00:00:17.377
especially around a certain value,

00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:18.544
and so what we're going to do is,

00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:21.476
we wanna find an approximation,
let me write this down,

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:24.309
I wanna find an approximation for,

00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.342
actually meant to be clear, I wanna find

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:27.825
a linear approximation

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:29.862
so I'm gonna approximate it with a line.

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:34.029
I wanna find a linear
approximation, approximation

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:39.882
of f, of f, around, and you need to know

00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:43.683
where you're going to be approximating it,

00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:46.350
around x equals negative one.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.186
So what do we mean by that?

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:50.754
Well let's look at this graph over here,

00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:53.739
on this curve, when x is
equal to negative one,

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.906
f of negative one is
negative, is negative 1/2,

00:01:01.217 --> 00:01:06.210
which sticks us right over
there, let me use a better color,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.754
so it's right over there
and what we wanna do

00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:10.764
is approximate it with a line around that.

00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:12.296
And what we're essentially going to do

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:13.130
is we're gonna approximate it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.106
with the equation of the tangent line.

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:19.233
The tangent line is
going to look something,

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.933
something like that and as we can see,

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.598
as we get further and further from,

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:26.551
from x equals negative one,

00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:28.571
the approximation gets worse and worse

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:31.348
but if we stay around
x equals negative one,

00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:34.108
what's a decent, it is
a, as good as you can get

00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:38.241
for a linear approximation
or at least in this example

00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:41.533
is a very good linear approximation.

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:44.104
So when people say, hey,
find the linear approximation

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.586
of f around x equals negative one

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:49.589
or they say, what is the following
is the best approximation

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:51.977
and all of your choices are, are lines,

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.712
well essentially, they're
asking you to find

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:57.878
the equation of the tangent
line at x equals negative one.

00:01:57.878 --> 00:01:59.389
So let's do that.

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:02.374
So in order to find the
equation of the tangent line,

00:02:02.374 --> 00:02:06.834
the equation of a line is
y is equal to mx plus b

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:09.820
where m is a slope and
b is the y intercept.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.165
There's other ways that
you could think about it.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.903
You could think about it,
in terms of point slope

00:02:14.903 --> 00:02:18.903
where you could say, y
minus some y that sits on

00:02:20.232 --> 00:02:24.232
that line is equal to
the slope times x minus

00:02:25.547 --> 00:02:29.604
the corresponding x one,
so x one comma y one

00:02:29.604 --> 00:02:31.431
sits on that line some place.

00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:33.585
Actually, I like to write
this point slope form

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:37.752
like this sometimes, y minus
y one over x minus x one

00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:42.094
is equal to b because this comes as

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:42.927
straight out of the idea.

00:02:42.927 --> 00:02:46.573
Look, if x one and y one are on the line,

00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:50.143
the slope between any
other point on the line

00:02:50.143 --> 00:02:54.049
and that point is going to
be your slope of your line.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.825
So we could think about
it, any of these ways.

00:02:56.825 --> 00:02:59.733
So let's first find the
slope of the tangent line

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:02.085
and that's where the derivative is useful.

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:05.525
So f, actually let me
just write f of x again,

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:08.232
so I'm gonna write it as x minus one

00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:10.739
to the negative one power, that makes it

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.358
a little bit clearer that
we can use the power rule

00:03:13.358 --> 00:03:15.225
and a little bit of a chain rule,

00:03:15.225 --> 00:03:19.648
so the derivative of f with
respect to x is equal to,

00:03:19.648 --> 00:03:22.376
so the derivative of x minus
one of the negative one

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:25.569
with respect to x minus one,
well that's just going to be,

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.647
I'm just gonna use the power rule here,

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:32.150
it's gonna be negative
one times x minus one

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.606
to the negative two and then
we're gonna multiply that

00:03:34.606 --> 00:03:39.197
times the derivative of x
minus one with respect to x,

00:03:39.197 --> 00:03:41.166
well that's just going to be one, right.

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:43.197
The derivative of x with
respect of x as one,

00:03:43.197 --> 00:03:45.382
the derivative of negative
one with respect to x as zero,

00:03:45.382 --> 00:03:48.607
so we could say times one here if we like

00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:51.045
or we could just not write that

00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:53.001
'cause it don't change the value.

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:57.915
And so let's evaluate that when
x is equal to negative one.

00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:01.165
So f prime of negative one is equal to,

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.707
I could just write this is, negative,

00:04:05.707 --> 00:04:10.685
all right like this way,
negative one over negative one

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:14.852
minus one squared and so this
is going to be negative two

00:04:16.273 --> 00:04:20.440
down here, so this is equal
to negative, negative 1/4.

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.297
So, the slope of our tangent line is,

00:04:26.297 --> 00:04:31.112
so I could write this way,
m is equal to negative one,

00:04:31.112 --> 00:04:35.279
negative 1/4 and so now,
we just have to write

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.910
its equation down.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.363
So we already know, an x one and a y one

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.262
that sits on the line,
in fact we want to use

00:04:43.262 --> 00:04:45.817
the point when x is equals negative one

00:04:45.817 --> 00:04:50.239
so we know that the
point negative one comma,

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:52.367
we could just input it right over here,

00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:56.132
f of negative one is negative 1/2,

00:04:56.132 --> 00:04:59.204
one over negative one
minus one, negative 1/2.

00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:03.566
So we know that this negative
one comma negative 1/2,

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:06.869
that that is on our curve
and it is on our line,

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:08.488
that's the point at which the tangent

00:05:08.488 --> 00:05:10.813
and the curve actually intersect.

00:05:10.813 --> 00:05:12.752
And so we can use any of these,

00:05:12.752 --> 00:05:15.114
to now write the equation of our line,

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:18.718
we could say, y, under right here,

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:22.635
y minus y one, so minus negative 1/2

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.805
is going to be equal
to, is going to be equal

00:05:28.805 --> 00:05:31.758
to our slope, negative 1/4,

00:05:31.758 --> 00:05:35.550
I'm just using the point's
slope version of our equation,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.550
is equal to our slope times x minus x one,

00:05:41.123 --> 00:05:44.511
so x minus or x squared
that we know sits on this,

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.390
so minus negative one.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.563
And so let me now write all
of this in a neutral color,

00:05:48.563 --> 00:05:52.730
this will be y plus 1/2
is equal to, and I can,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.950
so this is gonna be plus
one right over there,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.138
so I can distribute the negative 1/4.

00:05:59.138 --> 00:06:03.305
So it's negative 1/4 x minus 1/4 minus 1/4

00:06:06.436 --> 00:06:10.080
and then I can subtract
1/2 from both sides

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.723
so I'm gonna get y is
equal to negative 1/4 x

00:06:14.723 --> 00:06:17.213
and then if I already am subtracting 1/4

00:06:17.213 --> 00:06:21.302
and I subtract another half
is gonna be negative 3/4

00:06:21.302 --> 00:06:24.385
so minus three, minus 3/4.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.122
So, and that's actually pretty
close to what I drew up here,

00:06:28.122 --> 00:06:32.289
this should be intersecting
the y-axis at negative 3/4.

00:06:33.657 --> 00:06:36.824
So there you have it, this, this line,

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.797
or you could even say, this equation,

00:06:39.797 --> 00:06:43.399
is going to be a very
good linear approximation,

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.681
about as good as you can get
for a linear approximation

00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:49.848
for that nonlinear function
around x equals negative one.

00:06:50.874 --> 00:06:53.012
You might say, well why
didn't they just ask me

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:55.616
to find the equation of the tangent line

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:57.837
at x equals negative
one, well they could have

00:06:57.837 --> 00:07:00.088
but there's a little bit of
extra cognitive processing here,

00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:02.636
we say, okay, I can
actually use the equation

00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:05.236
of the tangent line at to approximate

00:07:05.236 --> 00:07:09.069
this function around
x equals negative one.
