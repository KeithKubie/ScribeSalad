00:00:01.923 --> 00:00:03.471
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video is

00:00:03.471 --> 00:00:05.997
get some practice adding
multiple digit numbers,

00:00:05.997 --> 00:00:09.065
but the point of it, isn't
just to get the answer,

00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:12.871
but to understand why the
method we use actually works.

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:16.121
So we're going to add 40,762 to 30,473.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.032
And you can pause the video and
try to solve it on your own,

00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:24.714
but I encourage you to watch this one

00:00:24.714 --> 00:00:28.817
because it's really about
understanding how things happen.

00:00:28.817 --> 00:00:30.463
So what I'm going to do is first,

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.156
think of this in terms of place value.

00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:33.983
So let me write out my
place values, let's see,

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:36.351
this goes all the way up
to the ten thousands place.

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:40.518
So let's see ten thousands
and then we have a thousands,

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:45.715
then we have a hundreds--

00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:47.258
I could write these words
out but this is a little bit

00:00:47.258 --> 00:00:48.612
faster to write it this way.

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:51.401
And then we could have a tens place

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:54.560
and then we can have a ones place.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.328
I wanna do that in a different color.

00:00:56.328 --> 00:00:58.749
So then we have a ones place.

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.453
Let me make a table here

00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:02.622
and I'm gonna express
both of these numbers

00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:05.132
in terms of ten thousands, thousands,

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:07.246
hundreds, tens, and ones

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:09.150
and then I'm gonna, at the same time,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.457
use what's sometimes known
as the standard method

00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:13.698
or the standard algorithm.

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:16.784
Algorithm is a fancy word for a system,

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:19.009
a way of doing something.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.104
But let's first represent these numbers.

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:24.311
Here I have four ten thousands.

00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:25.940
One, two, three, four.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.028
Here I have three ten thousands.

00:01:28.028 --> 00:01:29.464
One, two, three,

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.746
I'm gonna add these two
together eventually.

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:33.296
In both of these numbers,

00:01:33.296 --> 00:01:35.129
I have zero thousands,

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.534
so I have nothing in
this column right now.

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:40.777
Here, I have seven hundreds.

00:01:40.777 --> 00:01:43.071
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:45.237
Here I have four hundreds.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.696
One, two, three, four.

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:49.702
Then I go to the tens place,

00:01:49.702 --> 00:01:50.932
here I have six tens.

00:01:50.932 --> 00:01:54.073
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:01:54.073 --> 00:01:56.687
Here I have seven tens.

00:01:56.687 --> 00:01:59.789
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.651
And then last, but not
least, here I have two ones.

00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:04.484
One, two.

00:02:04.484 --> 00:02:06.587
And here I have three ones.

00:02:06.587 --> 00:02:07.920
One, two, three.

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:11.091
Now, let's just rewrite
this number up here,

00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:14.105
this is four ten thousands,

00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:16.741
so this is forty thousand,

00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:19.040
I have zero thousands.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.873
Right over there.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:23.138
And then I have seven hundreths.

00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:25.015
Seven hundreds.

00:02:25.015 --> 00:02:26.348
I have six tens.

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:29.335
Six tens.

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:31.002
And I have two ones.

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:33.861
I'm just rewriting the number,

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:36.371
but let me write the
tens in that blue color.

00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:38.871
So six tens and then two ones.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.369
Having trouble switching colors.

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:44.202
Two ones.

00:02:44.202 --> 00:02:45.358
So there you have it.

00:02:45.358 --> 00:02:47.244
This and this are just different ways of

00:02:47.244 --> 00:02:48.894
representing the same number

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:52.959
and then this down here, I
have three ten thousands,

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.542
and then I have zero thousands,

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.282
I have four hundreds here

00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:03.628
and then I have seven tens,

00:03:05.463 --> 00:03:06.380
seven tens,

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.909
and then I have three ones.

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:14.651
And so now, let's add up everything.

00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:16.721
So I can add it here and then I can also

00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:18.809
add up things right over here.

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.186
So in the standard method,

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:21.945
we would start at the lowest place,

00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:23.848
and we'd say okay, two
ones plus three ones

00:03:23.848 --> 00:03:25.341
is equal to five ones,

00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:28.194
and similarly, two ones
plus three ones would be

00:03:28.194 --> 00:03:31.007
one, two, three, four, five ones.

00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:33.358
Fair enough, nothing fancy there.

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:34.974
Now let's go to the tens place.

00:03:34.974 --> 00:03:38.631
Well, in the tens place we have six tens

00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:41.360
plus seven tens, and
in the standard method

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.039
what you say is, "that's 13 tens,"

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.622
but 13 tens is the same
thing as three tens

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:50.202
and one hundred.

00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:52.750
So what you do is, you would regroup.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.171
You would say, "hey
look, this is three tens

00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:57.376
"and one hundreds."

00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:59.677
Sometimes people say, "Oh
you're carrying the one.

00:03:59.677 --> 00:04:02.209
"Six plus seven is 13, carry the one."

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.621
And it seems somewhat magical,

00:04:03.621 --> 00:04:06.847
but all you're doing is
you're taking ten of the tens

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.875
and you're regrouping it as a hundred.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:10.199
It'll be a little clearer here.

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.199
So we have six tens and
then we have seven tens,

00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:16.862
you add 'em all together,

00:04:16.862 --> 00:04:19.996
you get one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:23.980
eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen tens.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.940
All we're doing right
over is we're saying,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.773
"Look this is equal to a hundred."

00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:35.009
So let's just convert that
into a hundred right over here.

00:04:39.186 --> 00:04:41.875
Let's just convert that
and so what we do is,

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:44.131
we just write the three in the tens place

00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:47.819
and then we add an extra
one in the hundreds place.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.096
And so what are we gonna have
in the hundreds place now?

00:04:50.096 --> 00:04:51.595
And actually, let me do it here

00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:53.104
because it's a little more interesting.

00:04:53.104 --> 00:04:57.236
So I have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:59.982
nine, ten, eleven, twelve hundreds.

00:04:59.982 --> 00:05:01.278
So I can write 'em down here.

00:05:01.278 --> 00:05:04.719
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.219
eleven and twelve,

00:05:07.323 --> 00:05:09.870
but with the same thing,
we don't have a digit for

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.849
the number twelve in our
traditional number system,

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.025
so what I could do is I
could take ten of these

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:19.570
and I can convert is to a thousand.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.079
So I'm gonna take ten of those
and give myself a thousand.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.086
No we're gonna do the
exact same thing over here.

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:28.035
One plus seven plus four is twelve.

00:05:28.035 --> 00:05:29.124
So you'd write--

00:05:29.124 --> 00:05:33.435
That's two hundreds because
this is twelve hundreds,

00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:36.837
that's two hundreds plus a thousand,

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.520
so we just regrouped again.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.722
Now in the thousands place,

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:42.226
one plus zero plus zero is one thousand

00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:44.483
and you see that right over
here, you have one thousand.

00:05:44.483 --> 00:05:47.010
And then finally, in
the ten thousands place,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.110
four ten thousands plus
three ten thousands

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.116
is seven ten thousands.

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.389
Four ten thousands plus
three ten thousands

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.999
is one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven ten thousands.

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.416
And so this number is 71,235.

00:06:05.015 --> 00:06:05.848
71,235.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.957
So hopefully it all makes sense

00:06:09.957 --> 00:06:13.074
how these two things will fit together.

00:06:13.074 --> 00:06:14.746
That what's going on over here--

00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:16.232
You're not just magically carrying numbers

00:06:16.232 --> 00:06:18.632
or magically regrouping,
you're just representing

00:06:18.632 --> 00:06:21.407
the same number in different ways.
