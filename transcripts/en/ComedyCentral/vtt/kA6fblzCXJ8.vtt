00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:04.003
- [Jason] So, Andy
Richter, thank you so much

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.114
for being here for the hour.

00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:06.674
- Thank you for having me.

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:07.657
It was, it was great.

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:08.582
I had a good time.

00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:09.626
- [Jason] Yeah, It's good, right?

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:10.459
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [Jason] It's fun.

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:11.585
It was painless. Painless.

00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:13.366
I expected more pain.
- [Jason] Good.

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.820
- Yeah, I just want to say, uh,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.513
I saw "New York Minute" last week, and uh,

00:00:16.513 --> 00:00:18.231
- [Andy] Oh, here comes the pain.

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:20.003
- Yeah. It's pretty unfunny.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:21.590
- [Andy] (laughs)

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.209
- I mean all, when I say "pretty unfunny,"

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:24.902
I mean really, really unfunny.

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:25.765
- [Jason] What's "New York Minute"?

00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:27.588
- It's a movie I did with the Olsen twins.

00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:29.312
- [Jason] What is it?
- A number of years ago.

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:30.145
- I don't know why (mumbles)

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:31.129
- [Jason] Wait, wait, what's the movie?

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:32.773
- It's called "New York Minute."

00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:35.929
The Olsen twins, it was a feature film

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.161
that they did and, and I was in it.

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:39.401
- I guess it was an artistic choice

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:42.368
to do an Olsen twins movie.

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:43.729
Oh, and also, the Chinese accent you did

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.068
was really offensive.

00:00:45.068 --> 00:00:46.003
- [Jason] Wait, you do
a Chinese accent in it?

00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:47.135
- [Andy] Yeah. I had a...
- [Dennis] Yeah a really

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:48.226
offensive Chinese accent.
- Nah, it wasn't

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:49.059
that offensive.
- Okay, what are you doin'?

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:49.892
What are you doing?
- [Andy] It was

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:50.725
kind of funny.
- What are you doing?

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:51.589
Why are you doing this, why are you,

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:52.422
Why are you doing this?

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:53.255
Don't do this, this is our guest

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:54.290
- I just thought I'd
brought it up, that's all.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.206
- Don't be...

00:00:55.206 --> 00:00:58.457
- Why would a man your, a
man with gray in his beard

00:00:58.457 --> 00:00:59.649
be watching the Olsen twins movie

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.332
just a couple of weeks ago?

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:02.745
- Oh, why would a man your age

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:04.879
be doing the Olsen twins movie?

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.574
- [Andy] No questions but why,
- [Jason] Dennis, stop.

00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:07.640
- [Andy] would that...
- Just stop, okay?

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.514
Dennis, just do the...

00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:11.516
- [Andy] That perv, or some
kind of perv accessory?

00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:12.892
- Andy, I'm really sorry.

00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:13.969
Just do the technical end
- [Andy] It's alright

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:14.802
of the podcast.

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:15.910
Anyway...
- [Dennis] I'm sorry (mumbles)

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.648
- Anyway, Andy, it's been a great hour,

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:19.309
you know Andy and Sarah were, Dennis,

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:21.451
they were up at my house
the other day, and...

00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:22.551
- We had a very nice time.

00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:24.434
- What a beautiful wife, I mean --

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:25.267
- Oh, well thank you.

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:26.100
- She is...

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.128
- I hope she didn't have a
little too much to drink did she?

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:29.091
- She had a little bit to drink.

00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:29.929
- Yeah, yeah she gets a little --

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.117
- She's fun.
- just a little crazy.

00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:33.765
She likes your white wine.

00:01:33.765 --> 00:01:35.052
- [Jason] Yeah, she does.

00:01:35.052 --> 00:01:37.131
- Sometimes, you know,
she gets a little feisty,

00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:39.633
but, you know it's got its upside too,

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:42.516
sometimes it makes her a little frisky.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:43.349
- [Jason] Really?

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:44.367
- Yeah. So I get to, you know,

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.178
I get the benefits of that sometimes.

00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:47.011
The insistence.

00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:48.269
- Like sex? She's sexual?

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:49.231
She's a little...gets horny?

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:52.941
- I, maybe, have been pulled
into a couple of bathrooms

00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:54.502
here and there, um,

00:01:54.502 --> 00:01:56.342
which is really
- Are you serious?

00:01:56.342 --> 00:01:57.525
Like a party?
- [Andy] A joy.

00:01:57.525 --> 00:01:58.449
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:59.373
I...But, that, I...

00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:00.835
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, so Sarah,

00:02:00.835 --> 00:02:02.028
nice Sarah,
- Yes, my wife.

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:02.998
- The wonderful,
- Yes, I...

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.254
- charming Sarah
- Yes, now I, yes, I...

00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:05.297
will go to a party
- Oh, I'm in

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:06.656
so much trouble for saying this.

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:07.489
- And pull you

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:08.322
into the bathroom
- Yes, yes

00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:10.635
- and you'll have sex in the bathroom?

00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:12.682
- I will leave it up to your imagination

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:14.000
as to what we do, but...

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.439
- I love, I mean I just, I
love her so much more now

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.132
Oh God, I thought...
- Well, don't love her

00:02:19.132 --> 00:02:19.965
too much.

00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.452
- I thought I loved her a lot
- Yeah

00:02:21.452 --> 00:02:23.893
- And now, she's like a ten in my book

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:25.047
- Great. Okay.

00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:25.880
- [Dennis] Shit
- [Jason] Sarah!

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.611
- [Dennis] Fuck!

00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:28.444
Fuck!

00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:29.277
- What?

00:02:29.277 --> 00:02:30.715
- Shit! It's gone.

00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:31.548
Fuck!

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.195
Oh, no no no don't crash!

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:36.505
It crashed!

00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:37.992
Fuck! Fuck!

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:38.994
Fuck it crashed!

00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:40.106
It's gone!

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:41.170
Everything we just did!
- [Jason] Alright,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.181
alright, so take it easy

00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:43.909
- You fucking take it easy!

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.763
You fucking take it easy!

00:02:45.763 --> 00:02:47.219
- [Jason] What is? Calm down!
- Right, take it easy?

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.052
- It's gone!

00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:48.892
- [Jason] Stop yelling.
- Fuck, man!

00:02:48.892 --> 00:02:49.854
Fuck!

00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:50.687
Who? Fuck!

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:52.106
- Dennis, will you stop,
will you calm down?

00:02:52.106 --> 00:02:54.052
- Shit! You don't even
know what I'm doing!

00:02:54.052 --> 00:02:55.775
You don't even know what crash means!

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.180
You don't even give a shit
- [Jason] Yeah I do know what,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.250
I know what crash means.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.499
- Neither does this fucking asshole.

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.720
Jesus Christ, it's fucking gone.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.111
- [Dennis] No fucking way, fuck!

00:03:07.111 --> 00:03:09.316
- Is, is he okay?

00:03:09.316 --> 00:03:10.149
- Oh, yeah.

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.482
He, uh, he flips out
every once in a while.

00:03:12.482 --> 00:03:13.565
- Yeah, yeah.

00:03:14.717 --> 00:03:16.053
He might need some help.

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:19.566
- He's actually really
good technically, so...

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.942
- I wanted to ask you before I go

00:03:21.942 --> 00:03:25.257
it's totally my fault, I brought it up,

00:03:25.257 --> 00:03:27.085
but could you please cut out the part

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:30.404
where I talk about the,
my wife and the drinking

00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:31.237
and the sex, and the...

00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:34.135
I should not have
brought it up, I'm sorry.

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:37.248
But I do not want that on the
podcast, if that's possible.

00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:38.821
- I totally understand, of course

00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:42.972
and you know what, the
whole episode is lost, so...

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:46.375
- Oh, so he wasn't able to get it...

00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:47.391
He was...

00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:48.474
- No, no.

00:03:48.474 --> 00:03:49.401
- It's gone.

00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:50.780
- Yeah, so I don't even
have to cut anything out

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.884
cause nothing, nothing is going out.

00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:57.051
- So this is all been a waste
of everyone's time, then.

00:03:58.551 --> 00:03:59.445
- Yeah.

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:02.221
- Wow. That, that is, a drag.

00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:03.059
That is a real...

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:04.726
- Yeah, I know, I...

00:04:06.151 --> 00:04:07.395
And I would say, let's go back in

00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:08.405
and do it again,
- No, no no, I, no

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:09.856
I can't, I can't
- Yeah, of course.

00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:11.727
I, I get it.
- Alright, well...

00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:13.278
Thanks.

00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:14.445
See you later.

00:04:17.253 --> 00:04:19.739
- See, see you later, Andy!

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.406
(upbeat music)
