00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.735
My opponent tonight is writer
and columnist Lauren Duca.

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:04.470
Here's what you need to know.

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:07.673
Her Teen Vogue magazine column
is called "Thigh-High Politics."

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:10.510
Personally, I find ankle-high
politics much more flattering

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.879
-for my body type.
-(laughter)

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.516
She wrote the article "Donald
Trump Is gaslighting America.”

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.750
Or did she?

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:20.119
Maybe you're just
remembering it wrong.

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:23.689
She won the National Arts &amp;
Entertainment Journalism Award

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:27.427
-in 2015, so I guess...
-(whooping, cheering)

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.530
I guess there is an award show
I hate more than the Oscars.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.331
-(laughter)
-Lauren Duca, everybody.

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.700
-Hi. -Lauren Duca, welcome.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.003
-Thank you.
-Welcome. So, Lauren, this is...

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.038
-This is our final show of 2017.
-Yeah.

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.307
I'm looking back on 2017,
and for me,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.077
the big story of the year,
it's the year of The Donald.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.179
Yeah, I think it's the reaction
 to The Donald

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.413
is the story of the year.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.515
But either way, it's still
the year of The Donald.

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:51.417
-I can see that point.
-You see...

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.319
-Hey, so I already won.
-(laughter)

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:54.921
Boom. Can we...
can we wrap this up?

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.355
No? We have to keep going.
Okay.

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:58.658
-You think it's the reaction
to Donald Trump, yes? -Yeah.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.394
I-I think that there's people
who are engaged, informed

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.296
in ways they were never before,
and then,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.831
that reaction is significant,

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.899
and it's kind of redemocratizing
the country.

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:09.168
Redemocratizing?

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.037
I think so. I think
that people are excited.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.573
They're... they are making sure
they know what's going on.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.641
They're-they're in touch
with their elected officials.

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:17.176
They are voting for sure.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.945
Definitely that's what we saw
in Alabama.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.214
Now, you wrote an article
that was entitled,

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.182
"The Gaslighting of America."

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:25.551
-"How Trump was Gaslighting
America." -Yeah.

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:27.954
Uh, first of all,
how do you get a big gaslight?

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.956
'Cause it sounds like
a great way of effectively...

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.991
-(laughter) -But what do you see
Donald Trump doing?

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.159
What did you see happen

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:34.427
-over the course of this year?
-Uh, yeah.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.529
I think that everything
that I was concerned about

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:39.232
when I wrote that article
has gotten so much worse. Uh,

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.667
it seems kind of quaint,
almost, in retrospect.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.903
I think at one point,
I had said, uh, "He's...

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.738
"He begins
to undermine the press."

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.640
And I think now he's just like,
"Eat (bleep),

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:50.176
-New York Times!" every day.
-(laughter)

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.079
So, the-the undermining
has definitely escalated.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.314
-Um...
-He's ove... he's over-minding.

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:57.550
(Duca mumbles, laughs)

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:00.553
Right. Um, so,
gaslighting is a technique

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:03.756
where, uh, the victim is made
to doubt their own sanity.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.057
-And...
-No, it's not!

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.527
(Duca laughs,
audience laughs)

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.195
Fair point. Fair point.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:11.430
Okay. It's not.
It's not, Lauren. It's not.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:14.634
And that's, um, what I think
that Donald Trump was doing

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.636
during his campaign,
and continues to do

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.804
to the American electorate,
where is making us doubt

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:20.206
whether anything is true.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.109
And it kind of robs us
of a foundation of truth,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.578
which is the only way
that he can be held accountable,

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.813
is if we're resisting
from a foundation of information

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:29.815
of facts over feelings.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.784
(cheering, applause)

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:36.656
I won't accept somebody else's
foundation of truth.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.891
I like to build
my own foundation.

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:42.261
-(laughter) -Now,
something I'm impressed by,

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:45.898
-you engaged with a spat
with Tucker Carlson, -Yeah.

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.701
but you're consistently
donating in his name

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.304
-to Planned Parenthood, which,
first of all, -(laughter)

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:54.907
-I think it's...
-(whooping, cheering, applause)

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.577
I think it's great that
you're giving back to Tucker.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.946
I think Planned Parenthood,
though, is the wrong choice.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.215
That guy can't be
into that at all.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.016 line:0%
-(laughter)
-Uh, we've actually...

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.851 line:0%
we've raised over $10,000,

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:08.187 line:0%
that we're donating
in Tucker Carlson's name.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.090
-(cheering, applause)
-Um, and I... I'm almost certain

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:12.725
that it pisses him off.

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.026
-(laughter)
-What?

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.696
That guy seems
very even-keel, right?

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.031
You can tell
by his constantly judging face

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:20.466
that he's totally fine.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.668
Here's another article
looking back on 2017

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:24.337
that I found was interesting.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.206
"Sexual misconduct has
no political ideology."

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.042
Except that it's Democratic.

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.378
-(laughter) -Right?
Isn't this a Democrat's problem?

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.380
You know, I think that,
uh, Democrats

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:37.016
have certainly been willing
to engage with the problem

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.986
in a particular way, where they
are not making compromises.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.855
Al Franken stepped down.
John Conyers stepped down.

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:45.691
There's a total lack
of accountability on the right

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:47.293
that is really troubling,

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.462
but I think we're seeing
a bigger shift

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:52.198
in refusing to accept
undermining integrating women

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.233
across all different
spheres of power,

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:56.535
and elected officials
should be held accountable

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:59.338
-first and foremost. -Yeah.
Do you... -(cheering, applause)

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:00.973
You're looking
for accountability.

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.109
Do you fear that we,
though, are...

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:05.378
we're-we're comparing
people like Al Franken

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.880
to people like Harvey Weinstein
and that's dangerous territory?

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:10.349 line:0%
You know, I think that we have
to be nuanced about it,

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:12.618 line:0%
and we have to be willing
to get into the weeds

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.754 line:0%
with context and judge
each individual situation,

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:17.823 line:0%
but we need to start with
a position of believing women,

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:20.493 line:0%
because the reality
of false accusations is a myth,

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.962 line:0%
uh, that is such
a small percentage of things,

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:25.731 line:0%
and women coming forward
see their lives destroyed,

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:28.734 line:0%
see their-their... entire selves
held up to scrutiny.

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:31.237
It's... the cost of coming
forward is just so high,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.106
and the benefits are so low,
and I think as a society

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.609
we need step one to be
being willing to look

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:39.578
at what women are saying,
and go through the due process,

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.780
um, that is necessary.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.348
And in the context of Trump,

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:44.684
that means
an ethics investigation.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.620
(cheering, whooping, applause)

00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:52.091
Throw another investigation
on the barbecue.

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:53.826
That thing is getting full.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.162
Laura Duca, tell me something
I already know.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:58.230
Um, Tucker Carlson
is what happens

00:04:58.263 --> 00:04:59.865
when you leave
William F. Buckley

00:04:59.898 --> 00:05:01.934
in the microwave for too long.

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:03.903
(laughter, whooping)

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.671
-Thanks for the recipe.
-(laughter)

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:07.673
Laura Duca--
her Teen Vogue column

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:09.675
is called "Thigh-High Politics."

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:10.209
The fight continues.

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:13.946
Opposers, are there any three
words more exciting than

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.515
"Click and subscribe"?

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:18.284
Yes, Hillary shot Lincoln

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:22.088
Subscribe now and find out the
truth THEY don't want you to
know

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:27.794
And by "they", I mean losers
looking for youtube handouts
without clicking "Subscribe". Do
it.
