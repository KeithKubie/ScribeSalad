00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.520
I was very good friends with Nino Scalia,
as I called him, not despite the fact that

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.750
we had very strong disagreements on issues
that were of fundamental importance to both

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.010
of us, but because of that fact, because of
those disagreements we were invited to debate

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.210
each other in various forums all over the
world.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.840
And as is true for any two thinking people
there are some deeply important issues where

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.620
we strongly disagree, but also some issues
that are deeply important to both of us where

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.230
we strongly agree.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:01:01.050
And both our mutual respect and liking arose
from the exchange of ideas in a respectful

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.789
manner, the open listening and grappling with
each other's ideas and doing it for an audience.

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:19.030
As a teacher and an advocate, I am so grateful
for Justice Scalia's generosity in speaking

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.679
before all kinds of audiences.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:28.740
The mutual respect, I think, is evidenced
in the fact that we were doing those kinds

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.020
of events.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.549
I would have liked him just for the fact that
he was engaging in that process of exchanging

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:44.210
ideas and he would often do it in audiences
that you could expect to be hostile to him,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.700
right, not just preaching to the choir.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.340
I think the most dramatic example was he agreed
to do one of these exchanges with me at an

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.750
ACLU National Membership Conference.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.819
It's really sad that people seem to think
that if you disagree with somebody on some

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.679
issues you can't be mutually respectful, you
can't enjoy each other's company, you can't

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.200
learn from each other and grow in yourself.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.330
Because I have found that having friendships
and collegial relationships with people with

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.920
whom I strongly disagree has been not only
advantageous to advancing causes and concerns

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.710
that are deeply important to me, but also
have just been so enjoyable on a personal

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.710
and human level and have really enriched my
life.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.450
So, for example, I care very deeply about
education.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.930
I think I'm a much more effective educator
when I teach students or speak before students

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.340
in the context of an exchange with somebody
else who has different ideas.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.970
I think that deepens the student's understanding
of the multiple perspectives that are plausible

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.240
on particular issues and enriches their own
analysis and their own understanding.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:22.540
Working with the ACLU, which has always been
a staunchly non-partisan organization by definition,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.270
through our own corporate charter never oppose
or endorse any candidate, official, party

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:39.070
or organization, rather we will criticize
or praise every individual or every group

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.680
on an issue by issue basis.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.690
And once you do that you have to acknowledge
that there is nobody with whom you do not

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.790
strongly agree on at least some important
issues, no matter how strongly you may disagree

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.400
on other important issues.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.069
And in terms of advancing your causes, if
you can work together collaboratively with

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.270
somebody who you agree with on a particular
issue you should do that regardless of whether

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.280
you disagree with them on another issue.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.769
It's going to make it easier and more likely
that you are going to succeed in your jointly

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.960
shared cause -- but also on a human level
it's just fun and interesting to get to know

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.140
and spend time with and learn from people
who have different ideas.
