00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.340
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Hi.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.640
My name is Todd Harvey.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.280
I am a curator at the
American Folklife Center

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.850
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.710
I'd like to welcome you
to the latest presentation

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.370
in our ongoing Benjamin
Botkin lecture series,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.500
and this is what we call
an open mic session.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.040 position:56%
So it's a slightly different format.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.160
The Botkin Series allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.000
of leading scholars in the
disciplines of folklore

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.330
at the musicology, oral history,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.680
and cultural heritage while
enhancing the collections here

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.840
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.440
For the center and the library,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.290
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.100
of our acquisitions activities.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.520
Each lecture is videotaped
and becomes part

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.490
of the permanent collections
of the center.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.850
In addition, the lectures
are later posted as webcasts

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.970
on the library's website where
they're available for viewing

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.480
to Internet patrons
throughout the world.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.440
So, now would be a good time to
turn off your devices if you wish.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.450
Today I have the honor of
introducing Jayme Stone

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.810
who with his band, just
gave an amazing concert

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.860
in the Coolidge Auditorium and
if you're looking at the webcast,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.140
I think you need to go back
and look at the concert first,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.580
because what I'm going to try to
do today is to bring some context

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.610
to that, to that event and to
help us and you all, you know,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.290
I'm working on behalf
of you in the audience

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.450 position:56%
to better understand what it's like
to be a touring [inaudible] musician

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.310
at this point in time, and also,
to better understand to style

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.900
that Jayme's bringing to
Library of Congress materials.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.560
So, I just want to
say thank you Jayme.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.220
That was a really amazing
performance.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.520
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Thank you.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.520
I mean, it is such an
incredible honor to be

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.460
in this building always,
but especially to play.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.730
I mean, I could you know like
you know, I've spent some time

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.220
down in the basement and
I could feel it you know,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.140
there's that old saying you know
like we stand on the shoulders

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.600
of our elders and I felt that
quite literally, and you know,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.850
on stage with an incredible history

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.130
of music here that's informed
this project in so many ways, so.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.150
Yeah, it's definitely an honor.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.170
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Yeah, how did you
feel about the performance today?

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.470
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: It felt amazing.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.210
Yeah. It was really nice.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.790
You know, knowing you
know in the same vain

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.670
that you know the same space
that Alan Lomax recorded

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.210
"Jelly Roll Morton" and
you know the Josh White

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.430
and Golden Gate Quartet
record was made there.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.340
So, it you know, it felt like
there was some history there

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.670
and also it's a point
in time in this project

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.160
where you know having been doing
this for the last about 5 years

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.340
or so, feels like the band
this season there's like a kind

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.540
of family-like chemistry.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.140
I feel really, really proud of
this new record and the work

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.290
that we're doing and we're a little
bit like in that phase of touring

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.320
where we're kind of on fire because
we've been playing every night,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.760
so it's kind of nice to be in
that particular phase and then get

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.300
to do you know a concert like this.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.920
Yeah, it felt really good.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.030
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Well, yeah if I
could think of one word to sum it

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.980
up it was a "tight" performance
no doubt, and I'm just wondering,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.800
where do you find musicians
like that?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.950
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Well, Toronto,
Vermont, and Nashville precisely.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.600
And people often ask
us that, you know,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.150
how in the world do you find
them and where did you meet them?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.430
How do you rehearse and all
these, you know, questions spin

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.370
when we're hear where we're
from and it's really a testament

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.700
to these particular musicians.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.540
All of whom I know
in different ways,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.700
essentially through the very
tightknit group of, you know,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.080
folk musicians who you know I
like people that have a foot

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.020
in the traditional camp, but
are also experienced doing a lot

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.310
of other music and have really
a wide ranging sensibilities

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.390
because that's what it takes

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.060
to you know treat the
material in the way that we do.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.040
So, Moira Smiley, I was
given a record of hers

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.200
by a mutual friend probably
like more than 15 years ago,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.270
and she in turn had heard
my music and when my wife

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.890
and I were getting married
we were trying to think

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.810
of like the absolute
perfect music and, of course,

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.060
it had to be just so, you know, and
I wanted it to be so many things

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.560
and she was somebody
that I was like,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.860
okay we should get Moira Smiley.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.160
I had never met her.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.210
And so we looked on her
tour schedule and low

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.540
and behold she was
finishing a tour in Boulder

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.550
where I lived the day
before our wedding.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.480 position:56%
So it was a kind of serendipitous
meeting and we met on my wedding day

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.780
and we've been friends ever since,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.070
and then when I first started
gathering together people for the,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.530
you know, collaborator of the Lomax
Project, she was one of the first

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.950
that I thought of and we've
been playing music ever since

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.370
and Joe Phillips the bass
player, we've been playing

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.440 position:56%
for almost 10 years together and
then we've done everything from work

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.050 position:56%
with symphonies and chamber
ensembles, to playing you know music

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.560 position:56%
from around the world and doing folk
traditions and so all of that is

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.700
in his playing and in our history.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.620
And Sumaia Jackson is the person
who is newest to this group

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.630 position:56%
and she's been doing all the touring
for the last 2 years and she was

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.930
at the Berkeley College of Music
in the American Roots Program.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:09.340
That's an incredibly vibrant, very
forward thinking you know folk

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.540
and roots music kind
of breeding ground.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.390
And I actually called up all
of my friends there and faculty

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.690
and I said, you know, I'm looking

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.750
for a fiddler you know who's the
perfect person for this project,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.750
and they all without
having spoken before,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.750
they all said Sumaia Jackson,
so, but that's them you know.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.490
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: It's
really an exciting group,

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.170
and you mentioned being on tour;

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.450
I saw on your schedule you got
a tour next week every night

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.660
in California or something
like that, is this,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.930
you've been touring
with this recording?

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah, yeah the new
record officially came out in April,

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.030
but we had them at the
beginning of the year and usually

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.410
as the record cycle goes, you know,
when a new album comes out we sort

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:08.030
of try and trapes, zigzag
around as much as we can.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.870
So, you know, I have a family.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:18.270
I've got 2 young kids, 3 and 7 so I
can't go out for really long tours.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.560
So, you know, we're out
for something like a week

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.610
to 2 weeks a month which is a good
amount in the first, you know,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.270
6 or 9 months of a record being out

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.270
and then it can pare
down a little bit.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:36.460
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: I took the
opportunity to look at some

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.000
of the videos that you made
with the Lomax Project and I,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.780
this is kind of a second phase
to that and one of the comments

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.260
that musicians in that band
made over and over again was

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.970
that it was a joy to work with you
because you are a good band leader,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.270
and I think that's worth
exploring a little bit.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.680
What makes a good band leader?

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.980
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: That's
a good question.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.620
I've done it for a longtime.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.020 position:56%
I think, you know, I started playing
banjo 22 years ago and very soon

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.790
after knew that I wanted
to play the banjo in a way

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.270
that didn't particularly exist,
and I wanted to make music

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:21.960
that combined things that were you
know not typically found together.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.270
So, it was clear that I
wasn't going to get a call.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.920
Like no one was going to say,
you know, come play bowed banjo

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.580
on my record or you know we
have this idea for a project

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.390
of West African music or, you know,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.810
we want a chambers
symphony with banjo.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.840
You know, so if I was
going to do the things

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.670
that you know were lighting up in
head I would have to create it.

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.540
And so I had been thinking for
a longtime how to cultivate

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.630
and create a context you know for
the things that I wanted to do

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.990
and that really involves
people and working with people,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.290
and I love collaborating.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.840
And, you know, what comes
to mind is actually a,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.570
there's a beautiful movie
that Wim Wenders made

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.240
about Pina Bausch;
have you seen this?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.050
She's an amazing choreographer and
she worked with the same company,

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.350
of course, people came in that,
but for many, many, many years

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:21.550
and she had this process where
she would essentially present

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.800
like prompts.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.440 position:56%
You know, she would say like you
know what does it, what does it look

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.940
like in your arms to you know be
a cactus or something like that?

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.940
Or things you know
related to whatever;

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.210
theme that she was beginning to
cultivate for a certain piece

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:42.310
of choreography and they
would move how, you know,

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.100
they felt like naturally
you know from that

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.640
and then she would make notes
or later photograph and film

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.250
and she would curate you know
their own personal language

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.450 position:56%
and she had the big umbrella vision.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.750
You know, and she was
the choreographer

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.040
but she really used their
voices or their bodies in a way.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.710
And I remember being really
moved when I saw that film,

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.330
because it was something
I'd been trying to do

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.430
but maybe a little bit shyly
because I felt like, you know,

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.490
maybe I needed to be more
of a capital C composer

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.260 position:56%
and you know write out all the parts
and you know and I've done some

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.530
of that, but what I find most
satisfying is to really find people

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:26.130
that have a singular way of
playing and that I resonate with

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.950
and create a process by which
they can really be themselves

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.370
and then I can kind of
go back in and figure

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.730
out like what works
together and shape it,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.650
so I think of myself almost
as the curator of the music

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.750
or the arrangements
rather than sort of coming

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.090
in with a big monolithic decision.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.490
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: So that
must necessitate a lot

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.540
of rehearsal time upfront,
is that true?

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.840
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: That's true.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.340 position:56%
I've also been working with people
I've known for a while, so you know,

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.650
you know musicians who are
steeped in all the things

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.460
that these musicians are you
know where they're improvisers

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.730
and they know traditional music and
they; we share a lot of references.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.660
You know, I can say like oh yeah
you know we want this thing that's

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.080
like a Bobby McFerrin
circle song, you know.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.890
And that can be like right, you
know, and when you work with people

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.490
that are cut from the same cloth or
you know you have a history with,

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.640
there's this shared language
and you'd be astonished

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.050
at how quick the process can be you
know with really great musicians.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.100
And then there's the secondary
process where you then hone

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.740
and you know things get seasoned,

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:42.380
but a lot of times you know I've
become a bigger believer in like a,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.720
you know, first thought/best
thought sometimes.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.220
You know, like that arrangement
of "Old Paint" kind of came to,

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.060
it was the first thing that
we ever did with Tim O'Brien,

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.940
and Moira Smiley, and Margaret
Glaspy, and Greg Garrison.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.130
And Margaret had brought in,

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.940
well actually there's this
really curious Lomax recording

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:05.760
where he's interviewing Vera Hall,
you know, from Livingston, Alabama

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.800
and he actually start, she
was such an phenomenal singer

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.440
that he started testing her to see

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.860
if she could back whatever
melodies you know he played her

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.160
or sang to her.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.960
And so he actually played her a
recording of "Goodbye Old Paint"

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.080 position:56%
which was not in repertoire, not a
song she did and she hummed it back,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.070
you know and of course, like all
you know amazing musicians couldn't

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.440
help, but you know it
came out sounding like her

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.730
and it was actually that,

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.390
that little snippet for
25 seconds no words.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:42.000
She just hummed the melody that
Margaret Glaspy used to kind

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.750 position:56%
of rework the verse; she brought
that in and it just sort of happened

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.950 position:56%
and around you know, I said well you
know, we can't leave out the chorus

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.560
in the whole part of the story
and so I wrote, you know,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.160
the chords for this and then Tim
O'Brien kind of quickly pulled

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.840
out some songbook sand
got online and we sort

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.160
of collage together lyrics
from different places;

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.880
oh like that verse, I
don't like that verse

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.340
and then we just played it a
bunch and it just kind of happened

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.310
in a way out of thin air, you
know, just this community spirit

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.740
and that's, that's you know kind

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.620
of often times I think
where the magic happens.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.700
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: I am curious
as I ask about rehearsal time,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.110
about the mechanics of putting
out a record, touring it,

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.470 position:56%
getting the musicians in the same
city at that same time and I noticed

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:40.300
that you, you do a little
bit of coaching right?

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.080
Some, is, can you tease that
out a little bit for us?

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:51.190
What are the economics like and how
can I become a touring musician?

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.580
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Exactly.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:59.850
Well, yeah the margins are slim.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:04.360
You know, I have been you know
existing, orbiting in a world

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.570
of you know folk and
world music and people

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.710
that are you know making the music
that they really want to make,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:18.490
you know, and following artistic
rather than popular choices.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.390
I mean, I made instrumental
music only for a good longtime.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.690
This is actually the first project

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.100
that has singing in
it for the most part.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.820
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: And
you're singing as well.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.830
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: And I'm singing
yeah that's a whole new thing,

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:34.270 position:56%
but so anyway yeah the margins are
slim and you know that word you used

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.300
"organized" is really what's it's
all about and if I have a skill

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.380
as a band leader that's
a big part of it.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.800 position:56%
It's being very, very, very organize
especially when you're dealing

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.050
with busy musicians that are all
involved in lots or projects,

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.180
Cheryl was in orchestra for years.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.120
Moira you know sings in 3 bands
and has her own solo career

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:59.810
and is a composer, and so you
know doing; I do my own booking

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.110
which is somewhat unusual.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:04.460
I'm self-managed and do my own
booking and which is common

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.450 position:56%
at a certain like grassrootsy level,
but you know for doing the kind

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.550
of stuff that we're doing these
days it's a little unusual.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:17.030 position:56%
So I have to be really organized
also just to maintain some semblance

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.750
of balance having a creative
life, you know, actually feeling

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.200
like I'm a musician and I'm
not just kind of sitting

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.540
at a computer sending emails
and having a family and all

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.130
of these things, so I you know
you can ask people that know me.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.470
I don't usually waste a second.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.430
You know, if there's like 3 minutes

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.590
between something I'll
just get something done,

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:45.300
and so yeah being organized.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.350
I plan really far in advance
and that tends to be the way

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.500
to work with great musicians.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.350
You know, because you can't
call up an amazing musician

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.760
and say I have a gig at the Library

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.090
of Congress next week,
are you available?

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.390
Because they're not.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:03.290
But if you do it a year ahead or
longer, then it works out so, yeah.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.800
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: And how does your
record label figure into this?

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.890
Are they helpful in
terms of booking and?

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.910
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah, they
don't do any booking stuff.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:15.310
I'm currently with Borealis Records
who put out the Lomax Project

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:16.670
and this new Folklife record.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.560
I released 6 records
independently before that.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.570
So I'm used to just like
roll-up your sleeves, you know,

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.240
do it all yourself kind of mode.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.050
So, I often am like steering
the ship, they're very helpful

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.530
and I have a nice little team,
but I'm often the one coming

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.320
in with ideas and energy,
but it's very nice these days

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.360
to have a support network and
they're a Canadian company

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.420
so they also have access
to some grants

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:54.760
which make the financial picture
really nice, because these days,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.550
as people are streaming music
from out in the so-called Cloud

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.930
where musicians are paid
practically nothing;

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:09.170
the economics of making beautiful
records with 60-page liner notes

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.230
and multiple visits to the
Library of Congress for research

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:18.740
and you know it becomes rather
difficult and so you know,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.430
part of the, part of the feat.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:26.260
In a way, I actually feel like
you mentioned the coaching work

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.560
that I do.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.860
I've been developing slowly

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:34.240
but surely an online course called
Compose Your Career to offer tools

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.890
for musicians, independent
musicians to kind of learn how

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:44.630
to make it work and, you
know, one of the things

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.230
for me is I actually
feel like your career is

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.980
like the ultimate improvisation,
because the stakes are high.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.210
You know, I mean especially
as you get older

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.520 position:56%
and if you're supporting a family
or like, you know, paying a mortgage

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.420
or whatever, and like on stage you
know you can reach for some idea

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.720
that you're hearing in your head

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.430
and if it doesn't work
out like it's gone.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:10.180
I mean, maybe someone will
replay it on video, but you know,

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.730
nobody's going to get hurt,
you know, no one's going

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.990
to starve if you hit a wrong note.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.000
But with your career it's like
it's a real thing to figure

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.510
out in the actual world which is
constantly changing and, you know,

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.580
the technology is changing,
and the medians are changing,

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.760
the whole business model and
what people like and don't like

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.170
and so it's a, it's quite,
quite a ship to steer.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:36.220
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: So touring
is an important part of that

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.450
because of it's a paycheck, I mean?

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.750
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:47.110
And also you know, people love
to hear, experience live music

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:52.870
and as much as music has become
commodified in many ways,

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:57.670
in ways that I don't think
benefit artists many a time,

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.220
it's actually touring where
you're there in a room, alive,

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:06.020
making music there's something
very compelling and I think more

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.530
than ever these days, you know,
statistics seem to be continuing

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.290
to show that you know people
want to go see live music.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.070
And so I'm thankful for
that and also that's,

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.740
that's where the whole
thing you know really,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.450
that's where the magic happens.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:25.150
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: I wonder who would
you think are your peers in terms

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.310
of folks doing the
same kinds of things?

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.060
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.620
Well, you know, many,
many of my friends.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.780 position:56%
You hundreds if not maybe a thousand
people that I know that are,

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.160
you know, out there doing this.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.350
I mean people that I look up to
are like you know, Rhiannon Giddens

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:50.100
and Dom Flemons from the Carolina
Chocolate Drops who are, you know,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.770
very successful making music that
I think is really important and,

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.810
yeah I can think of a lot of people
and I actually feel really blessed.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:04.690
You know, I usually go to this
music conference called APAP,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.880
and the Arts Presenter's Conference
in New York every January,

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.500
and I was there for a week,
a little longer than usual

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.100
and I only had one performance
and I got to spend a lot

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.040
of time just having informal
sessions making music with people.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.600 position:56%
I went out and saw music every
night and there was this incredible,

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.410
you know, hang after every show
where friends and you know heroes

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.740
of mine, you know,
were all just there.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.100
You know, I went to go see Sam
Amidon who I'm a really big fan

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:41.210
of who does similar such work,
you know, bringing his own kind

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:46.420
of like indie pop production
sensibility to old folks songs

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.490
that he grew up with
in Vermont and heard

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.320
on field recordings
and that kind of thing.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.380
And after, you know, the audience
was half like my favorite musicians

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.470
around New York and elsewhere and
there was this just amazing energy,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.220
because it's like wow
these are our people,

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.510
like everybody's a little
bit crazy to be doing this

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:09.120
and also these are the people that
are actually doing it, you know.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.320
And it's a, I feel very grateful
that I get to do it and that I get

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:22.600 position:56%
to know people that are somehow able
to make this whole crazy thing work.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.900
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Yeah.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:32.060 position:56%
So, I am counting maybe 7 recordings
under your name going back

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:37.620
to a decade or so which is a pretty
good clip, and I think I recall

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.870
when we first met you
were working on a thing

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.770
with the Boulder Symphony.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:51.240
I wonder if that was "Other Side
of the Air" which was 2013-2014?

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.540
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.840
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Kind of recording?

00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:00.450
What I'm interested in is how
your style has changed over time

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:06.110
or how the product has
changed and ultimately,

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.410
of course, where it's going?

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.320
But if we could go back
to that and contrast it

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.070
with the Lomax collection,
what was that recording

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.740
like "Other Side of the Air?

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.390
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah, so
that was a record I made much

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.910
of which were my own
original compositions

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:26.620
which is largely what I had done
before, although very influenced

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.150
by field recordings from
other places in the world.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.610
So there's the first piece on that
record is called "Radio Wassoulou"

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:39.780
and I made a record called "African
Appalachia" in 2008 after traveling

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:44.700
to Mali and I made a bunch of
recordings as I traveled around

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.710
and kind of continued to use
those as a touchstone and so even

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:53.850
on that album there was 2 very
West African inspired pieces.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.580
There's also a piece on there
called the "The Cinnamon Route"

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.520
that has influences from, you
know, North African music,

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.330
and Indian music, and Persian
music, and so I'm sort of pulling

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:12.110 position:56%
in threads of music that I love and
listen to into my own original music

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:17.770
and then around the time I
was working on that, you know,

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.000 position:56%
body of pieces a dear friend of mine
Andrew Downing who lives in Toronto

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.510
who is a fantastic composer
got asked to write a piece

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.630
for an orchestra that had a folk
element and so he just called me

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.780
and said, I want to write you
a banjo concerto, you game?

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.750
And I of course said yes.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.920
So, we were trying to find
a home and you know things

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.980
in the classical world are you
know can take years before you can

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.910
actually get an orchestra to record
a piece and I was too impatient

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.330
and so I just said, well I'll
just put it on this other side

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.470
of this air record and then
with the Chamber Symphony there,

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.770
I decided that I would try and
score for the first time a bunch

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.930
of my own compositions
for Chamber ensemble,

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.330
and I felt completely
out of my depth.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:09.040
And I remember, I remember actually
being in a hotel room in Rochester,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.510
New York after playing at
Rochester Jazz Festival

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.030
and pulling open the music
notation software called Sibelius

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.620
with 17 empty staves and I'm,
you know, I'm a banjo player.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.810
I can read music, but
very slowly and not well

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.020
and mostly everything's
by ear in my world.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.990
And I was just like, and
I called my friend Andrew,

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.230
I'm like I really don't
think I can do this.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.100
And he's like you can do
it just one note at a time.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.400
And that was that.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.050
I just sat there and I just
started writing, you know,

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.630
filling up the space in a
totally different kind of way

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.750
than the music that I usually made.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.230
Anyway, this is getting longwinded,

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.180
but that record was what was
happening you know I was touring

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.960
actually when we started
the Lomax Project,

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.680
and in terms of connecting them
you know there's a thread that runs

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.850 position:56%
through all of my work of taking old
recording and kind of finding a way

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:05.700
to make them newer using them,
you know, in the creative

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:11.610
and collaborative process,
and I had read

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.890
that John Szwed's amazing
biography, of "Alan Lomax;

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.580
The Man Who Recorded the World."

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.360
And of course I had been listening
to Lomax recordings for 22 years,

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.620
you know, since if first
started playing banjo and sort

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.790
of put those things together
like what would happen

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:29.090 position:56%
if I took this kind of collaborative
process that I've honed in this way

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:33.240
of working with old recordings,
but then come full circle back

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.730
to you know the folk music that
I've always loved and played,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.370
but have somewhat shied
away from on recording?

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:46.270
And so those were sort of the
ideas that seeded the project.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.730
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Is there any way
to tease out certain aspects of,

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:54.280
I mean you were talking
about your music, your style

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.030
and how would you describe
your style

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.000
and who may have influenced it?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.280
I mean, when hear it
I'm thinking maybe

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:08.020
like John Zorn or Bill Frisell.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.320
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: You got it.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.620
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Really?

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.920
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Oh yeah.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.880
John sort of less so, but
I you know I saw John Zorn

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.800
with his Masada Project in New
York probably 15 years ago.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.820
And Bill Frisell was a
really big influence.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.950
In fact, Bill Frisell was a
big influence like musically

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:28.440
and in terms of like looking
up to someone who had a career

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.970 position:56%
that I thought was really happening.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:36.900
Like, when I got into
Bill Frisell he was making

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.530
like a record a year solid;
a record a year and every one

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:44.120
of them you know, there was
"The Intercontinentals",

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.020
and "The Willies", and
the "East/West" Project

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.480
and you know he had a concept;
he kept drawing on many

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.170
of the same musicians, but always
bringing new people into the fold,

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.580
so there was a continuity
esthetically.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.650
He had a singular voice and he was
able to sort of surround the way

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.500
that he plays even though it was
always evolving, but surround it

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.550
with you know new concepts and
players and projects and repertoire

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.330
and that record

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.940
"The Intercontinentals" was a huge
influence, in fact, I cried my eyes

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.240
out the first time I heard it.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.860
I got an advance copy of it
from a friend of mine who worked

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.670 position:56%
at a record store and I took it back
home and put it on, and it was like,

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.840
it was like that experience
of like hearing the music

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.730
that I had only imagined, you know,

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.960
I love Vinicius Cantuaria who's
a great Brazilian musician who's

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.910
on the record and I
had just been to Mali

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.380
and Sidiki Camara plays
calabash on that record

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.930
and there's songs written
for Boubacar Traore

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.600
who I had listened to,
you know, for years.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.900
So, there was all these things.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.980
It was like so inspiring.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:53.500
And that idea that you know
what many of us know and love

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.170
about Bill Frisell it's
like what's he up to now?

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.840
You know, that think you know he's
coming to town and you think like,

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.340 position:56%
I'm going to go to see him no matter
what's it's going to be great;

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.840
I wonder what he's
doing next you know?

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:11.380
And that actually became like you
know people don't love this word,

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.780
but like if there was like
a branding that I wanted

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:19.070
to have you know, my dream would
be when a music center would call

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.380
and be like we'd love to
have you at our festival,

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.000
like what are you up to next?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.300
What are you doing now?

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:29.040
And sort of build a kind of trust
that, you know, there's good taste,

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.370
really great musicians, let's find
out where it's going to go next.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.480
So, and I mean tons of
other influences, you know,

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.470
the thing about influences
is that nothing goes away.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.150
You know, you're an
archivist you know it's

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:47.480
like the collection keeps
building and so you keep listening

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.110
and you keep having new experiences
and you play with new people,

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:54.750
you know, going to West Africa and
playing with West African musicians

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:59.260
for a number of years,
completely altered my playing.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:03.210
And I think of the banjo, because
it is a West African instrument

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:08.190
that came here you know on
slave ships in the 16 and 1700s

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.620
and I really feel that continuity

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:15.090
and have studied not only
close ancestors of the banjo,

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.810
but also all different
African, you know, instruments

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.010
and so there are times you
know if I'm playing a piece

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.750
of Caribbean music where I
can quote rhythms and sounds

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:29.560
and you know palm mute the banjo
so it sounds like a thumb piano

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.670 position:56%
or you know treat the instrument in
such a way or do things rhythmically

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.950
and I mean those things
don't go away.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.890
You know, and it's one
thing to know the sort

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.890
of big guide posts
of style, you know.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:48.280
I know how to make something
sound very much like African music

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.930
or Cajun music or something,
but it's the subtle things

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.470
that you can kind of pull in
without anyone quite noticing

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.790
and can cross-pollinate
all these different styles.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.240
That's the stuff I'm
really interested in.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.090
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Right.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:09.040 position:56%
I was struck by what you said and we
should just get this out of the way,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:17.040
right, that here we have heirloom
seeds and we're going to plant them

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.240
in new soil and see what
happens, and that is,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.300
and that's a different
approach than a lot

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.680
of people would take
with our recordings.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.930
There are the crowd of
people over there who want

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:36.110 position:56%
to imitate precisely the
intonation and the performance style

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.960
as in Lomax performance style.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.760
There's the crowd of
people over there

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.280
who will imitate it
but not very well.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:49.760
And then there's people like
you who do something else

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.710
and I think they're all,
they're all fairly legitimate

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:56.520
and I only have a quibble with
one thing that you said there

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.380
and that is that the dusty
shelf, and I just have

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:05.350
to say our stacks are clean.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:09.200
They're clean, it's the cleanest
place in the world you know,

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.390
and so if you can just
help us by pulling

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:15.390
that one out of your statement.

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.690
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:17.990
I'll go back with a
Sharpie and strike

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:19.290
that out of the line of notes.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:23.070
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Otherwise I find
no fault with what you were saying

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.550
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.950
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: A couple of
things that are still in my head

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.550
about your style and I think,
I think this is important

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:36.900
because you are doing
something kind of unique.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.910
I've never heard anything like it.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:45.270
You, they are very rich
orchestrations of these,

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.690
of the bare bones of these
things and they include a lot

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:55.980 position:56%
of substitute chords that aren't the
1, 4, 5 kind of thing that we have,

00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:02.070
though harmonies are much built
not just on a triad but on the 9th,

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:06.660
11th, and the 13ths
and the presentation

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.390
of it is very chamber-like.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.840
Are those accurate
characterizations?

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.140
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Totally accurate.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.320
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: So
that's intentional?

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.620
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:24.570
I mean that's a big part of our
esthetic language in a lot of ways.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:32.340
I mean, most well, a lot of folk
music is very chambery, you know,

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:37.930
I mean chamber comes the word
"room" and you know a lot

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:41.780
of old time musicians are making
music in a room, you know,

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:47.070
singing in room filling a hall
with you know a shape note hymn.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:51.800
You know, calling in spaces,
call and response you know,

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.380
when I see those films

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.720
of the Georgia Sea Island
Singers they're very much alive

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.630
in a room making music in
the space, the music changes

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.890
when the space changes,
all of those things.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.790
Of course, we have been influenced
by playing chamber as keynote.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:11.470
We mentioned this project that
I did, Joe plays in a symphony,

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:16.440
Sumaia was classically trained,
Moira sang early music, you know,

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.160
in college and still
continues to do work.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.750
She can sing opera and all kinds of
stuff, so we share that experience

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:30.080
and for me it's chamber music is
so much about color, dynamics,

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.280
depth like arch you know how
to build and develop something

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.860
over a longer period of time.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.510
How to sort of you know use
all of the colors available

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:44.860
in an instrument and combine them
with all the other instruments

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:50.230
and voices and that's become
for me just the hallmark

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:54.390
of you know interesting
music-making.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.950
So, like I said, things
don't go away.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:00.170
So not matter what kind of music I
play it's hard not to pay attention

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:04.570
to the arch of an arrangement, to
you know the harmonic possibilities

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:08.050
that are you know maybe
suggested by a melody.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:15.960
And yeah, I think as modern players
it's our you know our blessing

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.860
and our curse to be re-harmonizing
things which is, you know,

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.510
to sort of re-contextualize things,

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:30.110
but I mean that's what you know
it's a way of putting a new shine

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:36.120
or you know putting a painting
in a frame to take an old ballad

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.110
and then kind of recast it
in this new harmonic space.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:43.320
It makes you hear the same melody
in a completely different way,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.020
and for me the preservation
work has been done.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.460
I mean, that's what Alan
Lomax and all of the people

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:56.270
that have collected and hear,
I feel like I can't touch them.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:59.060
You know, like there's
nothing that one needs

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.650
to do Jess Morris's "Old Paint."

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:06.090
You know, go listen to it it's like
so incredible and it still sounds

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:10.380
as vibrant as the day it was made,
and so there's no need for me

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:14.560
to recreate that because it's,
it was created and it's there

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.620
and I go back and listen
to it all the time.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.920
So, for me what's interesting is

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.780
to use my own voice
and what's interesting.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.320
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Right, and
Moira had said she called

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.190
"Sylvia" a great sturdy
song and I like that image,

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:33.040
because sometimes we have this
idea that oh it's too delicate

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.240
to mess with, you know,
we don't want to a,

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.660
we don't want to change
these arrangements.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:43.050 position:56%
We don't want to ruin the brand, but
I like that they are sturdy songs,

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:44.900
they can withstand a lot.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.150
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah, and you
know the other thing about it is,

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:54.480
it's not like the recordings
that were captured were somehow,

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:59.060
you know, they're not like the
platonic ideal of a folk song.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.930
You know, there is
no like John Henry.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:08.310
You know, the one that appears
in a songbook is often one

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.690
that never even got played.

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:12.040
It's just cobbled together from
a bunch of different versions

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.890
and everybody has their, you
know, somebody blows through town

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.450
and a local musician hears
it, it's not on record,

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.650
they remember a few words and you
know as Tim O'Brien likes to say

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.040
like yeah I couldn't
understand some of the words

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.710
so I just made up new ones.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:29.220 position:56%
And that's you know, that's the folk
process right there, and you know,

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.400
we found, we spent the afternoon

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.020
at the Smithsonian Folkways
[inaudible] yesterday

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:37.420
and there was a beautiful
ballad sung by Herald Barker

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.070
and I found it so interesting.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.220
I was like wow this sounds so
different and Moira was like,

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.170
yeah that's because he
mixed up two ballads.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.910
So, he sang the versus from
one with the chorus of another

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.320
and it actually was
really fascinating.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.620
I was like we should do that.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.670
That's really cool,
it sounds different.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:55.670 position:56%
And you know, often times these
crooked tunes were just how somebody

00:36:55.670 --> 00:37:01.980
heard it or you know how you
know they might have been feeling

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:08.830
on that particular day, and then
we hold them up as being sort

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:14.430
of ideals you know this is what
Stephen Wade talks so beautifully

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.670
about in his book, "The Beautiful
Music All Around Us" which was

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.870
such a big influence
on this project.

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:26.610 position:56%
You know, that it's these singular
people that have put their own stamp

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:32.890 position:56%
on this music and it's the tradition
and it's those two things kind

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:41.830
of that really are the tradition
that are working off each other.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.130
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: You talked us

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.660
through the arrangement
of "Goodbye Old Paint."

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.170
I wonder if you could just
talk a little bit about "I want

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.520
to Hear Somebody Pray" is
that the name of that one?

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:58.760
I was very struck by
that and how did you get,

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.030
arrive where you are now
with that particular song?

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.360
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah, because
it's even different now

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.900
than it was on the record.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.760
That song, well Bruce Molsky
who's an amazing old-time musician

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.410
who was part of the Lomax
Project in the early days,

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:22.510
and he played me the
Carriacou Lomax record

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:25.710
and I fell in love with that song.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:29.350
He had actually been to Carriacou
on vacation and met a few

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:33.470
of the musicians and thought he
discovered this whole new musical

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:36.050
culture and you know I remember
he said it was like in the 80s,

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.560
he was disappointed to find out
that Lomax had already been there

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.400
and recorded all these people.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:46.490
And so we actually at concerts
started just singing "I Want

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.420
to Hear Somebody Pray", clapping,
singing, getting the audience

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.430 position:56%
to sing it just as a little acapella
you know way to finish the show,

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:59.720
and then the night before we
recorded the Lomax Project album,

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.940
it was like the night
before the last session,

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.490
I was like I really want to do that
tune, but you know I don't want

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.270
to just go and sing it
around one microphone.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.800
You know, we had done some other
stuff like that and it sounds,

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.380
there's a sort of polyrhythmic myth
in the way the clapping relates

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.810
to the singing and it sounds
very you know it's Caribbean,

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:28.330
but it sounds very African and
so I put this piece of foam next

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.910
to the banjo bridge that
sort of mutes it in a way

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:37.330
that makes it sound like a gourd
banjo or almost like a tambura

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.120
and I just wrote this
whole like kind

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.470
of like African sounding banjo
part to go with the melody.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:49.960
And I was, and I just texted
a little recording of it

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.880
to Tim O'Brien and I was
like, what of doing this?

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.760
He's like yeah, sounds
great; like tomorrow.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.520
He's like yeah.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:04.360
So, we all went in, on way to
the studio I don't usually text

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:08.320
and drive, but I was like I knew
that I wanted percussion on it

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.750
and there was no percussion
on that session at all.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.570
And so I called my friend
Owen Robinson and I was like,

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.110
are you free for a
recording session?

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.410
He's like yeah great when.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.040
I'm like 10 minutes.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.490
He was like I'm there.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:23.140
So he setup, we were
all in one room.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.800
I basically talked through
this idea of the arrangement.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.910
We played it like 3 times and
that's what's on the record.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:32.030
And now what you're hearing
is that having been seasoned

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.400
over a few years now, Moira
brings this whole kind

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.670
of improvisational thing.

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:42.520 position:56%
We would start just free improvising
on the way out at the end

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.470
and then eventually it just
organically at concerts

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.150
that would kind of cross-fade

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:52.200
with bringing back just the
singing unaccompanied sort

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.460
of full circle back to the original
arrangement and it's always sort

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.040
of changing, but that's
how that happened.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:02.090
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: That's nice
and when there are sections

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.580
that I can see there's
a little improvisation

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:09.040
in your performance
today, and in that kind

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:17.020
of space you do this there a little
scaler passages [singing] kind

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:23.420
of it's not arpeggiated like you
would hear with you know some banjo

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:27.250
and I wonder if that's
one of those signals

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.480
that we're vamping right now.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.150
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: It's a
thing that I do a lot.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:36.470
I, another influence
that we didn't talk

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:41.570
about earlier was Steve Reich's
music and I've, you know,

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:45.180
I head music [inaudible]
musicians like a few years

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.890
after I started playing banjo
and like completely flipped out.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:54.600
And there's something that feels so
relatable, because it's a lot of.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.790
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Could you do
like, like Old Paint phase?

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:00.090
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Right.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:01.390
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: You
know where you record it

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.690 position:56%
and then just slightly slow it down/

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:03.990
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:05.290
We could. Should we do it?

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:06.590
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Yeah.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.890
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: After this?

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.190
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Let's try it.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.490
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Cool.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:11.790
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: I mean you're
already mixing the media right?

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.090
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Do you know
where we could find some reel

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:14.390
to reels around here?

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:15.690
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Yes.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:16.990
Yes, we can do it.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.290
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Okay great.

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:19.590
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Okay.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:20.890
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Okay.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.190
Our performance is
going to be next week.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.320
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: I feel like this
is a good point to thank you

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.490
and to move to any
questions with the audience

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.620
and so I've hogged
all of the questions.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:34.210
Any questions that our
audience members might have

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:37.850
and I'm seeing a few now.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.260
I'd love to hear about
your experience

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.270
in the archives, how it went about?

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.990
What it physically was like?

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:49.660
Todd might have helped
you out a little bit.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:50.960
Where did you go?

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.260
What's the material like?

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.750
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Well,
the first time I came,

00:42:54.750 --> 00:43:00.560
so I was a little bit rebellious
in school and I never went

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.430
to university and I've always
been like very curious in studios,

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:10.980
but not good with institutional
learning you could say.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:14.510
And so, you know, I showed up here

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:18.380
without a library card having no
idea what the rules or credentials

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.820
that were needed or whatever.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.440
I had written Todd earlier to
let him know about the project

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.560
and the idea, and also
by the way, I'm on tour.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.110 position:56%
I give my band lunch money and I was
like, okay you guys go for lunch.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:35.440
We've got like 3 hours before
we have to you know drive

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:43.600
to the next city and so I showed
up and you were very generous, not.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.900
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Surprised.

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.680
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Maybe you were
just in a good mood that day,

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.890
but it was pretty clear that
you know there wasn't the time

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:55.010 position:56%
to you know put on the white gloves
and look for things and write it all

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.310
down and wait for it to come up,

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:59.350
so Todd just said let's
just go downstairs.

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.830
So, literally within 5 minutes
of being here for the first time,

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:07.070
we were walking around with a
shopping cart through the archives.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.480
Am I allowed to say this out loud?

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.340
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Well, we're not
selling anything just be clear

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.640
about that.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.560
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.870
And literally pulling
stuff off of shelves.

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:22.840
I remember there was like an
odd shaped box that was bigger

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.280
than the rest, so of course
I was interested in it.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.580
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: And I
was like what's that?

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.400
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: And I remember you
said, oh yeah you should take that.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.120
It was all the letters that
Woody Guthrie had ever sent

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.280
to the Lomax family
and then, you know,

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:41.610
I remember even seeing
the Ampex suitcase model,

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.890
the first stereo recorder
that Lomax had used

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:47.290
on this whole southern journey
and I, you know, we kind of peered

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.370
in the box and I recognized
it from the picture.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.830
There's this great picture of him
with Wade Ward where Wade's smiling

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:57.980
with a few teeth missing, listening
on headphones like probably

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.800
for the first time like hearing
himself being played back

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:06.320
and you know, yeah like you
talk about physically, you know,

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.460
I am someone that very much
lives in their imagination

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:14.480
and to be quite honest like a
lot of these characters even

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.460
when I had read the Lomax
biography, you know,

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.300
they were kind of fanciful stories.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.980
And it actually wasn't until I
was here there in the basement

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.740
where it was like, I remember
holding the first acetate disc

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:30.090
that Lead Belly ever recorded,

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:37.580 position:56%
and you know seeing the John Lomax's
beautiful handwriting jotting

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:41.860
down notes, you know, good
guitar playing and you know notes

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.080
on desk jackets of like who else
in the county they should go visit

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:49.920
and this kind of thing, and it hit
me like wow these were real people

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.970
that had their lives at this
intersection of, you know,

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:59.340
whatever was happening for them,
the music, you know, politics,

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:03.560
race relations, like there were
so many things that were all kind

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.020
of in the air as this
work was getting done

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.370
and everybody was trying
to figure out how to do it,

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.290
how to make a living at it, you
know, and it was so something

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.810
about it like it kind of brought
me down to earth in a lot of ways.

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:20.700
And the Lomax Project comes with
like 60 pages of liner notes

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.150 position:56%
and photographs, because it became
really important to me to like think

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.050
about where these songs come from

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.880
and how they ended
up where they are.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.180
Yeah.

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:43.170
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Well, I think
then we can, we can adjourn.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:47.090
I'd like to, excuse me, I'd

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.530
like to thank Theo Austin
for setting this up.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:52.700
I'd like to thank our friends
from ITS for making the recording

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:56.770
for all the folks who were able
to make it here in person and all

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.350
of you who are watching
on the web streaming,

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:01.450
and most of all, thank
you Jayme Stone.

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:02.750
&gt;&gt; Jayme Stone: Oh, thank you.

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:04.850
It's a real pleasure
and honor to be here.

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:06.440
Yeah.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.730
