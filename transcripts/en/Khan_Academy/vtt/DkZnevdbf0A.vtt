00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.070
Any pair of points can be
connected by a line segment.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.150
That's right.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.350
Connect two pairs
of black points

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.939
in a way that creates two
parallel line segments.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.230
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.646
So I could create
one segment that

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:16.264
connects this
point to this point

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:17.680
and then another
one that connects

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.640
this point to this point.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.170
And they look pretty parallel.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.920
In fact, I think this
is the right answer.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.253
If we did it another way, if
we had connected that point

00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:30.530
to that point and this
point to this point,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.590
then it wouldn't
look so parallel.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.822
These clearly, if they
were to keep going,

00:00:35.822 --> 00:00:37.280
they would intersect
at some point.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.930
So let me set it back up the
way I did it the first time.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.710
Let me make these
two points parallel.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.640
And these are line
segments because they

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.340
have two end points.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.490
They each have two end points.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.810
And they continue forever.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.185
Well they don't
continue forever.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:56.820
They continue forever in no
directions, in zero directions.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.042
If it was a ray, it
would continue forever

00:00:59.042 --> 00:00:59.750
in one direction.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.860
If it's a line, it
continues forever

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.130
past both of these points.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.629
In fact, it wouldn't
have end points

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.310
because it would
just continue forever

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.060
in both of these directions.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.510
Let's do one more.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.610
Drag the ray so it
has an endpoint at A,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.570
so we want to make its endpoint
at A where the ray terminates

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.740
and goes through one of
the other black points.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.304
The ray should also be
parallel to the pink line.

00:01:23.304 --> 00:01:24.220
So I have two options.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.790
I could make it go
through this black point,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.190
but it's clearly not parallel.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.394
In fact, it looks
perpendicular here.

00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:31.310
So let's try to make it
go through this point.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.840
Well, yes, when I do that, it
does indeed look like my ray

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.290
is parallel to the pink line.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.320
And this is a ray because
it has one endpoint.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.695
This is where the
ray terminates.

00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:41.910
It's an endpoint.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.580
It literally ends there.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.717
And it continues forever
in one direction.

00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:47.550
In this case, the
direction is to the right.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.966
It continues forever
to the right.

00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:52.300
So it continues forever
in one-- continues forever

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.710
in one direction.
