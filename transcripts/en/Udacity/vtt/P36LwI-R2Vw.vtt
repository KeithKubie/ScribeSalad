00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.410
After drawing conclusions and
thinking predictions,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.660
the final step of the process
is to communicate your findings.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.140
Now, even though you don't have rigorous
conclusions backed by statistics or

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.990
machine learning, you can certainly
think about how to communicate

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.200
the results of your exploration.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.840
At this stage,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.580
you generally want to decide which
of your findings you think are most

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.740
interesting or most worth sharing, and
how you want to present those findings.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.710
For example, I was interested in
the difference in total minutes spent in

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.270
the classroom between students
who passed the first project and

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.770
students who didn't.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.100
And I think the clearest way to present
this is simply to present the means for

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.580
both groups.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.600
I also thought the difference in number
of days visited in the first week

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.350
was interesting.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.740
And then this case,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.640
I thought the histograms did a better
job of showing back numbers.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.880
If you do want to share
any visualizations,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.610
in general it's a good idea to
spend some time polishing them.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.200
You want to make them look nicer and

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.370
explain what trends
you'll noticing in them.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.970
You always know what you made a plot of,
but your reader doesn't.
