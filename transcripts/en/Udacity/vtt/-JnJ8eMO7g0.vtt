00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.260
You've made it to the end of another lesson,

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.689
and we've had a lot of new material here.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.450
So let's try to summarize all of what we've

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.270
learned into six main points. Point one, mutations in

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.560
either the coding or non-coding region of our genome

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.470
can be classified as either SNVs, insertions, deletions, duplications

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.090
or even chromosomal translocations. Point two, mutations in the

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.350
coding regions of genes can be classified as either silent,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.542
missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations. Point three,

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:34.163
sources for mutations include: spontaneous errors during

00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:36.861
DNA replication or induced mutations from UV

00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:40.355
rays from the suns, or X-ray energy. Point

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:42.850
four, mutations that occur in germ cells

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.430
are the mutations that get passed down to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.170
the next generation. And aneuploidy describes problems

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.350
in cell division that result in additional or

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.410
missing chromosomes. Point five, both allelic and phenotypic

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.931
frequencies aren't the same in a population typically. And

00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:04.269
point six, both random and natural selection can change

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.890
the phenotypic and allelic frequencies in any given population.
