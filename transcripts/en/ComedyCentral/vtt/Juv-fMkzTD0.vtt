Let him hear it.
[cheers and applause]

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:02.229
(D.L.)
So I grew up in this city.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.931
I grew up on 135th and Avalon,

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:07.067
a neighborhood called the Fives,
and it was all black.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.502
And everywhere
we went was black.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.204
Like, we would get on
the freeway and drive,

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.939
and it'd be all black people.

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:14.074
So I remember that's what
I thought Los Angeles was.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.376
So I remember we would always
watch <i>The Price Is Right,</i>

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.579
and white people would get on
and say, "We live in L.A."

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:23.183
And I go, "I never saw
you mother[bleep].

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:25.986
Where are they at?"

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.688
So years later,
I would go to Westwood,

00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.990
and it says, "Now entering
West Los Angeles."

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.625
And I went, "This is where
they keep them.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.194
"This is where they stay.

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:35.629
No wonder I never saw them."

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.297
I learned everything
in my neighborhood.

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:39.433
We had bullies,
and back then,

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.468
if you had a problem
with a bully,

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.103
my father--
or a lot of fathers--

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.471
made sure
you had to go fight them.

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:45.672
That was the deal.

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.107
You had to fight
to face your fear.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.542
And I remember my father
telling me--

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.344
he said, "A bully's a coward.

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.513
"If you stand up to a bully,
and you punch him in his face,

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:54.114
like the coward he is,
he'll run away."

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.516
And this dude named Clifford

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.351
used to take my lunch money
all the time.

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:59.553
And one day, I was so hungry

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.388
that I said I wasn't gonna
give my lunch money up,

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.056
and I remembered
what my father said.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.892
And I stood to him,
and I looked him in his face,

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.727
and I punched him
dead in his face,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.061
and he beat the [bleep]
out of me.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.632
And...
[laughter]

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.467
From that point on,
I knew my father didn't know

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.968
what the [bleep]
he was talking about.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.240
But it taught me everything--

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:21.675
almost everything people
deal with.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:24.077
Like, I actually grew up
next to a pedophile.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.412
We didn't know what he was.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:26.780
We didn't know
what they called it.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.749
But my father used to
always say,

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:30.984
"Don't you ever let me catch you
over at this man's house."

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.819
And little boys--
this is a true story--

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.421
would leave this man's house,
and they would be crying,

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.822
and they would have candy
in their hands.

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.457
And they would go,
"You want some candy?"

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.093
I'm like, "No, mother[bleep].
Not that bad.

00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:41.428
"If candy can make you cry,

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.964
you can keep that shit,
'cause..."

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.699
[chuckles]

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.534
"Booty for Skittles
ain't a deal for me.

00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:50.137
I'm..."

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.306
It was just that
the way I grew up

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.540
taught me a lot about life.

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.342
I remember learning about sex--

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.377
which is the wrong place
to learn about sex,

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:58.879
is the neighborhood.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.547
I kissed this girl
when I was in third grade.

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.815
Her name was Michelle.

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.317
And I told this dude
named Junior--

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.052
I said, "Man,
I kissed this girl Michelle".

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:06.553
He said,
"Did you use your tongue?"

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:08.922
I said, "Yes."
He said, "She's pregnant."

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:13.594
[laughter]

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:16.463
And I go home crying
'cause I got to get a job

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:20.901
to take care of a baby.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.736
And I remember,
I'm waiting for my father.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.571
I was so scared
to tell my father.

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:26.840
And when he came home, I said,
"Daddy, I got to talk to you."

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.208
He said, "What's wrong?"

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:30.244
I said, "I kissed Michelle
with my tongue,

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:32.212
"and now she's pregnant,
and I got to get a job,

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:33.647
"and I don't even have
my own room,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.182
and is she gonna sleep in here
with me?"

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.517
And he laughed,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.819
but he never talked to me
about sex.

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:40.687
So later on, I'm growing up
in the neighborhood.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.089
I eventually had sex.

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.390
I got crabs.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:44.758
I'm not the only one
it happened to.

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:48.095
Don't act like it's just me.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:51.498
Same dude, Junior,
I go to him.

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:53.100
I said, "Man,
I got some bugs down there."

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:55.502
This dumb son of a bitch said,

00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:57.271
"Spray some Raid on your nuts."

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:59.740
[laughter]

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:02.609
And I actually did it

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.811
and had to go to
Martin Luther King Hospital

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:09.850
where they treated me, 'cause
I could've poisoned myself.

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:12.219
But I remember
all the lessons I learned

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.154
taught me how to look at
the world.

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:17.591
I remember the first time
I ever got called "nigger,"

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:18.926
the first time
it ever happened.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.060
Now, I'd heard it all my life.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.428
I'd heard my parents say it.

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.197
You know,
"This nigger's crazy."

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.067
But never directed at anybody
with any sense of malice.

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.469
So when we were in
the fifth grade,

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.305
we went on a field trip
to Olvera Street,

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:32.773
which is in Los Angeles.

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:34.208
It's the oldest street
in the world.

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.076
And we would buy maracas
and candy,

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:37.611
and we'd be playing around.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:41.114
So me and my friend Donald--
I wanted some ice cream.

00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:43.417
So I walked into the store,
and I said,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.419
"Hey, man,
can I have some ice cream?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.788
He said,
"We don't serve niggers."

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:50.324
I said, "Well, then
do you have strawberry?"

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:53.293
[laughter]

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:57.931
'Cause I had no idea--'cause--
[chuckles]

00:04:57.965 --> 00:04:59.733
'Cause we used to have
these nuts on our table,

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:00.934
and they were Brazilian nuts,

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.369
and they called them
"nigger toes."

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:03.504
And that's all I--
he said--

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:04.671
And Donald looked at me.

00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:06.073
He said,
"He's talking about us."

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:10.944
And I said,
"They make ice cream out of us?"

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:14.214
And he said, "No, he's talking
about black people."

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:17.451
And I remember being very upset,
and I went home to my mother,

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.086
and I went home to my father,

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.154
and I told them that somebody
had called me "nigger."

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:23.257
And my mother said to me
something I'll never forget,

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.359
and it really, honestly shaped
the way I see the world.

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:27.327
She said,
"So what did he call you?"

00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:28.695
And I said,
"He called me a nigger."

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.063
She said, "Are you that?"

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.465
I said,
"I don't know what it is."

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:32.799
She said,
"How could you be afraid

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.268
"to be something you're not--

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.869
you don't have no concept
of what it is?"

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:38.505
She said, "You're only
what you answer to."

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:39.840
And that's the way I grew up,

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:41.341
and that's the way
I see the world.

00:05:41.375 --> 00:05:43.110
Thank y'all for coming out.
I appreciate it.

00:05:43.143 --> 00:05:43.210 line:0%
