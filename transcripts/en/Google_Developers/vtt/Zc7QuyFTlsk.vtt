JENNIFER SHAW: Hi.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.090
Thank you for the nice
very warm welcome.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.530
I have never been so honored to
be on stage in my entire life,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.970
so thank you for
letting me be up here.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.270
I am here representing as a
founder of both New York Tech

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.760
Women and Bella
Minds, specifically

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.750
to talk about our
programs Bella Minds.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.020
We talked a lot about
international women, and just

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.490
the amazing things
that Google is

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.550
doing to help them, the
support structure with all

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.600
these different platforms.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.580
And I have a slightly
different focus,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.290
just in that we're all
like very tired and ready

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.950
for Pinkberry's, so I
just have a few-- I really

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.334
like the pressure, like get
done, we have things to do.

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.000
But I have a few
questions for you guys.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.100
Have you guys ever felt
excluded from something?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.740
Like just-- yeah?

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.630
Yeah, me too.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.070
Do you guys ever
feel like maybe you

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.734
dream too big, like
you have big ideas

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.150
and-- yay, there's
a few dreamers.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.050
I love you.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.460
So that's kind of me.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.220
I got on this road
into tech making,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.370
I actually didn't have a
professional technology

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.460
background.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.110
My mom taught me
databases as a preteen.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.030
That was her idea
of, like-- fun?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.750
I don't know.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.275
Which was great, but then
when I graduated high school

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:36.150
and was looking to
college, I was like, well,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.370
clearly I don't need to
go to school for that.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.325
I know everything.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.190
So I didn't.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.730
I went to school for
business, and sort of more

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.170
went down that path into
liaison role between technology

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.920
and business, which
is really kind of fun.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.990
So I also encourage that as
much as I courage tech making.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.254
But what happened is
that I moved to New York.

00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:00.670
And things were
going really well,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.960
I was doing a lot of research in
technology, software, wireless,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.205
all sorts of things.

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:08.461
And I kind of ready
for the next step.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.419
We mentioned I happen to
come from a background

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.370
in the Midwest.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.330
And yeah, I did.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.070
I picked up one day and
moved to New York on a whim.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.730
And so a couple
years later, I just

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.880
didn't have enough
technology in my life.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.800
And so I went out to find them.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.877
And it was gross.

00:02:26.877 --> 00:02:28.460
Really, the problem
that I didn't have

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.730
was that I felt excluded because
it was a male-dominated field.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.950
I actually felt really
excluded, because I

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.470
didn't feel like the women
treated each other very well.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.529
I'll give note that this
was several years ago,

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.695
and I don't think we're
having the same conversation

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:43.930
that we're having now.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.940
So hopefully that's not
happening as much anymore.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.440
But it was a real
problem, so that's

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.780
kind of what came
from New York Tech

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.739
Woman is that I wanted to create
an environment where everyone

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:55.280
felt welcome.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.467
And it didn't matter like
what your background was,

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:00.300
what your title was.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.258
Because we all know,
especially for those of us

00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:06.580
here in New York, that are
first conversation's like, hi.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.897
What do you do?

00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:10.230
And I don't know about you
guys, but that doesn't really

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.480
define me very well-- more so
now than maybe it did, but I

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.984
was doing research in
like random tech products.

00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:18.650
So it didn't really
define me very well.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.100
And I thought, that's
just not very fair.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.040
And so what I wanted to do
with New York Tech Women

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.820
was to create a very
all-inclusive environment,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.710
because we have enough
problems as it is.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.420
We shouldn't be our own battles.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.080
So anyway, so a little
further down the road,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.430
a couple years later, we'd
established New York Tech Woman

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.820
as a really strong presence
in helping women just

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.130
understand where their
place was in technology

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.210
and why they were there and
what they could do about it.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.010
And frankly, I just
sort of started

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.718
to feel that there
was a little bit more.

00:03:50.718 --> 00:03:53.820
Like New York's amazing culture
and there's a lot going on,

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.466
but with my Midwest
background, I just

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:57.590
felt that there was still
something really missing.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.890
And I started getting
all these emails.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.320
And it was a big
conversation about, well,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.330
we need more diversity.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.704
Do you happen to
have a woman who

00:04:04.704 --> 00:04:07.700
can fill my blah, blah,
blah, tech position?

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.930
And I just felt so gross when
I would get those emails.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.080
And in case you
guys didn't realize,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.670
tokenism is also sexism.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.370
And so that was a
real problem for me.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.510
Yes, I want more
women in technology,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.100
like more than I want
to eat most days.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.030
But the problem right
now isn't that we

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.476
don't have enough
women in technology.

00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:32.850
The problem is
that we don't have

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.720
enough people in technology.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.200
And it'll be really glorious
when we get more of them

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.040
to be women.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.400
But what I really
started to research--

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.020
and that just dug me down
kind of into a rabbit hole--

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.080
was that about 20% of our
country is just not online.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.900
Also just coincidentally,
about 20% of our country

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.500
lives outside
metropolitan areas.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.120
So I put kind of my history
of being in the boondocks--

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.880
and I'm telling you,
Carhenge is in the boondocks.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.360
And I thought like, when
we talk about diversity--

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.220
and obviously today
is about gender

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.440
and I celebrate that
more than anything--

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.070
but true diversity
comes from every angle.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.120
And so we started to realize
that the conversations were

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.750
happening in New York and in
bigger cities that, you know,

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.800
tech and the scenes
and the cultures.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.200
But I realized that there was
a huge problem with getting

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.910
everyone in this
country connected

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.200
in this blanket of
network rather than just

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.380
these big hubs.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.290
So I created Bella Minds, which
takes city-centric education

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.550
models and resources and
pairs them with small towns

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.790
in America.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.000
So we actually take tech leaders
from New York City, Washington

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.310
DC, Boston-- Boulder even-- and
we place them into small cities

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.900
for live, hands-on education.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.020
So I have one more
question for you guys.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.300
Has anybody ever taken
an online course?

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.060
Yeah?

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.750
It went really well, right?

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.230
OK, leave your hands up.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.255
Leave your hands up.

00:06:08.255 --> 00:06:09.930
I took an online course.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.480
Who finished?

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.820
Who finished it, like
all the way to the end?

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.970
Awesome, yeah.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.860
Who retook another one
because it was so amazing?

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.990
Yeah.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.640
So there's so much study
around the way that we learn.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.290
And so what we've learned
with the community

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.700
is that online education
just doesn't cut it.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.030
Think about this-- teach
technology with technology.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.800
Like I'm going to learn
to code from code?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.300
Hmm.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.466
And I didn't think that
that was really quite right.

00:06:41.466 --> 00:06:46.640
So I do have a big background
in education, and specifically

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.400
about education.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.530
So we actually do live,
on-site training in small towns

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.280
in America, which
is really exciting.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.650
I actually just got in,
literally this morning,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.940
from being away at our
first pilot location.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.510
So we launched in October.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.447
We raised almost
$30,000 in crowdfunding.

00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:08.030
I don't remember
which speaker-- which

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.488
one was talking
about crowdfunding?

00:07:09.488 --> 00:07:11.680
But I want to talk to you.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.090
Anyway, $30,000 in
crowdfunding to give 25 women

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.910
scholarships to
our first program.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.020
So I have just
like a small story.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.030
We built program,
we built curriculum.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.500
We actually took an
Ivy League education,

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.550
pairing it with both business
school and technology.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.700
Because think about what's
missing in the world

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.000
and what's required in
the world of technology.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.370
Think of it on a scale-- like,
for you guys-- zero to ten,

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.250
right?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.660
And a truly digital literacy,
like if you are technically

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.000
illiterate, like a true zero,
there are programs for you--

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.730
the local school is working
for you, probably some YMCA.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.470
There's definitely like
some really great government

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.010
programs and even
school programs

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.350
that are helping
you combat that.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.620
And then the other hand, we
now have programs everywhere

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.940
that are teaching tech
mastery skills, really

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.360
kind of pushing level on
that high ten level, right?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.510
Really trying to
get it together.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.040
But there's something
missing in this middle.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.500
And so that's kind of the
goal of Bella Minds is to take

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.600
everything that's-- I
don't know, envision it,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.667
like maybe a four
to like a seven.

00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:21.250
And how do we make
sure that everybody

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.400
is at least over the
halfway mark, right?

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.089
We have a lot of
preaching where we

00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:27.130
talk and talk and talk
about like, learn to code,

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.338
learn to code, learn to code.

00:08:28.338 --> 00:08:30.410
And I agree-- learn to code.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.870
But at the same
token, for those of us

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.659
that are at least
semi-technologists in the room,

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.287
please stop learning to code,
because I have to fix it.

00:08:39.287 --> 00:08:40.559
Right?

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.380
So like, while I agree,
like everyone absolutely

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.610
should have this
in their resume,

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.000
but it's not for everyone.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.710
And that's perfectly OK.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.050
But it is the
language of tomorrow.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.700
So that's actually what
Bella Minds is working on,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.370
is how do we get them
past that barrier

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.230
where it really is
a true vocabulary?

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.600
Because we want to take them
from just being consumers

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.580
to actual tech creators
and tech makers, right?

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.590
I use "creators" because that
sounds better with my tag.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.940
But to truly make things,
and to reiterate to them

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.620
that you can make
a lot of things.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.480
You can create anything
on the internet.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.980
But these are groups of
women and in situations

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.340
and environments where that's
just not brought up for them.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.840
I'm just another-- because
I know we're all like really

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.135
anxious for the Pinkberry--
so like I'll just

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:32.010
try to keep it light.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.880
Is anybody actually
from rural America?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.630
Shoutout, Midwest, yay.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.470
All right, so I
just want to hear

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.630
from a couple of that would
claim Midwest, what happened

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.610
when you came to New York,
assuming you're here now?

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.150
JENNIFER SHAW:
OK, somebody else.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.043
You?

00:09:50.043 --> 00:09:52.210
Ohio?

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.110
Loveland, Ohio.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.495
AUDIENCE: I made it to
Arizona [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:56.449
Loveland, Ohio.

00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:59.311
I was there for 19 years.

00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:00.386
People don't leave there.

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:01.219
JENNIFER SHAW: Yeah.

00:10:01.219 --> 00:10:03.140
AUDIENCE: They don't know
what goes on outside of--

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.530
JENNIFER SHAW: No, they don't.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.500
So that's actually what
I learned-- no, they

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.958
don't know what happens outside
Loveland, or Lyons for that

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:09.850
matter.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.950
And that's fine-- kind of.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.600
And to be quite honest, that's
like a very American way

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.320
of view, right?

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:16.740
I don't know.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.114
When I first moved
to New York, I

00:10:18.114 --> 00:10:21.690
was like, these people think
like the world ends here,

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.190
right?

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.140
Like, we all know that we
live in a bubble in New York.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.306
And so I think it's actually
more and American view,

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:29.430
not just like an Ohio or like
a New York view or a Nebraska

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.040
view.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.020
But what do we have
to do to actually

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.340
really bridge the gap together?

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.040
And so my focus is on
mid-career women rather than

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.740
young children.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.710
I have seven nieces.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.950
I want them to be tech too.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.030
But what happens is that we're
shy, in the next four years

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.860
or so, we're missing about
a quarter million people

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.100
to fill our tech jobs.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.780
That's just in the US.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.770
And right now, we're
kind of in a rob Peter,

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.570
pay Paul sort of situation.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.429
We're importing about 17%
of all our tech talent

00:10:58.429 --> 00:11:00.720
from around the world-- which
is glorious, thank heaven

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.010
for that, because it does
truly, truly breed the diversity

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.030
conversation.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.800
But when we balance that with
the rest of the demographics

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.820
of the US and then
country and whatnot,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.310
we're really not putting to
work the people that we have.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.830
And if we want to
keep up as a country,

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.160
we actually have a
problem now, right?

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.570
We actually need women that
have worked at the bank,

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.360
and they've worked
at the vision office,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.600
and they've worked at
the reception office

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.860
to actually start learning
these conversations,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.059
because their background
is phenomenal.

00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:32.350
We need to make sure that
today's teachers are actually

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.620
having this conversation.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.930
So that's my focus
with Bella Minds,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.810
is that as much as, yes,
we need a strong pipeline

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.320
and that everybody should
be mentoring a young woman,

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.820
I just strongly, strongly
encourage everyone in this room

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.370
to reach out with somebody
who just like really just

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.640
doesn't want to participate
in this conversation

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.990
and start talking to
them about the potential.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.650
So age doesn't matter.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.330
You can learn
something regardless.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.020
So we actually just finished
our pilot program in Nebraska.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.500
I did it on my hometown, which
was really pretty glorious.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.960
And I did it with 10
people that I knew.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.002
That seemed safe, until I
learned so much about it.

00:12:11.002 --> 00:12:13.460
And so I think I'll just share
with you my biggest finding,

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.126
because honestly I haven't had a
chance to look at the research.

00:12:16.126 --> 00:12:17.260
I've been gone.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.730
But the biggest
finding is that we

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.830
built a program that was
one week, live-intensive,

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.557
with mentors on site for them.

00:12:22.557 --> 00:12:24.890
And then we have a follow-up
eight-week program for them

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.806
so that they can actually
virtually understand

00:12:26.806 --> 00:12:28.300
what that communication
looks like,

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.400
because that's that
middle mushy part-- logic

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.720
and problem solving and
working with remote teams

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.177
and understanding different
cultures and problem solving

00:12:35.177 --> 00:12:36.260
and thinking about things.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.160
It's not actually sitting
down and writing code.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.710
And so the biggest
finding that I had

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.310
were two women in the
middle of our week

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.680
together who had never had
internet in their house.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.480
It wasn't a matter of not
affording or not available--

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.820
it was seriously not a priority.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.890
They just didn't care.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.470
They had no idea what
tech could do for them,

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.450
or like what advantage
there was to them.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.620
And by like day
three, two-- and I

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.830
think maybe a third woman-- went
out and installed high speed

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.760
4G to their house.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.912
Right, so that to
me is like, I almost

00:13:10.912 --> 00:13:12.870
don't care about like
the rest of the research,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.930
because to me that speaks
for the rest of it.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.575
It simply is just not a
priority for the world.

00:13:18.575 --> 00:13:20.200
And unfortunately,
we just have to have

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.770
that for this country in order
for us to participate wholly

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.700
and to participate now, right?

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.390
We don't have a
problem in seven years

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.890
when my niece
graduates high school.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.760
We have a problem now
in terms of tech talent.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.391
So that's what I'm working
on with Bella Minds.

00:13:36.391 --> 00:13:38.140
Yeah, I don't think
we're doing questions.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.220
And I'll be really honest,
I'm going to keep it short.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.386
You guys all want Pinkberry.

00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:43.186
I want Pinkberry.

00:13:43.186 --> 00:13:44.055
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:45.810
It's tiring, it's
longer in the day.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.340
But I do encourage
you to two things.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.920
Again, make sure
that you reach out.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.310
And I don't mean just reach out
to a young girl who needs help.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.560
Make sure you reach out to
your mother and your sister

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.330
and your aunt, to your next-door
neighbor, like whatever

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.150
it means-- your bank teller,
spread the Gospel if you will,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.790
that technology is just
so incredibly powerful.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.740
It doesn't necessarily
mean that they

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.970
have to be the next
developer of Google.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.350
But to participate in the
language is really important.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.290
So reach out to somebody.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.440
And I can help with
that if you need.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.410
So that's Bella Minds.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.390
And hopefully you'll
have questions later.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.780
But thank you all for having
me here today to talk about it.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.330
[APPLAUSE]
