Speaker 1:          00:00:02       And we're live. Hi Sir. What's going on man? Very well. Thank you. First of all, thank you very much for the coffee machine in this. I just learned that it's turmeric. I used to say Tumeric, I used to not even think there was an RN in there for some strange reason. Well, in Hawaii it's Olana. So it just depends on which country you're in. Yeah, it's a diff what did, what is, what is, it's a root, right? Yup. Ginger, the ginger family. And is it, why do they call it Olana? Is that up? That's just the Hawaiian name. I mean, the Indians probably have another, you know, in India it's probably one of the most use, uh, you know, are our route. They, it's in every era. All Indian foods. It's full of it. Yeah. Yeah. It's really healthy for you. Right? It's great for inflammation.

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       At what? Gut Health too. So you, uh, gave me this layer, superfoods coffee machine, and I'm addicted to this now. This coffee with turmeric. I've never had it before. Well, there's some other minerals and stuff in there too. So if you're addicted to it is because there's things that are good for you. Yeah. Like I crave it. Like it seems like something that was your body wants it. Yeah. I, you know, I think sometimes people think cravings are based on negative. Like, oh I just, it's bad cause I crave it. But I think cravings are natural. I think it went, but it's, you know, we abuse it when we use garbage, but when you craving something like that, I mean there's, you know, a bunch of minerals in and a bunch of good fats and there's a bunch of good stuff in there. Yeah. It's hard to tell though, right?

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       Like sometimes you crave sugar, sometimes you crave ice cream. Yes. There's some cravings that are not good. Exactly. Other ones are exactly. But the system of craving, I believe, what is part of a natural human thing that we have that was meant to crave good things, but we abuse it with cause sugar and nature is meant to be safe. That means it's safe to eat. Right, right, right. So, so yeah. So then we, so that, but then we abuse it by disguising a bunch of garbage with sugar and then people think, oh, that's great to eat. That makes sense. Yeah. Cause whenever I lift weights, I crave protein. Yeah. Crave like fish or chicken or steak or something. Yeah. Well you're, you're beating up muscles. You want protein. Yeah. But it's an instantaneous craving. Yeah. It's like right away I'm like, Oh, I've got to eat something.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Yeah. Um, so you've got me crank in the sauna up. Uh, your wife told me that you crank years up to 220 degrees. Is that real? That's real. God Damn Man. I get to two 10. I'm like, this is, how long do you do at two 20? Well, it depends on how, how cold you go into it. Oh, oh. So if your, if your body, if your core temperature is weighed down, you can, you know it, if you, if you've got off the stationary bike and your core was nice and hot and you went in there, you know, you'd be lucky to get 10 or 10 or 15 minutes out. If you come out of a ice tub or you've been outside with minimal clothing, you could go in there and for 20 minutes at two 20 so it just depends on, you know, where your, what your core team, you know, where your core is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       Is that how you do it? You do from an ice bath. I will do it from a nice path that just, you know, I, you just break it up. It's just like anything, any kind of training, you just want to constantly stress the system. And if you're used to a certain pattern, you know, go into it hot. Like if you go into a sauna hot coming off of some cardio that it's twice as hot. If you go in cold then you can go for a longer period of time. And same with the ice. I mean, if you go into the ice cold, the ice, we'll tap you. If you go in hot, you can be there. So they're doing some studies now on hot yoga at a Harvard. They're trying to figure out if hot yoga mimics the positive health effects of Sauna. And so the idea is that, you know, because you're straining and resisting, it's, it feels much hotter than 104 degrees.

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       You have a journal that was 104 hundred five degrees would be nothing for sure. But Yoga at 105 degrees, it's pretty rough. Rough. Well, because again, core temperatures spot. So we do some stationary bikes in the sauna. Wow. And that, I mean, that's just a, it's like you can always up the ante, you know, it's like a weight stack. You just slap more led on there. And we'll do, we'll do, we'll go in this with an assault bike. I have an assault bike and one of the Saunas and we'll crank that thing up. And you know, I mean, you're lucky if he might be five or 10 minutes and you're, you're, but I think, you know, we're such good adapters or our, you, our adaptation is amazing and you do some stuff for a while. I think you did it pretty soon. You're like, oh, I can handle, uh, you know, an assault bike and at, at a survivable pace, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       Yeah. Survive. That's a rough machine. Rough machines. I have the rogue versions of echo bike. Yeah. That thing is fantastic. I love it. For sure. That's all four limbs, all four limbs. It's one of my all time fee to two Bottas Tabata sprints on it. An all time favorite method of Cardio for sure. For sure. Well, low impact on the system. You're not beating every, the joints. Um, every, all four things are working and you could throw in some nose breathing in there or something and breath holding intervals or something just to, you know, we're seeing in suffering. You were explaining nose breathing to me out there. Yeah. How nose breathing is better. Better for you because of, well, first of all, you were designed to breathe your sinuses and your nose were designed for breathing. And so you actually admit a gas in your sinuses.

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       From my understanding, a gas called nitric oxide, which is a vasodilators, helps you absorb oxygen. So by breathing through your nose, plus you reduce the amount of intake that you have and that gets you CO2 tolerance. So all of a sudden you're, you're breathing less volume. I mean, you know, from the fight game, we, as soon as the guy goes to mouth breathing, you're like, he's toast. You know that, right? That's your first giveaway. So your ability to deal with stress and breathe through nose, I mean, everybody should be breathing through their nose in their sleep, walking around. I mean, we somehow we became mouth breathers in the last 200 years and they're not sure why. There's a great book called the Oxygen Advantage, uh, by Patrick Mcgill that, uh, he actually is on our board of XPT but he, he, you know, kind of realized that our issues really stem from mouth breathing, chronic, uh, mouth breathing, which is scrubbing our CEO to and keeping our co two levels down, which is the market of absorb oxygen.

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       So when your co two levels are down, you don't absorb the oxygen from your bloodstream. The cells don't take it. As soon as this co two goes up, then the, then the body starts to pull it out of the blood. Interesting. So smaller amounts by breathing through the nose actually makes you absorb more oxygen while keeps your tolerance and tolerance. But definitely get your CEO too tolerant up. But the smaller volume helps your body become more tolerant of higher levels of co two. But the nose, the sinuses themselves emit a gas that helps the lung absorb the oxygen is, and that's, you know, that's what I've been led to understand. I had a broken nose until I was 40. My nose was useless. I couldn't get anything out of it. It had been broken, like who knows how many times. Yeah. And it was all the inside was all caked up with scar tissue and calcified.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       And when I got it fixed, it was like the world change. It was like, ah, I couldn't do that. I just couldn't breathe out of my nose. I would go to yoga class. They tell me to breathe at. All I know is I'm like, I don't have one. Yeah, I could smell farts. Yeah, that's it. I could smell gas and gasoline. Like it has to be rough for me to smell it. But now I have a real nose. Yeah. I always encourage people, if you have a broken nose, please get that deviated septum fixed. Well, you know, it's surprising if you start to nose breathe, even if you have struggle because of the, that gas is helps you open up a lot of people. I mean, I'm not saying that you have that, but a lot of people actually will gain volume after a few weeks of forcing themselves to nose breathe.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       They'll actually start to open up all of that, that system. Does that make sense? So your body would just adapt and try. It forces it to, to open. But yeah, no it's all about nose breathing. I didn't think, I just thought it was just more difficult. So it's probably a good thing to do for discipline. Absolutely. And if you can do your cardio and retain a nose breath, you're, you have another gear because then when you go to mouth it's like you gotta it's like having a blower on your car or something. You open up the, you know, you open up the air and it's a whole new game. So by being able to sustain a high output nose breathing then, and like I said, it's all about the tolerance for CO2. It's how much co two you can handle in your system. You know, like that's why altitude screws people up cause the CEO two jacks up and they don't have a tolerance and then you get all wonky and you feel like crap.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       Yeah. And it's interesting that you're talking about cravings because one of the things that I've noticed since I've been, I cranked up the, to the, the temperature in the sauna for the first week to 200 degrees that I've been doing to 10 for the last few days. And uh, you crave it now. I crave it. Like when I'm at home, I'm like, I can't wait to get back to that God damn song again. Meanwhile, when I'm in there, I can't wait to get out. It's weird. They're within lies. The struggle. I mean ice is the same way. Like I have an addiction to ice and I, you know, uh, recently I've been just came back from Hawaii and I'm like dealing with ice machine's broken down. I've been waiting for the new one. I keep calling the guy and go, hey, when are you gonna put the thing in?

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       And He's thinking it's like a luxury. Like, yeah, you're, you know, you've got it. What do you need an ice machine at your house for him? Cause I have to like restaurant size ones. Yeah. And, well I have a lot of friends, but he's like, what do you need that for? And I'm like, I like just just get, you know, he's got the tubs. I'm like, I need, my body craves. You get it. Listen, your body is just craving the things that are bringing the hormones and do it. I mean it's like why you crave exercise. You know? I have a theory that the reason why people are hooked to cardio activity is because it's forced breathing that people, because you wouldn't willingly just sit on your floor and breathe heavy for an hour. So your body's like, okay, let's go for a run. Like let's go.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       You need to run, you better run, you better run, and then you go run and then the body gets that absorption of, oh, it gets at a oxygen. Then it really wants to feel. I feel like there's probably several factors cause also I feel like when I'm really consistent with my workouts, I know that I'm gaining momentum and I know like, ah, you know, I'm consistent, everything's going great, I'm in great shape right now. I've got to keep pushing this. Yeah. That feels like it's, it feels like a, like just, just positive results are being achieved and you can sort of get addicted to success. Well and, and it, but also to the body, the adaptation, if you ever put yourself under some real severe stress in multiple days, the first day you feel like you're not gonna be able to make it. The second day you're feeling, you know, like you can't really can't make it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       The third, pretty soon, the fourth day the body is like, oh, this is the new house we're living in. Like this is where we're at. Okay, well we're going to adapt and modify. And then pretty soon you're doing even more your than you were doing the first couple of days and you're not even feeling it. And so it's like we're, that we're an amazing, an amazing machine. You know, we're an amazing creature. Just the way we can handle the load and the, and especially in this, in our new world where we, you know, don't have to do much unless we want to. Um, do you know Eddie Izzard is, yeah. The comedian. Yeah, yeah. He, he ran a series of marathons all around the UK and we did one in South Africa and he was on two weeks ago. And he was telling me that when you first started doing it, like the first few were really hard, but then your body's like, well this is what we do.

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       We run marathons and then like day three, day four things started picking up day five and by the time day 10 came along, he's just running for sure. Yeah, for sure. I've got a friend ran 125 in a row and then he ran the Boston after that and then he had a fight in Vegas and he ran a marathon in the morning and then he like knocked the guy out in the third round and after, I mean he says he met his marathon in the morning and then fought that day. Holy Shit. That's a cause. This Tom Jones. Yeah. Moitai seven time white Thai world champion. Jesus zone. Yeah. Yeah. The fuck man. You run a marathon a day, you fight it magic put dude, knock two out. I'd be like, I'm done. This is not me. Yeah, I'm going to learn how to play golf. Yeah. Fuck this. Moitai fuck this Tom Jones.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       What I would say, that's crazy. So he got 125 marathons in a row, so 125 days of marathons, two Boston, and then he ran the Boston. When he got there, he ran across the country. What he ran across the country. So that's how he got there. So he did run America, took a nap, ate some food, ran a marathon, took a nap. It's like, what the fuck buddy? But just shows you that, you know, that ability to adapt and what we can, you know what we can do? It's amazing how the body will just, when you push it and you keep, it'll just be like, it'll ramp. I mean, and I think for us in this, in our new world that we live in, that seemed so crazy, but probably in the past you were like, oh yeah, well we went all the way down to South America and we did some hunting down there.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       And then we, you know, trek marathon or two per day and we came all the way back to Alaska, you know, like right. You know, like that was just our life a lot. Yeah. Well especially when they used to persistence hunt, you know, when they would just run an animal down. Yeah, the animals are great for sprints but for especially like gazelles and things along those lines. But you know what though? You know what though, the real technique really is based on is that our breathing, that breathing is what gives us, we have an ability to adjust our breath so we can actually adjust how many times we breathe PIR motion where a lot of these animals are breathing for a Rep. Every rep is a breath. So every step is, and we can do multiple steps in one breath and so that why are, that's why we can outrun a horse.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       At the end of the day, you always see the in the cowboy movies, a horses laying dead in the desert and the guy still going along. But because the, those mammals are breathing every breath as a rep and you imagine how tiring that is. Like you're a horse ride [inaudible] right there breathing every and where are we running full speed, but we can just do a breath and then do five or six or eight reps and that gives us that endurance. That's why we can run those gazelles down because those guys are just breathed there. Their breath out. That's interesting. Well I'm, I'm always very appreciative of guys like you that are in my age range. I'm just speed limit. Yeah, speed limit. You're, but you're also very fit and very active and you keep going. Whereas a lot of guys around 55 like it's a wrap turn off the car.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       Yeah, it's, there's not much in the tank and so I like to see guys that are in my age bracket or a little bit ahead of me like, oh, he's going go, I can keep going to full spin. I think a lot of that is just thinking and knowing that you can, because I think so many people feel like, Hey, I'm 45, it's time to settle down. It's time to relax and wind down this exercise. You know? I bet you know, I, I think, but I think that people use that as a disclaimer and not do the work. It's like, now I'm 45, so now I don't, now I don't, I'm too old. For me, I think that's a way out. Right? That's a way to go.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Hey, I don't want to do the work anymore. And you know, I have, uh, my, uh, one of my best friends just passed this last year and he was 85 when he passed. And uh, and he was crazy. I mean, he did the iron man 10 times. The first time was when he was 50. Um, and then he's done the race across America three times and he does just, he was just an animal bang iron every day, ride the bike to just a 85. He was doing all that stuff and animal an animal till the day he died. I was like, wow. And His name was, and this is the irony was his name was don wild man. And so like that's his given name. No, I'm serious. That's, it's amazing. His given name. I go, anybody named the wild man. Got to keep it up. But he was, you know, like you're talking about, uh, when you can see it right.

Speaker 2:          00:15:33       When you, what does it look like when I see, I mean, you look at, it's interesting to see in sports right now. We have a lot of athletes right now that are operating as though they're the oldest that, you know, that they, that we've seen. And I believe a lot of it has to do with the fact that that, uh, you know, that they've have some examples, but they're also not take accepting that, hey, now you're too old like that. Just because that's a decision like, Hey, oh, now you're too old. Oh yeah. You know, you're going to keep doing that. It's like, yeah, you're going to do it all the way until they throw the dirt on the box. You know, like we're going all the way full speed. Until we're not. And then when we're not, we're not, what did Mr Wildman die of?

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       Uh, it was eventually it was a cancer that he couldn't get a fight through chemo. And so, but, but, but it was within like couple of weeks, like he just was like, shut it down. Um, he was at one point, he was like the, he was a little bit like the everready bunny and, and Humpty dumpty, like he would just like double knee surgery, like within, like we hit a broken leg and he'd be on a stationary bike with a crush on one of the pedals and he'd be peddling and crutching well on the other leg, I mean, he was just absolutely out of his mind and, and the doctors would be like, oh, you're healing faster than a 30 year old. And I'm like, yeah, well he's, cause he's just a cardio monster. And so he's getting that blood flow. And, uh, and he, uh, we were helicopters snowboarding in Chile, the s uh, last summer, not this one, but the one before.

Speaker 2:          00:16:59       And I was with the run with the guide and the guy goes, hey, you know, I'll hold your buddy. And I'm like, oh, he's 84 and he looked at me and he's like, yeah, no, no, I mean, but how old is he? And I'm like, he's 84 and he's like, yeah, he's 84. Like, check it out buddy. He's going fakey. And like, I mean, you know, he was, but he was our, he was our poster child. He's our guy. We looked at, we go, I mean, and I've had a few of those. I think it, you know, that I've been exposed to in my life where there's guys that just, those are the guys that I always admired. I always admired the guys that just were always going full speed and never, never sir can, you know, they didn't sir come to all that, all that pressure from society. Like, Hey, you're old now. We can still do that. What do you think you were a kid? Just all the bullshit that you can feed into,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       uh, and, and be a victim of. Yeah. We have these preconceived notions of what it's like to be 30 what it's like to be 50 what it's like to be 85 and some people like, yeah, you could fuck that. I'm not interested. Yeah. Because they're never looking at ages. Some as some like feeling like they're like, they're never going all 35 you feel like this at 40 all you're slowing down now, I'll da Da da. You know, and not get any, just you lay down. It's like, you know, I always say if people stop doing something, like they go, oh, I'm going to retire now, man, I'm getting old in the sport. It's really not that they're getting old, it's just that they've made a decision that they would want to do anymore. And they just used the age as a, like a disclaimer. Like, Hey, I'm, I'm good.

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       You know? Yeah. It was. For some folks, I think it's a mental tiredness for sure. Keeping up their enthusiasm is probably the difficult thing and that's why I think a lot of people look forward to retirement, right? They look forward to those golden years where they just holding hands and walking towards the sunset. Just jump on a sword. I mean, no, I'm sad. I mean it's like at that point you're just so then you're just alive, dead. You know, you're, you're, you're, you're dead, but you're alive. Like, but I think some people look forward to some day where they don't have to struggle then they can't be on earth. Yeah, you can't be, you can't, well you can, I mean like, I'm sorry, the system is a little bit designed to struggle. Everything that we do that's good for us has a, has a certain amount of stress.

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       Just like you want to get that sauna, you want to get on that salt bike, you want to jump in that ring, you want to hike that mountain. It's all stress driven. And the fact is that's our universe. That's the universe we live in. And, and so if you got some other, and you know, and I appreciate, let's hack our way through it and I think there's waste that hacking supports us. We can hack our way to, but only support the things that we're doing, but thinking that you can just hack your way through and not actually suffer, it's impossible. You just, you got to suffer. I also think you don't appreciate the good times unless you suffer absolute outside. I think I appreciate food more when I work out. I appreciate life more. I like doing things more at when I struggle. Absolutely. I can tell you, I know sitting down is an incredible thing.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       Like when you go, wow, this feels so good, I just sit down. Yeah, because you're streaming. Yeah, for sure. But a lot of people don't recognize that that's a lesson. I think people really need to get drilled in their head. It's not that tricky, right. No. I'm going to say this isn't rocket science. This isn't like elaborate. It's available for everybody. Just move. Yeah. Key move. Just keep going. Drive it hard and I can promise you you'll, you'll, you'll sleep better. Like everybody, we have a lot of sleeping issues right now and I'm just like, well, people aren't tired enough. Yeah. Like my daughter was like, oh yeah, you know, having a hard time sleeping. And now she's been banging tennis balls seven hours a day and I'll tell you, she and I have a problem sleeping now. Right. She had been real well. I'm like, yeah, it and I, you know, I think there's a lot of, it's just a lack of movement or this, we just stopped moving.

Speaker 1:          00:20:51       Yeah. And then your brain races because your body's not getting exhausted. So you've develop all this anxiety and all this weirdness. Hunter gatherers did not have the need for Ambien. I guarantee it. Yeah. There was the other day, there was no Melatonin. They were showing me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The melatonin was, was, you know, created in their retina from staring at the sun and the early morning light. I mean that's, they were up, they were moving and they were up early and they were, and they were, and they were going until dark and that dark, it was time to lay down and then you just did that and you were not sleep issues. We're in a problem back then. It's, it's interesting. I'm learning from my dog because my dog is up first thing in the morning when you start things up and then when it starts getting dark out, once he eats, man, he's just laying down.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       He was like, what's up? Chilling over here. Oh yeah. Well and I, I'm a constantly studying my dog. I would have brought him, but he's getting his nails done today. This is really, yeah. Yeah. Well cause he's just ripping up the floor. He's got some hooks but uh, but I watch him never leaves his bed without stretching first in the morning. First thing dumped up dog down, done full up, down dog and then he full speed 80 miles an hour, like a rocket. And then just write to the couch and lay down and then just be totally asleep and then just up full speed back to the couch and lay down. I've got, I go, there's something to be said about that thing. A little stretch, full speed. Lay down. We'll speed laid out like, but no warmup, no warm up. That's no warm up. But people need warm up.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       Do you agree? I don't know if I had, I don't know. I don't know about, I don't know about warm up. I think warm up is being alive. I think you know, I mean, I mean never warmed up. I mean, what's that? What about if you're going to lift something heavy? Do you think that you should warm the muscles up first? Well, I think if you set the thing up and you put everything on and you set it all up, you're already starting to warm up and if you're psyching up and getting your brain ready to do something aggressive, I think that you've already, the adrenaline's already going and you've got a lot of stuff. I mean, I know if you just get up off the chair and walk over and try to grab a giant bar with a bunch of weight on it and lift it, that might be a problem.

Speaker 1:          00:22:57       But that wouldn't be, you would never do that in nature when you were going to lift something heavy. It usually, there'd be some lead up to it, whether you walk to the place that you were gunning when you've got the thing. And, you know, I mean, you know, I don't know. I don't know about about, cause I think there's mixed opinions about, you know, people say don't stretch before you work out. And that's been the most recent thing before it used to be all yeah. Loosen up before you work out. And I'm like, I mean my dog does down dog, you know, up dog down dog. And that's only after he's laying down and then he just goes full speed at, I mean well I know that if I do Moitai if I'm hitting the bag or something like that, I don't go hard at first to break a sweat.

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       I do the first two rounds, I'm just shadowboxing. Yeah. I'm just putting, I mean I don't fully full blast the bag until I'm sweaty. Yeah. But that's just my thoughts. I mean I just, I feel like that's the way you're supposed to do. That's what I've always been told. Yeah. When, I mean I think the, I think I would connect that more did part of it is because of what we are now. [inaudible] cause I sedentary and cause, yeah, we're not, we're not what we, you know, we are not fully in our, in our nature essence, we're not, we're not wild. You know, if we were wild, I think we would need as much any warmup up. When you're wild, you don't need a warm up. But I think because we're not moving as much because if you're moving all the time, you'd already be warmed up there.

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       Would like to see a human from like 5,000 years ago. I'd love to be around like a hunter gatherer and see what they looked like. Their pain threshold was crazy. First of all, they are what they could endure. You know, their pain threshold was just [inaudible] of the cycle of pro bono arm and be like, we'd still be operating with broken stuff. No problem. What did they do? They just kind of like tied it up or something. I mean, I don't know what that was. That was when they advanced into medical, right? Yeah. A lot of them probably just hobbled around until it didn't hurt. That's where inflammation came in. Everything got inflamed. So they would hold it, you know, naturally the body would hold it in position so that you, I mean inflammation is designed to kind of immobilize a cast. It, it would, you know, if it was your ankle, it just gets so swollen I couldn't move but they'd still be on it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:06       They'd still be role and it just, they wouldn't be moving it around because the body would naturally do down the future of humans is not look so rosy when you really think about how we're slowly deteriorating becoming these gelatinous balls of meat and what issue and the bodies are connected to the brains. And so that's why we have some mind issues too because at the end of the day, the bodies aren't functioning correctly so that it's not feeding the brain correctly. And so the brain, that's why we, I mean I think that when you're really physically well then your thoughts are physically well. I think it's definitely, it definitely helps. But people do not like to hear that. Do you notice that you noticed that? Yeah, absolutely. If you don't, I didn't even like you, like you seem like a happy guy, you know, I don't care if you're on any medication, but some people who are want to think like, no, no, no, I have a medical problem and I need this.

Speaker 1:          00:25:59       Even if they don't exercise, they go, no, no, no. You don't understand. And then if I say, okay, but do you ever exercise, they get mad at you. Absolutely. They get mad. Like, absolutely you're, you're suggesting I'm lazy, but you're suggesting I brought this upon myself because of my behavior. I know I have a disease. Yeah, no way. Again, I think that's a disclaimer that's a way out. To not have to take, be accountable, be accountable. Like, Hey, that if I was out doing moving and doing things that it would actually make this go away. You know? I mean, I, I think that, uh, you know, I think a lot of, a lot of depression is connected to, to the, you know, I believe ice icing could cure a big PR portion of, of depression just because of the hormonal to the system and the, you know, I mean normally when people are depressed is connected to some sort of hormone imbalance and to have a doctor tried to figure out what that is, it's pretty elaborate.

Speaker 1:          00:26:54       That's pretty tricky. Well, they've shown in studies that regular exercise is as effective at ssrs or more. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. I think also diet because of inflammation, the inflammation for sure leads to all sorts of different ailments, which could lead to a depressed feeling, feeling of unwellness well just eat a bunch of garbage for a week and see how you feel. Yeah, I can talk, I'd be depressed or just drink some layers to the coffee stuff. That shit, man. So the sauna thing, what is the benefit of getting it that hot? Well [inaudible] I know they said, honestly, my problem is, is that, you know, if, if, if a lot is good, then even more is better than, you know, that's a little bad to my, we're both like, Hey, no, I'm just saying like, yeah, you know, if ten's good than 20 he's got to be even better.

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       But you know, I think part of it is the natural evolution. If you're sitting there doing time at, you know, 180 degrees and you, and you can go on there and you're, you know, you're hanging out and then just 20 minutes, it's 30 minutes. So you might as well just try to turn it up. And, and, and my understanding is that the Europeans, I mean, I'd be, you know, you look at a sweat lodge and you, I mean, it ain't one 80 you know, if you go into any kind of sweat lodge, if you go to Europe, all the Saunas are a much hotter. Like, it's like you go into a rush and, you know, steam thing. It's not like those things are, you know, I, I think that they're pretty conservative with it. I think. I think you just listen to your body. If you'd go in there and you start hallucinating, you might want to step out, you know, you might be like, Hey, you know, uh, maybe I eat something wrong or maybe I need to just get my body a break.

Speaker 1:          00:28:38       But I think you just use your, you know, use your, your, your own feeling, uh, as a, as your guide and, and you know, I know that I, if I, if I'm height properly hydrated before I go, my tolerance is substantially greater. Like I can really measure it. I can be hydrated, go in and be like, oh yeah, no problem. And I can go and dehydrated and feel wonky and be like, hmm, yeah, I'm not as good. So that makes sense. Yeah. I definitely have adapted. I've definitely adapted to 200 degrees because when I go to yoga now, it does not seem nearly as hot 105 degrees. Even at the end of the class, I'm like, this is interesting. I was thinking of the last class, I was like, this doesn't feel that bad. Exactly. Yeah. Well that shows you right there that you're adapting and then all of a sudden your tolerance. You know, a thing I really like about the sauna is I think it really plays into into overheating as an athlete. It over, you know, you overheat and that's usually when you have issues, right? As you overheat and then you and then you, your performances is encumbered, right? You just see it and so the more your tolerance is for the heat, the less, the more

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       you can handle overheating. Pretty soon you don't overheat and then you just don't have that cause that, that, that's one of the factors that gets an athlete I think as in any performance as you overheat, if, whether you're fighting or marathon running or basketball, any sport, when you start to overheat your, that's usually when you're, you're toast, you're done, you start losing your motor skills and you're tall. If you can build that tolerance up. And I think, like you said, hey, if I go into 202 20 and then all of a sudden you're at Yoga, uh, you know, you're at hot yoga and it's 105 and you're just like [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:30:16       Yeah, it really does make a giant difference. I've only been doing it at 200 for a couple months now. Really in to 10. Look for, like I said, last few days. Yeah. But you have been doing it this hot for how long? Well, I've been doing it for a while, like I've been doing, it's been over the last couple of years. You know, I did one, I did a protocol that, uh, I heard on a doctor, Rhonda Patrick's a show and, and it was a holding, uh, a one hour, a one hour straight at somewhere between 170 to 180. Whoa. So that's another, and you, if you do that 10 days in a row, I was doing it twice a day for 10 days in a row. And you're supposed to get like some 1600% hormonal boosts, like your whole body just goes into this radical hormone [inaudible] 72 one 80, somewhere in that, right?

Speaker 2:          00:31:02       Yep. Interesting. One 71 day, one hour straight. I was doing that and I'd get it twice a day for 10 days in a row. And, and, and uh, and, and, and at the end of that, you've got a different gear. It's like all of a sudden you got o d in your, in your, in your, in your gearbox. Interesting. Well, it definitely increases the red blood cell count. Correct? Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I don't know all the science. I just usually go off of, you know, I usually go off of, uh, of instinct and then, and then I, and then sometimes it gets validated by, by science and so at the end, you know, [inaudible] I mean, I, I think and, and I, and there really isn't any, any studies on it, but I truly believe that, that, that he is better after performance for recovery than ice.

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       I mean, I think isis comfortable. Um, I had my, uh, I don't have a whole thing about paying a relationship with pain and, and I was doing a thing with, uh, I had a hip hip replacement and, uh, I was set up to do all this icing before and, and then I learned that icing suppress the, the, the, uh, healing hormone, IGF one, there's a healing hormone that helps your body heal and pain is kicks that hormone off. That's how the body knows. So when you suppress pain, you stopped that healing. So you're going ice, you suppress that hormonal release of IGF one, it's the healing hormone and all of a sudden it's going to slow your healing down. So if you do it cause it makes you comfortable, like, Hey, if you've been, you know, running around in your overheating and you're gonna go on ice tub because it feels good, that's one thing.

Speaker 2:          00:32:35       But if you think that it's going to benefit, I'm not sure. I don't know yet. I think he could be the better benefit because you've got heat shock proteins, which deal with damage cells and all that stuff. Um, and I'm not listening. I, this is just stuff that I hear that I'm feeling and then just claim we're both love dogs. Yeah. Fall. Yeah. Dennis Miller, this is my opinion. I could be wrong of course. So you know, the uh, but uh, you know, so that, that, that and, and, and then they talk about growth hormone that your body produces growth hormone in the heat, right. As another one of the side effects. And so, uh, from a, again, from my understanding, and I'm not a doctor, um, so I, I, when I hear that, I go, well, and heat should be the thing you do because after every game, every football, every basketball player, every athlete goes right to the ice tub.

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       Yeah. I think if you're going there for comfort, okay, cool, that's great. But if you think that that's actually the thing that's really benefited, you know, really going to bring you the best recovery, maybe, maybe heat's going to bring you the best recovery, but it's going to be miserable. Because last thing you want to do after you finish a workout, it's go sit in a hotbox. Just not, yeah, interest, happy. But these, but for injuries though, for injuries, they say you should reduce the inflammation. But if what you're saying that's interesting, right? Well, the more pain, the more, you know, you know, the old saying no pain, no gain, right? No fruit, no pain, no gain, no pain, no gain. I mean, everything's painful. Like if you go on the heat, it's just comfortable. You going to workout, you get sore. I mean, no pain, no gain.

Speaker 2:          00:34:00       So if we go with the old, that old, you know, no pain, no gain. I believe that the pain is associated with the healing because of that hormonal response that pain brings into you. So, um, I would attribute like I had a s a fast recovery, but I, I attribute some of it is because that I was not suppressing any of the pain. So if, I think if you take pain meds, that's suppressing healing. So if you say, Hey, I'm so uncomfortable, I gotta pop pain pills to, to endure this because it's so hard, we'll then just extend the healing that you're just going to. And the more you suppress the pain, no matter which way you do it with its ice pain, pills, whatever it is, I believe the longer you extend the healing, the more pain you can take. I mean inflammation is the marker for that healing hormones.

Speaker 2:          00:34:46       So again, reduce inflammation. I don't know if that's, that's again I would like to a a doctor to and somebody to tell me that really has a study that's that they know that they've really looked at to tell me that that's really working, that, that the icing. I mean if you do it immediately right when you get, you know, you snap your ankle and you go right in a nice tub bucket and keep it from fully, uh, you know, inflaming maybe in the, in that instantaneous, but doing it over days and I think that's just paint. I think that's just comfortable making more comfortable. That's interesting because you always see basketball players ice on their shoulders, ice on their knees like right after games cause they have clay comfortable. Yeah. I was just thinking that they have to play so many games in a row though.

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       Yeah. But it's also comfort, comfort. Like, I mean, I think it's because it feels good if your shoulders all jacked up and you numb it, you know, just like a pain pill would do. And this is just a topical numbing icing, just creating, uh, the, you know, the guy that, uh, that created rice, which is like rest, ice compression and elevation. He came out last year and said I was all wrong. So no, he did. That guy came out and just here. Well then the last two, couple of years he felt really bad. Well, I'm saying so he came out and said, you know, that he, he was, you know, that he, he, he takes it all back. So I, you know, I dunno. I mean, I just think, I think there's no absolutes. I don't, I, but I, I, I'd be interested, I've been trying to learn about it.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       Like, Hey, can you really tell me what really is the best thing? Or maybe it's heat, Nice Combo, you know, that, that heat, Nice Combo because that does so much flushing to the system, you know, squeeze down the ice, squeezes everything. And then all of a sudden the heat expand. So your contraction expansion and that, I know that that is, uh, you know, but that takes energy to that tires you down more than you know, than the, than the heat. But you do do ice bath, he ice pass heath back to back. Yeah, I'll do it. Like sometimes I'll take, I'll do it on a Sunday, I'll do like seven rounds of that stuff, you know, nine or you just get tired. You get, you get, you know, you're well, that's why we want the intensity. Right, right. So the colder it is, the shorter you have to be there and the hotter it is, a shorter, you have to be there.

Speaker 2:          00:37:03       So if you're hanging out, so if you could get it down to 15 minutes and you know, three to five minutes and let's say three minutes in the ice in 15 minutes in the, in the sauna, then all of a sudden, you know, let's say 20 minutes around then your tea, you know, then here you, here you go, you got, you know, two and a half, three hours, you know, that's why one seven, two, one 80 you do a whole hour versus, yeah, but that's a whole different protocol. That was just a, when I heard about, and I just try, I tried it. Paul, part of it is cause hard to stay in that thing for an hour straight at 170. I mean it's, that's not an easy task. Are you listening to anything in there or are you just the beat in my heart, not putting anything in the music or anything.

Speaker 2:          00:37:45       Yeah, I'll listen to music or something like that or a more a podcast or get somebody else to suffer with me. Uh, yeah, just to get some, try to try to set hard, try to get somebody else and maybe they come in for half and then they're back out and then they come in for the other part of something. When I'm on the road, I tried to get comedians to come on the song with me at a hotel and it's only like 150, 116. They're like, I'm out. I'm like, you're out here for 15 minutes, say shit. So it's all, but it's all what year? It's, it's in your brain. It's in your mind. It's, it's, we're so, uh, you know, domesticated for so domesticated. Oh, it's hot. It's cold. It's this. And you know, we're just, we're, we're as this something that you, or is this the, the whole surfing community?

Speaker 2:          00:38:31       Are they end of this kind of stuff? Uh, no. I mean, I, I, I, well, you know what's interesting is, is because I'm a surfer, obviously everybody thinks, oh, you know, all the surfers and you're friends with the surfers. I remember actually I had not, I really am kind of outside of the community itself. I have sir friends at surf, but I'm so not part of, you know, and in my career, I haven't been part of the industry of surfing and, and uh, really, so in a way I'm, I mean, I have friends that surf that come and do it and we've definitely, there's been some influence into surfers in general, at least the good ones, or are, you know, training and, and, and using these ice heat protocols. And so they're, they're, they're, uh, you know, they're, they're aware and, and motivated. Uh, but the, but surfing in general is, you know, uh, I mean, I don't even know what half those guys are doing.

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       Well, I would think that they would be looking to you. I mean, if, if I was a young surfer and say, man, I fucking love surfing, I'd like to be doing this when I'm 55 was Laird Hamilton doing? Yeah. But I don't know. But I think sometimes the, you know, I mean, I think for a lot of, obviously it's changed now, but in the past, I mean, you know, and it happens a lot with the younger people in general. Uh, is just like, don't tell me what to do. I can eat whatever I want and do whatever I want. Yeah. I can go to Taco Bell and Burger King and, and still, and stay up all night and still, you know, rip, you know, or do or do my thing. And it's true probably in every sport. Um, and then, and then, you know, I always say there's a thousand, you know, 20 year olds and then there's 530 years olds and then there's 250, 40 year olds.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       And then there's like, you know, and then he'd just go as you go and, uh, there's less and less. And it, you know, I always loved that, uh, the term, the victory through attrition. You know, when you just the last guy, if you're, this allows guy and you're standing, you don't even have to be any good. You'd just, when you're like the winter, like you won, you're the only guy left. I kind of things. Yeah. I like that. Just you, you've been following this just to improve your physical performance just for life. Absolutely. Absolutely. And, and, uh, you know, I, I think I really cherish, I cherish, uh, feeling good. I care's feeling good. Like I really enjoy feeling good. And so that drives me towards, you know, wanting, and like I said, either whether I had Paul Chek years ago, uh, went and did an assessment with him and he's an interesting guy.

Speaker 2:          00:40:55       Very, yeah. And Watson and stuff a lot online. Yeah. And, and, uh, him and I had a, an instant connection and, and, but, you know, I love the philosophical approach to certain things. Like he said, and this had a huge impact on me, you know, 25 years ago, or he was like, you know, the three white devils are white flour, white sugar, and white milk. And I'm like, okay, like drink. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just put [inaudible] on it. But if you couldn't rock a cow and raw milk together, that's a powerful drink. Yeah. That's for real. But if you put dead milk, homogenized, pasteurized, yeah, just abused. And then you, and then you take some really bad cacau if there's any at all in it with a bunch of, who knows? You can't pronounce it, you know, he said, uh, if it wasn't here 10,000 years ago, don't eat it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:43       Uh, and if you can't pronounce it, don't eat it. You know? And then the three white devils, I mean, that's a philosophical hard time with turmeric though. Yeah. Why? Let's just say the word oh struggled. Pronounced. Yeah, but it was your 10,000 years ago, so you've covered some fun. Yeah. Those are good pieces of advice though. Yeah. But just to look at food that way, it's like people go, what's your diet? I go, plants and animals, plants and animals. Like what? You don't like it don't make it difficult. Don't be like, well, I eat this and debt. I think that the stress around that stuff is crazy, but I, I, I really believe that to truly be, to have optimum performance and to be, and to be optimum that you have to have the whole every spoke in the tire that you need, every single spoke, that you have to have a good relationship with your family.

Speaker 2:          00:42:33       You got to have love and you got to have good things with your kids and you've got to have friends and you got to have your health and you've got to sleep well and you've got to be hydrated and you've got to work out and you've got, and you've got to have a, you know, your business thing and you've got to have, I think you just have to have all these things to really have balance. And I think if you, if, if one of the spokes isn't tight that there's a bump in the wheel and then you're just not gonna, I don't truly believe that that you, you're performing at your optimum because you need, your head needs to be clear when you go into your performance, whatever that looks like. I think that's excellent advice. I think that makes a lot of sense. And it definitely keeps your mind clear.

Speaker 2:          00:43:10       You know, you have your bases covered, covered. You're not just, you're not here but there, but somewhere else. I mean, and I know I've dealt with not being, having all the spokes good. And I know that the, how that feels, and I know when it's good, you're, you're clear, you're good. Yeah. You're, you're, you're, you're, and it's how we're meant to be. I mean, we're meant to have that be real clean. We're meant to have that there be some silence. Balance. Got To have it. Yeah. That's why, I mean, even overworking mean people think that, you know, I think that's a badge of honor. Yeah. Yeah. Like, Oh yeah, I worked, I think, and I don't sleep and Dah, Dah, Dah. I'm like, Oh yeah, well then you're compromising yourself. I told the Ilan Mustang digital. Yeah, I was, I went to space x one time and I pulled him aside.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       He was standing out and go, hey, you know, you got to take care of this, but my hand on his chest, I just go, yeah, take care of this. But you've got to take care of you. What'd he say? He just, she had the, I don't know if he understood he's a robot. Yeah. He, I don't think he understood that he barely a person. I'm just saying, I don't think he, no, I don't think it with all due respect and, yeah, but I don't think he understood what I meant. I, I didn't, I felt like, you know, someone like that if they were really taking good care of themselves, getting the right sleep, getting in the right food, getting a workout, all those things. I imagine, imagine like, if they can do what they're doing, you know, burning it on both ends. Imagine what they could do fully balanced. Well, I don't think he wants to do any more than what he's doing. I just think he's so with

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       getting Tesla to run correctly on, he was sleeping on the floor of the Tesla factory and working 17 hours a day. I mean that's, that is, that's an insane person. I mean, he was just there all day long trying to make it work in it. Obviously it does work. They are amazing cars. Yeah. Everything's, yeah. It's, it's beneficial. Yeah. This drive that he has, but I agree with you like for overall enjoyment of life, that's not the way to go about it. You have a blockage there though too. I think if you don't, can't pull back and look at it from a distance you and you're in it. I think you get too detailed and then you can't, you know, you can't be, I think you, I think it could be better because of that. I think maybe, maybe it'd be profitable. Yeah. It's hard. It's a hard fucking business.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       I mean, you're, you're competing against the big boys. Yeah. Right. But what's interesting is even though they are doing that, they've managed to, he's managed to make something that's so different than anything else. You have one that now I don't, fuck man. They're crazy. Yeah. I was reluctant. I told him I buy one when he did the podcast. Yeah. But I was like, God damn. And I like muscle cars. All, I hear an engines. But I drove that thing. I was like, Oh, other cars are stupid. They're all stupid. They are, they're archaic. They are here to that thing. They are well and healthy. And you see all the companies going that way. Now you can see, I mean we were cause uh, my buddy, while Ben and I were into electric stuff and uh, and we went and there was a guy that has electric dragster and we went down and with this electric director and it just smoked any top fuel dragster, like beyond at, but it didn't make noise, so no one wanted to watch it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       So I mean, and you're like, what? I'm been, no, no, no smell, no noise, no flames. Right. You know, and tell him no good still burning gas. No, no, no pollution, no pollution. So people were like, oh, that's no fun. So yeah, but when you drive a Tesla, like I've a the model s p 100 d I think it was called, when you drive it, it's effortless. Like everything, just you just go where you want to go. Like I like to be over there. It's like a video gal. Like all of a sudden you're over there. Well you have to get used to it cause I've been in them and driven, driven him. And it's interesting how the body has to acclimate to the acceleration because you're used to that jolting shifting, you know, first gear, second gear, third gear, all that delay like a, it's like ac versus DC.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       Normal cars are like Acu, a little gap between the power and when you get that, you know, it's, it's, the body has to get used to the, I'm still not totally okay with not looking where you're going and just flip it on auto pilot. But I guess that's, yeah, the next generation, well that's fun on the highway, but yeah, I look where I'm going to keep my hand on the wheel, but it is fun to like shut 10% of your brain off and just let the car kind of handle the speed and one it does it well. Does it well, does it well? Yeah. Well, I just, like I said, I think you need a person who's as obsessed as Elon Musk is to make something like that. But I agree with you if, if, if he wants to enjoy his life, well, just live longer.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       They have more ideas, have more influence, like just be, I am only speaking that way. I've just been in the way of optimizing him, right? Talk to mizing him for it because of his, he's so amazing that, okay, let's optimize your amazingness by, by making you like be healthier, like be take care of yourself so you can be around longer and maybe do more great things. Right? So it's again, I, you know, I'm just speaking personally, but when you try to look at optimization, right? Like you're here, you only get so long, you know, what are you doing and, and are you really optimizing it by, by, you know, burn by, by taxing the system and not, not getting all of it that out of it that you, you know, but I guess in a way it's kind of like unhappiness, you know, people use that as a workout.

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       So that's a little bit, it makes you tired and you're get hungry and you know, yeah, there's always that. Well, it's the choices you make, right? Like sometimes you just get stuck in the momentum of the choice that you made and it's very difficult to like take that pause and go, okay, am I doing this the right way? Maybe I need to reset. We needed to just take some time to really consider if this is making me happy and how many years I'm going to be able to do this and sustain it. Yeah. Well that's a tricky thing, right? That's a, that's a, that's a self self, uh, you know, analyzing yourself and putting that up is, I think it's easier just to keep going the direction you're going to take some Adderall and keep it in the can go full speed. How long have you been living in Hawaii?

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       Uh, well my mom took me from San Francisco and I was six months old. Whoa. Wow. Pretty much. It was only a technicality that I wasn't born there, which actually worked against me because you know, when you're not born, then when you're not born there, then you're not from there. So they're low. You're not born here and they're like, oh yeah, but I've been here since I was, you know, since I can remember. So let's just put it that way. Right. Remember actually worked, they still hold it against you the six months that you weren't oh yeah. Oh yeah, we missed you bro. Oh, it's months. We're, yeah, yeah. Paying them out of your mother here in the state. But yeah. But yeah, since I was a little kid, I mean my mom took me, uh, I was born in San Francisco and she took me when I was a few months old.

Speaker 1:          00:49:41       I have a theory about people from Hawaii. There's a groundedness that they seem to exhibit that is universal. It's almost, you very rarely find completely frivolous, dopey people that live in Hawaii that they're not. Yeah, I'm sure you find some people that are not that smart, but you, there's a groundedness. There is so many of them have because they're on a volcano. Yeah. Ocean. And you know, it was interesting that you talk about that because yesterday we were having a conversation about what is that right. And we have a term, a couple terms. One of them is Mana, which is the power from the land. Another one is Aloha, which is our kind of a spirit of how people act, uh, from Hawaii. But I believe it has a lot to do with islanders. I think islanders have that. And I, and it has a lot to do with, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       it has a lot to do with the ocean being around the ocean that the ocean surrounding you and the ocean is the most conductive substance on earth. So elect electrically and there's all this thing. So you get influenced by this, you know, and I think energetically the nature is so powerful. I think it puts us into a, there's a certain kind of humility that you have when you're in that you're next to a volcano that's 14,000 foot and you've got a 2000 foot waterfall and you got a giant wave. I mean, this is stuff that kind of goes, oh yeah, we're just a little ants. We're this little specks and we don't, it's humbling, but it's also inspiring and energizing. Gives you power. The Mana, Mana. I've always wondered why people that live in peach communities are, they're so chill. Like I've wondered, is that because of just the humility that you get when you just looking at the ocean, the Blue Boomerang, have you ever seen that book?

Speaker 2:          00:51:19       No. It's called the blue mind. The guy's pretty interesting and he does a study of why we gravitate towards being on the beach, why all the most expensive real estate is beach front. And that something about when we stare at the ocean, they did all these studies where the, it just totally lights the brain up. That our whole something about the horizon and about the ocean itself, that that affects our whole wellbeing. Uh, and, and part of it, we don't even know why, but we're just drawn like, why, you know, why is, why are we drawn there? Why do we, you know, and it has, it has, uh, you know, an effect on our system. I wonder if that's because we evolved to be close to the water because that's where the bounty is, where you can get fish. And while we evolved from the water without true, so here we call that the, the whole aquatic ape theory.

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       If you ever, yeah, no, I haven't really, uh, you know, uh, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't really studied that. I, I mean, you know, I, I know that, I know that when you're around dolphins and when you're around Wales, um, how, and like, you know, it's interesting today I was in the ocean and, and I, and I felt something was around and I could feel it. I just knew something was around. And then it just five, 10 minutes later, a big sea lion kind of popped its head up and went. But I could feel before, uh, but, but you know, when you're around those animals that are in the ocean, you definitely feel a kindred spirit with them unlike you do with land, animals, you know, you don't really have that mean. I mean, okay, maybe a wolf for dogs because we were connected with them for 30,000 years.

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       We have that relationship. You feel s something with a dog. But, uh, but with the sea animals, like I say, when the dolphins come around and you're, you just feel some kind of, there's just some there, you know, and they say they've done some studies with, you know, dolphins, how would they effect kids that have, you know, different, uh, uh, disabilities and stuff and how it, it totally helps them. And, and so there's some healing ability and actually dolphins are capable of having a collective consciousness. And that's why they, when they get surrounded, the big ones don't just jump out of the net. They, everybody stays together. So they, but, but again, you know, the aquatic eight, but the, that were from the ocean. I mean, listen, we call it the super life, right? They ocean is the, is the reason why this, why were we were here and why we can be here?

Speaker 2:          00:53:41       Because if it wasn't for that, we would be, it'd be Mars and it'd be hard to live there. Yeah. There's a, this something that attracts you to it. It's very strange. It's very true when you stand there, just so you could, it's peaceful just to sit down at the beach and just stare out at the blue. It is. Yeah. Well the blue mind is a great book. It's a beautiful book about talks about that and the science behind that and the effect it has on our system. But you know, in a way watching the ocean move is a little bit like watching a fire. You know how fire is mesmerizing. You have a fireplace and you just watch the flames move while the ocean has that movement. Um, and, and, uh, and, uh, I'll sometimes I'll go to the beach and I'll do a headstand and stand and look at the ocean upside down, which is crazy because now it's the ocean is the sky and the waves are moving opposite to what your brain is used to.

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       So it, it, it, it's, you know, it's something when I'm doing, when I'm bored at the beach. Do you think you could ever live in a city? Um, I've stayed in a city for a little while before. I mean, I moved to Manhattan at one point. We lived in, yeah, I lived in Manhattan when I was about 17 or 18. I had some friends that used to come to Hawaii. They lived in Manhattan and they invited me back for the summer and I lived there for a summer. Um, and, uh, you know, it was dangerous for me to be there. That was dangerous because you're kind of more trying to pull the wild, you're a little more wild, you know, you're a little more like an animal and then you're like, you're in confinement, you know, and there's just not enough nature. Like I go to central park and swing off trees and stuff, but that, you know, that you only set only didn't so much.

Speaker 2:          00:55:17       How old were you at the time? Like 17 or something like that. You felt like a real urge to be around nature always. Yeah, always pulled. Pulled too. I mean, I would just go to central park all the time. Yeah, no, that's interesting. Yeah, I was just, I needed that. And you know, people don't realize when they lived there, but when you, when you're in a place with giant cement buildings, you know, they're tall, you're in fight or flight the whole time because the big, yeah, because you're, you're threatened by these big masses that could fall over and hit. Yeah, absolutely. And you intuitively, you're living in that and then the noise and all of the, all the people. Cause I, you know, I, I grew up sitting in the back of the class, right. I, I go to a restaurant, I find a chair against the wall. Like I, I go look for a chair and go, where's, you know, I'll sit in the corner. I want to see what's coming. I like to see what's coming. So, and you go, you know, you go to New York and there's just, you're bombarded from every single angle and so you're in fight or flight. You're just, you're constantly on guard too. You know? You don't know what's gonna. You know, I'll take my chances in the ocean. Yeah. I love

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       visiting. Yeah. I love visiting. Yeah. But as far as living there, man, I just don't in my, my friend Jeff lives there and he's like the energy of the city who talks about the energy. It's amazing. I'm like, okay, well it's retail therapy too. Yeah. Retail pair. They said, we tell Mecca gets why every woman in the world moves there. The other along the shop shop, shop, and then your friend goes, there's a lot of energy here is all the people. People are moving, they're doing things and makes me want to do things. Yeah. But I want to do things anyway. I don't need that. Yeah. Yeah. Well we weren't meant to live stacked on top of each other. That's not in our nature. That's done in our biology. Now is there an abundance of everything? Yeah, there's a lot of things that make it attractive right into the tree.

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       True. I mean, there's beautiful women that make it attractive. There's don't blow all the food you ever wanted to make it attractive. You know, there's all, there's an abundance of stuff and there's always something you do. You go to the theater, you don't have to be self motivated, you don't have to be self driven, right. You can just, there's always three, you know, 10 parties and a bunch of things and speakers and Cyan and just anything you can think of, there's every aspect of it. So I think that's has an attractiveness about it. But in our essence, do we belong in these, these metropolises? Mm. They don't really have any in nature that we, so we wouldn't actually, that wouldn't be a place that, you know, and we can only handle so many people at once anyway. Like we can only have real intimate relationships with like a hundred and, I don't know, 130 people or something.

Speaker 1:          00:57:54       Some crazy. That's like one fifth yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm, what I'm fascinated by though, is that these things exist everywhere and it's, cities exists in almost every single country. There's a place like a Manhattan or like in la where everybody is just jammed in together. Like what is it about people that makes us want to live like this? That's an interesting thing. That's an interesting question. Why are we attracted to that, to that? Well, the abundance, you know, that we're all, and we're, we're drawn to go where everybody wants to go a little bit like sheep, you know, like we all go where everybody wants to go. Opportunity. I mean, there's all these things that, you know, why does every, why, why did, why does every city draw every young person from the countryside, right? Because of opportunity and excitement and possibility. The possibilities.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       My friend Michael Mouse was on the show yesterday and he was telling me that he was choking. He swallowed a piece of food and he got it stuck in his throat and he went to a table in Manhattan. He was in Manhattan and he was like, I'm choking. And he said this to this table people, and he said, this woman just stared at him with no reaction, like didn't smile on anything and he coughed in the food, came up, he goes, I was choking to death. And she said, well, you should take smaller bites. Like just the harshness, the harshness of New York. It's like the, the, the value of a human being is so, so much less because there's so many of them. Yeah, that's true. That's a problem in the earth. Yeah. Right now our value for, and we become such a void where we become such voyeurs of like, we'll, I'll just watch you die.

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       I'll just, I'll get a video of it and put it, you know, post the stuff that's, I mean, yeah. Instead of like, wow, that guy needs help. He's hurting. Let's let me help him right now. It's like, wow, let's see. You know what I mean? You see it's a, it's a strange phenomenon. You'll get more help when there's less people around then you will, when there's all the people around. Yeah. They'll, Debbie thought a thousand people and they'll all just sit there and stare at a guy that's bleeding to death, where when there's two people there, one of the people will tourniquet the guy's leg. Right, right, right. Look, if you've met, if you saw someone in the woods fall and break their leg and was just you two, you'd feel totally connected to that person. Whereas if you saw someone who's 100 people around, the guy falls or gets hit by a car, you're like, well that ain't my problem.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       That ain't my problem. And everybody goes, that's not my problem. So I mean you the fusion of responsibility. Yeah. It happens in large groups of people. You feel like somebody is going to handle this and no one does. Yeah, no one does. So yeah, there was a video that I watched recently of this guy. There was a, I don't know what was happening, but it was outside at night, some sort of a nightclub, sort of a situation. This woman hit this guy and this guy knocked out this one woman and then another girl came out of me, knocked her out too. And the guys filming it. Someone's filming it and then not doing anything about it. No one's, no one's tackling this guy. No one's grabbing. The guy runs away successfully and then the LAPD put a thing out looking for this guy. I'm like, how the fuck does the guy with the camera live with themselves?

Speaker 1:          01:00:51       How did you just exit them? Exact guy punched to women. Exactly, exactly. Unless you're a woman too. And the only kind of what this guy fucking me up to, I don't know who all, you just hit him with a brick then if I mean, you know, whatever. I mean just saying, just, you know, drive your car, you drive your car on them. I'm just wondering, you know, but it's, it is strange how we lose our humanity in these jobs. We're doing it more to them now. Just with all of the, there's a bunch of factors that are playing in, into, into that right into, into us. Kind of separating ourselves from the person next door. They're right there, but we're, we're over here. We're on our, on our device looking down, and they're right next to us and we're like, it's almost like we pray.

Speaker 1:          01:01:33       We think that that's an invisible screen. Yeah. This is all the thing about Hawaii that I've always found interesting. So you kind of know everybody, so you can't be an asshole. That's a beautiful thing. Yeah. You accountability, accountability, you're going to see him at the, you're going to see him at the store in five minutes. So either you work it out and you agree that you don't like each other and it's just like an accepted thing and, or you work it out and you get through it. Yeah. I love that. Well, I love that about small towns to small towns have the same thing. But the thing about an island, it's a small town with the notion around it. So there's really nowhere to go. And you live on Kauai? Yeah, I grew up on Cola. How many people live there? About 60 something now. 65,000 or so. That's hilarious. Yeah, that's less than the big island, which is pretty, but it's big

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       giant and Chinese like a hundred something, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I lived on Maui for a while, um, as well, but I grew up on Coleco eyes. My, the is my, you know, that's my, that's got my heart. It opens my heart. So gorgeous. They're gorgeous. And then you've got Honolulu, which might as well be Chicago or something. Absolutely. It's like city problem. Absolutely. Annual city problems and a heavy military. So they have a huge military, you know, and in the military, uh, influences a city like any, any, any city that it has no military next to it. If there's an effect that the military has on the city. Sure. In Honolulu has that Honolulu is connected to the military cause you got Pearl Harbor, all of that stuff. So, and then a million people, which is insane. Insane. I'm the only NP gathering pay. Honolua means the gathering place.

Speaker 2:          01:03:07       So it's like where everybody goes to, you know, and that's where the state capitol is. That's our whole, that's our, that's Waikiki. That's, you know, that, what does that one place become so populated? It's, I tend to him, I don't know why it's, it's, you know, I think it has to do with, if you look at most places that cities have been created, it's usually some geographical design, some shaped like a good harbor and obviously Honolulu's and incredible harbor. So great harbor, great protection. Um, so that probably has a lot to do with, with, uh, the fact that it was developed. Like it was because of the nature of, and it was, you know, I used to say it like if you went to Rio de Janeiro and no one was there and you showed up one day with a boat and there was no one had built anything, it would be amazing if you showed up in Manhattan and you went up the Hudson and you pulled up onto that island, you'd be like, wow, this place is amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:04:05       So in most of these places, you know, if you're in Paris and you went in the sand went around it, you'd be like, wow, this. So most, most of the places where cities have been developed are amazing geographical locations. And then they, out of necessity, they were easy to get through with boat. You know, that that has a big factor to it. There's always some sort of, you know, Stra strategic, there's something to astray, you know, being a strategic partner, a location as well. But yeah, well, I don't know why Honolulu, I, other than great for moring and harbors and unprotected, real protected, all that Pearl Harbor stuff is very protected. And so that made it very easy to develop. If you didn't live there, what do you think you'd live in another planet?

Speaker 2:          01:04:54       I Love Alaska. You know, I, but I don't think I honestly, you know, uh, both Gabby and I had been, uh, splitting the years for, since we met and I realized that I am, I'm nomadic. Like I'm, or I'm that I really like, like the animals. I like to move in a season. It feels more natural actually. And I, we, I kind of, with my daughters, we of influence them that way, but I don't want to be anywhere all the time. That's what I really realized. I realized that I'm not good. Then I just, there's, well you'll get caught up in a domestic with your neighbor and you'll just, they're just, there's something about being in one location all year round and it feels more natural to move according to the seasons. Right? Like, Hey, it's summertime energize you go to, you know, we come to California in the summer, the surface down in Hawaiian in the summertime.

Speaker 2:          01:05:43       That's when the waves are flat. So there's, they don't, I don't have the sea to, which means I would shifted to other land stuff. It brings a whole set of opportunities. It's like why would we go north? I mean, why would we go, uh, you know, in north, in the summer because the, it'd be a more abundant, but in the winter you wouldn't go because he'd be too harsh. So it's a little bit like that mentality where you move more. Like if you're hunting and gathering, you'd definitely be moving according to the seasons. Like you go where the fruit was when the fruit was, you know, good. And you'd go where the hunting was great. When the hunting was good and all of those things. And that feels natural for me to just be, you know, to be back and forth, but to do like six months in each places at what you did.

Speaker 2:          01:06:23       Yeah. So you have Malibu and you could die. Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. Well, and then you get to see both things to both things and to open your mind, open your mind, open your mind. And, and, uh, energetically Malibu is very powerful. Like where we are, you know, it's like Indian mountains and the mountains meet the sea. And there's some, you know, people don't realize how abundant that see life is too. They always all Malibu. They have like a preconceived idea about what Malibu is, but Malibu's has, has, uh, you know, Malibu Means Kate Way to the sea and to Gash. That's a, that's an Indian word. Malibu is the gate, which is in a way as the valley that opened from the plains where the buffalo were to the fishing and the, and the, and the ocean. So there's, there's some, you know, something to that place that, that we feel comfortable.

Speaker 2:          01:07:08       And if you're going to be here for us, it's a, I can still be in the ocean. I can still have that nature part by then I can run into, you know, La and try to expand my brain a little bit. Yeah, it is really a weird spot. Right? Look, Malibu's got a weird combination of really rich people that are completely detached and they're on pills and the PCH is a terrifying place to draw one of the most dangerous, so many fucking drunk driving and it's windy and you have the ocean. So good them houses on cliff on the other side of narrow winding and bad drivers in general. Just all our drivers in America are terrible. It's even the one that, there's something about that range too. There's so many bars and restaurants where people drink terrace areas. That's a, that's a wickedly dangerous road.

Speaker 2:          01:07:54       But this, this detached people. And then I've had friends that had their kids go to Malibu High and the Lord Jesus Christ's, everyone's doing drugs. It's all fucked up. Yeah. And the children of these rich people are often neglected, raised by their nannies. Oh yeah. Parents aren't home. And yet they're just so you have that contracted by some of the coolest people ever. And so you, and you have some of the people that don't to live in town, that work in the industry, highly successful, that want this. They want nature and they want to be in there and they'll, they're willing to drive that coast highway every day and go to work in town just to have the balance of being in the sanctuary. So, you know, it's, it's what we always say, bright, light, dark shadow. I mean, it's the nature of, it's what you get with it, you know, with the, with the greatness you get is the, you know, the destruction that attracts weirdoes.

Speaker 2:          01:08:41       Yeah, it does. Yeah. There's so many strange, eclectic people. ECLECTIC. Yeah. Which kind of makes it, but it makes it great too. Like if you're up for the good group, you got guys, you know, you'd go to the store and you got guys that are, that are, uh, you know, that lived in Malibu for their whole life. It's their kids. They don't, you know, they live up up one of the canyons and they're totally grounded and, and, and you know, and then you got right next to him, some, you know, giant mansion and it with like you said, you know, kids that are neglected and yeah, but there's some good ocean there and there's some good mountains. So for like mountain bikes and, and ocean activities, it's pretty, you know, the land stuff's always going to be tricky with the humans. You know, you get the humans, they're on land.

Speaker 2:          01:09:25       We rented a place on the water for like three months when we're getting our kitchen done. And it was crazy. Like you just sit there, wake up, eat breakfast, you're on the water. Yeah. It's just, yeah. And the place we were at it was, the water would literally come under the edge of the house. So it looks like you're sitting on the lot. Well, it's like being on a boat and you watch and do sea otters and all this wildlife and birds. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. You don't want to own one of those houses, but they're nice to stay in. Well if you own it, you really don't own it for long. No, not in this day and age. Especially if we get it. We never know we're going to get a big wave. So I'm always gun shy about being on the water, you know, living on the water.

Speaker 2:          01:10:05       I think I, when I was a kid we had to evacuate and so I'm assuming something, uh, for giant surf, huge, huge surf. So we had to leave our house in our house. A bunch of houses got push across the road and Whoa, 1969 which was a surprise. Yeah. So I've always been, I think I've had a thing in the back of my head like at one besides highly expensive, but just living on the beach. It's like, no, I'll go to the beach, I'll be at the beach all day. But then I want to be away and like I want to go home and be away and not have sand in my bed and not have salt on my TV and you know, not have, like everything gets corroded, corroded. Well you have to build a boat. Yeah, you should. If you build a house there, just pretend it's a boat and that you don't have to worry about sinking or maybe, I mean it might say, might say slowly.

Speaker 2:          01:10:51       How far away do you live from the water? Uh, I'm about a mile as the crow flies, but I'm up a hill so I overlook a, I overlook the ocean and I could see a, and then I don't have any neighbors. I have only one neighbor on the front and back and that both sides, no neighbors. So it's, I've always liked being on hills and being back. I just seems that's where I end up. I just saw some views, I think views really good for your brain, good for your brain to be up and, and, and let everything fall below. Good for the brain. Soothing on the mind. What is this a physical training company that you're doing? You're doing something XPT yeah. What is that? X T is a, I would describe it as a, a kind of a, it's a lifestyle program that evolved out of what, how I, we live like what we, what we do.

Speaker 2:          01:11:40       And so we started a, an experiential thing where people can come for like two and a half days and go through this, you know, get exposed to speakers and they do heat and ice and we do pool training and breath work and mobility and conferences and stuff there. Uh, exposed to speakers. Like, what do you mean? Well, I'll invite, you know, I would invite you to come and speak for an hour or I'd, I'd invite a Paul Chek or we'd have somebody speak on longevity or somebody speak on, you know, just have during the, during the experience we'll have a couple speakers talk on, you know, nutrition, fitness, wellness, career whenever, just as something as a, another piece of the, of the element. And then, uh, and then, and like I said, we have pool training and then we try, and we've been certifying trainers now to kind of help people go through the process as well.

Speaker 2:          01:12:30       And so it's, you know, it's, it's really about rest and recovery and breathing. It's more based on, on that part is not just another training thing of like, hey, how, you know, how we can hammer you. I mean it's, I think that's overplayed. I think the ways we can train and, and how we're training is really overplayed. I think we're, we're not creating enough things that nurture the system, you know, and really look at trying to, to support people in their, in their, in their already, you know, hammering life. They're already just beating themselves down. It's like, let's get off the red eye and then we'll go to the gym and we'll hammer ourselves there and then we'll stay up all day. And, you know, and I think we, they need some support. So breathwork is a big part of it. Um, knowing how to move correctly, I think that's a big part of it because plenty of people hurt themselves, especially in the gym, be without, you know, without some knowledge of movement in form.

Speaker 2:          01:13:22       And then I have a pool training system I developed, which is the Gabby was telling me about. That sounds crazy. Yeah. That's the most proprietary thing I think we have is, um, it's a marriage between the CIM and the in the pool because I despise swimming. Um, yeah, I know. I do. I just want to you if you said go do laps in the pool, I'd be like Shambhu and I'd get the floppy fin and all. Yeah, I just, it's just crazy out here. Fucking serve. Know what I'm saying? But, but if you said, hey, we're going to take these masks in this fins and we're going to swim this coastline where the waves are breaking on the rocks and we're going to go for five miles. I man, like I, but if you said, hey, go down there and, and, and, and where some swim goggles where you can't even see and swimming some murky water where you don't know what's in it and we're going to swim a mile down there and you're going to do that every day.

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       That I'd rather step on a rusty nail than do that. I mean it's like that's so because of my, my disdain for swimming, that kind of swimming, I mean, I, if it's, if it's in the surf and the waves, that's a different, that's a different game. That's a whole different, they don't want to do laps in the pool. You'd kill me. I'm going to die. I just, I would rather, yeah. I just, I'd rather hit my hand with a hammer, just enjoy moving in the water. But I do with some dumbbells. Oh, okay. So carrying a dumbbell and jumping with and dumbbells. And why did you start at x p t like what was the motivation because you're, you're obviously into doing this stuff yourself. Why create a foundation or, well, the reason why we started it was because, uh, an opportunity to expose this stuff and share it with more people.

Speaker 2:          01:15:02       We were doing it ourselves naturally. And then we have friends come and they were like, this stuff's awesome. And then can I invite my friend? And then we were, we realized that that if we really wanted to expose it to more people and share it, we were going to, it was going to be a limitation if everybody had to come to my house. Do you have like a website and everything? Yeah. What does the t stand for? Xpt Lie, uh, XPT life.com and XPT stands for, well, my, my concept is it's an exploration in performance training. Ah, there is high performance fuels, a limitless life. Dumbbells in the pool. There is, oh yeah. So this is all yours. [inaudible] I need to, yeah, you have to come. Well, I'm just, and it's Kyle Kingsborough. Yeah. I love that guy. Yeah. The, uh, while I have some beautiful guys come, like, I'll give you a great thing that you appreciate it as a, I have this whole, well first of all there's a bunch of things that happen in the water, right?

Speaker 2:          01:15:57       Which one of the things that happens is when you're underwater, the compression of the water allows the blood to flow through your lymphatic system, which normally takes about a 24 hour period. It happens in one hour. So imagine compression tights, like you know, if you wear compression, it really helps the blood flow, right? Well this is the ultimate compression. The water is right. So then you deal with the psychology. So it's good for fighters like Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye fighters because of the psychology of what we can do because you deal a lot with stress. So we're able to implement stress in a very controlled environment. Um, and then, and then, uh, and then like for example, uh, and grant hill at one point in his career, but I have loved friend joke, Kim Noah, who's a basketball player and we were doing these, uh, we're doing these in the water.

Speaker 2:          01:16:43       We're doing these dunking drills last summer. So I trained with him and get a bunch of stuff cause you can do a lot of highly explosive, heavy loaded movement with protection because now you don't have to worry about momentum, which is what you're going to pull your shoulder out. It's gonna throw your hip, it's going to hurt your knee. Where I could take a basketball player and I can run him through thousands of jumps. Thousands, which at the end of, if I did that on land, he would be broken. He's already jumping much in his season. He doesn't need to jump more. Right? So I could load him up and, and make him do these dynamic movements. But now he's protected because he's, because we've taken gravity out. So we're at, so it's, it's like, it's like saying, hey, we get to go trade in outer space, but it's in my backyard right now.

Speaker 2:          01:17:24       What kind of results of these athletes boils parents? Well, so Joe Kim in his career, and I don't know how many years he's been in the NBA, he came back after doing this dunking job, just using this as an example. And, uh, it had the most dunks per minute that he's had in his entire career. Whoa. He was like Dunkin on it. It was slamming on everybody. I mean it helps that he's seven feet tall. But the fact is, is that he, he, he noticed now, uh, uh, you know, grant hill was talking about he gained three inches in the last year of his career after playing in the NBA for 20 years. All of sudden he's jumping three inches higher. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean we're getting, we're, I'm, that's the kind of tangible stuff that I'm, that I, that I'm getting just that there's a lot more things, a lot of it has to do with breadth because, uh, in the water it's all controlled breathing patterns.

Speaker 2:          01:18:11       So everything is controlled because you can't breathe until you get to the top. So if you're doing a drill where you're jumping, and in most of the things we do, our leg driven swimming is mostly arms. And part of the reason why people only use her arms is cause you use five times the oxygen with your legs as you do with your arms. So the legs are very inefficient for swimming, but yet they create a lot of load on your heart, which that can boost your breath holding. And so there's a bunch of other, other, uh, things that happened, but a lot of it is just that environment is very protective. So for recovery too, for like what somebody got a hurt knee, hurt, hip, hurt ankle, you can go in there and start moving dynamically early before you would ever do it on land and be protected.

Speaker 2:          01:18:53       So there's a bunch of, you know, and then we can just ratchet it up. I can make, you know, if I it, I truly believe if you gate, if you said, you know, I'll get few Phelps is going to come to your house and you're going to have Phelps for three months. I could make felts faster. Yeah. This is, this is this. I'm so I'm, he's doing a dunking drill and he's using a medicine ball, but he's having to jump out at three feet of water. Right. So when he gets on land, when he gets on land, it's like he's like a he, it's like a whole other game. Yeah, I would imagine a whole nother game. Now did you invent this protocol? This whole thing of yapping and doing it in the water. What, what motivated you? Well, I came in the original concept came out of the a a drill, not a drill.

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       A thing we used to do in the summer when we were kids. That's a Hawaiian kind of watermen drill where you run on the bottom with stones. So seeing that Bj Penn does that stuff. Yeah. So you get a stone, you run along the bottom, then you put it down, then your friends swims along the surface. And then when he, when you go up, he swims down, grabs it, and then he goes along as far as he can and you swim and you just go back and forth until neither one of you can do it. So it was based kind of on that concept. And then, but I wanted to expand that because that's kind of limiting. You just swam and you run and you can't isolate movements and you're not working, uh, a like you can with dumbbells. So now I shift dumbbells into the water and, and I have all different weights.

Speaker 2:          01:20:16       So, depending on your skill level, you know, everything we do. And that's one thing about, uh, everything that I'm involved in is it usually has to have a spa. It has to be able to be, uh, you know, for everybody to do it. It has to be old people and kids too, in my mind, that it's not viable unless it's, if you can appeal to everybody that you need, you need to, a kids needs to be able to do it. An old person to be able to really be valid, that really have legitimacy. You know, it's like, okay, the coffee, it's has to be, there has to be things that the kids can, can have that creamer. The old people can have it. It's gotta be good. You can't just be specialized. I think the specialization of some of this stuff is, creates, uh, the lack of validity.

Speaker 2:          01:20:59       I don't think that it's valid if it's specialized and so the, I can take a little kid, like my daughter does a bunch of the pool training stuff, right? I have an older, older guys that come and do a bunch of the pool training stuff. You know, I got Pat Riley comes in there and he trained in the summer time with us and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So we get a fairly broad spectrum of people and that, and that confirms to me that it's really legitimate. Right? Because then it's like, no, this is real. Like the kids can do it. The old people can do it. The top guys can do it. The bottom guys can do it. Everybody can do it. Then you know that that's something that's, that's I, I just think that that's, you know, what, what, what is real? So how many years have you been doing this?

Speaker 2:          01:21:40       Um, XPT well, I mean, the pool training I've been, I developed over the last probably 10 to 12 years. About 12 years now in the pool with any of you have evolved it. So you start off with a couple ideas. I avail. I had like a velcro wait jacket where you felt crowed. Like, Oh yeah, wait, yeah. Jumping into the deep end. It was a little scary to get the jacket off and how can you get up? So that wasn't, that wasn't, that wasn't viable. So that was, so then we moved to have dumbbells where you can drop them. But, but we, you know, there's probably 20 exercises that we watch. Are you using, it depends. Sometimes we're doing, we have a move called the gorilla where we're using, you know, 60 to 70 70 pound dumbbells where you're doing a curl, press jump. So you g and you're jumping on the slope.

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       So your curl pressing and jumping with, with uh, with, you know, 60, 70 pound dumbbells, depending on your size. We're swimming with 50 pounds, 60 pound dumbbells. We're jumping off the bottom with 15 pound dumbbells. That depends on the exercise. So it's all depends on the person's skill, what the drill is. But we, I have a whole, I have all the weights next to the pool, so we have everything from seventies to to five pound dumbbells. I love that idea of the jump press, like doing some sort of a, Oh yeah, it's all, you'd love it. It's crazy. I call it the gorilla curl. So it's a squat curl, press jump. And then you, when you come out of the water, you just let the weights drop and then the water catches him. You could never that Atlanta d rip your shoulder out. Right? Right.

Speaker 2:          01:23:07       How deep you do this in the water while you very on your height. So I have, I have, uh, about, uh, 11 foot deep end, and then I have a slope. So you can choose every depth all the way. And then I have what you saw in that last video. It's about a three and a half foot shallow end. So this is the first pool. I'm trying to build a couple. I'm trying to build one in Hawaii right now. That's, that's going to evolve from what I learned from this pool. So this pool, I just kind of built it with, you know, with the hopes of designing a program and then out of it came all they, all this stuff. What are you going to alter? Um, I'm going to create multiple depths. So I'm going to do like an area that has 12 foot.

Speaker 2:          01:23:47       Then we're going to shift back to feet and have a 10 foot and then another flat area of eight foot. And then another flat area is six foot. And then I have the magic width is about somewhere between 35 to 40 feet wide. And that's like if you're trying to swim a heavy Dumbbell, you know we do a lot of individual limb stuff so that you isolate each limb. So we'll do pistol squats and Russian lunch squats and a bunch of other, you know, and and movements that you can, you'd be very vulnerable if you did that in the gym. You can, chances are you could hurt yourself, but because you have that stability in that environment, it totally supports you. So you can, you can be a and go into ranges of motion that you don't have. Like you, you know, you might not be able to go sink all the way down into a deep lunge on one leg and press out with dumbbells in your hand on land.

Speaker 2:          01:24:36       But in the water you can and, and the water actually makes it lighter, so you have to boost the weight and stuff. So there's a bunch of great stuff that comes out of it that sounds very attractive to people that have had injuries. Beautiful. And what, but the irony is, is it kind of, it's a little bit like what comes out of Rehab where you actually get better performance to like, like, you know, a lot of a lot of rehab exercises become performance driving exercises, you know, it's like, Hey, don't do that shit. Only when you get hurt, start doing that and get strong that way. So then you'd maybe won't get her. Yes. Yeah. You know, so it comes that way too. It goes both directions. And do you have workouts that people can follow online if someone goes to the XPT life is XPT life.

Speaker 2:          01:25:20       Yes. And help me to life website. Yeah. And we actually, the thing that we have, the, the thing we have right now, there's probably the most, uh, the most, uh, kind of prevalent one thing that's happening as soon as, as we have a breathing APP coming out. So we have a breathing app that has almost every different modality of breath work. And so there's some pretty cool stuff in there where you can go choose, hey, before I go to sleep or before my workout, after my workout, you know, during my thing. So we have a bunch of, we have a pretty cool breathing app, uh, that, that we're working on as well. So you ever talked to Wim Hoff? I know. When do you know him? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm doesn't, he doesn't give a fuck if you breathe out of your nose, your mouth.

Speaker 2:          01:25:58       I was like, just, I know, I know. He doesn't get so crazy. I love that guy. He's comedy. No, I have, I've had a few, I've him women. I've had a few, we've had a few experiences, let's just put it that way. But we've had him at it. We've had them at a couple of experiences and I've done some stuff with whim. I've known him for like four or five years now. Maybe, maybe a little longer. So he'll keep, comes usually when he was in town, I think the last time maybe when you, when you saw him, he, he came, he comes to visit. So I get, um, I, if I, usually when I go with whim, I usually translate for him. When he goes to one of his classes, I'm usually like trying to, oh, in case people don't understand all I know, but I'm just saying sometimes I'll be with somebody, they'll be like, what'd he say?

Speaker 2:          01:26:41       I'll be like, what he means is take a deep breath. Yeah. He's such a character. He is a character guy. Went to fucking the top of Everest barefoot. Oh yeah. Like, well, yeah. Almost lost his toes to, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he goes, yeah. Well, he's, he's his art actually, uh, is, uh, two ml is, is a, is a derivative of to, and I'm not sure if you know what to mow is, but to moe is a Himalayan breathing, uh, technique that the, that the, uh, the monks have that they were, they, uh, they have this one thing where they dry sheets. So they have this thing, the ceremony where they go at night in the Himalayas when it's frozen, it's snow and the guy sits there and they put wet sheets, wet blankets on them, and they breathe and get their bodies so hot that they dry the blankets.

Speaker 2:          01:27:31       And then, then the guide that can drive the most blankets at the end of the night is the, is like the guy, you know, but it's, yeah, yeah. It's called [inaudible] and it's a, you can go online and look it up. Uh, to moe is a, is a, is a Himalayan breathing technique that that was never exposed to westerners big, um, until just as of recently. But the whims whims a work is a derivative of, of tumo. But nose breathe, it's all about nose breathing. It's all about nose breathing and when you understand the science of it, but he's right about getting people to just breathe because people are not breathing. And um, we just had, in fact we had another, uh, Bill. Lissa, what's your, I want to save, uh, it's a Russian name but, but she has a great book. She trains fire, fire and police and military, um, breathing.

Speaker 2:          01:28:20       We just had her at, we did an XPT in Miami about a week, two weeks ago and uh, and she came as a guest speaker and we, and was working on really trying to create more volume and then are a lot of people's rib cages aren't moving and so they have a whole, you know, there's ways to try to increase your movement of your rib cage, your rib cage. You'd actually open, like you, you could take a tape and measure your rib cage when you are fully exhaled. And then when you inhale it should expand like, you know, three inches or more for you to be really optimally breathing. And a lot of people, I mean, part of it has to do with the whole six pack abs and what's aesthetically pleasing. But meanwhile, when you have a real nice six set of six pack abs, you don't, you're not able to diaphragmatically breathe.

Speaker 2:          01:29:05       You're not able to use your diaphragm. You're not using your diaphragm when you have that. Yeah. Because you're, you're, the tightness isn't allowing the diaphragm to push down the diaphragm and the pell and the pelvic floor actually squeeze your organs together. And, and that is actually massaging the organs, which influences your digestion and everything. And the deals with a bunch of acid reflex and a bunch of others things. But when the, when the, when the, the ABS are so tight that, that the, that the stomach can expand, the organs can't push this belly out, then you then, then you have a limitation in your, in your, and then the ribs aren't moving. I mean, it's just the guys are gonna hear this and go, good, I'm going to stay fat. I don't need a six pack. Well, but, but no, but, but I actually, if you're really using your lungs, you, you can, you'll, you'll strengthen your core in a way that you'll get core.

Speaker 2:          01:29:58       You could have six pack abs and not have core stability. Like, so, you know, I mean, and, and you know this, I mean, when you look at a lot of not every single great fighter is just ripped. No, some of them biggest ones ever not ripped it all at Fedora. Exactly. So let's talk about that for, for uh, an example of, you know, the aesthetic isn't always function right and, oh, and of course we know the mind is always ahead of everything. I don't care what the car looks like. If the God no motor, it doesn't do anything. So it's, the body only goes where the brain tells it. But the fact is, is that that you see some of the best athletes when you look at certain athletes, you're not like, they're not the physical specimens that you've ever seen. You're like that, that guy's the most ripped and shredded.

Speaker 2:          01:30:39       A lot times those guys get knocked out. You, you see the guy come in and you just call, this guy's going to kill this guy. And then he just gets, you know, annihilated by the guy that looks maybe not quite as hard. Right. Part of it is genetics. Max Holloway's perfect example. Hawaiian guy. Yeah. He's not like shredded. I mean he's strong obviously, but he looks more like a swimmer. Yeah, yeah. Well, and you, you might find that his breathing, he might, he might have better air volume because at the end of the day, a lot of it's about oxygen cardio and Max is cardio is off the chart. Exactly. So he's getting more movement out of there. I mean, you know, again, we've created these, you know, aesthetic things in, in our culture like, oh six pack abs a sign of this and Dah, Dah, Dah. But when you look at real breathwork and how the diaphragm works and how the ribs expand, you realize this, like we're, none of us are really doing it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:32       Right. You know, and you can actually create more volume. You know, you said you like cordyceps mushrooms. Yes. Well, those are actually a vessel dilate. Those helps help you absorb oxygen. You those can up your vo two Max, right? There's only a couple of things that you can, how to increase your vo two Max. But cordyceps is one of them. Beaches, beaches, another one. Um, you can create more volume by expanding your lungs. So by opening the rib cage and creating more room that can create, um, promote your vo two Max. And what people are hearing this and hearing breathwork folks who have never done anything like that, they don't, they really don't understand what you're saying. Like, what do you mean by breath work? Like, give us an example of like a protocol. Well, I mean, a real simple, I mean, they do it in Pranayama, they have it in apnea. There's a thing called holotropic breathwork. Really is, is when you isolate the breathing system in and you know, the simplest way. And that's why Wim says, Hey, I don't give a shit how you breathe, just breathe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you know, like we'll do a breadth routine and we'll sit somebody down and we'll say, okay breed like you're running where you think you're running and you will tell the guy breed like he's running and they'll go, I go, that's a slow run buddy. Like breed like you're running right.

Speaker 2:          01:32:42       You know, like, like any time, any, any movement in any air in and out is going to, is a form of breath work. Right? And especially when you isolate the system and you're not doing it because of an activity. The fact is that when you use that system and you work it and you're not detracting from it by doing an exercise, if you're doing the assault bike while your arms are working in, your legs are working. So all the oxygen that you're absorbing is going into your arms and legs. When you're isolating, you just do the breathing alone. Now the oxygen's going into that system and that system is going to develop and get better. Then when you do your assault bike after you developed that system. So we'll isolate breathwork and we'll just do it alone. Well, whether we're doing, you know, whether we're doing breath holds, we're doing some kind of apnea breath work, which is w you know, we can do a pattern where you're doing like you hold for 30 seconds and then you breathe in for 15 and then you breathe out for 15 then you hold the yet, then you go in and out and hold in and out and hold.

Speaker 2:          01:33:44       That's one pattern. Another pattern is in hold out, hold in, hold out, hold in, hold out. All like, you know, again, those are, there's, you know, and then there's Pranayama apnea holotropic there's just somewhere your oxygen in the system where you know, like wimps,

Speaker 3:          01:34:02       hi, how are you?

Speaker 2:          01:34:05       Just get that rhythm going and do that for five minutes and people know by feel light in and I go, yeah, because you haven't had oxygen like that in your head. You haven't had oxygen in your system like that. Right. So again, a conscious co bringing consciousness to your breath. We're not just walking along in life, like not thinking about breathing. That's the beginning of breath work. Just awareness of, hey, I need to,

Speaker 3:          01:34:32       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:34:33       You know, I need to breathe in and out. Stay conscious. Yeah. And that's a big one with martial arts. You see in Jujitsu with beginners, when they first start sparring for the first time, they panic and they have shallow breath and you've gotta tell him us. Okay, stop right now and just breathe. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We'll fight or flight. Fight or flight. But it's interesting how they can't get a deep breath. Yeah. They, they, they hyperventilate. Yeah. We'll you, we'll put somebody in the ice for the first time that hasn't done it. Yeah. That's the craziest. Want to see it? That's an incident Caney though. Oh yeah. He can't breathe. Oh yeah. But you eventually learn the system. The system turned. That's actually a, uh, an involuntary response to get out. Right. Strike you. You have the option. So you should exercise that option.

Speaker 2:          01:35:19       Well, that's an involuntary response. That's your, that's your subconscious mind. Protecting the organ organism. Like, Hey, this in your body intuitively knows this is dangerous environment. Get Out. And so that reaction is to get you to get out. When you, when you make a conscious effort to not lead that environment, then the body goes, oh, okay, you're not going to get out. Okay, well now I'll organize. I'll bring the blood to the organs, all adjust everything. I'll boost your hormones. And so, and then pretty soon you don't get that response anymore. Once you do it on a regular basis, the body just goes, oh, we're here we are again, back to that ice thing. Bring the Ba, you know, boost the hormones, bring all the blood. No, Oregon's, you know, that so, but that, that's, that's a similar thing to what you're talking about in Jujitsu where people are the stress on the system.

Speaker 2:          01:36:02       They're stressed and so they're involuntary Italy, you know, and that's fight or flight. One thing you can really do to calm, like calm a kid down. This is the way you get yourself into parasympathetic. Where you bring your thing down is when you extend your breath for seven seconds on the inhale and the exhale that reduced, that'll bring everything down. Like, if you want to calm down in your or your kids straight, your little kid, just all and you get them to just breathe in for seven seconds. You know, and I tell people, think about Osi, my youngest daughter, when she would get upset, she would do that too. And I try to like, you gotta breathe, you gotta breathe, calm down, but seven seconds is a magic number. If they, if you can extend the breath for seven seconds and the body goes into parasympathetic and totally like that's what you do to like go to sleep at night.

Speaker 2:          01:36:48       Like if you're having a hard time. So there's a bunch of stuff to learn about the breadth, which is amazing. I think the reason why the, the breadth has always been so important to, to me is this because of the ocean. Because you know, growing up when you almost drowned, you know, a thousand times you, you, you, what is important you, you get to know, you just get to appreciate like there's none down there and it's all up there and so be cooled down there. So when you see you can get back up. Well, I've learned I'm breathwork because of Hicks and Gracie are watching Hixon Gracie practice yoga. He's a friend. Yeah. You know he does that. What does that, yeah. What does that stumble? That's, that's the uh, Pontiac. Yes. But there's a name for it. Yeah. Where you twist the, yeah. He really sucks.

Speaker 2:          01:37:32       Is Oregon's. Yeah. In his son can do it. Amazingly crone can do it amazingly. Yeah. Yeah. It's super good for you. Well that for the organs. Yeah. And that the ability to control your breath like that is so critical when you're sparring. So critical to, to get oxygen. These long training sessions will for your life, for your life. Anytime you're in this stress, if you can control your breath, that controls your heart. Yeah. Do you ever do 30 seconds in, 30 seconds out? Do you ever do that? Yeah. Just slow, deep breaths in. Slow, deep breaths out. That's an amazing exercise cause well that's the extension of that. Yeah. That certain parasympathetic that's bringing in seven. Just the minimum amount. Like whenever you go into any of those long extended stuff. And then the, and then those breath holds. Anytime you hold the breath, then you get that co two level and that's what gives you the anx to, you know, uh, what's interesting cause you know, whims done like some record breaking stuff and you have that free diving stuff where, where they scrub oxygen, you know where they hyperventilate and scrub the CEO too and get that real low.

Speaker 2:          01:38:32       But you have to be careful about shallow water blackout. So we don't really practice any of that stuff. We do more like assault bike, jump in the pool and see how long you can hold your breath and then it's, and then, and then you know, five, 10, 10 seconds is like, that's big time. 15 seconds. You're like, wow, that was amazing. At maximum heart rate. How long can you hold your heart? I mean, how long can you hold your breath at some that's a challenge. So I keep an assault bike right next to the pool. Yeah. Oh yeah, just punishment. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Wow. Yeah. Wow. God, there's always another twist to the pretzel. Now, what are the, I mean, because of your hip, do you have any limitations on other kinds of stuff that you can do? I'm not, I'm not just running would be a real cool.

Speaker 2:          01:39:15       Yeah, no, I, I like deep, deep texture running so soft sand because of the foot and the articulation of the feet and not chew and non not wearing shoes. Um, so I'll do beach, I'll do sand running and like if I'm in the snow, like Alaska or something like that. But I love barefoot and deep stuff. I don't like running on hard ground. I just, first of all, we, as soon as you're, you know, if your two 15 or two, you know, whatever, anything over 200 pounds. I mean, you shouldn't be running more than a couple of miles a week if you're over a buck 20. I mean, it's just, it's a, Oh yeah, it's so hard on your sis on the hard ground. Absolutely. That's stuff is just pounding you. You, I mean, it's one thing to go in a soft t, something that as absorption, you know, like if you're running in the sand or you're running or you're running in the snow or you're running into some deep thick grass or something that's got absorption.

Speaker 2:          01:40:08       But yeah, you go run your, you know, your 180 200 pounds and your run and you just pound, everything's just, you know, seven times your body weight on the download and then you're wearing a shoe that's, you know, that's kind of deceiving you. It's a little bit like a Sunglass, you know, you think it's blocking the light but it's letting old bad light in, you know, you think it's blocking the absorption but you're just getting pounded. I mean your and your feet or you know, I mean barefoot is so important. Grounding, so important. I mean these are, these are things, but uh, I have a new, uh, I have a cool bike that I just, somebody just gave me recently called a standup bike, which the company called elliptic go. But it's a standing bike, its position, so for standing alone. And so the postures, unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          01:40:50       And you want to grind on a hill. I mean, you don't need running and then you have zero impact. It's like, you know, it's so, I think running is hard. I mean, I understand that high of running and uh, but you know, if you want to, you want a real, for me real running is barefoot and some soft sand. I had this one beach in Hawaii that I run on that, that that's a little bit like quicksand and probably you'll sink in like mid, lower, lower, lower calf. Like you'll sink in a foot into it. You don't need to go far, but you don't need to go. And you know what a Taro Patches. No. So I grew up, uh, we got grew up farming. I like around on a pig farm and then with Taro Patches and fishing. And so I kind of grew up in a, but there's a terror, a Taro Patches, uh, as a, as a rice patty, pretty much mud.

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       Right? And so you, we grew up working in that stuff and walk in and carrying buckets and being in that mud. Slushing the mud, like a foot deep. My, but what I'm saying, an environment like that where you have to pull your foot out and then sink in where it's absorbing the impact. I mean that's where work, you know, I always question the damage versus the work, right? Like the pounding that you and most, I mean, you know, once you're a certain size, the war, the pounding that you get, I think you can get all the cardio. You want to jump rope. Trump rode straight landed on your toe, you're doing the thing about when you're running every in, inevitably people go to heel striking. They're landing on their heels because they have a shoe that they, so they think they're getting, you know, they think they're getting protected because they're landing on something kind of soft.

Speaker 2:          01:42:19       But it's still sending the, you know, that impact up your spine and inevitably anything you do and you, and you come back and your back hurts. I have to question like, is that optimum? You know, and that wasn't dead lift either. It was, you know. Yeah. But what about your friend, the Moyie Thai fighter? Well he, but he runs, he runs like on the very shipper short, short step balls of his feet like, like, and I would, I wouldn't even, I would call it more like a, I don't even know how to describe the pace, but it's a slow, a slow, a slow pace that you're landing on the toes the whole time. So it's not like a run, you know, a hard run where you're pounding. So, so he's probably only doing like 10 minute miles or something like that. I don't know. I don't even know what is his ranges?

Speaker 2:          01:43:02       You'd have to ask Mr Tom Jones? Well I think, I think running off your toes. Great. Yeah. I mean there's some as the who does those, the running, who does it? Who Does it? I do. I run with minimal issues. Yeah. But if fortunately standing bike, that is ridiculous. I wouldn't be caught dead in that then. Well back for me that, that there, that's the elliptic go. They have the new, a new one that's just a pedal. I'm just kidding. Yeah, it looks awesome. No. But you know why the guy made that silly cause the guy was a runner and couldn't run anymore. Got Injured. Uh, and then he, and he started the bike and he said biking's not running. And so then he developed that thing because it's simulates running without the impact. So that's, I'm like I said, that's why I liked the pool.

Speaker 2:          01:43:44       That's why. And I think too, it's like if you think about doing things forever, we're talking about doing things forever. Yeah. Right? Yes. So we're talking about doing things forever. So how are we going to do them so we can do them forever? No impact. Well, so reducing impact. And if you actually started doing that initially, then you might not have to worry about trying to recover from all that stuff that you, so it's like we don't want to train in a way that we're going to have to change our training to try to make up because all the damage we've done, let's try to avoid the damage from the beginning. I'm a, it's already too late for me. I got seven, you know, I got six broken ankles, got broken, arches broke again. What the hell did you just do your ankle? I like what's been broke six, six or seven times broke the arch, broke all the messages from surfing all different motorbikes, surfing, snowboarding because you mess up your hip.

Speaker 2:          01:44:34       Uh, probably cause my broke walking on a broken ankle for uh, all those years that cause each time I broke it I have five or six different breaks and then I would keep going. So I would keep walking on it and, but I'd means I had to carry the load on my right hip. So I think I just wore the cartilage out from offsetting and carrying the load of the broken Lake Jesus. So that was, but so I mean it's so, it wasn't like one injury where you hurt your hip. It was just slung. I just wore it out. I just, I said I lived a couple of lives with [inaudible] is that that was only on one life hip and I had three lives in, uh, what is it like having a fake hip, insane, incredible bionic. That thing's not even in my, in my, in my brain.

Speaker 2:          01:45:17       Not even how so it does. I just, I don't ever even bring it into consciousness. It's in, it's slicker. It's like a Mercedes Benz ball joint. I mean it's absolutely perfect. Wow. And you know, I mean I've had ACL, had some knee stuff before that was harder to recover from than the hip. The hip was. I just felt like I got kicked by a horse for a couple months and then after that it was like no brainer. Jump off a cliff, go stand up, paddle, run. I mean I tell you to not do certain things. Nope. Really? Nope. You could like, you could just start, he don't do anything you should do with your real one. Really. That's don't do anything you shouldn't do with your real one. Yeah, absolutely. That was the only thing. I mean the guy, the doctor Penn Nunberg who did mine, he, he did it to a contortionist I guess some contortion has had some blown hips and he'd get it to the girl is still performing and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:46:12       So I don't, I think it's, I mean this stuff is, the technology is amazing. And the thing that I, the thing that I would consider if I ever had to do it again is that the atrophy from the, the, the, the initial problem is harder to recover from then you just go in and getting the new one. And I think when people push it, you know, they used to prior to push that stuff because they wanted to wait for the technology got better and they only last 15 years and all that stuff. Um, but the atrophy that you try to recover from, it was harder to recover from than if you would've gone in and gotten it done when you need, when, as soon as you needed to have. So the one you have now, you have to get it swapped out every 15 years.

Speaker 2:          01:46:55       No, no, no, no. But, but in the back in the early days, well, they, they, they don't know how long this new stuff last. They had some, they had some material that that wore out after. Like they, cause there's a, uh, like a, uh, some kind of poly urethane, some kind of psych outer layer. Well like a cart lit like a, like a manmade Cartlidge between the ball joint in the socket. And so that stuff wore out in the past. But yeah, and they had this new stuff that, that has been in for 10 years and a lot of people are already and they've seen zero where on it. So you don't know. It could be 30, could be, you know, could be 10. I mean I was actually, uh, I stayed conscious in, in, I was able to stay awake for my hip surgery that uh, cause I didn't want to have to recover from the, from the uh, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:47:41       Yeah. It takes people a month to get the anesthesia their system really. Oh yeah. To try to get the anesthesia. I mean anaesthetise controlled death. They're just put you right to the edge of dying and keep you alive. I mean anesthesia, some hard stuff on your system to get that stuff out of your organs. You've got to do like a full detox cleanse. It's not dislike. Oh yeah. Anesthesia. I've never heard that before. I didn't, I didn't know that. Oh yeah. I thought you feel like shit for a day or two, but I didn't know it. That's shit's in your organs and stuff. There's no way that stuff to go that they can't, they can't Doshi out and knock you out like that without that stuff lingering. I mean, you know, how long does it take to when you've got a hangover? I mean, so that they do like an epidural block on your epidural block.

Speaker 2:          01:48:20       Yeah. And they had it so good that they could just isolate the left, the left hip. They did that to me when I had my first ACL surgery yet I wanted to see it. Yeah. Cause I was like, yeah, I want to watch. I felt like I'm only going to do this once in my life. I want to see this. Turns out I had three of them. Yeah. Three knee surgeries. But yeah. But I wanted to see it. I wanted to, I wanted to be there if it was pretty freaky. Yeah, I was ACL. I had ACL to had ACL. The right light on. Yeah. Yeah. And a cadaver. I had a cadaver on my right leg. Left leg, had a patella tendon. Oh yeah. Yeah. So now your hip doesn't even, you don't feel it. You don't feel anything. Not even in the wheel.

Speaker 2:          01:49:00       Not even a thought. Wow. Not even like amazing. And it was, I was, it was debilitating. I could barely walk. I mean, I could still surf, but I'd get to land and I was hobbling around like, you know, move and, uh, Maynard from tool, you know the band tool. Uh, Maynard is a, he's a Jujitsu enthusiast and he had to get his hip done. Uh, and he fucked his hip up from stomping on stage. You know, cause he's always like stomping with one leg. Yeah. He blew his hip out. Yeah. Well I think mine's attributed a lot to my back leg and surfing. Uh, so I'm on that back leg and that leg is loaded, loaded. So I think that, but, but I know the brakes, the brakes and the other in the left ankle and left foot. And how many I had and that I was always on it.

Speaker 2:          01:49:43       I know that attributed to a lot, cause this, this, this right leg carried the load for that thing for it to get your left leg fixed. My ankle. Ankle. Yeah. I just let it, so every time I went I went to my knee, uh, to get my knee worked on in the guy goes, he saw my ankle and he goes, and then he saw the, about how much mobility I had and he called in some foot specialists and they had to take x Ray. They just wanted to see, cause I have no metal in there. There's no screws, there's no nothing. I just let it, you know, and just so every time you just let it sort of heal itself up. Yep. So it snapped and you just walk around on it? Yeah, pretty much. Cut. The cast off. The first time was I was 16, so I cut the cast off and you know, and I went at rebroke it the first time and then, uh, and then I had broke it other ways had got a little smarter after we broke him.

Speaker 2:          01:50:33       But yeah, that's, and then arch the arch. I broke the arch because the ankle was so cows, so a bonded that when I broke it, I actually broke my arch. That was probably the most painful. That was the most painful, uh, break down in that area. When I talked to Kelly Slater, he broke his foot. Yeah. Yeah. The same sort of his was just recently. Yeah. And his, his was fucked up for a long time. He said that's a painful thing to snap your toes. Like you're the middle. The metatarsal a crazy. Well, yeah. You have a 75% of the bones in your body or blow your ankles. What really? 75% like times of numbers. Yeah. Numbers of both. But your feet, your feet have like half the bones of your entire body. God, I never thought of that. That's crazy. But it made, there's a lot of shit down there.

Speaker 2:          01:51:24       A lot going on. A lot. Little, little ones, little nubs and weird little ankle. See that's why kickboxing so stupid. You throw in those things at people and slamming him in the elbows, knees and stuff. I fucked the clods big. Oh, guaranteed. I've broken my, that didn't like kicking something. Breaking your feet. It's a little embarrassing if it's a wall though. Is that what you kicked? No, I'm just saying no. Mine was, I, like I said, I broke my bro. Mostly sports related motor, Mike. Uh, wind surfing, you know, towing. Yeah. Yeah. Well I guess with as many injuries as you had though, you do understand like what's good and what's bad for you. For sure. You hope. But you know, it's interesting. It's a little bit like in karate where you know you, when you know how to heal, you know how to wound.

Speaker 2:          01:52:14       Hmm. Interesting. You know that the more, the more you understand, it's like I think, I think my injuries, first of all, it's a form of failure. I think that is taught. I've learned a few things from them. And, and, and you learn how also how to recover and how to heal. And so I think that feeds into how to train and perform like a thing that's all interrelated because you start to have a more intimate relationship with your body and know how it responds. So I think there's something, I mean, you don't learn a lot from winning, you know, and succeeding that doesn't teach you anything compared to losing, you know, losing teaches you in any way. Injuries are f forms of loss there, there, you know, on unsuccessful endeavors. Yeah. Yeah. When you lose your, and then you lose your ability to do stuff and then you wonder why you're doing it and if you're going to be able to do it again.

Speaker 2:          01:53:04       Yeah. All that stuff. Do you float at all? Uh, no. But I saw your float tank. You've never done it? I haven't. Oh Man. I've thought that'd be right up your alley. I know. I just haven't, I just, I've been invited by a friend who has one in Malibu. I just haven't ever, you could use this word anytime you want. Yeah, I should try to come up on the float and then come on down and they tell you one. It's like I can tell they're salt in there. By the way, the everything's crusting up in the back. Guaranteed. Yes. Thousand pounds of Epson Salts. Oh yeah. Tank. Yeah. Yeah. If you're, anytime I have a notion, so I float there and there's a lot of noise in the, oh no, it's true. It's just for, but that's what you love about the pool because you're floating already.

Speaker 2:          01:53:42       As soon as you go under actually has speakers underwater. So cool. Really? Oh, you play music. Oh Wow. So you can get Dan, you can get lost over there. It's pretty cool. So what other things do you do besides the, a curl pressed jump thing? Like what other or the types of exercises are you doing in the pool? Um, we're doing, we're doing, you know, like single dumbbell cleans, clean, single arm dumbbell, and then stroke, get a breath free fall. So you're doing single arm jumping. Okay. And then we're doing single arm swimming. Ah, single alarm, swimming, carrying dumbbell. I call that ammo box. How much weight are you doing that with? We can do like 50, 60 pounds. Wow. Do an APP. It's called an ammo box. It'd be like if he had an ammo box. Again, you swim across the river, like that's kind of the concept.

Speaker 2:          01:54:26       We have cell phone, we have the Yuki, we have a phone. Do you keep wanting to out of the water polo and swim with your handout? Oh Wow. And then, uh, and then a budget, like I said, single leg stuff. So a lot of, a lot of like a Russian pistol squat, jump, lunges. Uh, uh, what else? A bunch of, a bunch of old fast breaks where we're doing this one where we dropped down. You run along the bottom with two dumbbells to the other side. You set one dumbbell up, you jump up, you bring one dumbbell out, you go back down, grab the other one, bring that one out and then pull both of them out and drop back down and run back out. We call that one fast break kind of mimicking like if was basketball court, you'd run down, you jump up twice and run back.

Speaker 2:          01:55:08       Jump up twice. Um, and then we have spider man. We have, I mean we, they just spider mans one where you swim, you carry a dumbbell and you descend into one end, you jump up, you grab, you get a breath, you just send it into the other end. And then, and then all these exercises were able to, we to make them harder. We'll do them on an exhale so you can do, so we ramp up, you know, we can either increase weight, we can create increase distance or we can do an egg, do it on an exhale. So when you developed all this stuff, did you run all this down from your own practice? From all trial and error? Like how did you develop this? Well, some of them came from failure. So you know, you try to do one move and then you'd fail.

Speaker 2:          01:55:50       Some of them came from friends that I was working out with. It would hold, well let's try this. And then we'd modify it. Some, some of them came from my daughter. I watched my daughter, my one daughter swim down one day and grab a weight and then try to swim up with it. I'm like, oh, that's a great move. And we, you know, so we, we, we, some of it came out of necessity for movement, like certain dynamic movements that the basketball guy, you know, one of my friends needed or a, and then it naturally all the movements kind of naturally evolved. I think that's why they're also great. And there's an isolation to each limb. So we have an isolation so you can really see if the dexterity of your right arm versus your left arm and how strong it is versus the other one, how strong one leg is next to the other one to have the Mo, the ranges of motion and the mobility we're, we're doing, we can do a front back flips and front flips multiple.

Speaker 2:          01:56:44       So you jump up and get a breath and then do multiple flips and, and uh, and extend work time so that your extend breathwork where you'll do, you know, like three or four moves in one on one breath. So we have a bunch of ways to, to ramp it up as we evolve. Because you know how it is. It's like in any exercise you get proficient and then you're like, well how do I make it harder? While you make it longer, you make it faster. You make it heavier. I mean these, but because you're in the water, we always have the breath holding element. Uh, and then we had the distance element and then we have the weight because we have weights so we have the weight elements. So those are different ways that we can ramp it, you know, ramp it up. So when you're developing this program, are you writing on this stuff down?

Speaker 2:          01:57:26       Are you doing these workouts yourself and saying, okay, I really started to fatigue after 30 of these, so we'll try to, well I have a group of friends, I have a group of guys that train that come to my house to train six days a week. So there's like days a week? Yeah. In Malibu? Yeah. Malibu. Oh. So because now the pieces show Malibu's is summertime, right? Summertime is when it's really like a, the season for training because there's no surf in the winter time, you're not going to train and then have a giant swell and be tired. That would be just stupid. So you never want to let the problem with it is that you get, you know, I, I tell people, I go, listen in probably in any sport, you get the most out of shape during the season. You're in a certain kind of shaped game shape, but you're really not in shade because you can't, you can't have a regimented workout routine if you're competing now and so and so.

Speaker 2:          01:58:14       And in my case, uh, the oceans dictating the performance, right? So you can be, oh, there's going to be 20 feet to next, you know, in three days. And then all of a sudden you show that there's not, there's no surf said, only half the size or the wind screws it up or something. So you get all that build up. So we have to do things to kind of exhaust the energy. But you can't be in a nice Monday, Wednesday, Friday pool training with Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, you know, um, lifting mobility in yoga and whether, you know, it's like you can't get into that kind of a rhythm and a, and Hawaii not conducive for that. Anyway. It's part of the beauty of it is like, I always so beautiful, let's go to the thing or we're going to go down the coast cause it's a nice day. It's a good day for fishing, go to the mountain.

Speaker 2:          01:58:55       There's just so much other activities to be done. We're in this environment, you're in the desert and it's kind of like, okay, it's a June gloom, no problem. This bang iron or you know, ride the mountain or do whatever you're gonna do. So that's, uh, the end. But in that summertime routine, uh, I have a group of guys in that we bounce everything off of each other. So I'll do the, we'll do 10 and he'll do 10 and he'll do 10. I'll be like, yeah, that was good. Okay. Up the way. Okay. Oh, twenty's too many or that weights too much or that way. It's enough. And so we just kind of, it's evolved naturally that way. And then, uh, and then I got some other friends that are a little bit more professional. We have a, uh, my friend of mine, PJ, who's been involved with all of the, uh, stuff around XPT to write programming and do that kind of stuff that changed.

Speaker 2:          01:59:42       He trains a lot of fighters and great and mobility and, and, and uh, and to other training stuff. So he, he'll come in and they go, they start to really break it down and make it into a real program. But we have routines that we do. We have circuits that we do that we know, you know, how, you know, when we're taxed. And you know, it's an interesting thing about what the pool really teaches you is that, you know, you have a volume of energy available. We go, okay, well, you know, you got a 50 gallon tank and I can do three or four drills in fifth, 10 or 15 minutes that does, you just, there's none left. You just blew all 50 gallons. You do. Extended breath holds with super hard work where I can, you know, make the, give you some things that are a little lighter and now we can take that 50 gallon tank, we can drag it out and make it, make it last two hours.

Speaker 2:          02:00:32       Right? Cause we do these, we're doing higher volume, less weight and so we're, you know, breathing more often, we can expand that thing. So everything in between just blowing that whole tank up at once. Right. Through real intense breadth hole with maximum weight as you know, Max breath hold Max weight, uh, Max Rep. Okay. We're good. We're, I mean it's, and I think liftings the same way. You know, it's like how many Max lifts do you have in a certain day and how many per week do you have though? It's real tangible in the pool. The pools reel, you know, the, the, the interesting thing about the pose that it doesn't get, you don't get muscle soreness because of that compression. So you don't get that like wow, I'm sorry. You get, you go. Almost every single person that comes. And it's one of the A, I always say, you know, you got to call me and tell me if you fell asleep at lunch.

Speaker 2:          02:01:21       And every guy, every, every, every person, you know, I was in the thing and just in their desk at the work or whatever, just fall asleep, like guaranteed at some guys, you know. Oh I fell asleep for an hour. I saw 20 minutes, 10 minutes, you know, but everybody, why is nighty night? I don't know. I think it has a lot to do with the oxygen and that and, and the, and the taxation of that environment. But it exhausts you in a, in a, in a, in like a terminal way. Like it's, it's, it's a complete exhaustion. And I, and I don't know why, part of it is the threat of being underwater. Part of it is though that the water is sucking the, the calories out of you, you know, because it's like, uh, when they, uh, when they were talking to a Phelps about burning all those calories, while, you know, three quarters of the calories, he was burning his cause he was in a 70 degree pool and people go, well, our 75 degree pool, and I go, yeah, but the by the body is 98.6.

Speaker 2:          02:02:18       So for the body to keep itself warm over in three hours, it's at 75. That's 20 degree differentiation. You've got to keep the bodies just working to keep itself warm and that and that. And because the water affects you more than the air, it's, you know, it's, it's more intense on your system. They just, you just get tapped. So that the water temperature, the, uh, the, the, the oxygen load, the, the psychology of being underwater with weights, you know, the workload that it's taking, all those things play into just full, thorough exhaustion and nothing, nothing. I do, uh, exhaust me more thoroughly and yet more kind of comfortably than that. You know not, you don't have to expel. You don't still want moving. Well you're not wounded. You don't come and see if I train that hard in the gym, I'll feel hurt after I'll be, I'll be wounded.

Speaker 2:          02:03:08       I'll be a little like and if I move wrong or something I'll be like, oh you know, you feel like something, you tweak something. So this allows you to do this six days a week. That's one of the reasons why. Well it actually helps flush the other days when you're doing other land training. So actually helps support your, but no, I mean we're not doing, we're doing pool training probably every other day and it just, I ended up turning the kind of, I love being in the pool so much that we have, we do a thing called surf and turf, so, so we have surf and turf where you're doing like some sort of some sort of burpee press, some kind of lifting on the deck into the water and then a routine in the water and then back on the deck and back in the water. You might be doing a, we have one of a move called a sea horse where you hold a dumbbell between your legs and then you hold your feet up in front of you and you swim like this with a dumbbell in your lap.

Speaker 2:          02:03:58       And then when you get to their side than you do pushups. So you do pushups on that side. You, you see horse over, you do push up that side, see horseback, you do that. I mean you just blow up. Right. So we, I, I think I, I enjoy that, that part of it, just, just being creative, making it fun, making it interesting. That's the part that really is enticing. Just the dredgery and the monotony. Like when you said, Oh yes, swimming laps, I go, that's just like dredgery just, ah, like, which there's a mentality for that. I'm good. I can be good at that. Like I can get on a, I can get on my board and you know, I've, I've done some endurance stuff. I palled 22 hours one time. Um, I've done some much two hours. Yeah. Oh yeah. So I've done, I did actually, I actually did a thing on Hawaii called the Hawaii five, we call it the life 500 we started on the south point, a big island, and we biked across the big island, so 125 miles. Then we paddled to Maui, uh, 38 miles, and then we biked across the valley and then we paddled to Molokai and then we biked across Molokai that we palliate to a Wahoo. Then we biked across the wall who then we paddled to Hawaii that we biked across the Hawaiian. We did that in five days. So that's what's day six. Like that's when you start coming. Good.

Speaker 2:          02:05:12       It's the end. But you're, but you're good. No, explain. It's what you said about, you know, about running. Yep. On Eddie, Eddie, when you know, all of a sudden you're, the body's like, oh, is this our new house? Is this, is this what we do? What we just, what we do? Yeah. Once we, once the body makes that decision, all of a sudden you're good. Like, okay, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm good. I mean the hands had blisters everywhere, but the, the body felt like, oh, this is where we, you know, I did a race across America with done with wild man. He talked me into it. I didn't want to do it. And he suckered me into, into it. And uh, he said, cause I was like, he had other plans. He was, cause he was an operator and he's like, he wanted me to go in this race.

Speaker 2:          02:05:57       And there's four, it's a four man team, you know, ram is now called the race across America. It's a bicycle race across America. You start in Oceanside and in and Delaware. And so you bike across and each guy just goes like 45, 45, 45, 45. And then you chase the other guy when he's riding and you get out, then you just go full bore as hard as you can for 45 minutes to the next guy gets on. He goes, but you're riding in the car chase and the other guy and you do this day and night, right? All you're doing it day and night. And He, uh, you know, we, the first couple of days we felt pretty sick. Like you felt you don't even, you don't even want water, like water. You look at water and you're like, that's when I really learned to appreciate Kombucha, but, uh, but we don't even want water.

Speaker 2:          02:06:37       And then day two, day three, all of a sudden, day three, you're like, wow, I stomach thing goes away. I'm ready to go. I feel good, let's go. And uh, but it was that thing about the body being comfortable with that, that kind of dredgery but I, I don't mind the monotony of that, of that kind of like, Hey, I'm going to go that on and just you're gonna Paddle for. But if I do it in my, in a routine, like something that's a little more not out of a mission. Right. And then I'm like, then you're just, you know, I don't want to go in and do the same lifting routine did day in and day out. It's just not, Eh, I'd prefer creating new stuff and making it interesting and, and having that, that the distraction of the, of the challenge of something new and keep me interested in, or did it make sense?

Speaker 2:          02:07:28       Do you, what about massage? Yeah. Love it. Live for it. We'll kind of get, uh, only good ones get a like deep tissues going. I've done to kind of almost every single modality you can think it's usually about the person. It's usually about the person that gives it and, and, and how, if they're healers or not. So I just try to find healers. And when you say healers, what do you mean? That people, that, that do it because they're into taking care of people. Then they not doing it as a profession. Like they don't do it to make money. They make money as a side product, but they're healers. They, that they, that they just have a gift that there you go, you, you know, you can, you can get 10 massages, right. And, and, and they're all can be good, but there's just one of the people that they just have a skill.

Speaker 2:          02:08:18       They know how to touch. They know what it is. They know where they know how to feel it. They know how to, they know how to use the system. Um, you know, I've done, uh, that my, the thing that I'm crazy about right now is I'm crazy about dry needling. Um, that's the thing that has been the most profound, uh, I mean, I've done, uh, you know, I've done, uh, oh, she ought to and acupuncture and that thing and just, I mean, I, you know, and Rolfing and I've done the 10 series three times and I mean, I've had all those different modalities, but dry needling has been, you know, and then I have another person that, that, that just does, and I don't even know what art it is. It's just massage. And she just, she just is able to understand the tissue, no loud, and she's relentless and, and, and, uh, and, and won't, won't leave and won't leave it until everything releases.

Speaker 2:          02:09:11       And she knows how to release it. In Dry needling to people. Uh, dry needling is, uh, a technique where they use acupuncture needles on soft tissue and they, um, touch the trigger point and get the system, the stuff to release. Like it's, uh, it's not acupuncture. It's, it's a, it's a different modality that, that, um, that I'm not sure if it's, uh, what states it's legal or not in, I know most of the athletes that I know, they used to do it a lot in Australia. They do it in Europe. Um, emotional in some places. Some places it's not legal. Yeah. Why? I have no idea. It probably because it works and somebody threatened by it. I mean, isn't that usually the case? Well, gas or someone doesn't understand it and they think someone's a quack and get those needles. All of these people, you don't know what you're doing.

Speaker 2:          02:10:02       There's no science here. Yeah. Well there's some science behind it and uh, and it, but it absolutely is the most, uh, functional. I mean, I've got friends with giant knots in their traps in the one session that then goes away. Extremely intense. Yeah. Intense, intense. But it, but dry needling is, you know, if I ever have my friend who's really good at it, comes through, I'll, I'll, I'll steer her your way. Cause it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the most effective. I mean, I, I, you know, uh, I think, uh, as someone, uh, that you are always looking right, we're always looking like, what, what, you know, hey, we need the heat, we need the ice, we need the thing. We need the food. We need the thing. Where's the tumor? Where's the, you know, we always are looking. And so when I run into things that are affective, I'm, I cherish him because I know that you know it.

Speaker 2:          02:10:54       And the problem is you have a high bar because when you've experienced great work, you just, you can't, you go get somebody who does a little mushy mushy and you're just like, ah, don't, I don't have time for that. I'll, I'll, I'll lay, I'll lay still for three hours if I know somebody knows what they're doing. Right. But I won't be there for 20 minutes if somebody, if I feel like it's like half ass. Yeah. Which is a lot of it, you know, a lot of that stuff's out there and PR and no fault to the people. I think part of it is just, they probably just don't know. And their intentions, it's gotta be your intentions. Why, why do you do it? You know, it's interesting how some people can just find those problem areas. They just, Oh, it's right here. I don't even know.

Speaker 2:          02:11:33       They know. And they, and they feel it with their hands. They see with their hands and they know right where it's like connecting where to dig in and, and how to release it. Yeah. That's an art. That's what I said, which will release. It's real. It's real. When you're good and you and somebody really knows what they're doing. That's why I say more about the people than the technique because there's, I can, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, but give me the person and, but that dry needling is, is it's the most effective of any of the, uh, of the stuff that I've used it in. This person is in California that you use, uh, the girl that helps me as in Hawaii. And then, uh, they, they teach in Colorado. It's actually a, it's actually a technique that they developed. Uh, some guys that were studying pain is from my understanding, they were studying pain.

Speaker 2:          02:12:18       And so what they did is they had all these people that were injured and different areas and then they injected them with different solutions and they injected them with like a placebo and like Celine and Novacane and all kinds of different things. And everybody got better. And what they realized is that it was the needle and the acuteness of the needles themselves in the areas that were painful, that were causing, that was causing this release. And so they develop the whole pain referral chart and a, and then they die and they developed this, this technique. And uh, it's, it's cause everybody always confuse miss confused, you know, confuses it with acupuncture. They owe Yaki book drag. No, it's not acupuncture. This is in the soft tissue acupuncture's on the Meridians and on the electrical system. Right. This is soft tissue. This is, this is to get the soft tissue to release, but they'll take stuff that you've had that cyst like a cable somewhere or not or something that just won't release and, but it's, you know, it's back to that no pain, no gain. Oh yeah. For sure. There's always that. I've got a lady that does trigger point massage and it's the most painful shit I've ever experienced in my life. It's like you just want to quit. Absolutely. When I get out of there the next day, everything's like loose and pliable and, and I've had things that are like,

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       well, I've really injured myself. And she fixed it. Yeah. And then like a day later, like it doesn't hurt anymore. I'm like, this is strange for, and it's been hurt like for months. Yes. So there was something in there that was not enough. And I always assume that that's an injury and sometimes it's not an age. It's not, yeah. It's just the tissue. It's just not really set up. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and they've tested it up to them to deal with the Fascia and some other stuff going on that did that, that they have to know how to release it. And saunas seems to help that quite a bit too crazy. The combination of those two are, I mean that's, that's what I found is that sauna and ice kind of eliminate the need really to get worked on enlisted super cute. Like if it's not, if it's super cute, then there you, you, you know, you need, you need somebody to go in there and, you know, put the Jack Hammer on it.

Speaker 1:          02:14:22       But, but if it's not a cute like that, just the normal maintenance and, and, and actually preventing the stuff from getting to a point where you really need to get the work, the sauna ends magic. That stuff is crazy good. And it seems to me that when I've been ramping up the temperature, like in the two hundreds and now in the two to it seems more effective, more effective, more effective. It's more intense. More torture. Yeah. More towards her, more results. But I'm a little bit, you know, and I don't know, maybe it's something you can find out, but I this thing with, I'm a little rocky right now with the, with the infrared was going to ask you that I'm a little rocky with the infrared right now only because, uh, of just some of the, uh, something that happened to me with my skin and then, and then met, I met a dermatologist that was pretty educated and he was saying that, you know, that that, uh, that he says is that it damages the Collagen and then it does, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:15:16       Yeah. Damages the Collagen in your body. He's way, hey, affects the structure of the skin because of the penetration of it. And that the most you should ever do is, this is, and these are my words, but the, uh, the most you should ever do is, is, is, you know, three times a week for 15 minutes at the most for infrared. Yeah. And Andy was saying that, uh, and you should never look at it as well. Jesus, like it's harmful to the eyes. Yeah. So, so I got a regular sauna just because the protocol that the doctor Rhonda Patrick was talked about for those, I guess it was uh, was it Norway? Yeah. Yeah. That was all regular songs. Yeah. So I'm like look, if they're getting into this results from regular sauna, I'll just do a regular sauna. Well I like regular anyway cause it just seems like it's natural.

Speaker 1:          02:16:01       It's kind of like ice. Like people go and Cryo, hey you want to go cry? I'll go. I have a nice tub. I don't eat crow. And by the way if you, if you want to do a real ice going on ice tub, cause Cryo is cake walk compared to a real iced up. You can only do Cryo for a couple of minutes to, and you don't have heat next to it. And I mean you can not only do ice for a couple minutes till it's like think about cryo though is you can do cryo and then work out. Yeah, you can do Iceland workout too and know, yeah I do that all the

Speaker 2:          02:16:29       time. In fact, we incorporate ice into training. And so one of the things that we do is we'll three quarters into the training, we'll just pull out, right when you start to kind of lose some of your juice and you'll go do like three minutes and come out and then try and you have another gear. So that's another little thing to incorporate ice within that within that system. Or we'll do ice as we, as we train as one of the stations, imagine doing a circuit. And one of the stations is, you know, we are doing, uh, uh, we're doing a horse a couple of months ago on the last season maybe, but we were doing a, uh, like a, an iron horse free standing in a horse position with your arms and we'd stand in that position for 10 or 15 minutes of course, position with your, on your musical horse stance.

Speaker 2:          02:17:09       Yeah. Horse car. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So we're in a horse stance with where the arms are straight out. Okay. You're holding, so call it the iron horse or whatever, just standing in the horse. So He's standing in the horse position, 10 minutes, go on the ice, three minutes. Oh, come back out San, they'll send another thing, go on the back of the ice in the thing. Blow you up, explode you like crazy. So I mean there's always, like I said, there's always a little, you know, a little hook to give it. But the ice to incorporate it within your training I think is phenomenal. Like people, that's why I questioned warming up because people go warm up. How about do three to five minutes ice and then go start all your cardio and start to train. Right now your body will just be freaked out, freaked out.

Speaker 2:          02:17:50       But it's, the ice makes you stimulate it. Like when you feel the system, it's, it's cold but you're not cold. Like it's trying to heat up, heat up Michael Phelps in the pool, heat up. It's revving. Interesting. So there's all of that. That's like the science of the fun, you know, the, uh, the, for me, I look at it like a laboratory. It's a little bit like being an artist and playing all that stuff that brings, makes that keeps me interested. It keeps me excited about about learning. Uh, learning. Cause I think it's about learning. It's all about learning. Yeah. Learning about your body and learning about what to affective. Yeah. Well that's why I'm glad there's guys like you out there. The Guinea pigs. Yeah. Well the Guinea pigs, Guinea pigs. That again are in my age group. Yeah. So like, I know that it's possible because they're in this 55 absolutely long after that. Well, listen man, thank you. Thanks for coming here. Thanks for doing that. I want to do your workout too. Yeah. Well you're, you have an open invitation. I happen. I gotta I gotta I'm still a after the fires, I'm still cleaning, so I got this weekend. I should, we are doing a cert, so we're training some people this weekend, but after this weekend, I'm open for the summer. So if you, you want to come and, uh, you know, beautiful. We'll do that, Ben. Let's make it happen. [inaudible] Aloha to you too. Thank you. Thank you. Bye everybody.
