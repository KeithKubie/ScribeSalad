1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
So are you going to college for
the either back to college? You're,

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:07,230
he'd been in the military. Okay.
Number one out of the gate. Crush it.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,050
That's what you should do in college.
You should crush it.

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,540
You should study hard
and you should crush it.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,200
Now in order to do that, you've got
to get a mindset. Cause guess what?

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:21,000
You're going to think when you get out
of the military, you'd be like, go,

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,330
this is nobody do and all of this does.
This doesn't matter. You can be like, Hey,

8
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:28,490
I was in,
I was in Iraq eight months ago,

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,240
or I was in Afghanistan six months ago
and now you're sitting here telling me to

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,620
read a book and write down words on a
piece of paper. This doesn't matter.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,010
That's an easy,
that's an easy path to go down.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,880
It's pretty easy to say that. You
know why? Because it's actually true.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,690
And what you did in combat has more
gravity and more consequence than anything

14
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,160
you're going to do in college.

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,810
And if you want to go down that path
and be, this stuff doesn't matter.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,130
This is an important compared to what
I've done, so I'm going to blow it off.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,820
That's a path you can go down if
you want to. I don't recommend it.

18
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,590
What I recommend you doing is straight
up crushing college. That's what I meant.

19
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:17,040
Recommend you doing. How'd he
do that? Because everybody,

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,080
if you make that decision
that you want to crush it,

21
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,040
if you want to make the decision that
you're going to prove to people that,

22
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,280
you know what? Yeah, I was
overseas, I was in combat.

23
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:28,530
Now I'm coming back and your
little games that you're playing,

24
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:33,060
I'm going to beat you in your own games.
So how do you do that? Number one,

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,840
do the reading that you get assigned to
do the assignments that you get tasked

26
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:43,320
with. Do everything. Let
that be your new job.

27
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,060
These silly little games that they're
playing. Let that be your job.

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,370
Just like I was talking
about ocs when I went to ocs,

29
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:53,520
I made that like a game for
me that I was going to win.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,300
So do that with college and then
on top of that, make it a game.

31
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:05,280
Yes. But then on top of that
as a deeper commander's intent,

32
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,280
make it that you're going to not
just do well there as a game,

33
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:10,050
but you're going to do well
so you can get smarter.

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,400
So you can really actually
learn information that's
going to make you a better

35
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,170
person and give you better

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,590
ability to dominate in the
world of, that's what you
should be doing in college.

37
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,630
Now, these kids that you're going
to be going to college with,

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,470
they're not going to have this attitude.
They're going to be, you know, hey,

39
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:35,610
what do I need to do to get by?
What's Sally doing tonight?

40
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:39,570
I'm more concerned about that than I am
about going out dominating this course

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,370
so that I can get an a so that I have
knowledge so I can go and crush some,

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,220
some vocation later on in life.

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,200
So don't just do it as a game. You've
gotta play the game a little bit. I mean,

44
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,170
you've got to, for me, I get
the game mentality going,

45
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:59,640
but I think game mentality is a rooted
in something deeper and it's rooted.

46
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:03,670
It is gaining knowledge to be smarter.
And better as a human.

47
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,800
Now a couple things about
college and the actual tactics,

48
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:12,640
techniques and procedures to dominate.
Because when I went to college,

49
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,540
I did dominate and when
I went to high school,

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,900
I did not dominate. Why don't the high
school, I didn't care about high school.

51
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,690
I was like, whatever, got
waiting. Can I go in the military?

52
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,840
It can I go now. So, but when I went
to college, I had a new attitude,

53
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,520
which was I'm going to dominate.
I'm an,

54
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,240
I'm in a battle against these people here,
I'm going to beat them.

55
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,180
So there's some of the things
that are important. Number one,

56
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:38,650
college is all about time management.

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,160
Getting ahead of the curve
because it's so easy.

58
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,470
That's what happens with kids in college.

59
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:48,610
That's why they don't do well because for
the first time there's no one tracking

60
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:51,070
them.
No one's imposing discipline on them.

61
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,050
You have to have in order
to do well in college,

62
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:56,200
you have to have self discipline because
no one's going to tell you to start

63
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,880
that paper that's due in six weeks.

64
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,730
No one's going to tell you to
start it tomorrow. Yup. Yup.

65
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,010
You can just blow it off.

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,880
You can blow it off for five and a half
weeks and then you've got to write a 30

67
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,850
page paper in two days and it's gonna.
It's not going to be quality.

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,400
No one's going to ask you have you
done your homework before dinner?

69
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,030
That's right. So you need to
get the time management going.

70
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,520
Do you need to get a disciplined
time management schedule?

71
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,960
You need to get ahead of the
curve as early as possible. Right.

72
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,290
You know when you want to write papers,
do a 30 page paper due,

73
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,200
you need to write it in chunks
and it makes it so easy.

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,270
I mean it was a joke when
I was going to college,

75
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,310
I would have my papers
completely done like a week out,

76
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,931
like a week out.

77
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:42,280
I would be done with a 30 page paper and
then I would just be reviewing it and

78
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,650
getting it all completely dialed in.

79
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,980
I'd turn it in two days early
and then move onto the next one.

80
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,770
Same thing with studying.
You don't want to study.

81
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,920
You do want to study hard right
before the day of the test,

82
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,980
but you want to have knowledge already
absorbed in there so you wanna.

83
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,810
You want to study leading up to that.

84
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,460
When you do reading that I talked about
highlight, break out the highlighters.

85
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,460
That's what I do and all these books
that were hammering through right now,

86
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,180
we don't always,
I always send out pictures of,

87
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,820
they're all highlighted and marked up.

88
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,190
That's how I'm getting the
good information out of them.

89
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,680
So highlight and then another little
trick is to make the flashcards I used to

90
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:20,140
highlight and then I would make
flash cards about what I highlighted.

91
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,390
Turn everything into a question and
then you go through the flash cards and

92
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,220
you're going to, you're
going to memorize stuff. Oh,

93
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:33,880
here's the big one. This is
really obvious, but guess what?

94
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:37,870
People don't ask questions,
ask questions.

95
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,900
I used to raise my hand straight.
I would sit in the front row.

96
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,120
First of all in college,
I sat in the front row.

97
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,680
I was 20 what was I 20 I think I was
27 or 28 years old going to college.

98
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,980
I would sit in the front row in the
little desk and I look like Arnold

99
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,090
Schwarzenegger in like
a little kid's desks.

100
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,380
I then I'd raise my hand all the way
up like all the way up over my head and

101
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,850
they'd be looking at me,
you know,

102
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:05,150
cause in college they kind of stop raising
their hand. But I did it anyways. Yeah.

103
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,400
Just to be be you. Just
to be, just to do it.

104
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,510
So I'd raise my and but you ask questions
cause guess what? The college kids,

105
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:17,240
they don't ask questions and, and
guess what? Adults don't ask questions,

106
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,040
why don't they ask us? Cause they got an
eagle. They didn't want to look stupid.

107
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,990
Right. I don't care. I'm here to win.

108
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,850
Exactly. Oh I you don't think I'm
smart. Let's check out the GPA homeboy.

109
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,713
You know what I'm saying?

110
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,900
So ask questions if I and ask
questions as soon as that,

111
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,770
as soon as the knowledge,

112
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,220
as soon as the understanding train
starts to get derailed a little bit,

113
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,530
ask the question right then maybe give it,

114
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,560
maybe give it a minute to see if you
can get it back on track by yourself.

115
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,980
But the minute you realize
you're not understanding,
raise your hand and say, Hey,

116
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:52,280
you know what teacher, I don't
understand that. Can you reexplain that?

117
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,860
Because I'm not understanding. Yeah,
you don't want to miss that train.

118
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,880
I don't want to miss the train.

119
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:59,090
You don't want it to go too far off
course and then you're just lost.

120
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,030
So when you feel it coming off,
try and catch up real quick, clean.

121
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,550
You'll take a look and
then just raise your hand.

122
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,470
Put your hand all the way up in the air,
sit in the front row,

123
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,540
put your hand all the way up in the air
and look at the teacher with with a dead

124
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,290
serious face and they're gonna look
at you all nervous and be like, yes,

125
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,350
that's the only one. I went to
college. They called me John Because,

126
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,420
because that's what the
attendance sheet said,

127
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:23,090
cause my real name is John and that's
what the attendance sheet said.

128
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,040
And so they'd say, yeah, I'd
be sitting there and they'd
say yes John. And I'd say,

129
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,660
yeah, I don't understand that.
Could you re explain it please? Hey,

130
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,390
when they called you John, did
that fuel the fire? No, not at all.

131
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,980
It doesn't matter to me,

132
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,420
but it's the only time cause like I didn't
know these people because normally if

133
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,660
I'm going to work with someone,
when I introduced myself I'll be like,

134
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,640
hey my name is chocolate. Cause
that's what everyone always calls me.

135
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,000
But these people would call my name and
the tendons and I didn't want to have

136
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,990
this, you know, adversarial releasing
shit. Sorry. Oh yes John. That's me.

137
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,850
The other thing is, you know, do
some psychological warfare. You know,

138
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:02,690
I would line up my pencils, I do it
on the podcast you bought right here.

139
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,170
Eye Line up pencils. It's a, it's
a, it's also getting into character.

140
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,540
You're priming,
you're priming myself.

141
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,750
I'm looking at the teacher like I am
so ready to take notes that if I have a

142
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:16,670
downed pencil it will not cost me a
single letter. I'll be back in the game.

143
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,810
All your contingencies.
Yeah,

144
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:23,920
contingency passes a standing by it
and then so they sit in the front role,

145
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,730
line up your pencils,
have your notebooks ready,

146
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,870
personally challenged the
teacher you want it to.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,400
You want your personal
challenge to be the pole,

148
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,230
every piece of knowledge out of them
and then go beyond what they know.

149
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,640
I was, I was, I was
competing with the teachers.

150
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,430
I was trying to learn more
than they actually knew.

151
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,610
And then they bring their little tests,
a little exams,

152
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:48,410
you and you just crushed
them and smash them.

153
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,090
Now they'll see the thing you gotta be
careful of here is this can get political,

154
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,890
this can get political.

155
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:59,250
And if you start being
offensive with the way you act,

156
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,760
if you start rubbing it in their face,
then guess what?

157
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:06,720
That can affect your grade. And part of
the game here is to get a good grade.

158
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,230
So you actually, it's a time for you
to start building your relationship,

159
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,310
building skills, time to start
building your leadership skills.

160
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,160
Cause you're gonna start
manipulating the teacher, right?

161
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,490
You want to make them think that you're
actually super interested in stupid crap

162
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,630
class that they're teaching. I want
them to think that not out. Now,

163
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,020
some classes you're going
to love and they're gonna,

164
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,220
you're gonna learn a lot from,

165
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,210
like if you're into English and you get
to take advanced grammar and syntax,

166
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:38,040
you're going to be sitting in
there like, yes, this is rocks.

167
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,990
But there's gonna be some
classes you don't want to take.

168
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,500
But you got to get in there and make
your teacher think that you're super

169
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,161
interested in,

170
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:47,850
super fired up to learn that thing and
that you're not just interested in the

171
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:51,410
grade. But at the same time they got to
know that grades important to you too.

172
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,750
So you want to get along
with them and again,

173
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,790
go into college and if you're a veteran,
you're representing all of us out there.

174
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,360
So you should be going in there
and just smashing college.
