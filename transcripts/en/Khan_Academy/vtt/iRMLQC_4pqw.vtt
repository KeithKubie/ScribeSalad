00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:03.124
- Storing bread in the
refrigerator delays drying

00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:04.447
and the growth of mold,

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:08.708
but increase the rate at
which the bread loses flavor.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.647
So that already felt a little bit strange,

00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:11.831
especially right around here.

00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:14.050
But let's think about
why it feels strange.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.211
So what's the subject?

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:17.987
The subject is storing
bread in the refrigerator.

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:18.788
It is singular.

00:00:18.788 --> 00:00:19.868
It is a singular action.

00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:22.612
The singular action of storing
bread in the refrigerator.

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:24.829
This right over here is singular.

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.629
We have a singular subject.

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:28.708
And then we see it right
over here, where later on,

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:30.670
and once again, the word
delays isn't up for debate.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.136
They didn't underline this
as a potential error place.

00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:39.386
This is a singular
version of the verb delay.

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:41.674
So this right over here is also singular.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.333
So this verb right over here,

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.926
this singular verb agrees
with the singular subject.

00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:51.050
Let me do that same magenta color.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.307
If you have a singular subject,

00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:55.645
then you should have a singular verb.

00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:56.249
So this makes sense.

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:57.340
Storing bread in the refrigerator

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.232
delays drying and the growth of mold.

00:01:00.232 --> 00:01:03.015
But then over here we say "but increase."

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:04.536
Increase?

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:07.067
This is the plural form of the verb,

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:11.110
so this really should be
"increases" to make it singular.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.263
To give it the singular form of the word.

00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:16.393
For this verb to agree
with the singular subject,

00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:19.153
it needs to be "but increases" the rate

00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:20.944
at which the bread loses flavor.

00:01:20.944 --> 00:01:23.762
So the error is definitely
where we suspected.

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:27.082
It's in this part of the sentence.
