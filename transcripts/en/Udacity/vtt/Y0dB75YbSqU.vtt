00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.395
In order to illustrate
correlated equilibrium and

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:07.181
why you would care about it,
I want to first introduce a game.

00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:10.536
This is game theory after all and
this is the game of chicken.

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:11.847
Are you familiar with
the game of chicken?

00:00:11.847 --> 00:00:17.354
&gt;&gt; I have seen the game of chicken
on movies from the 40s and

00:00:17.354 --> 00:00:20.680
stuff or 50s or 60s.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.350
The General Tso part doesn't make
sense to me, but the chicken part.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.570
It's like cars rushing at each other and
teenage, I'm going to say boys,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.770
deciding whether or not they're going to
be chickens and swerve off the road or

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.000
whether they're going to be,
tough guys and risk dying.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.330
&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly right.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.370
So the two versions are two cars going
towards one another, vroom vroom vroom.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.290
Voom voom voom.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.970
And who's going to swerve first?

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.006
What happens if they swerve
in the same direction?

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:47.806
I've never even thought of.

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:52.211
The other one is where they're both
driving towards a cliff as fast as they

00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:56.687
can and who's going to either dive out
of the car at the last minute were turn

00:00:56.687 --> 00:00:58.280
their car away.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.120
And the chicken is the one who loses
the girl because this is in the 1950s.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.769
&gt;&gt; The girl's in the car
going over the cliff?

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.110
&gt;&gt; No, the girl's usually
the one that starts the race.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.435
&gt;&gt; It's the 50's,
it was a different time Michael.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.900
&gt;&gt; Understand.
&gt;&gt; And what does that have to do with

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.170
General Tso's, well I'm-
&gt;&gt; Or game theory, for that matter.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.230
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a game right?

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.390
In fact, we can turn it into a game.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.940
And how do we know it's a game?

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.208
Because I can draw a matrix.

00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:18.844
So I'm going to say that
there are two actions here.

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:19.830
You can either chicken out.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.630
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.709
&gt;&gt; Or you can dare.

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:22.928
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:25.400
&gt;&gt; So let's just draw a matrix
that captures that idea.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.410
So I'll just put it right here.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.503
Okay.
So there's a matrix you can either

00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:29.983
dare or you can be a chicken.

00:01:29.983 --> 00:01:32.529
&gt;&gt; Okay, uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; Okay now, if both of you dare then

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:38.500
you both get zero because that's what
death is equal to in this world zero.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.226
&gt;&gt; I see nothing good
ever happens again.

00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:43.540
&gt;&gt; Right nothing good ever
happens again you just you dare.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.802
So you both got the girl, but
you both died so it didn't really help.

00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:47.921
&gt;&gt; You don't get
the girl if you're dead.

00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:49.685
&gt;&gt; That's probably true.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:53.240
Okay, so, on the other hand you
could there and the other guy could

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.425
chicken out in which case you get
seven and the chicken gets to why two?

00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:59.930
Because you get to live another day he.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.370
&gt;&gt; Live but
you get to live in constant shame.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.500
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right
which is worth two.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.260
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; Apparently.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.770
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Or

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.180
of course the this is a symmetric game,
so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.130
if I chicken out and
you dare it works the other way.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.270
And the other option is
both chicken out and

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.960
that's a whole lot
better than being dead.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.310
And it's actually better
than living in shame alone

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.880
because you're sharing the shame.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.620
But it's not as good as having
dared while the other chickened.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.221
Chickened out.

00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:23.496
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that sounds good?

00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:25.922
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 6 seems kind of high but
I can live with that.

00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:27.837
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's math, Michael.

00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:28.870
It doesn't really matter.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.480
[LAUGH] So it's a general sum game and
it's a matrix and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.162
all this other stuff about cars and

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:36.590
everything don't matter anymore
because everything is the matrix.
