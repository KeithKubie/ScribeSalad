00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.500
Great now that our
environment is set up,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.970
let's start coding an interstitial ad.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.060
The first thing we have to do
in our AdActivity Java code

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.380
is to set up our application key.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.070
We do this by saying
AdRegistration.setAppKey and

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.290
then you'd put in your unique app key.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.360
This key is given to you
when you register for

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.570
a game developer account through Amazon,
and it's unique for every app.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.310
It helps identify your app, and
keep track of ad displays and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.775
clicks that your app receives.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:33.200
You'd usually use your own app key,
but since we're just doing a general

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.910
example, I'll use a sample
key that Amazon provides.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.150
Now let's make our ad.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.757
First I'm going to make a private
variable of interstitial ad type,

00:00:41.757 --> 00:00:44.375
which we know is a class
in our Amazon ads library.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.284
Then I'll give it a name,
InterstitialAd.

00:00:47.284 --> 00:00:51.223
Now that we have our ad variable,
we're going to create an instance of it,

00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:52.820
load it, and show it.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.770
So back to our onCreate method.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.600
I can create our ad by saying this,
then giving the variable name,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.880
InterstitialAd equals a new
InterstitialAd object.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.510
This ad object needs to know the
activity it's going to be used in, and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.530
again that's just going
to be this activity.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.800
That is to say,
our InterstitialAd activity.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.690
Then I just need to add a line
of code to load our ad,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.410
which is as simple as saying our
variable interstitial ad.loadad.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.050
But what happens once this ad is loaded?

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.620
I'll have to create an ad listener
that will just listen to the ad and

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.200
decide what happens when it's loaded or
when it's closed.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.650
To listen to our ad, we have to say
this.interstitial.ad.setListener,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.280
and then we're going to
define a listener of our own.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.400
So we're going to create an Internet
class called MyCustomListener,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.720
and we'll just build off
the default add listener.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.325
So we'll say MyCustomListener
extends default ad listening.

00:01:55.325 --> 00:02:00.055
The listener notices what happens to
our ad at three different points,

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:03.265
which are methods in the listener class.

00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:07.480
One point when the ad is loaded or
unloaded,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.040
which takes in the ad object and
its properties as parameters.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.430
A second point, if the ad fails to load,
which will throw an error message,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.299
and a third point when the ad is
dismissed, that is when it's closed.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.490
And we can write in
specific behaviors for

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.880
our ad or
app at each of these three points.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.870
For example,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.400
if our ad fails to load we might want to
put in code to call a backup ad network.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.210
If our ad is closed, we might want to
put in code to resume our game.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.400
But for now we're going to focus on
what happens once our ad is loaded.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.410
Once our ad is loaded,
I'm just going to want to show it.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.025
So to do that, I want to specify
the activity that it's in, and

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.051
then a reference to our ad object.

00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:57.353
And then similar to loading the ad,
I just say .showad.

00:02:57.353 --> 00:03:01.400
It's important that the show ad is
inside the on ad loaded method,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.130
because we can only show
an ad after it's been loaded.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.880
So if we put it up here and
it didn't load, we would get an error.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.911
So this method is all we
really need to show our ad.

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.229
And the last thing we need to do is
specify that we're using this custom

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.060
listener of ours.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.120
So let's replace this with
a new MyCustomListener object.
