00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.650
Well let's see.

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.530
Eight out of ten cats prefer Whiskas.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.550
That's comparing eight cats to ten cats.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.430
Even though I didn't write cats here,
this eight was referring to cats.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.062
So those are the same units,
that makes that a ratio.

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:14.430
Gas costs $4.25 per gallon.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.860
So gallon is one unit and
dollars is a different unit.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.880
Okay so
that's different units means rates.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.480
Out of 500 grads,
200 grads got business jobs.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.050
That's a ratio.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.700
And the Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.060
Well, that's just a fact,
that's neither a rate nor a ratio.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.860
If you got these all right,
great work, and if not don't worry.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.300
We're going to talk more
about this in this lesson.
