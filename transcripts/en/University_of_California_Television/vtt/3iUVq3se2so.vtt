00:00:00.685 --> 00:00:01.710
(logo whooshing)

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.640
- [Narrator] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.763
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:13.190
(calm music)

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.030
- Good afternoon.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.560
Forgive my voice, a little
something is in my throat.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.330
But in any event, I am William Lester,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.350
professor of chemistry

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.280
and chair of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.250
We're pleased, along with
the graduate council,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.920
to present Dr. Leon
Lederman, this year's speaker

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.083
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.550
As a condition of this
request, we're obligated

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.290
and happy to tell you how the
endowment came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.760
It's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.590
this campus is linked to
the history of California

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.963
and the Bay Area.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.260
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the army,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.400
came to San Francisco during the gold rush

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.160
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.960
In 1885, Charles
established a professorship

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.030
here at Berkeley as an expression

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.263
of his long held interest in education.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.250
His daughter, Lily Hitchcock
Coit, still treasured

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.990
in San Francisco for
her colorful personality

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.860
as well as her generosity,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.080
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.860
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.163
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.660
The Hitchcock Fund has become one

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.390
of the most cherished endowments

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.480
of the University of California,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.290
recognizing the highest distinction

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.040
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.010
Thank you, Lily, Charles,
and now a few words

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.907
about Dr. Lederman.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.130
Leon Lederman is internationally renowned

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.740
for his research on neutrinos,
ghost-like particles

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.150
that pass through
everything in the universe,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.480
and on subatomic
particles known as quarks.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.420
He was awarded the National
Medal of Science in 1965

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.190
and the Wolf Prize in physics in 1982

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.000
for discovering the bottom quark,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.570
which establishes the existence

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.260
of a third generation of quarks.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.440
In 1988, Lederman was
co-winner of the Nobel Prize

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.860
in Physics with Melvin
Schwartz and Jack Steinberger

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.230
for his discovery of the muon neutrino,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.723
proving that there are at least
two families of neutrinos.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.800
His research has provided major advances

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.980
in the understanding of weak interactions,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.980
one of the fundamental nuclear forces.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.200
In addition to his work as a researcher,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.240
Lederman is also a leading
proponent of science

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.750
and math education at the
high school and college level.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.160
He founded the Illinois Mathematics

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.610
and Science Academy, IMSA, in 1986,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.013
and has served as resident
scholar since 1998.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.044
IMSA is an internationally recognized

00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:15.220
educational institution
for developing talent

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.110
and stimulating excellence in teaching

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.240
and learning and mathematics,
science and technology.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.158
Lederman is also an outspoken advocate

00:03:23.158 --> 00:03:26.970
for the Physics First movement,
which seeks to rearrange

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.710
the current high school science curriculum

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.653
so that physics precedes
chemistry and biology.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.310
Dr. Lederman received his master's in 1948

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.670
and his PhD in 1951 from
Columbia University.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.280
In 1963, he proposed the
idea that eventually became

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.920
the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.170
where he served as
director from 1979 to 1989,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.393
and is now director emeritus.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.260
He previously served

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.530
as the Eugene Higgins
Professor at Columbia

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.825
and as the Frank L. Sulzberger
Professor of Physics

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.600
at the University of Chicago

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.960
before becoming the Pritzker
Professor of Physics

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.813
at the Illinois Institute
of Technology in 1992.

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.100
Lederman is a founding member

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.980
of the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.040
of the United States Department of Energy

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.250
and is a member of the
National Academy of Sciences.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.550
He's also a past president of AAAS,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.740
the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.700
It is during my service on the AAAS board

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.260
that I first met Leon

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.460
and encountered his magnetic personality.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.787
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Leon Lederman.

00:04:34.787 --> 00:04:38.037
(audience applauding)

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.070
- Thank you very much, that
was a really good introduction.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.237
Could you do it again?

00:04:56.237 --> 00:04:57.300
(audience laughing)

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.133
Okay.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.610
Well, it's great to be at Berkeley,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.760
I haven't been here for some years.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.570
Great to see many, many old friends.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.760
I'm delighted to be here and only sorry

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.760
that I haven't prepared the
most spectacular presentation

00:05:19.332 --> 00:05:21.053
in world history.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.090
But I thought I would talk today

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:32.053
about something I've been
working at for some time,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.653
and that is on science education.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.100
I started getting involved, well,

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.030
I started getting involved in education

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.870
as a professor at Columbia where teaching

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.840
was considered a very serious
obligation of the faculty,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.403
something I enjoy doing.

00:05:51.824 --> 00:05:56.080
And something curious
happened, I went to Fermilab

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.580
as an administrator and found myself

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.470
ill at ease because I
wasn't teaching anymore,

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.530
I'd do funny things
like catch some post-doc

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.610
in the corridor and pin
him against the wall

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.810
and teach him something.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.510
Eventually, the group of post-docs called

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.630
for a meeting with me

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.450
and tried to figure out what was wrong.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.680
And eventually, they got
it, that I'm not teaching,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.190
and that's a bad thing to do suddenly.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.000
And so that started a series

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:39.550
of Fermilab educational activities,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.550
Saturday morning physics for
hundreds of high school kids

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.600
that came on Saturday to
listen and things like that

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.040
and ultimately, the Illinois
Math and Science Academy,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.040
which I'm very proud of,
it's just won a major award

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.140
by the Intel Foundation as
one of the best high schools

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.860
in the United States in the
teaching of math and science.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.023
That's good stuff.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.530
So I thought I would regale you today

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.500
with some of my efforts in education

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.920
and we'll try to use
all this modern stuff.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.263
What I asked for was do you have,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.703
at Berkeley, a slide projector?

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.453
And I got a blank.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.320
Usually, when I ask
that, they say oh yeah,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.380
we have one, it's in the
closet on the third floor,

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.380
so I suggested that here,
but there was no third floor,

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.940
no closet, so.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.970
But we have a good effort

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.970
and I hope that you'll be able
to see some of these things.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.460
I have to recognize from this introduction

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.090
that fame is an important
ingredient in being a physicist

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.333
especially with awards and medals.

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:14.170
This was illustrated this by
being on a crowded train coming

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:19.170
out of Chicago one day and
it stopped at this institute

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:25.710
for mentally handicapped
patients that the train stopped

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.740
and the nurse got on the
train with a clipboard

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.740
and a bunch of patients
and she organized them.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.740
And as very crowded she counted
them, one, two, three, four,

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.340
and she looked at me and say who are you

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.790
and I said I'm Leon Lederman,

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.490
I have a Nobel Prize in Physics

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.107
and I'm director of Fermilab.

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:47.230
She said, yeah, five, six.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.397
(audience laughing)

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.630
So here's this thing.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.690
I hope we'll get it going.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.160
A Scientist Looks at Science Education

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.060
and I'm very well aware

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.560
that education is a complex phenomenon

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.740
and we all work at it.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.600
When most of us who've been in
academia we work at it hard.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.350
I think a lot of us, especially
in the teaching of physics,

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.670
are aware of difficulties and so on.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:29.670
And so a lot of this that I'm
gonna tell you is experience.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.730
My point of view is that

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.850
of an experimental particle physicists

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.236
to gradually and then
hopelessly became immersed

00:09:41.236 --> 00:09:43.680
in the educational process

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.060
and I've been now at it full
time for well over 10 years

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.963
with mixed results.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.930
First of all I worry a lot.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:58.930
I worry about the the whole gamut

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.700
of educational things from pre-k

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.880
which is now very important
especially around here

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.090
where Scientists in the
Crib has become a textbook

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:16.010
for many of us and it
came out of Berkeley,

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.550
to all the way to grade way
up in the college graduates

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:25.330
and worry about the teachers,
the poor kids left out

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.160
of some of the advantages,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.770
the gifted kids are we
taking care of them?

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.130
The college science dropouts,
the ninth grade biology

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.710
which is my pet peeve.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.950
Science illiterate college graduates

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.560
where for too many colleges

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.520
it's still I forgot the

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.210
one semester of rocks for jocks

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.620
or whatever it is that's
considered to be a proper course.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.550
I worry about global
warming, the Dow Jones,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.290
all kinds of things.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.723
But most of them not terribly relevant.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.370
This is something you
may not be able to read

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.290
but I just want to say we live in a time

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:16.290
of escalating global crises.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.100
Problems so complex,
interdependent, far-reaching

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.570
and resistant to traditional
modes of thinking

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.880
and problem-solving they
seem to render us impotent.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.940
A short list is the economy.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.983
All of you here especially
in California, know about it.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.930
Joblessness, that goes with it,

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.500
the health care system still struggling

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.030
and in the Congress.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:45.010
The problems of global climate
change, the wars we have.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.230
There's enough here to
keep many, many busy.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.020
Yes and then there is the competition,

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.483
there's the growth and power
of China and India and Brazil.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.040
But there is also an emerging realization

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.430
that scientific, economic, socio-political

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.430
and environmental futures
are inextricably linked,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.030
causing us to re-evaluate
policies, I hope,

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.913
and redesign strategies.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.110
So what do we do about STEM education.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.350
STEM, of course you all
know, is science, technology,

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.800
engineering and mathematics.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.720
It's interesting that
the engineers have gotten

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.680
into this nickname twice and
maybe that they deserve it.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.210
Science, technology,
education and mathematic,

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.820
where we now train our students

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.470
to think in decidedly different ways.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.330
We have to since clearly the old ways

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.050
of teaching have failed.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.993
Einstein said something like,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160
the thinking that created our
seemingly intractable problems

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.170
will not be able to solve them.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.830
And so when we're talking about education

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.860
and we have a recognition that
goes back certainly to 1983

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.920
but probably long before that

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.270
what we must do to have our students open

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.420
to creatively generate new knowledge,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.420
new questions, new ideas
and globally collaborate

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.580
to wisely improve the human condition,

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.100
to have them think in
decidingly different ways,

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.860
clearly we must teach in
decidingly different ways.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.080
So there is an enormous burden we have

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.630
on our educational system

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.960
which is very difficult to implement

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.093
as anybody who's worked in
education will assure you.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.830
So 21st century is a different century.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.410
It's a knowledge and
information based society

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.000
which will produce new
opportunities, new challenges

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.570
in all dimensions of our life

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.800
and there are three certainties.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.370
Change is inevitable.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.050
Complete coverage of some
subject is impossible

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.840
and obsolescence is unavoidable.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.240
I've been told that three years is

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.662
about the lasting period

00:14:17.662 --> 00:14:20.150
for electrical engineering.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.370
It's not that you have
to go back to school

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.260
but the things you've
learned in your four years

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.260
at electrical engineering
become obsolete very quickly

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.040
and so continuous study is essential.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.900
New technologies, new
discovery, new media,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.620
new social structures,

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.370
new possibilities for quality of life,

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.566
make lifelong learning

00:14:44.566 --> 00:14:48.743
not only a handsy slogan but essential

00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:51.600
so that humans can think, create, learn

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.963
and collaborate forever.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.080
The divided lifetime,

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.580
once upon a time you
learned for 20 years or so

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.820
and then for the rest of your
life you apply that knowledge.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.890
That clearly does not work anymore.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:10.450
Lifelong learning becomes
not a slogan but a necessity.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.583
So how are we doing?

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.610
Well as a widely-held
well-documented realization

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.920
that the nation is slipping dangerously

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.980
in its ability to maintain a
robust, innovative, industrial

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.693
and technological society.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.570
Leadership qualities of
science, technology, engineering

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.380
and mathematics, which
have made us prosperous,

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.950
are rapidly being overtaken.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.720
Cries of alarm are now
being sounded by leaders

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.460
in business, economics,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.480
even the Congress and the White House.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.102
And we've never been I think
more fortunately poised

00:15:45.102 --> 00:15:50.102
to make progress in a dramatic
way with this White House.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.920
The huge gap and
essential scientific grasp

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.910
between the US public and the
21st century requirements,

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:02.863
is a major obstacle to
the reforms we need.

00:16:02.863 --> 00:16:05.590
A vigorous technological
nation must have cultural

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.680
and social values to sustain the qualities

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.260
that underlie progress,
that venerate education,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.023
that respect rationality.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.640
A National Commission, which
is something we often seek,

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.640
to make dramatic changes in our system

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:28.560
but can only begin a process
which must be long-term.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.920
Yet our Commissions proliferate

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.423
and I've had some experience with these.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.550
So why do our schools fail?

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.230
Well there's a lot of reasons

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.280
and many of you know these reasons

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.250
and these are well known reasons.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.440
Teacher training, teacher morale,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.930
lack of continuous
professional development

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.650
on the part of teachers,
inadequate teacher evaluation.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.300
In Chicago the number of teachers rated

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.150
as unsatisfactory is something like 0.2%

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.310
which is clearly nonsense.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.750
Teachers are not rewarded
for being good teachers

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.210
or for teaching more demanding subjects

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.370
and conversely difficulty

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.380
in handling poor teachers
is a major problem we have.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.830
Outdated, largely irrelevant curriculum

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.540
and I want to talk some more about that.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.040
Dysfunctional school management system.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.800
If you think about the nation and schools,

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.360
there's 50 states, there are 16,000,

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.653
I think, school districts,

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.400
then you have the various
committed organizations,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.370
the unions, the PTA, the book publishers,

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:50.370
many other organizations
who seek sustenance, profit

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.223
and so on from the school system.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.210
Poverty, lack of preschool preparation,

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.930
low parental education,
motivations and so on.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.130
Not nearly enough parental choice

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.230
for example charter schools,
suburbs, where do you live,

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.130
social promotions, problems,

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.260
retention in grade, summer schools,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.100
inability to use beautiful
educational technology

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.203
that exists but often is just not used.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.900
The Third International
Math and Science Study

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.610
has been widely advertised

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.510
and probably many of you
are somewhat familiar

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.570
with how we do.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.087
Our fourth graders
actually and not so bad.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.680
They are among the leading component

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.020
of our educational system.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:48.020
By eighth grade our students
do slightly above average

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.540
but by 12th grade there
are only two countries

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.460
that we're better than
Cyprus and South Africa.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.710
The picture that emerges from these data

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.780
as expressed by Bill Schmidt

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.453
from Michigan State
University is a curriculum

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.880
that lacks focus, coherence and rigor.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.510
National Association for
Educational Progress assessments

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.440
are in agreement.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.350
Only 20% of US seniors meet the definition

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.600
of proficiency in science.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.530
In 1983 a committee of 10
convened as a National Commission

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.430
to design a curriculum for science.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:36.240
Established the sequence
biology, chemistry, physics,

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.240
as clearly alphabetically correct,

00:19:41.662 --> 00:19:43.220
(audience laughing)

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.750
for high schools but in the year 2008

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.460
this is still the sequence being
used in some huge fraction,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.220
well over 90% of our high schools

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.350
in spite of profound revolutions

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.793
in our knowledge of physics
and chemistry and biology.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.150
How do you get that to change?

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.270
Our high school curricula
are over 100 years old

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.210
and they were established
in 1890 something

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.530
and at least 70 years out of date.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.530
So we need obviously a
sensible science sequence

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.150
and I'm going to talk a
little bit about a sequence

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:31.150
which a major change in
which one studies science

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.380
in the following sequence.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.920
In which in ninth grade instead of biology

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.630
as it is today you study physics

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.190
and in 10th grade you study chemistry

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.570
and in 11th grade you study biology

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.050
and that sequence has
a lot of other effects

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.960
that you have to do when
you change the sequence

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.740
in the way of coordinating and correlating

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.900
and doing something.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.080
There have been a lot of studies,

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.080
enormous number of studies.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.360
Here's the Glen Commission report,

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.740
Report to the Nation from
the National Commission

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.040
of Mathematics and Science Teaching.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.293
I've got a lot of these.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.720
We have, it's an amazing
amount of literature.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.950
There's No Time to Waste.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.783
You can tell from that,

00:21:15.783 --> 00:21:17.110
you don't have to read these reports,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.490
you just read the
titles, No Time to Waste,

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.850
Vital Role of College University Leaders

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.263
in Improving Science and Math Education.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.100
There's the huge interest
on the part of industry,

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:37.890
you know about Bill Gates
with the huge sums of money

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.680
that the Gates Foundation
is putting into schools

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.680
and you have similar activities
from the major industries.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.840
Intel, Motorola, IBM,

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.590
the Business Roundtable
is a very effective group.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.590
More recently Norman Augustine led a study

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.380
which produced a very
important report entitled

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.960
Rising Above the Gathering Storm

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.550
and somewhere some of that
material is percolating

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.933
around in the Congress.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.350
I also strongly recommend
for those of you interested

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.750
to read President Obama's talk

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.080
to the National Academy of Sciences.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.377
Where, just to quote, "I am
here today to set this goal.

00:22:26.377 --> 00:22:29.037
"We will devote more than 3% of our GDP

00:22:29.037 --> 00:22:30.997
"to research and development

00:22:30.997 --> 00:22:34.427
"and improve education
in math and science.

00:22:34.427 --> 00:22:37.667
"Represents the largest
commitment to science innovation

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:38.893
"in American history.

00:22:40.227 --> 00:22:41.807
"In response to Sputnik,

00:22:41.807 --> 00:22:44.107
"President Eisenhower signed legislation

00:22:44.107 --> 00:22:46.697
"if you'll remember to create NASA

00:22:46.697 --> 00:22:49.797
"and to invest in technology,
science and math education

00:22:49.797 --> 00:22:51.767
"from grade school To graduate school."

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:53.817
President Obama said,

00:22:53.817 --> 00:22:56.037
"Today I am announcing
a renewed commitment

00:22:56.037 --> 00:22:58.457
"to education in math and science.

00:22:58.457 --> 00:23:00.227
"American students will
move from the middle

00:23:00.227 --> 00:23:03.687
"to the top of the pack
in science and math

00:23:03.687 --> 00:23:05.007
"over the next decade."

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.990
And so with that, scientists,
engineers, educators,

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.100
like superman and superwoman
remove their lab coats,

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.390
drop this slide rule,

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.420
oh, you don't know what a slide rule is.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.908
It's a piece of wood.

00:23:21.908 --> 00:23:23.630
(audience laughing)

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.690
Yeah, drop their slide rules,

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.230
close their education tomes
and they get involved.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.940
The battle is for the hearts and minds

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.690
of the citizens of the nation.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.250
Enlist the population
this complex set of issues

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.740
that connects scientific
thinking capabilities.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.330
It's a war on ignorance.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.720
We do seem to like wars
so we decided that maybe

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.310
if we have a war on
ignorance that will take away

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.490
from the other guys who want
wars on almost everything else.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.540
The battle grounds are the
schools, museums, the cinema,

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.640
the TV, the newspapers.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.253
What is being tested is a
commitment to rationality.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.780
So here's the war.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.960
War on ignorance and I must say

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.067
that an important component is where

00:24:14.067 --> 00:24:19.067
all the business leaders the
Gates' and the Greg Barretts

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.200
and Lou Gerstners and
Google and YouTube and so on

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.600
governors, congressmen,
engineers, even lawyers.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.750
Is that a misprint?

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.103
No, why not?

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:37.640
And then after a lot of
these, lots of reports,

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.410
well in 2007 my partner, Shirley Malcolm,

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.807
who was the head of education at the AAAS,

00:24:46.807 --> 00:24:48.716
the American Association
Advancement of Science

00:24:48.716 --> 00:24:53.600
and I co-chair the National
Commission mandated

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.530
to fix 21st century STEM education.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.740
So we read reports, lots of reports,

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.210
the reports were amazing.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:06.210
They went back to a report in
1983 called The Nation at Risk

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.360
which was beautiful.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.030
Filled with military metaphors

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.870
like we've created unilateral
educational disarmament.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.763
Really, I wish I'd thought of that.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.980
Eloquent reports, lots of the reports

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.863
and we discovered a
secret room in Washington.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.240
It's called the National
Commission Storage Vault.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.322
All the reports are there.

00:25:37.322 --> 00:25:39.770
(audience laughing)

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:40.683
Lots of them.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.030
And we read these reports and
the reports were all sensible.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.210
They told us what we have to do.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.400
They talked about teachers,
they talked about schools,

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.350
they talked about curriculum,

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.620
they essentially said everything.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.880
The problem was that nothing
was ever implemented.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.890
The failure was a failure to implement

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.430
and that's when

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.597
in our particular experience

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.930
when we tried to implement we found

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:20.220
that the implementation
problem was difficult.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:25.220
So let me go to my own feeling

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.113
for how the subject works.

00:26:28.317 --> 00:26:33.220
Out in the research field this
kind of pyramid makes sense

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.550
that the base of the
pyramid is mathematics

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.300
and if you like computer
science and it's the base

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.803
because mathematicians are
very happy to be mathematicians

00:26:43.803 --> 00:26:45.700
and not talk to anybody else.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.040
Although if somebody talked to them,

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.713
they're not unhappy about it.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:51.930
Physics and astronomy sit

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.980
on mathematics and computer science

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.310
because physics and astronomy
require mathematics.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.090
Chemistry, these are
the research fields now,

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.320
not education necessarily.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.830
That chemistry sits on
physics and astronomy

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.270
because physics provides the basis

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.040
for what goes on in chemistry.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.400
There isn't anything, any
chemical phenomenon that I know of

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.440
or any chemical process that if you say,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.930
why does that happen you're not forced

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.480
to go to physics for an explanation.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.350
And then sitting on chemistry
is modern molecular biology.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.140
And then that's simplification.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.940
There are a lot of hyphenated
subjects and so on.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.070
But this is the hierarchy
that exists in the sciences.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:43.240
That mathematics plays a
crucial role for physics

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.120
and mathematics and
physics support chemistry

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.620
and mathematics, physics and
chemistry support biology

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:56.360
and so you would argue that in education

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.353
there ought to be some parallel.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.900
The existence of a hierarchy

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.420
in the relationship of the sciences is,

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.280
I think a profound cognitive statement.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.673
Physics is a foundational science.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.690
It plays a unique role

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.720
and that therefore the
sequence clearly ought to be,

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.120
physics and then chemistry
and then biology,

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.580
rather than the current trend

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.880
in over 90% of high schools

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.890
still biology, chemistry, physics.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.990
When you reorder the course
you do a lot of other things.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.180
You change the way you teach the course

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.400
because when you're teaching
physics in ninth grade

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.763
these are ninth graders.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:48.410
You're lucky if they're taking
algebra one concurrently.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.270
Someday algebra one will
be a 7th grade course

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.820
but it isn't there yet

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.280
and so this physics has to be conceptual

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:03.290
without problem solving
or major problem solving

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:08.450
but it could be a very solid
important base for chemistry

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.520
and a base to explain what a science is

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.680
because very, very little in the way

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.920
of the process of science
goes on in the schools

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.650
and that's an important issue.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.530
Most of the children
that are learning science

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.320
in the high schools will not be scientists

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.680
but they will be voters
and they'll be citizens

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.220
and they'll be important
that they have a grasp

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.120
of how science works.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.130
A year of physics gives
students a good sense

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.430
of how science works especially
when we tell stories.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.090
Chemistry broadens the
study of matter and energy,

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.110
drawing explanations from physics

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:51.100
at the same time deepening
the students grasp

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.730
of concepts, more stories.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.300
Biology provides a more
cognitive challenge,

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.276
building on the chemistry and physics

00:29:58.276 --> 00:30:01.793
that undergirds biological order.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.440
Modern biology is DNA.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.273
What's DNA?

00:30:06.273 --> 00:30:08.340
DNA is a molecule.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.173
What's a molecule?

00:30:09.173 --> 00:30:10.840
That's made of atoms.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.210
So if you talk about DNA
in ninth grade you've got

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.630
to wait for physics to
find out what an atom is.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.470
That just doesn't make any sense.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:23.560
And teaching biology without
mentioning DNA is another thing

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.970
that seems too curious.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.970
So Physics First is what it's called.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.653
That was my biggest mistake
in launching this program,

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.081
was not calling it Biology on Top.

00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:40.350
(audience laughing)

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.290
It was dumb to call it Physics First

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.710
because people are very suspicious
especially of physicists.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.393
Probably justifiably so.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.500
so we propose that the disciplinary study

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.220
of science begins with physics.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.380
This is A , for 9th grade age 14 or 15

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.960
even though the students may
have only just begun the study

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.140
of algebra.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.110
Conceptual physics, this
was actually invented

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.480
by, I forgot his name,

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.460
but a long time ago

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.460
as a way of teaching physics to children

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.190
who just were impossible mathematically.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.660
But it's changed a lot now.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.600
It emphasizes a conceptual grasp,

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.770
does not emphasize much mathematics,

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:29.520
minimum of mathematics

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.170
but that doesn't mean you
can't teach a good course

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.400
in physics that way.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:37.700
The belief of some people
that you cannot teach physics

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.490
without calculus is just
absolutely incorrect.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.500
The intimate dance of physics
and mathematics can be learned

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.930
even with the simplest of equations.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:51.910
I mean after all, if you say a
car is going 50 miles an hour

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.760
where will it be in three hours

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.310
and you write down X equals VT,

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.960
you've done something fantastic.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.240
You've written down a prediction.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.790
Wouldn't Wall Street like
to have such an equation?

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.950
The first year of physics not
only introduces the concept

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:15.950
of the science with its broad
foundations and implications

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:21.020
but it also prepares students
for the study of chemistry

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.183
which follows physics.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.120
Let me just comment, if you can see this,

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.900
that Physics First is not a new idea.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.490
When we started looking into this,

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:37.266
we found probably 50 or so high schools

00:32:37.266 --> 00:32:41.970
that have been doing Physics
first for five, 10, 15 years

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:50.210
and so that it isn't a brand new idea

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:53.990
and most of the schools that
have adopted Physics First,

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.660
a long time ago are very happy with it.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.640
They find lots of advantages to it.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.450
The schools that have
been talked into changing

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.053
which I know more about,

00:33:06.992 --> 00:33:11.992
give us a very positive
reinforcement to the idea

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:18.030
because when it's done with
the enthusiasm of teachers

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.580
and the support of the
administration and so on,

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.070
you find that first of all students

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:34.090
who take conceptual physics
do better in chemistry.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.300
They do better in biology,

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.720
they begin to be interested
in elective courses.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.090
Many schools have
reported growth by factors

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:45.299
of three to five in the enrollment

00:33:45.299 --> 00:33:48.960
in elective science courses.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.340
They found women taking
advanced placement physics

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.660
which I always thought was
illegal but it's not illegal,

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.683
it's in fact a good thing that happens.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:05.347
So that there is a lot
of positive happenings

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.543
in in the subject.

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:18.990
I found my grandson's biology
book which had 9th grade,

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.120
9th grade biology and there was a sentence

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.220
and at the transmission

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.130
of sodium and potassium positive ions

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:29.990
through cell membranes is crucial

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:31.353
to the functioning of nerve impulses.

00:34:31.353 --> 00:34:35.640
This is a ninth grade biology book.

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.377
This one sentence as the essential physics

00:34:38.377 --> 00:34:42.720
and chemistry concepts apply
to a vital element of biology.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.150
In ninth grade biology,

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.080
students have to memorize
a meaningless description

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.750
of nerve impulses.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.210
That's the problem with
ninth grade biology.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.090
So much of it is memorization.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.980
So Physics First

00:34:59.019 --> 00:35:03.263
is the thing I'm trying to sell today.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:10.610
If you look at textbooks,
high school biology textbooks,

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.420
they actually review
physics and chemistry topics

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.420
in the first chapters or two
before looking at real biology.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.763
Chemistry textbooks review physics topics,

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.820
atomic structure, relevant
forces, definitions

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.140
before looking at chemical reactions.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.950
Physics seems to have no
other science prerequisites.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.050
The natural conclusion is to
begin a disciplinary study

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.245
of science with physics suitably modified

00:35:40.245 --> 00:35:44.550
to fit the development status
of ninth grade students.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:49.220
It's not simply a switch of
physics and biology courses.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.110
Ninth grade physics is
most commonly conceptual.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.250
It stresses a grasp of concepts

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.760
as opposed to problem solving.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.110
I know that many of my own
graduate students can solve

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.530
all the problems in the textbooks

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:07.530
but when it comes to conceptual
grasp they're a lot weaker.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.250
As more and more schools
advance algebra studies,

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.020
more and more math can be included

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.370
in the conceptual physics part.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:19.060
Biology for students with a year

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.710
of chemistry and physics
is a very different subject

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:27.710
and Roger Bighby who has run
an institute in Colorado,

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:33.650
largely for biology teachers
has given many workshops

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.590
in which the biology teachers were told,

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.967
okay now your students
have had a year of physics

00:36:38.967 --> 00:36:42.450
and a year of chemistry
what do you do in biology.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.730
And it's clearly a more richer

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:49.730
and more exciting way
of teaching the science.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.970
So we got a lot of news.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:03.380
New York Times featured
this several times.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.203
A push to reorder science
which the puts physics first.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.380
The various communities,
the school communities are

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.020
all discussing this.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.210
This is now well known.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.380
And little by little we're getting schools

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.533
to adopt physics in ninth grade.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.700
I think at last count
there were some 2,000,

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.210
a little over 2000 public high schools

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.700
that reordered the sequence

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.790
to physics, chemistry, biology.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.670
2000 sounds like a large number

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:43.220
but since there are 25,000 high schools,

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.460
we have a ways to go.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.023
It's a very slow process.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.650
One of the things you, one of
the implications of this is

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.720
not only do you make a
change in the sequence

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.380
but you physics, chemistry,
biology and math teachers ought

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.800
to give the given time.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.490
I think this is a crucial
issue in changing our schools.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:10.450
One of the major things teachers
complain about is a lack

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:11.450
of time.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.730
If you ask the math teacher,

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:14.730
how often do you talk
to the physics teacher?

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.625
They say well we pass
each other in the hall

00:38:16.625 --> 00:38:20.460
on our way to classes and
that's not the way to do it.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.010
So we're pushing very hard for

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:29.010
at least a four or five hours per week

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.240
epoch of collegial
professional development

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.273
where teachers talk to one another,

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.560
design a strategy

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.330
for how new subjects are
brought in and so on.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:47.730
And then why not bring in
occasionally the history teachers

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.140
and art teachers and literature teachers

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.220
and maybe this is a way to
close the two cultures gap.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.210
Here I recommend E.O.
Wilson's book, Consilience,

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:03.210
which is a very ambitious idea

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:06.420
of the unity of knowledge

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.410
which he espouses.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:12.900
The goal for all students is
science as a way of thinking

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.000
designed to generate comfort
with new ideas, behaviors,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.610
situations, characteristic of our times.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.210
You can have numerous
pedagogical excursions

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.540
to real-world problems that make inner

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.900
and transdisciplinary approaches,

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.470
new educational technology.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.010
Here Bob Tinker has been a partner of mine

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.400
in some of these developments.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.230
Make visualizations easy

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.920
and the approach to abstraction possible

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.583
in much earlier grades.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.260
Wide adaption of the inverse
order must have waves

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.650
that go way down to k eight
and up to higher grades too.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.090
So what we're really talking about

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.220
when we talk about Physics First is really

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.113
this revolution we need.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.760
And there's more.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.270
Even more important than that is

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.390
the thing I quickly alluded to

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.102
that when you design a 21st
century high school curriculum

00:40:08.102 --> 00:40:11.330
you have to ask what do we want them,

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.070
all of them to remember in 10 years.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.970
They will have forgotten
equations F equals MA

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:19.330
or E equals MC squared.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.540
In the high school
science for all students

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:26.540
each discipline must sacrifice
some time in the content

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.520
of the course to the process of science.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.000
How does science work?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.910
How messy is the process of discovery?

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.223
The need for open-mindedness, skepticism,

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:42.290
some sense of history, science
as a humanistic activity,

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:44.910
storytelling, what is a scientist?

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.270
What are they like?

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.550
Social and economic results.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.310
Science is the only universal culture,

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:52.460
it's the same anywhere.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.580
Science is a way of thinking and knowing.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.580
So these are the things one hopes

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.480
one can eventually

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:06.163
produce.

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:10.133
And let me try to get to
some quick conclusions here.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:14.940
A virtue of the P-C-B sequence
is that the physics learned

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.000
in year one is used in
chemistry in year two.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Whereas the biology in ninth
grade is ignored from then on,

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.640
unless there's a very,
very unusual situation.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.120
Both physics and chemistry
are used in biology,

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:34.040
thus deepening the conceptual
grasp of how science works.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.230
Teachers of each of these
core disciplines should have

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.150
some knowledge of the others.

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:42.060
So I think I'm making a case

00:41:43.797 --> 00:41:48.250
and there's a huge amount of data.

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.410
Unfortunately it's very
hard to get high schools

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:56.170
to track students when
they leave the high school.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:42:01.170
But we have huge amounts of anecdotal data

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.820
about the benefits of
changing to physics first

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.290
and I have some of these things here.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.230
I'm just gonna skip over them

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:12.413
and being delighted to review with you

00:42:13.256 --> 00:42:16.340
some of the facts that they work.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.540
As I pointed out,

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:22.630
the process of changing
is a very slow process

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:25.770
we've been working on
this for say 10 years.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.840
We've got 2,000 schools

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.550
but we have many, many school districts

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:35.340
and the number of times that
our group of people go out

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.340
and talk to teacher meetings
and so on is pretty impressive.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.963
So there is, this process is known.

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.470
It's working slowly.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:51.843
How we get to accelerate
it is a good, good problem.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:58.120
I do have finally just two slide

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.720
that may have some
interest to some of you.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.570
The problem of atoms.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:09.570
Atom is a very abstract concept
and many parents are worried

00:43:09.739 --> 00:43:12.910
that if you introduce
atoms in ninth grade,

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:17.640
the atom is a difficult concept.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.880
For example how many
atoms are there in the dot

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.220
at the end of the sentence.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.460
Well it's a million, trillion atoms.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.350
How do you grasp that?

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.870
So I tell a story about Aristotle.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.880
Aristotle had a common urge

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.123
and so he peed into the Aegean Sea

00:43:36.123 --> 00:43:39.310
and in 2,000 years the
water got all mixed up

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:44.890
and so the nice calculation is

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:48.700
how much of Aristotle is
in this glass of water?

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.480
And anybody who does the
calculation will find there are

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.240
about a thousand atoms.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.960
(audience laughing)

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.200
Actually we published this some years ago

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.804
and the President of
United States at that time,

00:44:03.804 --> 00:44:05.360
(audience laughing)

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.360
found an error and this
was in the newspapers.

00:44:11.024 --> 00:44:15.200
He pointed out that we made a mistake

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.610
of a zero or two.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.970
So anyway I think that's
a good place to stop.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:21.846
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:44:21.846 --> 00:44:25.096
(audience applauding)

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:33.610
- [William] All right questions

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.510
and comments please come forward.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:37.660
Dr. Lederman has agreed
to respond to them.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.440
- [Man] Well I'd like to point out

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.100
that there's the STEM technologies

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.180
which includes engineering

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.760
so if we're gonna make a
hierarchy above biology,

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:56.190
we really should have
something, oh, human ecology

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.587
which goes out into engineering

00:44:58.587 --> 00:45:03.587
and which has a lot of
sub work for technicians

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:06.460
'cause that's really the
only way that the US is going

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.780
to be competitive in the world

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.160
of several billion manual workers is

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.550
to have everything very highly automated

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:16.520
and so that most of the
jobs here have some aspect

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.960
of being a technician working

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.270
with a material production here.

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:25.890
So this would apply to me
a rather divert structure

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:29.100
where we don't have the
standard lecture format

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.100
and quite the same goals
but really goals of working

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.523
with teams to define how
to make useful things

00:45:36.523 --> 00:45:38.763
and get them to succeed in the real world.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.790
- No comment I think
that's a good statement.

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:47.860
I know that engineers
have been working hard,

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.143
especially I know about
the work done in Boston

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:57.050
where I think they're leading the pack

00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:00.260
and trying to introduce
the deuce engineering

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.020
at earlier grades.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.860
The only problem you always have is

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.411
what do you put in place,

00:46:07.411 --> 00:46:09.620
If you're gonna add something

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.400
we've got to subtract something.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.113
But I think that is a valid comment.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.350
- [Woman] Hi so you've convinced me

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:27.580
that we should have
physics first what advice

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.000
or suggestions or things would
you say that we should do

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
as future academics or present
academics faculty teachers?

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:37.450
What should we do?

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:41.740
- I didn't hear everything
but you're asking about advice

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.330
to others who would foolishly go off

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.196
and try to change the curriculum.

00:46:47.196 --> 00:46:50.160
- {Woman] I mean if we agree
with what you're saying,

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.170
what's the next step?

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:55.070
What would advice or suggestions
do you have for us to do

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:56.424
to help education.

00:46:56.424 --> 00:46:57.257
- Well you know--
- For high school,

00:46:57.257 --> 00:46:58.380
like you're describing?

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.910
- I think the the
problem always is getting

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.650
the public involved on your side.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:14.650
I mean in a way it's not so
hard to find the academics

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.130
and the thoughtful teachers to say,

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.750
yes this makes sense oh
and administrators too.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:27.290
But until I think we
can get the, you know,

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:31.950
my fantasy on this is very simply stated.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:34.340
If I can only get Oprah Winfrey to listen

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.780
so she hasn't answered my telephone calls

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:39.930
but someday she will

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:44.930
and what you need I think is
a popular force that says,

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.520
look we're not doing well in education.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.180
We've got to do better.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.660
And this is one way to do it.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:59.660
Now we have a very strong Washington group

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:04.790
that is poised I think
to make important changes

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:11.120
but so I'm speaking on
my pre-Obama momentum

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.690
but we're hopeful that maybe

00:48:17.947 --> 00:48:22.947
with more ability to spend
time on this particular issue,

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.353
we'll get a lot more help from Washington.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.750
- [Man] See along those
lines I was wondering

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:38.592
what you saw in terms of
Arne Duncan's leadership

00:48:38.592 --> 00:48:41.160
for the public schools
of the city of Chicago?

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.150
Do you see things emanating
from that leadership in terms

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.290
of our national directions?

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:49.123
- Yes there are some conversations.

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.410
This present Secretary of
Education is a good guy

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.820
and I think he's,

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.723
in principle we've had
conversations supportive.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.960
When President Obama was my senator

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.400
we had some fantastic conversations too

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.400
at least in which I was taught awed

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:23.750
by his belief

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:27.193
in the power of science and education.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.793
And he's written papers on the subject.

00:49:29.793 --> 00:49:32.800
It's not something you have
to tell him, he knows it.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.810
The big problem now we
have is is the complexities

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.400
of our present.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:43.400
That's why I started out with
the economy and environment.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.460
So many problems are
piling up in Washington

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.797
and yet every one of these
problems has a science

00:49:51.797 --> 00:49:53.780
and education aspect to it.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:58.780
So we shouldn't be too fearful

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:03.510
to push education and science

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:07.650
as hard as we can because
that's the right key

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:09.070
in all of these issues.

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:10.870
You know, how do we fix global warming?

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.420
Well you know that it's science

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.540
and all of these other things are science.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.070
So I think we have to be emboldened

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:21.250
to say this is the right venue

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:28.670
for helping in the present,
under present circumstances.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:31.943
Gotta work at it.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:38.440
- [Man] Hi so you mentioned
engineering in Boston

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.840
and I actually was working
at the Museum of Science

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.250
on the high school approach to engineering

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.083
for ninth graders.

00:50:44.083 --> 00:50:46.900
So we were sort of your
competitor in some ways

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:50.490
to Physics First trying to do
sort of an engineering first

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:53.430
and as we started down the
curriculum development road,

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:56.390
we were sort of trying to
mesh with you guys and say,

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:57.730
well let's try and get kids

00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:59.770
to understand atoms and molecules.

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:00.900
That's a good goal.

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.520
But as we got into it and we
started doing more research,

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.570
we sort of came to a more

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:10.210
of a macroscopic
thermodynamics approach right,

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:12.510
so flow models which are
bigger in engineering

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:15.550
than a traditional atomic
molecular interpretation,

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:17.340
the kinetic molecular theory.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.550
And one of the things that we found

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:22.960
that is not well addressed by physics

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.070
whether in ninth grade
or you know later is

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:28.140
and it sounds esoteric is entropy

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.150
or the general running down of things.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:33.650
And we talked about heat but
heat as a form of energy.

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:36.320
So I guess I have two questions.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.630
One as you move physics to be first

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.630
and have this idea of let's teach it

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:43.440
so that kids can take chemistry

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.728
and focus on the atom.

00:51:45.728 --> 00:51:50.110
Have you sort of not focused
on reformulating things enough

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:53.880
to have a better understanding
of thermodynamics

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.500
as a foundation for the other subjects

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.068
and I don't remember the second question.

00:51:59.068 --> 00:52:00.810
(audience laughing)

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:01.643
- I agree.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:03.850
I don't have any comment on that.

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:07.700
I think you have a, I'd have
to look in great detail,

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:11.010
you're making very positive suggestions

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:14.650
and I'm sure that somewhere in this,

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:19.650
I mean there's a email
clutch of 30 or 40 teachers

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:25.120
that communicate regularly with ideas

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.100
like how to fix it better and so on.

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:31.000
Your statement is a good one.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.760
If you write it up in a little
more detail I'll circulate it

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:37.990
among this crowd and maybe
something good will come out

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:40.150
of the, you know, and specifically out

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:43.773
of the re-formulation of curriculum.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.323
What you make it sounds plausible to me.

00:52:48.397 --> 00:52:49.850
- [Man] In this new
reformulations you talk a lot

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.270
about commissions and I hear now

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:52.633
that the Governors Association is planning

00:52:52.633 --> 00:52:57.633
to get together and rewrite
basically science standards

00:52:58.530 --> 00:52:59.760
and it's a question

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.830
as to how much they're gonna involve AAAS

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:03.860
and their benchmarks et cetera, et cetera.

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:08.330
But ideas change very
slowly and difficultly,

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:10.630
if that's a word, in this field

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:13.650
and so how do you see that happening?

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:14.720
How do you see new ideas

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.600
and really fundamental
reformulations happening

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.100
and are you optimistic about that?

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.070
- Yeah, well, of course
you're always optimistic

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:23.820
otherwise you don't do anything.

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:28.420
But what you're touching
on is in fact the proposal

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.400
that Shirley Malcolm and I tried to sell

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.030
in this National Commission idea

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:40.600
that we do need, you know,

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:45.600
during Sputnik we didn't
have the kinds of things

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:51.690
that were needed to combat
the menace of Soviet progress.

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:58.910
So Eisenhower created NASA and so on.

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:03.900
Right now we don't have a
mechanism for implementing

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.847
and for smoothing the fact

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:11.570
that we have 50 states

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:15.420
and each you know 50 governors
and the states are beginning

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.543
to do things in the way,
which is interesting,

00:54:19.667 --> 00:54:23.530
they're I think they're
called P-20 commissions

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:30.600
and they if in fact as the
examples I've seen are correct,

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.770
more and more businessmen
get involved in this.

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:37.700
Business men getting involved

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:42.550
in the state manipulations is positive

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:45.050
because they're around
longer than the governors

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:46.860
and we've got to get a mechanism

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.190
whereby states can talk to each other.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:54.190
So that a New Jersey teacher
moving to Missouri doesn't have

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:56.340
to learn a new language.

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.010
So that there's a lot we have

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:00.930
to do in the way of the whole system

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:04.670
that I'm you know I waved,
we've got to improve the system

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:05.890
and make it more coherent.

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:08.210
We can't give up local control,

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:11.000
that politically is out
of the question in my view

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.770
but we can have a strategy,

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:17.410
a national strategy for standards,

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:20.060
a national strategy for many things

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.100
that go into the whole educational mix.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.940
That's what we need to do

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:28.860
and that's part of the
kind of question you asked

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:30.010
that we need an order,

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:32.050
we need to reorganize

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:35.993
this chaotic incoherent system we have.

00:55:40.301 --> 00:55:42.280
- [Man] Many students in high school,

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.320
including those at Cal right now,

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.900
did not take physics last.

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.690
They didn't take it second
and they didn't take it first.

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:52.350
They just never took physics.

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:57.210
Is it your hope that if
physics is put first,

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:59.260
more students will take it?

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.470
Because that we have a big problem

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.210
that people just don't
take science period.

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:03.900
They're not required to take it.

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.160
They'll take some.

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.340
Maybe they were required
to take one science class

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:12.000
but for the most part in my class

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.970
which is the the physics for non-majors

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:17.420
about half the students
have never taken physics.

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:20.920
That's a separate problem from
what order we have them in.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.630
What are your comments on that?

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:25.873
- Well when the city of
San Diego, some time ago,

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.890
decided to adopt Physics First

00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:34.773
and 9,000 students registered
for physics in ninth grade,

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:37.580
this was five years ago or so,

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:40.290
they went through a huge effort to train,

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:41.650
a big problem is training,

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:43.390
they're not enough physics teachers.

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:47.210
They had to train
physical science teachers

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:51.400
and the biology teachers to pitch in.

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.200
But somehow they manage this

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:59.200
and it went on for three
or four years successfully.

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:00.880
They were really getting it now.

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.730
The teachers are getting
more enthusiastic about it.

00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:06.460
A lot of it has to do
with not forcing teachers

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:11.460
but having teachers being
part of this revolution

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:13.210
in a positive way.

00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:15.430
And then in came the parents.

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:16.903
And the parents said, what?

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:21.110
You're teaching physics
to my ninth grader.

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:23.850
It's gonna destroy his mind

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:26.650
or the hormone, you know,

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:29.660
and parents had two
opposite points of view.

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.700
One is you're watering down the physics

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:35.240
by giving it in ninth grade,

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.350
we should wait for the calculus.

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:39.940
And the other was it's
too much for my children.

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:44.140
Both sets of parents objected
for different reasons

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:49.140
and the the school board

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:51.140
that had been so progressive

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:55.410
in San Diego got fired

00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:57.140
and they had to give up the program

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.550
even though when you really looked at it,

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:02.150
they were really making
very, very good progress.

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:05.160
Kids were learning,
teachers were enthusiastic.

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.440
- [Man] You said 9,000 signed up

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.690
but I don't know whether that's
20% or 80% of the students?

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:12.640
- It was all, the whole school,

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:16.030
everybody registered
for ninth grade physics.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:18.150
- Please join me in
thanking for Dr. Lederman

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:19.764
for a wonderful presentation.

00:58:19.764 --> 00:58:21.990
(audience applauding)

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:24.657
(gentle music)
