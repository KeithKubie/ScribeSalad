Hi all, my name's Josh Livni,
and I work on the developer

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.950
relations team here at Google.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.110
Today I want to show you how to
add a new dimension to your

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.090
map by integrating Google
Earth in just

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.860
four lines of code.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.250
First, let's take a look at a
basic maps API example that

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.600
we'd like to add a 3D view to.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.280
Here I have a basic map that
I've taken from the maps V3

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.040
examples page which has
a simple KML layer.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.870
I replaced the KML overlay of
the Chicago transit with this

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.370
track of my snowboard route
from Squaw Valley last

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.160
weekend, which I recorded and
shared using the My Tracks

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.910
application on Android.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.610
It's been a bad year at the
CRS, not much fresh now.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.210
Can you tell if I stuck to the
groomers in these conditions?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.020
Not really, because even with
the satellite view enabled

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.590
it's hard to get a feel
for the mountain.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.360
So let's edit the code here to
first include the generic

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.700
Google API loader, which we'll
do in this script tag.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.970
For those of you familiar with
Earth API development, you'll

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.230
note that I have not specified
a domain-specific API key in

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.900
the loader.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.769
And this is because since the
launch last year of Google

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.560
Earth Version 6, the API key
has not been required.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.810
Next we'll load up the
third-party utility library

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.620
that takes care of the maps
and Earth integration.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.560
I'm loading a local copy, and
there's a link to the library

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.310
at the end of the
presentation.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.590
And now let's load up the Earth
API itself, which we do

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.930
by simply calling Google.load
Earth, and

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.990
then the version one.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.490
The Google loader, by the way,
can also load up a variety of

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.000
other APIs, as well as hosted
libraries like jQuery.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.230
Check it out at
developers.google.com/loader.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.460
OK, moving on now.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.130
With three of our four lines
already done, let's finally

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.640
add that Earth button
to our mashup.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.840
I'll do this down at the end
of our existing code by

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.260
instantiating a new Google Earth
object and pausing at

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.880
the map instance we want
to associate it with.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.830
So let's refresh our map.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.126
And look, we have an Earth
button at the top right in the

00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:03.060
controls, and clicking it will
load up the Earth API.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.370
Which, as you can see,
gives a much nicer

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.620
context to these tracks.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.580
Let's make these tracks seem
a bit more impressive.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.030
This bit takes advantage of the
fact that you can control

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.690
the full experience of the
Earth API using the hand

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.010
[? loader ?] at the Google
Earth library returns.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.180
Here, for example, I've
modified the terrain

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.200
exaggeration programmatically.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.430
But you could also turn on the
historical imagery, and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.640
generally take full advantage
of all the powerful features

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.570
of Google Earth to help ensure
your map tells the story the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.370
way you want.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.830
Currently, this maps Earth
integration library supports

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.350
all the basic overlays,
including markers, polylines,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.990
polygons, circles, rectangles,
and of course KML.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.550
So that's it for the intro to
quickly bringing Google Earth

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.650
to your Maps V3 application.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.140
If you have some data that could
use the rich context of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.000
a 3D view, this library is a
simple way to get started.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.250
Have fun.
