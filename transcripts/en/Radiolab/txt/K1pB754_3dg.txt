Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and today my name is Alisa Faith Pennington and I am a u s citizen by birth. We're going to start,

Speaker 2:          00:07          I was homeschooled my entire life with a cry for help. I have no 19 years old and I'm unable to get a driver's license, get a job, go to college, get on a plane, get a bank account for vote. This is the story of a woman who became sort of famous. I didn't pick the situation for myself and I don't know how to fix it. I don't know how to get this through being invisible.

Speaker 3:          00:33          So

Speaker 1:          00:34          for having no identity whatsoever, if you've been through a similar situation or know anyone who can help, please contact me. The story comes to us from our reporter, Alexandra young and the young woman at the center of this story. Um, I was born in Texas is Elisia faith. Pennington goes by faith in, born in Houston. And then we moved to Kerrville. Uh, when I was real little, like I don't even remember Houston at all. She grew up in a really small town. About 45 minutes outside of San Antonio and it's kind of country. We lived right outside of Kerrville actually. So it was even more in the country than Kerrville. His face. Parents were very conservative, very religious, and they had created a place for their family that was separate from the rest of the world.

Speaker 4:          01:19          Well, hi there. Welcome to the Pennington point. I'm Lisa and I just wanted to say a quick hello face mom. Lisa actually kept a video blog of life in the Pennington family. Right now the sun is shining, the birds are singing so peaceful out here in the country. So we had like maybe like five acres of land. This is our front porch. We bought this old farm house about 10 years ago and started

Speaker 2:          01:42          and we had a little home farm. We had goats, chickens. We had um, rabbits at one point, a cow that we would like raise, you know, we'd butcher it and then freeze like all the meat and then eat it over the year. So it was this sort of approaching self-sufficiency or was it, was it, I think what my parents wanted to do is kind of reach that self-sufficient point. Um, but they also really wanted to give their something, their kids to teach them

Speaker 1:          02:07          responsibility every day before he could go play. You had to do a chore. There was a chore. We had a chart and it would have the kids names down one. How many of those, how many of you were there? But nine children, grace, Jacob hope, faith patients don't. Adam a legend, Levi. Um, you've got that down pat picking loader forth right in the middle, Middle Child Syndrome. And her parents says faith. They were kind, but I'm very firm, very strict. A lot of rules for how you're supposed to dress and how you're supposed to look and how you supposed to carry yourself. What were some of those rules? Uh, for the girls? Um, you had to wear dresses and little super high callers and we always had to wear sleeves. No sleeveless, kinda Amish but not like that conservative. And uh, we all had really, really long hair.

Speaker 1:          02:59          We didn't cut our hair and we just didn't have a lot of access to things that they didn't want us to have access to. Like we didn't have internet until like, you were like 18 and could get on the allowed on the Internet for like limited sites and stuff. What about television? Did you guys have that? No. None of kids watch television today. Um, love electronics then they don't, they tend to not have as much of a passion for learning and working and um, their bottle reading and they didn't get to watch a lot of movies growing up. They only listen to Christian music. Were you homeschooled or were you, did you go to public school or what? How did that work? All homeschool DePaul school. Every single one. What does that mean? That you were like, I'm always on the, on the property or we need a go to church off and on various times.

Speaker 1:          03:45          So we'd go off for that because stuff but just sort of super rarely like we didn't most of the time Trisha, mostly you are with your family. Then I was just having a kind of a moral thing like like we are trying to keep you a wholly and I think they just wanted to keep like the things that they thought were like sinful in the world away from their kids and try to like keep them safe and everything. But they stopped that. So if you said I want yes, they would say no and they when they say nope. Yeah, arguing was not allowed. But faith actually she was always just kind of pushing that line just the little bit. I am definitely a lot more stubborn and a lot more free spirited and right around her 18th birthday I just, I don't know, I reached a point like a breaking point.

Speaker 5:          04:35          Mm.

Speaker 6:          04:35          Was, we were actually having like a little family meeting and I was with the four oldest siblings and my parents were kind of supposed to discuss things. And then my oldest sister asked was asking my mom, she was considering getting a job and kind of asking advice or permission if she could. And they're like, nope, that brings in too much outside influence. But she was 23 yeah. Hmm. And then my brother said he wanted more internet because he was doing work for our church and they're like, I'm sorry we can't do that. You know, you could be looking at things online, you know, we just have to shut it off then hope the one that's right next to me, she was 21 she was asking for a phone. My own parents were like, no, you don't have to have a phone. And so I was just like, wow. You know, I'm looking at my other siblings

Speaker 1:          05:14          and they have nothing ahead of them. We're not allowed to get jobs, not allowed to go to school. They have no life except living here on this little farm. They have no future. After that night, I decided I couldn't live like that. I couldn't, I was not going to turn out like that. So I had an iPod and I went down to my parent's room and I snuck, um, when my mom wasn't there and I snuck my grandpa's phone number and since he had an iPhone, I could text him over Wifi from my iPod. So I did. And I said, hey, when y'all come visit next weekend, I want to go back with you. I need help. Like I need to go away from here. Can you take me back home with you? And um, he said he would. So grandpa is not of the same mind as your folks? Oh, well

Speaker 2:          05:58          they weren't really on board with how my parents did things, but they always kept coming to see us and so I knew that they cared about me and so I felt safe to reach out to them.

Speaker 1:          06:09          So the next week her grandpa and her grandma show up at the farm and um, Yep.

Speaker 7:          06:14          Plan was to just, you know, just what were you going to bolt or how are you going to do this?

Speaker 1:          06:20          I went into bold. Yeah, no, but I just wanted to go, but my grandpa was like, you need to ask them first. You need to ask permission. So I did. And then they said, no, you can't go with them. And then so I was like, okay, cause I couldn't argue. And then I said, uh, or they approached my grandparents approached me back, so do you still want to go or, and I finally decided that I did.

Speaker 7:          06:45          As far as you know, you're the only one so far in the family history that might dare to act on this, these convictions.

Speaker 1:          06:53          Uh, no one had ever done anything like that in our family before. So

Speaker 2:          07:00          the next morning, September 24th, 2014 my mom was on her morning run and my dad was in his office. He said he was always there working in the morning, so none of them were in the house and my grandparents had goodbye to the rest of the kids. Then I just walked out the door with them. With luggage or just one suitcase? Yeah, my, my grandpa texted my mom and was like, we're taking faith with us. Just wanted you to know. And then my mom texted him and said, don't go anywhere yet. I'm coming back. She had texted my dad and then they, they both came and, uh, tried to get me to get out of the car. They were like, you have to get out of the car. I was like, I don't have to like, well, yeah, you have to because we're telling you to. I'm like, well, no.

Speaker 2:          07:43          So they got in and they actually asked my grandparents to get out. They were like, can you get out of the car and we'll get in so we can talk to her. So you were alone in the car with your parents then? That's when all the, all the safety goes away right here. That's the only thing I had on my side is that I was buckled in the car and refused to get out. I think they were just kind of shocked. I was so torn. I mean, they felt like I was just melting. And what was it that kept you in the seat? Um, I think it was just telling myself over and over that I knew it was the right thing to do, even though it doesn't feel like it. I had to take control of my life and after awhile they, my grandparents were like, we have to go, like we need to leave now. And so they left just drove away. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          08:35          so these were like, this is, this is what, eight people that you eight plus two, so this is 10 people that you are,

Speaker 1:          08:44          yeah, they're my entire world. Like yeah, I was astonished that she had the boldness to carry out that plan. This is Jenny Elena's face and her mother's, who like her grandparents didn't really subscribe to the Pennington Worldview, but she would visit them from time to time at the farm. You know, for faith, it's even more than just the boldness of leaving her family. She believed she was walking into this world that was bad, that was potentially going to harm her.

Speaker 3:          09:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          09:14          so that first night she gets to my parents' house, my grandparents said, hey, you can sleep in this room and there's a TV in the guest room. And they just toss a remote and leave her alone and said, we want whatever you want. Now faith, she had never been allowed to pick her own TV shows. No. And so she, she turns it on

Speaker 1:          09:33          for a place that gets full sun and she said it was like a eight to 10 hours of sunlight a day gardening show or a home improvement show or something. And she's sitting there thinking, I don't know if this is bad for me exactly. Just pour a little water on top and if it drains away,

Speaker 6:          09:49          should I be watching this? Cause that's kind of what my parents did there. They would kind of dictate what was right, was wrong. You know, when someone would do something, but okay, that's wrong. We're like, okay, that's right. And now that moral compass was gone,

Speaker 6:          10:01          she suddenly wasn't sure what was good and what was bad anymore. Yeah. I am so tired of the way we relate to one another. And 19 is a tough place to step into the world. Being that naive to have sex with his wife, I don't care. You know, she was asking me about sex, like how do you learn? What do you, I don't know anything. I thought I knew what kind of manual. I didn't know anything. Even the most basic social norms, like I don't know how I'm supposed to act when she'd hang out with her cousin or other people her own age. I don't know what I'm supposed to talk about. I didn't catch mostly like the references I'd make all these other teenagers would be talking about shows, boys music, movies, school in faith. I had no idea

Speaker 2:          10:42          she wanted to join this world. We all live in. I mean even in the most simple ways. She wanted to get a job and learn to drive, have an apartment, but she couldn't,

Speaker 1:          10:54          she didn't have course have a driver's license. Nope. Plus she didn't have a social security number. Didn't have the birth certificate? No. Where you were born. We did. When you were born, didn't they say, okay, this is the hospital will wasn't at a hospital. It was all home birth plus they specifically sought out midwives that would agree to file no records. Why would you want to do that? Um, there's this whole kind of way of thinking. It's called, what's it called, sovereignty to take some of these documents as they exist, they've got hooks in them. So as I dug into this story, I actually talked to a bunch of people who

Speaker 8:          11:28          the birth certificate seemed like a paper of ownership

Speaker 1:          11:31          for political or religious or just privacy reasons, don't want this kind of documentation from the government. Yeah,

Speaker 8:          11:38          definitely been used for a measure of control.

Speaker 1:          11:41          Now faced parents who actually wouldn't talk to me for this story, they're not specifically a part of that movement, but my dad kind of adopted some of those ideas that the government should not a number assigned to us.

Speaker 4:          11:54          They purposefully raised faith and her eight siblings to be outside of this system and that's probably something they thought of as a gift. I guess the thinking is that faith would be free from the rules of society. Clearly my parents

Speaker 1:          12:09          did what they did out of like the best that they thought they could do. So, I mean I'm not going to get mad at anybody for doing what they think they should do. But to faith it didn't feel like freedom. It actually felt like prison. And this is where faith journey really began. Faith and her aunt and her grandma, they went online, started poking around and they realize that the first thing you need is a birth certificate. Yes, you're starting at the beginning said, let's get you born. Right. So she applied to the bureau of vital statistics, government office where they keep track of like births, deaths, marriages, adoptions, and the bureau of vital statistics does a search, not only of that name, but of any like Jane Doe, babies born in that area. You know what to make sure that you weren't stolen at birth from some other parent or something like that.

Speaker 1:          12:56          But they couldn't find anything. So they said the next step is to go to court. So my mom contacts the court and they wanted three pieces of information proving her birth facts. Well, there was a sworn affidavit by my mother, a swearing that, you know, she was at her birth. So we got that one. So they needed two more documents. She could get a doctor's records, but she doesn't have any, I've never been at the hospital face says she's never been that sick. Never even had an accident and never been to the dentist. And you're flipping through the no school records? I had never even set foot inside of school. Oh Wow. Any savings account? No. You can't get a bank account without a social. What about immunizations? My Dad was super against all that. One of the court clerks asked if she had ever been baptized because the certificate that you get when you're baptized in a lot of churches can work as one of the three pieces of evidence.

Speaker 1:          13:52          But it turns out the baptismal record didn't have her birthday on it, so it didn't count. Did you ever go to the library and get a library card? Nope. You can't get a library card without an ID. Did you ever get any mail addressed to your name at your parents' house? Yes, but it was all, you know, handwritten stuff, which doesn't count. So you have to go to the judge and say, what? What do you say to the judge? Well, the judge won't listen. He just said, we're not going to hear the case because you don't have enough to even for me to even consider because you have to have some kind of records. You don't have enough proof. So you're sitting there at a table and there's a lawyer sitting there opposite and you, and you think so. So I know I was born. Uh, I believe that I am this age. I was born in my house at such and such an address. Now what do we do? He looks at you and says, or she looks at you and says, I've never seen this before. She seen people,

Speaker 4:          14:44          well, undocumented, but not someone born in this country invisible to the state and the federal government we put up, if you're born in America, you're not automatically a citizen. So shouldn't that, I mean that. It's not like when you're born there's like this halo floating over your house. Just letting everyone know you have to prove it. Yeah. Were they, couldn't she get a, an immigration attorney to help? Won't, no, not really. Because when an immigrant comes here from another country, they have this country of origin and for faith in the eyes of the government, she has no country of origin. They just think of her as being from nowhere.

Speaker 1:          15:23          Wow. So I was just like, I was stuck. That's weird. We called everyone and we could not get help and we'd get like a little bit of a lead. Like maybe this will work. And we'd go and we talked to somebody or we fill out a paper, we mail something yet or we call somebody or something. And just like you're rejected every time, you know, it just looked hopeless. It just made me feel like this is never going to happen. You know,

Speaker 4:          15:44          it got to the point where when she was at parties or just talking to people about her situation,

Speaker 1:          15:50          there was like, oh, what are you doing? I say, oh, I don't exist. And it would kind of start this like weird conversation and it would actually start a lot of conversations for other people. And it would kind of help me to like navigate stuff. And so I actually kind of helped me figure out how to socialize. It's just this funny little thing she could say, but when she was alone it wasn't funny at all. I went through a really dark time during that. I went through a lot of depression. And did your depression manifest in you? What, what happened to you? Um, I was not self harmful, but I was having a lot of suicidal thoughts. I feel me. Doesn't know. Most of my friends don't even know. It's just felt like I was just floating in like in the middle of just see, have just so much stuff, you know, I didn't know who I was. I kind of feel like I didn't really exist at all.

Speaker 3:          16:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          16:48          we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back.

Speaker 1:          17:43          Hey, I'm Jen. I boom, rod. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and today

Speaker 4:          17:47          the story of a woman who famous for being

Speaker 1:          17:50          infamously invisible,

Speaker 4:          17:52          so she decided that the only solution was, my name is Alicia Face Pennington and I'm a u s citizen by birth. To make this video, I was born at home and my parents neglected to file birth certificate or birth record of any kind. She just figured I was homeschooled my entire life, so I have no school records. Maybe there's somebody out there that has, you know, done this before, so I was like, well, let's give it a shot. I want to travel, I want to get an education. I wanted to just be a functioning American, but I can't until I can prove citizenship. If you've been through a similar situation or know anyone who can help, please contact me. She put it up on Youtube and then that was it.

Speaker 3:          18:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          18:34          I didn't expect anyone to watch it

Speaker 3:          18:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         18:38          but

Speaker 12:         18:40          my phone was just like notification after notification. It was like dinging and dean and dean. In the first week I had over 1.3 million views.

Speaker 1:          18:50          I hadn't even like been on youtube before that let alone like posted a video, so it was crazy. It went up on Reddit, Twitter and never seeing it on Yahoo in the front of snapchat daily. Oh my gosh. People just couldn't believe it. They were like, can this seriously happen? Gay just took off and then she just starts getting all these emails. It was insane. I was getting literally two emails every single second. That's not an exaggeration and I couldn't keep up with it. Like I could not read all of them coming from like Germany and Israel, Africa, Australia, India, like it went worldwide. And what were people saying? What did they email you about? Oh, all kinds. Like I was not only touched by your screen presence, but I'm also very infuriated and frustrated by the circumstances of your dilemma. I actually sat down with faith while she read through a bunch of these emails.

Speaker 1:          19:33          Hello. I'm very intrigued by your story, but I'm currently 23 years, some of them from homeschoolers. Hello. Elisia my name is Jose. I'm from the children of immigrants who felt like a sense of solidarity. I commend you for reaching out to the Internet, but a lot of it was, and I pray that you were able to get the documents you need. Just a lot, a ton of encouragement saying, I don't know how to help you, but I just want you to know I'm rooting for you. Like don't give up. What did it feel like to have eyes on you in that way? It was really empowering. Um, like I didn't, I didn't, it wasn't very confident in who I was. Um, so just to have so many people be like, we're behind you. Yeah. I know. It felt really good to be recognized a little bit, but at the same time it kind of made her more famously that woman who doesn't exist, the girl with no identity and it didn't even solve her problem because when people did offer advice didn't really help start working on not paying tax.

Speaker 1:          20:28          They'll come to you. I got people who just had, you know, dumb ideas of what to do. [inaudible] if I knew you enough to marry you so you can gain citizenship. Many of them were marriage proposals. I got a lot of proposals. Uh, actually I'll get you pregnant if that will help. Oh my God, that is some of them not so subtle. Doesn't want to just like delete. I'm like, nope. Nope. And also inside of those emails and comments, there was a conversation about whether what her parents did was right. This one is from like the opposite perspective. It says her parents didn't quote neglect anything. They stood on an exercise, their rights, and wisely. So what they did was in her best interest, she just doesn't understand it because she is young and she's led a protective life. A lot of these folks felt like faith was blowing this gift that her parents had given her.

Speaker 7:          21:14          From my perspective, if you take some of these documents as they exist, they've got hooks in them. This is Alfred addict who blogs about sovereignty and sovereign citizens. First off, just to give you a little bit of, uh, evidence that maybe I'm not crazy. There's a case called Chisholm versus Georgia from 1793, and they're talking about European jurisprudence. The distinction between the prince and the subject. And the distinction is that the prince gets his rights from God. That's when they say the king is anointed. The Nice, exactly right in a coronation ceremony. But they go on and they say, no. Such ideas obtained here, meaning within the United States of America, after the revolution, the sovereignty devolved on the people, and they are the true sovereigns. And the word sovereigns is plural. Yeah. I think we all know that you're a sovereign. I'm a sour and Alexandra's a sovereign.

Speaker 7:          22:12          How do you deal with the opening phrase then in the constitution, which is we the girl, we and people, not I the person one by one, but we the people want it says we the people. It means we, the sovereigns. Sovereigns are not a collective. Think many people would argue. I understand that. But if you are, we ended up getting into this, a little tussle over the rules of government, not in visibility, the idea that the constitution, but eventually we got back to faith. Once you have been recognized as a sovereign, how do you avoid, it's like getting rid, I'm doing well. I'm just gonna. I want to judge. I don't want blue eyes anymore. But part of you must, part of you must go out and feel a little sorry for her. Right? Like she, she's got, she has a, she has a will to become something other than he has a will to become a subject.

Speaker 7:          23:03          A subject. Yes. Yes. So, but I don't think that you condemning want to be free. Oh, you are condemning her then? A little bit. No, I'm saying she's making a choice. There's proviso in the Bible where people in the Old Testament, if you wanted to remain, you could, you could volunteer to be a slave for some guy. Some people don't want to be sovereigns. It's not an email. I just want a job and they want to travel and they want to work for a little bit. That's exactly right, but there's, there are consequences for her abandoning her status as a free woman. Well, here's the weird irony because she has no birth certificate because she has no passport. The state of Texas in the government or the United States say, well, we can't figure out how to make you visible like we, yeah, it's probably, they may

Speaker 4:          23:46          not be able to, but then face grandmother lives in my district in Sun City and she, the government stepped in. My grandma was able to get in touch with Marsha Farney, Marsha Farney state representative I of House district one. She's a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives. We would get together. I do with my staff and say, what are the calls we've had come in this week? And this one really caught our attention. So usually heard about it. She said, we need to do something about this. And she did

Speaker 10:         24:13          this bill isn't as chimp to get a birth certificate for those.

Speaker 4:          24:18          Around a month after her face video went viral, Marsha Ferny put together a bill and brought it before the House of Representatives in Austin.

Speaker 10:         24:25          The committee already read about this bill and they are keenly aware.

Speaker 4:          24:30          So the bill does a couple of things. It makes the process logistically easier expanded where someone could apply for a delayed birth certificate. It was, but also outlines punishments for the parents. So in the case of faith, right, if she asked her parents for documentation and they refused, then that's punishable by up to a year in jail and up to $4,000 of a fine or a combination of both. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         24:56          Mr Chairman, I know they are full of witnesses here who want to testify on this bill

Speaker 4:          24:59          and they held this hearing to kind of weigh the various sides. Hi, I'm Alicia Southworth live in Georgetown, Texas, and I'm and so faith and her aunt and her grandma all went to testify.

Speaker 10:         25:12          Faith is my granddaughter and my namesake. I was in the room the day she was born. Unfortunately that is not okay.

Speaker 4:          25:19          Her grandma fills in the state wraps on what they'd been doing the last six months.

Speaker 10:         25:22          We went to the DPS to get her a driver's license and they said no. They said, go to the social security people. Security people said no. Go to the voter registration people

Speaker 4:          25:32          meetings and dead ends and rejections.

Speaker 10:         25:34          No, go to the DPS. We were stuck in a do loop. Well, I wasn't gonna quit there for goodness sake. She's a Texan. So Marsha Farney has offered us our only hope we have had since this started. I just, I urge you to pass this bill, take faith out of limbo and give her the life she desires might be. It was just like we would not allow my parent to physically handicap a child. We should not allow a parent to handicap a child where they can't operate and function in society. She is truly, although you've seen her standing here a nonperson, she could walk off the face of the earth and legally nobody would know she was gone.

Speaker 4:          26:19          I think the bill is a little misguided. That's James Pennington face dad. He came out to the hearing and ended up on the Fox seven newscast and unfortunately this is the only bit of tape we have of him. He provides some pretty draconian penalties for a process. It's already there. There are six other children, I think. I don't disagree with that. I mean just the state of Texas want to put start putting parents jail. Well, the bill gives the judge some leeway based on what the circumstances are for the parents, but we, we felt there was a need for some teeth to this bill to Ganda. It turns out that the Texas State House and State Senate agreed, so we were able to get it through the house and the Senate. The bill ended up passing, Republicans voted for it. Democrats voted for it. There was actually only one, no vote, but the next time Marsha for any was up for reelection. She actually lost in the primaries. And according to the Texas observer who actually did a really nice podcast of face story, there's this lobbying group called the Texas homeschool coalition who donated a bunch of money to Farnese primary

Speaker 1:          27:22          opponent who's parental revenge I guess. Okay. But then what, so where does your, does that leave faith though?

Speaker 4:          27:29          Well, um, because of the bill faith was able to take her case to a different court, a higher court, and it seems like the bill allowed the judge to consider different kinds of evidence. So in the end faith was able to use an old orthodontist record and a piece of paper from her uncle, a doctor who had treated her toe back when she was a kid. And in just a couple of weeks,

Speaker 1:          27:52          success is the by certificate. Sometimes I just take it out and look at it sometimes randomly. I know it's like, it's so dumb. It's like it's your birth certificate. Every person has one. But I'm like, I have one too. Can you read it to me a little bit? Like what's, what information is on here? Um, it has my name at the top and it has like my description, my sex, where I was born,

Speaker 2:          28:15          the county, just what county does it say you're born in? Harris County was born in Houston.

Speaker 13:         28:20          Ah.

Speaker 2:          28:26          I'm hoping that the physical papers can like mirror the emotional thing that she's going through because I feel like it's like as she's getting the papers she's appearing so that by the time she gets that last one, she will know who she is and then she will be that person, whoever that is. She's working so hard for it. I'm hoping that that just that will have developed in her something that she feels like it's more than a piece of paper, you know? Yeah. I'm hoping so. Now faith, she was actually able to get a driver's license, but she still doesn't have her social security number a which means she can't get a real job. She can't open up a bank account. She's still really, she can vote, but she can't get health insurance. She might not be able to go to college, so I don't know what's going to happen to her.

Speaker 1:          29:19          We were asking her this question like, when this is all over, do you know who you're going to be? You know, because now this is who you are. You're the girl with no identity. And uh, she was a little concerned that she wouldn't know who she was going to be if your, if your aunt asked you that same question again, like who do, who do you think you are now? Who Do you think you are? No, I'm [inaudible] what, how would you answer that now?

Speaker 14:         29:45          Um, I don't know. Like I just feel like me, like I'm just faith.

Speaker 3:          29:54          Cool.

Speaker 2:          30:07          Cute. Thanks to recording producer Alexandra young. This piece is also produced by Brenna feral and Andy Mills and we had a lot of help from a lot of Texans, I should say. Uh, I think they're mostly Texans. Savannah Escobar, Rachel Komen, David Glenn, Chris van Dusen, Zen Alegbra, Russell Waylon, liberty consultant, Nick Reed, the group, homeschool alumni reaching out and the Lake Travis Zip line adventure company.

Speaker 1:          30:31          Speaking of that last one, as you say, when I went to go visit faith in Austin, uh, she's got green hair now. She's got a nose ring and a tattoo. She goes home from time to time. And she actually visited with her mom on mother's Day. Um, but when I was there, she wanted to do something with me that she'd never done before. I'm so excited you guys. So we decided to go zip lining. He said Zyban six, and this one just happened to be called the leap of faith.

Speaker 15:         31:04          Okay.

Speaker 3:          31:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         31:13          yeah.

Speaker 14:         31:36          Hey, this is Jack. One last thing before we close. Um, I wanted to let you know that this fall I'm actually going to be, uh, doing something that I haven't done in the 14 years that I have been working on radio lab. I'm gonna take a little time off. So, uh, you will not hear me, uh, producing or hosting this podcast through the fall. I will be back early January. Uh, and you know, the reason is very simply that, you know, in creating this show and then building it up and then going on for live tours and then most recently creating the spinoff, our first spinoff more perfect. Uh, just need, I mean, it's all been incredible, but I just need a moment to catch my breath and to reacquaint myself with my children. So I'm going to be doing that. But the great thing is that, um, you know, as much as Radiolab is this thing that I started with Robert and with Ellen, um, it's now as you know, home to a hugely talented, amazing group of people.

Speaker 14:         32:32          Uh, so you'll be hearing more of them. I mean, Robert, my partner in crime, we'll be holding it down, but you'll be hearing a lot more of Molly Webster, a Soren, and a lot different. Simon and the whole crew will be doing stories. And I happen to know there's some pretty amazing stuff coming down the pike and I, for one, am really excited to be able to listen to it from the outside for the first time. So yeah, now we're making a few appearances here and there. So if you find yourself in like Missoula, Montana or Sydney or Melbourne, Australia, uh, come say, hey, otherwise I will see you in the new year.
