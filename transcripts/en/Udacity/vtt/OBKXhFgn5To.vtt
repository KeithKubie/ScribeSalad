00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.596
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I solve my inequality, just like from before, I get x is greater than or

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:09.142
equal to 2. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Notice x can now equal 2. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I plug in 2 into my original

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:14.444
inequality, I'll get 8 greater than or equal to 8, &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which is a true statement.

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:16.109
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you said 2, nice work.
