00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.850
The Starship Enterprise's mission is to explore
strange new worlds, but some of the “strange

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.700
new worlds” are exoplanetary horrors, likely
to frighten even Captain Jean-Luc Picard back

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.100
into his shuttlecraft.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.609
Howdy planetary bodies, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.039
Out there, in the deepest corners of our galaxy,
are some of the most amazing exoplanetary

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.039
discoveries.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.950
We’re finding alien worlds orbiting two
stars; possibly Earth-like planets that may

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.850
host life; we’re even detecting clouds condensing
in the atmospheres of exotic hot Jupiters!

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.670
It’s an amazing and PROFOUND voyage of discovery.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.490
But often, as we get familiar with some of
these exoplanets, they sound downright HORRIFIC.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.870
For example, 55 Cancri e might be oozing and
poisonous!

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.530
Located about 40 light-years away, this exoplanetary
scare fest is known as a super-Earth, 8-times

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.530
the mass of Earth.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.420
It's really hot because it's so close to it's
star; so hot, in fact, that water and other

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.100
fluids can’t exist in a liquid state.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.720
After taking density measurements of this
hot world, astronomers realized that these

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.790
fluids could be in what is known as a “supercritical
state” -- meaning the fluid is so hot and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.470
under so much pressure that it's acting crazy.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.950
And this exotic fluid might be oozing from
below the surface of 55 Cancri e!

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.950
And it that weren't scary enough, the Hubble
detected possible hints of hydrogen cyanide.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.790
So yeah, this thing might ooze superheated
fluid that is POISONOUS!

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.090
But it's not alone in it's freakiness.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.130
Do you remember that scene from “Indiana
Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark” -- when

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.890
they open the Ark of the Covenant and everyone’s
faces melt off.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.750
Well, that's the life of CoRoT-2a.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.930
This poor exoplanet suffers a similar fate
every.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.930
single.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.930
day.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.720
This “hot-jupiter” exoplanet orbits really
close to its star and has become bloated due

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.280
to extreme heating, but the powerful X-rays
blasting from its star cause an estimated

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.320
5 million tons of material to be shed into
space off the planet EVERY SECOND.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.970
That’s pretty nasty.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.430
You might be thinking, when is CoRoT-2a going
to just disappear then!?

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.310
We're not sure... but the Kepler-19 star system
might have a ghost planet!

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.030
Around 650 light-years from Earth, an exoplanet
called Kepler-19b has been spotted.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.170
It has a strange orbit where it occasionally
speeds up and then slows down!

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.750
Like people before they call the Ghostbusters,
orbital dynamicists would think "this is impossible."

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.000
Planets don’t just slow down and speed up
all by themselves!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.640
In reality, though, they can, but it means
there’s a ghostly alien world that has gone

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.420
unseen, and its using its gravity to tug at
Kepler-19b from afar.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.230
Tracking the orbital oddities in exoplanets
have actually helped us find MORE exoplanets

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.070
through a method called “transit timing
variations.”

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.870
So really, exo-ghosts might be creepy, but
they're actually kind of cool.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.600
But a guy who was NOT cool is Sauron, the
famous baddie from “Lord of the Rings.”

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.910
Remember the giant Tower of Barad Dur?

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.260
Okay, now look at this.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.380
Is this the The Eye Of Sauron?!

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.290
Nope, it's the star system of Fomalhaut.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.210
This star system has been the focus of lots
of attention in recent years for its massive

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.200
planet Fomalhaut b.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.740
It appears to have taken up residence in the
debris surrounding a young star 25 light-years

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.740
from Earth.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.760
The debris makes images of the star system
look like the eye of Sauron.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.470
So, even though Fomalhaut b is just a bit
of dust in Sauron's eye, it’s a rare example

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.180
of a directly-imaged exoplanet!

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.110
We've literally taken pictures of this.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.650
Look we know this is kind of a funny way to
look at astronomy, but c'mon.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.520
It's incredible to think that only about 20
years ago, we didn't know there were any planets

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.880
outside of our solar system, and now we've
got potentially thousands!

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.830
With such a variety, some would have to be
a hell on Earth.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.100
Or… on whatever planet they'll be called.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.870
If you like scary things, you might like scary
video games.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.760
But are those video games good for your brain?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.020
Well, Science Channel answers just that with
the show Your Brain On Video Games.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.140
Check it out November 1st 9/8c on Science.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.610
OK, so a planet you've heard a lot about lately is Proxima b. It's really close, it might be earth-like, maybe not.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:11.570
Find out all the exoplanetary facts about
this historic find in this video here.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:21.410
What do you find most scary about space?

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.290
Is it aliens, supernovas, spooky exoplanets
or just a deep, dark and vast unknown?
