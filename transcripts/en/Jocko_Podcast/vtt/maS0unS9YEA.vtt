00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.270
When you realize that nothing will change in the leadership,

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.160
do you tap out and move on or continue trying to be a good leader to your crew

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.730
who deserves it?
That's definitely a a question that

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.420
requires a little bit more information to give a good answer too.
You know,

5
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.890
because what's the situation?
Can you be,

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.340
is there an opportunity that you could become the leader longterm because that

7
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:25.320
totally changes the outlook,
right?
If you could,

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.280
if you could do a good job and step up and move them to a more senior leadership

9
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:33.900
position where you could take even more turret turns or take even more care of

10
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:34.500
the crew,

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.970
well then that's a positive thing and it might be worth hanging out for also,

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.400
is it a complete dead end?

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.170
Like is there no possibility it's a family owned business and all the senior

14
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.750
leadership is related to the family and you're not part of the family and you're

15
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.870
never have a chance that that changed the prospect.

16
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.920
I mean obviously then it's like,
okay,

17
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:56.040
well maybe it's not worth sticking around there.
If you leave,

18
00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:00.030
can you leave where you can give open the opportunity for other people to go

19
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:04.860
where you're going,
right?
Which is not a good thing in terms of,
you know,

20
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.760
you're not being very loyal,
you're being anti loyal,

21
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.970
you're being unloyal disloyal if you do that.

22
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.220
But if the leadership that you're working for isn't taken care of the people,

23
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.790
then you have to have some loyalty to the people that you work with.

24
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.060
So there's that.
Um,
I think that you,
you,

25
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.830
you have to assess everything that's going on in this situation,
which,

26
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.140
which is not evident in this one quick question.
I would say this too,

27
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.480
like don't blind side your boss,
right?

28
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.780
That's something that if you're going to leave,
leave on good terms,

29
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.370
explain to him what's going on.
Also,

30
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:44.100
that can be an opportunity to start a conversation about how the leadership

31
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.060
could include proof.

32
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.030
A lot of times people don't want to change anything until it really smacks him

33
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:50.250
in the face.
And one of the thing that smacks him in the face is,

34
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.460
is when one of their good people comes in and says,
hey look,

35
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:56.940
I am going to leave because of these reasons.
And again,

36
00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:00.900
you don't on the exit interview or on those conversations,

37
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:04.320
you don't just drop dime and make everyone make out to be this horrible

38
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:06.270
situation and say,
here's some things that I've noticed.

39
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:08.040
Here's some things that I would want to change.

40
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.980
Here's the direction that I see the company going and this is the direction I

41
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:14.310
think it should be going.
And for these reasons I've decided I'm going to go try,

42
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.850
you know,
try my hand somewhere else.
I think if you'd be open like that,

43
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:21.570
it can start some good conversations and possibly you could make some progress

44
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.730
or possibly you could confirm your suspicions,

45
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:29.370
which are no one wants to change.
No one wants to do anything different.

46
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.880
And if that's the case and you realize it's a dead end for you,
yeah,

47
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.990
you got to take that option.

48
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.670
You can't beat your head against the wall on the 40,
you know,

49
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:41.550
you can beat your head against the wall 47 times on the 48th time.
It's like,

50
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:45.480
okay,
I need to do something different.
So pay attention to that

51
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.840
next push.

52
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.240
What can we all learn from tenacious d that most people overlook?

53
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.700
You know,
critical question.
It is a critical question,

54
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.220
but there's actually a real,
a real legitimate answer to that.

55
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.800
And that is that tenacious d who's uh,
a very,
uh,

56
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.490
funny group of individuals.

57
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.690
Jack Black is one of them who's a musician in a comedian and an actor and Kyle

58
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.570
gas is the other member.
What,
what's,

59
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.580
what's great about them is they don't take themselves too seriously.

60
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:24.880
And I think that's the lesson to learn is don't take yourself too seriously.

61
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.160
Have some fun and

62
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.350
don't take yourself too seriously.
There it is.
Yeah.

63
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.800
And I would say there's a difference between taking yourself seriously and being

64
00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:40.010
serious.
So you know how like

65
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.720
being serious is like,
okay,
you're not necessarily joking all the time,

66
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.200
but taking yourself too seriously is like,
you know,

67
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:52.740
if like a joke is made about you or you can't laugh at yourself,

68
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.520
that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's different.
So you can be serious all the time.

69
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.910
You can be a serious person and not take yourself to see that as true.

70
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.770
And that's a good that,
that's fine.
That's right.

71
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.460
The person you don't want to be as the person that takes themselves too

72
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:09.530
seriously all the time.
That's a problem.
So inversely,

73
00:04:09.531 --> 00:04:14.480
I guess could you be to like,
could you be a very,
not serious person,

74
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.090
but take yourself too seriously?

75
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.830
Could you be a very serious,
no.
So could you be a very like,
jokey,

76
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:26.940
not serious person?
Yeah,
for sure.
The person that you can dish it out,

77
00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:30.310
but you can't take thin skin type guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.

78
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.130
Kind of like you write a little bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I see.

79
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.950
I see what you did there.
I got
a next question.

80
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.560
Unless there's anything more from tenacious D no.
You know,
maybe some good songs.

81
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.440
We can
inspirado right.
That's from Tennessee.

82
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.890
That's where you got their phone.
I got to give him a warning.

83
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.140
Have language is not appropriate for kids who are tenacious.

84
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:57.430
D ignore some of the subject matter.
So be careful with that.
Yeah.
The warranty.

85
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.300
Next question.
You mentioned you rarely pay,
play closed hard.

86
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.980
Rarely is this just a personal preference?

87
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.930
I would say that it is somewhat a personal preference,
right?

88
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.040
Because there's definitely some people that intentionally played closed guard.

89
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.810
That's their game.
Um,
but at the same time,

90
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.360
in order to attack even from the closed guard,

91
00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:26.480
most of the time you have to open your guard.
So therefore your guard is open.

92
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.720
So open guard.
Yeah.
That's kind of what I do.

93
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.330
Skip the step of opening my guard.
But you've been in people's guard.

94
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:37.190
They have really good closed guards.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's not fun.
No.

95
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.130
And that's why I try not to let people close their guard.
Yeah.

96
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.600
Cause you got from that from happening.
Yeah.
There's people that have really,

97
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:47.390
really solid psycho closed guard.

98
00:05:47.391 --> 00:05:51.340
So I'm not anti closed guard and some people are great at it.
Uh,

99
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.160
my personal preferences to play more open guard.
Yeah.

100
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.970
Yeah.
It's one of those things were closed guard.

101
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:02.360
If you're not a person who always plays closed guard or whatever,

102
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.800
it can be just something that you kind of use for specific situations.
You know,

103
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.810
like if you're trying to um,
maybe breed

104
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.160
regained some energy or something like that,
you arrest a little bit,

105
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.240
or even in like a s self defense,
like a striking scenario,

106
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.280
like a closed garden.
Mike,
Mike,
kind of a closed guard is,

107
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.590
there's no doubt that closed guard has viable purpose.
Yeah.
And is good.

108
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.370
And I do use it.
I just don't use it a lot.
Yeah.
Yeah.

109
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.440
And if you're a taller,
lanky guy,
closed guard might be a little bit short,

110
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.070
fat legs that,
you know,
call up.

111
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:41.570
My closed guard is like my toes are touching depending on the size of the
person.

112
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.880
And actually where it stems from,

113
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.060
if you went to the root of it is it stems from foot locks.

114
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.900
So if you close your guard,
when your guard opens,
you're vulnerable,

115
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.790
and that there's a moment where you're both vulnerable.

116
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:55.130
And if you're training with guys that have really good full locks,

117
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.720
that's not a good situation.

118
00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:00.050
So that's where I started not closing my guard because there was always that

119
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:03.200
transition period where my feet were vulnerable,

120
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.540
so I just stopped closing my garden,
kept it open,

121
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:09.590
and move my fit feet towards me to keep it a little bit safer.
Yeah.
