00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.880
Before we commence the program,
I ask you to take a moment

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.540
and silence your mobile
phones and electronic devices

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.110

interfere with our speakers.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.580
I'll also make you aware that
this event is being recorded

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.570

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.650 position:56%
I'll take a few minutes to introduce
the program and the speakers,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.160
and then we'll turn it over
to the substantive discussion.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.960
Daniel K. Inouye was a
lionesque figure in Washington

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.750
and in his home state of Hawaii.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.050

Honolulu, Inouye graduated

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.070

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.800
after the United States
entered into war against Japan.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.470
Coming out of the University
of Hawaii as a premed student,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.400
Inouye volunteered and
was the youngest member

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.500

regiment of the US Army --

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.980
a unit of Japanese-American
soldiers who fought gallantly

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.630
in the European theatre
of operations.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.890
On April 21st, 1945
Inouye was wounded

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.780

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.230
and entered into public service.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.380
Elected into the territorial

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.840
followed by his election

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.360

Our first lecture last year featured
Madeleine Albright and Colin Powell

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.960
and addressed bipartisanship and
the US engagement with the world

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.510
around us, exploring how
leaders have cast aside political

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.650
differences at home in order
to act in the best interests

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.290
of the nation abroad and how
they might do so in the future.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.470
This evening our speakers will
consider the delicate balance

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.640
between protecting civil liberties
and safeguarding national security.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.560
They will consider historical
precedence from World War II

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.920
and explore some of the issues
created in the wake of the events

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.700

of the Patriot Act.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.570

It was there that Mineta, a
Boy Scout, met Al Simpson,

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.280

his local Boy Scout troop.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.090

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.350
I have covered both men.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.190
I know that they are not only
some of the best known names

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:44.140 position:56%
in Washington and the most respected
voices, but I know they are also two

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.300
of the best liked people
in this town.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.110
And that's no small achievement.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.510
I want to start --

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.490
[ Applause ]

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.540
&gt;&gt; Can you believe that?

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.840
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: I want
to start with --

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.210
I've known Alan Simpson since
1978 when he was elected.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:07.650
And I never knew the story
about how the two of you met.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.220
And Secretary Mineta,
let's start with you.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.000
Tell us about moving into that
internment camp and tell us

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.300
about the cane that you carry now.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.230
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Well, seminal --

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.310
because I'm going to
personalize this --

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:32.330 position:56%
but probably the most seminal moment
in my life was December 7th, 1941.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.400
We had just returned home from
church and we had the radio on.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.950
And pretty soon people were calling
about "What's going on in Hawaii,

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:47.200
and how is that going to
impact on us on the mainland?"

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.110
And so in February 19th

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:59.090
of 1942 President Roosevelt
signed Executive Order 9066.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:04.220
And that order delegated
to the Secretary of the War

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.600
and to the Commanding General

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.120 position:56%
of the Western Civil Defense Command
the ability to evacuate persons.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.870
It didn't say German, Japanese,
Italian; it said just the ability

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.710
to evacuate and intern persons.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.010
The Commanding General

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:26.870
of the Western Civil Defense
Command was a General Dewitt.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.030
And General Dewitt postured
that if the Japanese were able

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.330
to attack Hawaii, they
would probably be able

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.840
to attack the West Coast.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.090
And then if they attacked
the West Coast,

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:46.210
because there were 120,000 people
of Japanese ancestry in Washington,

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:50.450
Oregon, and California,
he had coined the phrase

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.720
"Once a J-a-p, always a J-a-p."

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.460
And if he figured if the
military forces came,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:02.380
120,000 people would join
up with the military forces.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:10.560
So he used Executive Order
9066 to commandeer racetracks

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.090
and county fairgrounds because
they had built-in living quarters,

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.060
namely horse stables.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:23.180
And so soon after February
19th, the big placards went

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.970
up in those neighborhoods

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:30.920
where there were many
people of Japanese ancestry.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.210
And the big signs just said simply

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:40.300
"Attention all those Japanese
ancestry, alien and nonalien."

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.190
And even as ten-year-old
kid as I was reading

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.410
that I said, "What's a nonalien?"

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:50.250
I asked my brother, who was 19
-- nine years old than me --

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.720
he said, "That's you, a citizen."

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.060
I said, "Well, why isn't the
government calling me a citizen

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.520
instead of a nonalien?"

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.720
Now, I'm not sure how many
of you have ever stood up

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.470
and pounded your chest and
said, "I'm a proud nonalien

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.910
of the United States of America"?

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.560
I don't think you have.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.550
And that's why to this day
I cherish the word "citizen"

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:23.580
because my own government wasn't
willing to use that moniker on us.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:33.050
So by May of 1942, we were
being assembled to move

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.460
onto the internment sites.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.790
And we could only take
what we could carry.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:46.380
And so we were first put into
-- imprisoned at Santa Anita,

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.950
the racetrack, which is
400 miles from San Jose.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:57.180 position:56%
So for us it was a big, long
overnight train ride to Los Angeles,

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.400
to Santa Anita, the racetrack.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:06.530
And I was ten years old and had
my Cub Scout uniform on, baseball,

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.470
baseball glove, baseball bat.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:14.040
And as I got on the train,
the MP's confiscated my bat

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.560
on the basis it could be
used as a lethal weapon.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.960
So I went running to my father,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.080
crying that the MP's
had taken the bat.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.780
He said, "That's all right.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.550
We'll get it replaced."

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.890
But there were no stores in the
camps, so it never was replaced.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.260
So I did lose my bat at the time.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:43.690
And 1991 I wrote the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.870
Act and that was considered
landmark legislation.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.990
It was the first rewrite of the
National Defense Highway Act.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:57.110
And the American Society of
Civil Engineers gave me the honor

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:04.010
of being a fellow of the American
Society of Civil Engineers.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.810
A fellow wrote to me
from Los Angeles saying,

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.190 position:56%
"Congratulations on becoming fellow.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.300
And I was very touched by the
fact that you lost your bat

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.930
when you were ten years old.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.920
And I want to share with you
a bat from my collection."

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.000
And when I opened the box it was
a bat signed by Hank Aaron --

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.200 position:56%
he was home run king -- and Sadaharu
Oh, the home run king of Japan.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.800
And so I thought wow.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.100
And so --

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.960
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: But that's
not the end of the story.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.590
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: So I wrote the
fellow a letter profusely thanking

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.320
him for this wonderful gift.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.980
And a reporter from the <i>San
Jose Mercury News</i> heard

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.160
about my getting the bat, so
he wrote a story about the bat.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.770
Being an enterprising reporter
went to -- excuse me --

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:57.560
a sports memorabilia shop, found
out the bat was worth $1,500.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:03.390
Well, the gift limitation for
those of us in Congress was $250.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.480
So I had to pack up the bat, send
it back to him, and explaining

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.090
to him why I couldn't
accept the bat.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.520
And I sent a copy of that
letter to the reporter.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.510
I penned on there, "The damn
government's taken my bat again."

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.240
[ Laughter ]

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.910
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Mr. Secretary,
I'm going to bring Alan Simpson

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:29.820
into this now because what was
it like for you as a kid growing

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:35.140
up in Cody, Wyoming to go out
and visit families during wartime

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.050 position:56%
who were basically American citizens
prisoner in their own country?

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Well, it was a very
confounding time because the war --

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:48.710
December 7th, a beautiful
Sunday, suddenly they said,

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.580
"The Japs have attacked
Pearl Harbor."

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.650
There was no political
correctness in those days.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.110
One of the cartoons in
the interpretive center,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:05.150
a very racist cartoon of the
first order by Dr. Seuss.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.790
Most amazing thing to
look at, the guy that went

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.650
on to charm the millions.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.460
It was a time of hysteria.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.070
But what it was really
time, there was nothing

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.190
between Powell and
Cody but sagebrush.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:24.090
And suddenly in the
June, May of '42 --

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.080
don't forget a Japanese
submarine shelled the coast

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.170
of California in March of '42.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:37.470
And they said, "How could this
possibly have happened unless

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.980
they're spies?"

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.530
So they didn't gather up anybody in
Cedar Rapids or Denver or New York.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.420
They just took them right
off the coast -- 120,000 --

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:54.200
and 14,000 people came to the
sagebrush between Cody and Powell;

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.170
about fifteen miles from
Cody, ten from Powell.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:05.390
And it had barbed wire,
the entire enclosure.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.690
It was barracks.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.490
As far as you could see, barracks.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.950 position:56%
No toilets in any of the facilities,
just a mess house where they ate,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:18.650
and then their toilet in a
tar paper shack -- literally.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.560
And they got off the train.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.560
And at each corner were
guard towers with soldiers

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.290
and machine guns aimed inside.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.400
Now, when you're a kid and you're
hearing on the radio every day

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:41.420
that the Japs have killed people
in Iwo Jima and they were taking us

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:47.580
to the woodshed until Midway
Island came up and we blew

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.880
up a lot of their carriers.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.800
But it was a tough time.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:56.710
Signs on the door in Cody, Wyoming,
"No Japs allowed," or "You SOB,

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.400
you killed my son in Iwo Jima."

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.040
And our scout master --
very advanced fellow --

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.980
said, "Look, they've got
scout troops out there."

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.410
I think there were three troops
and one was from San Jose.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:15.610 position:56%
And he said, "If any of your parents
don't want you to go, you tell me."

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.710
And only one parent said no.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.160
And my parents said,
"These are kids.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.150
They're just like you."

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:30.670
And we went out there and just
did merit badges and braiding.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.800
I didn't have any hair to braid,
but we braided other things.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.100
And met this cat.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.780
And then it never ended.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.410
He said that I tried to
drown out a bully in his camp

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.320
and that I made this
hideous laughter.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.010
I know that's not true.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.470
[ Laughter ]

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:55.250
But nevertheless, it was
a great lesson in working

00:22:55.250 --> 00:23:00.620
through the confusion of a terrible
situation and seeing boys just --

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.460
same merit badges, same
little books, same stuff.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.760
Terrible.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.500
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: So here we are
in 2016 and we've been through --

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:18.290
both of you -- have been
through 2001 and September 11th.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:23.290 position:56%
Are there lessons from the
internment process at a time of war,

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:27.810
after a time of real attack by a
known country, a known adversary

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.870
to a time now where this shadowy
terrorism and the rise of ISIS?

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:36.290
What lessons do you take from this?

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.940
And in the rear view mirror, does
the internment seem terribly,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.660
terribly wrong or understandable
at the time?

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.480
Senator?

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.840
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Well,
there's a difference.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:57.890
The difference is after we rounded
up 120,000 Japanese-Americans,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.820
very few of them were
permanent resident aliens --

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.360
some were -- the Nisei
and the Issei.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:13.770
There wasn't one single case of
espionage by any Japanese-American

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.940
in any one of those camps.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.330
It's different this time because
you're dealing with apparently

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.560
and vividly -- and
don't throw anything --

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:29.580
of people who like to behead people
and give women contraceptives

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.770
because you're not supposed to ever
rape a woman who could be pregnant.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.260
These are not pleasant people.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:39.600
And at some point you have to
make a distinction without getting

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.120
into hysteria and racism that
it's a very different thing now.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.240
And that's not very
politically correct.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.400
And you're going to have
to deal with real refugees.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.180
And a real refugee is a person
fleeing persecution based on race,

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.060
religion, national origin,

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.300
or membership in a political
or social organization.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.770
The dogs are tracking you
and the gunners are aiming

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.050
at you -- that's a refugee.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.880
And if that definition
isn't met case by case --

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.520
which was something
that Kennedy and I did

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.890
and George Shultz --
you got real problems.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.360
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Mr.
Secretary, looking back,

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.180
what should those students who are
listening to us from Hawaii know

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:29.430
about how you look at the
internment and how you look

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.800
at the security threat now?

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:36.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Well, I was the
Secretary of Transportation on 9/11.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.640 position:56%
And I was having a breakfast meeting
with the Deputy Prime Minister

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:46.610
of Belgium, who's also the
Minister of Transport for Belgium.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.490
And I had with me Jane
Garvey, who was the head

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.260
of the Federal Aviation
Administration.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:57.600
The three of us were having
breakfast in my conference room.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.570
My chief of staff came in
and said, "May I see you?"

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.410
So I excused myself,
went into my office.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.090
As I went into my office,

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.080
at the other end is a
TV console on the floor.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.270
And as I come walking in, obviously
it's the World Trade Center

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.540
and black smoke pouring out.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.840
I said, "What's all this?"

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.140
They said, "Well, we don't know.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.070
We've heard general
aviation into the building,

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.920
we've heard the possibility
of a commercial airliner

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.030
into the building, we've
heard the possibility

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.120
of an internal explosion
in the building."

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.390
So I looked at the TV for a
little while and went back

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.830
into the conference room
and explained to Jane

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:41.350
and to Mrs. [inaudible]
what I had just seen.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:48.060
And so little later he came back
in and said, "May I see you?"

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.990
So I excused myself,
went into my office,

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.340
and he said it was a
commercial airliner

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.640
that went into the building.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.870
And I was standing in
front of the TV set.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.970
And then all of a sudden
I see something green go

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.900
across the screen, disappear on
the left-hand side of the screen,

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.400
this yellow orangey billowy cloud.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.960
And I said, "Holy cow.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.410
What was all that about?"

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:18.870
or words to that effect.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.190
So I really watched
TV for a little while.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.600 position:56%
And I finally went into the room and
I said, "I don't know what's going

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.940
on in New York, but I know
it's going to involve me.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.940
Jane, you've got to get back to
the operation center at the FAA

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.700
and we've got to deal
with whatever's going on."

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.800
So I excused myself and
went back into my office.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.770
By the time I got in there,
the White House called, said,

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:43.490
"Get over here right away."

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.520
So I went over to the White House.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.270
And as we're driving in, people
are running out of the White House,

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.760
they're running out of the
old executive office building.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.650
And I said to my driver
and security guy,

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.320
"Is there something
wrong with this picture?

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.980
We're driving in and
everybody else is running out."

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.510
So I went into the White
House and Dick Clarke said,

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.810
"You got to be [inaudible].

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.090
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: He was the
counterterrorism advisor

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.390
at the time.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.690
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: "You
have to be briefed

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.990
in the situation room
by Dick Clarke."

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.160
So I went in there and he
didn't really tell me much more

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.240
than what I had already
heard on television.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.590
Then he said, "You got
to be in the PEOC."

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.450
And I said, "The PEOC,
what is that?"

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:28.930
He said, "That's the Presidential
Emergency Operation Center.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:31.320
It's a bunker way under
the White House."

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.440
I said, "I have no
idea where it is."

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.010
Secret Service agent standing
there said, "I'll take you."

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.520
So I went over there and
got there probably about --

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:45.040
I think it was about 9:20 or so.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.040 position:56%
And the vice-president was in there.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:54.710
And so military aid came in,
said to the vice-president,

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.100
"There's a plane heading
towards DC."

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:05.150
So in the POEC there's a big, long
table probably 30 feet long; 12,

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.190
15 feet wide; chairs
all the way around;

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.990
phones between each of the chairs.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:15.220
This phone I set up to my
office, this one to FAA,

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:21.470
sat there at that desk
talking into both phones.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:26.670
And so when he said that there
was a plane coming towards DC,

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.100
said to the FAA people,
"What are you tracking

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.190
of a plane coming towards DC?"

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:38.130
And in the credenza behind my desk
I had a monitor with an outline

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.600
of the 48 states and
a whole bunch of dots.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.660
I put my mouse on one of those
dots and a flag would come up

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:53.250
and say UA 123 -- United
Airlines flight 123 --

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.200
PDX and then a number of
navigational points, ORD.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.330
So the plane had left Portland,

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.010
flying through these points,
going to Chicago O'Hare.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:11.640
And then it would say D757 52
-- a Boeing 757 Series 200.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.240
It would show the compass
direction, the amount of fuel left

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.870
on the plane, and a
number of other things.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.840
But all that transponder had
been turned off on that plane.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.360
And all they were doing
was following the blip

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.270 position:56%
on the 37-second sweep of the radar.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.730
So I said [inaudible]
"Where's the plane?"

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:38.460
And it's hard to relate to
a radar picture and then try

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.610
to relate it to the ground.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.920
So he said, "Well, probably in
the middle of Pennsylvania."

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.280
So every so often I'd
say, "Where is it now?"

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.220
And so he'd try to guess.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.680
He'd say, "Probably north
of the Baltimore now."

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.980
"And where is it now?"

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.580
"Probably near Roslyn."

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.880
"Where is it now?"

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.050
"Probably between Roslyn
and the National Airport."

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.570
"Where is it now?"

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.760
"Oops." "Oops what?"

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.360
"We just lost the bogey,
just lost the target."

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.230
"Where did you lose it?"

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:12.860
"Somewhere between Pentagon
City and the National Airport."

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.450
And then someone broke into
the phone and said, "Secretary,

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:20.650
we just got a phone call for an
Arlington County police officer

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:24.400
who saw an American Airlines
go into the Pentagon."

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.380
So I said, "Monty," I said,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.550
"that's the third commercial
airliner used as a missile today.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.020
And we don't know what
the heck is going on.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.570
The military has something
called stand down.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:37.090
We've got to do our own stand down.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:40.870
We're going to bring all
the planes down right now."

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:44.750
And Monty said, "We will bring all
planes down per pilot discretion."

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.840
And I said, "Screw
pilot discretion,"

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.200
because I didn't want a pilot
over let's say Albuquerque

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.470
or Phoenix deciding he'd
just fly into Los Angeles.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:57.860
I wanted all the planes down.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:03.600
And at that point we had
5,138 planes over the skies.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.360
And in two hours and 20
minutes we were able to get them

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.890
down all safely and
without incident.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:15.450
But that morning, that Tuesday
morning, I pulled three people

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.660
out of ACS -- Aviation
Civil Security.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.860
I said, "Start putting
together a security regimen

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.160
that we can allow the
airlines to go back up."

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:31.990
And so they started working
on it, pulled them out of FAA

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:34.270
and brought them over to my office.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.140
And they started working on that.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:41.420
And it took until Friday for
us to get the new regimen out.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.440
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Let me ask you to
look at it now through the eyes

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:53.620
that we have now where terrorism
has now struck softer targets.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:58.990
And do you think that the
reactions were the right one

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.290
on September 11th?

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.690
And what do students and the
rest of us now know better

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.880
as we look back on September 11th?

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.720
Is there a way to better
protect Americans,

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.540
the broader issue of
national security?

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.840
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Well, I
think the fact that the TSA --

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:19.800
we established TSA
in November of 2001.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.870
And since then there has
not been a terror incident

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:29.330
of any major magnitude in
our transportation system.

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:33.760
The thing that had been
before the case was

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.710
that we allowed the airlines
to do their own security.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:39.500
And they would put
it out to low bid,

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.090
and whoever got the low
bid did the security.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:45.310
Well, that proved not
to be the case.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:50.170
So ACS started putting
together the regimen.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:51.470
And what they started out with

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.000
at the very top was no
racial or ethnic profiling.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.440
And that was the first one
that was in there on the list

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.340
of things that they wrote about.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:10.270
Now, on Thursday, September 13th we
had a cabinet meeting of the House

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:14.440
and Senate Republican
and Democratic leaders.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:20.090
And towards the end of that
meeting Congressman David Bonoir

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:25.580
of Michigan said, "Mr. President,
we have a large population

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.730
of Arab Americans in Michigan.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.920
And they're very, very
concerned about all this talk

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.710
about keeping Middle
Easterners off airplanes,

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.520
keeping Muslims off airlines.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:45.050
And even talk about rounding people
up, putting them into camps."

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:48.630
And President Bush said, "David,
you're absolutely correct.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:53.610
We are equally concerned
about the rhetoric going on.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.590
And we don't want to have
happen today what happened

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.600
to Norm in 1942."

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.900 position:56%
And you could have hit me with a
feather and knocked me off my chair.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.200
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Wow.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.610
We have so much territory to cover.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.200
I want to move ahead.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:14.580
Alan Simpson, when you look back
at that time and, of course,

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.460
then in 47 days after the
September 11th attacks,

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:25.020
the United States Congress
passed the Patriot Act.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.280 position:56%
And you were the judiciary committee
during your time in the Senate.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.820
Do you think the Patriot
Act was the right next move?

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.400
It's been revised,
obviously, since then.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.340
But was that reaction
an understandable one

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.520
in terms of national security?

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.950
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Well,
it was responding

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:48.530
to hysteria and fear and racism.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.600
And, you know, I always love
it -- I don't love it --

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:57.450
I'm puzzled when people talk about
what happened in World War II,

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:01.590
that Earl Warren was
right at the forefront

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.370
of evacuating these people.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:08.290 position:56%
And he spent his life on the Supreme
Court trying to expiate his guilt.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:11.050
Franklin Roosevelt, one of the
greatest civil libertarians

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:15.870
of all time, with a great
tragedy the Supreme Court

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:21.850
of the United States in a 6-3
decision together with the majority

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:26.320
of William O. Douglas said
this was perfectly okay,

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.920
a military necessity.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.670
So people said, "Oh, how horrible."

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.490
Well, so what?

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:39.600
It happened and you
can't unwind history.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.090
There was a dissent
by a guy named Murphy.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:43.390
He was a hack.

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:44.860
He was a Democrat hack.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.160
I hate to say that, but he was.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.620
But he should go down in
history with the Constitution

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.550
and the Gettysburg Address.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:37:01.110
He wrote the dissent, which in
Wyoming terms was essentially

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:05.500
"Military necessity my ass."

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:10.170
This was a total violation of the
Constitution of the United States

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.270
of America based on
race and hysteria.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.130
We are all foreigners
in this country.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:22.360
And it isn't that big as on the
wall of the interpretive center

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:29.080
that dear Norm raised all the
bucks -- I took some of the credit.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.580
But these things --
I mean, it was done.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:37.250
And now, you know, they're
talking about privacy.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:41.170
I mean, I have another
twisted view of life:

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.450
I have no privacy, never did.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:49.650
I wish they hadn't found out about
some of the stuff but, you know,

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.600
shooting mailboxes and
being on federal probation

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.610
and hitting a cop --
those are not good things.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:03.270
But nevertheless, my view is very
simple: What do you got to hide?

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:08.600 position:56%
And this thing between Apple and
the US is going to get a lot bigger.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.990
It's going to be like bear meat --

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.970
the more you chew it,
the bigger it gets.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:18.540
And at some point you're going to
find guys who are encrypted not

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.220
for going good things in the
world; they're encrypting

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.800
so they can do bad things and
then invent their own coinage

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.770
for God's sake and play bit --

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:34.030
I mean, the fun and games in my
lifetime in this area are going

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:39.080 position:56%
to be full zone bullet jacket stuff.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.330
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: So where are we
now in terms of the Patriot Act

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:47.640
and then the USA Freedom Act,
which came on after Edward Snowden,

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:54.360
an analyst who had left Hawaii with
all the briefcases full of secrets

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.530
and put them out there to make
sure that they were published.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.870
What does the United States do now?

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:05.060
What should Americans know
about their privacy right now

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.900
and the balance with
national security, Alan?

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.200
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: I don't know.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.910
As I say, it's a puzzler.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.310
You know, they're waiting
for Snowden.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.410
They want to extradite him.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.840
He'd love to come home, though
he ain't going to get home.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:27.390
And then there pretty soon
somebody will say as we say

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.440 position:56%
but your shirt, your heart fall out.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.670
We should have him
back and all that.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.210
Well, we will bring him back.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:39.520
We'll do something in the court
system when he comes back.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.840
I don't know.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:47.130
The whole thing is shot through
with political correctness,

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:53.720 position:56%
which when I taught at Harvard, I
told my class, "If anyone's enamored

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.670
by political correctness,
you want to get out of here.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:01.120
Because we're going to talk about
everything -- the Irish troubles,

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.390
Armenian genocide,
abortion, homosexuality.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.660
All of this will be talked
about without a muzzle."

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.010
Because I think people who say,

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.490
"I've never had a bad
thought about anything.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:17.060
I'm just the sweetest
person on earth

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.090
and never had any bias
or prejudice certainly."

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.200
That's just BS.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.150 position:56%
So that's going to be one and that's
why this guy Trump is hitting all

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.090
the chords on the <i>Phantom
of the Opera</i>.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.870
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Trump, who is this?

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.810
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: He's not my guy.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.020
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Mr. Secretary?

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.690
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Well, I was
on the Intelligence Committee

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:45.190
when we wrote the FISA, the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:50.050
In there, there was a
requirement that the NSA had

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:55.250
to get a search warrant to
tap the lines of a US citizen,

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.060
go to a three-judge tribunal
to get a search warrant.

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.950
Now, that was eliminated
in the Patriot Act.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:05.810
And so the protection there

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:12.900
about what can the government
have access to wasn't there.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.920
And that bothered me.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.670
And I remember the
administration had asked me

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:22.440 position:56%
to help get the Patriot Act through.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.530
I said no, I couldn't help them

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:27.870
because they had eliminated
the three-judge panel

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:30.850
when they rewrote the FISA act.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:40.530
And so I think there has to be the
kind of protection to citizens,

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:47.180
even with the national security
as extreme as it could be.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:52.510
And otherwise, you
know, the whole --

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:57.610
the thing I couldn't understand
was on September 11th was sort

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:01.440
of reliving the evacuation of '42.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.180
Because here you had
the media people saying,

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.680
"Round them up, keep
them off planes."

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.290
And so, I mean, even the
president said, "We don't want

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:16.320
to have happen today what
happened to Norm in '42."

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:23.660
And then he met with a large
group of Arab-Americans,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:32.300
Muslims at the Islamic
Study Center on Mass Avenue

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.480
on Monday, September 17th.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.960
And he said to them, "We know
who did that last Tuesday.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.000
They were not loyal Arab-Americans.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.500
They were not faithful
followers of Islam.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.890
They were terrorists.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.010
And we're going to go after them."

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:53.860
And the same thing happened
at the end of September,

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:59.440
there was someone shot and killed
-- a man who owned a gas station.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.970
It was a minimart.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.600
And when they apprehended
the killer,

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.260
they said, "Why did you kill him?"

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.490
He said, "Because he
looked like the enemy."

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:09.700
The fellow was a Sikh.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.000
And he had --

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.300
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: The turban.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:16.460
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: He had facial
hair, he had leg bindings.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.180
Said simply because he
looked like the enemy."

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.510
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: What part
of government really has

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.420
to take the lead on security?

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.760
Is it the Executive?

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:31.210
Is Congress uniquely unsuited to
really grapple with these issues?

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.420
Should it really be
left to the courts,

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.890
the ultimate resort the courts?

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:37.460
Who in government?

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.390
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Well,
it requires --

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:49.120
the Executive part of our
government still requires laws

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.410
by which it gets the
authority to do something.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:44:00.720
So as in the Transportation
Security Act of November 17, 2001,

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:06.730
Congress created TSA
and gave us the --

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:13.920
there were 36 mandates in the
law as to what we had to do.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.760
So you still had to have
the Congress involved in it.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:23.320
At the time Congress wanted to have
the security done by contractors.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.000
And I maintained that the
contractors didn't do their job.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.430
And I wanted them as
federal employees

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:36.010
so that regardless whether you got
on the plane in Chicago, Dallas,

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:42.420 position:56%
Fort Worth, or [inaudible] Iowa,
you were going to have the same kind

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:46.110
of level of security being applied.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:50.320
So we were finally
able to get Congress.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.570
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: These
things are a federal job.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.480
Immigration is a federal
responsibility.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: That's our next --

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.460
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Not a
state-by-state responsibility.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.010
But if you have a Congress
that won't function on an issue

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:07.220
and they're not functioning on the
issue, then the president's going

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.610
to come in with executive order,

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:11.990
which is exactly what has
happened with immigration.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:17.390
And when we did an immigration
bill back in '86, bipartisan,

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:23.010 position:56%
big votes both sides, it didn't work
because the right and the left --

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:28.060 position:56%
Grover Norquist rode in on his white
horse, I remember, and his robes.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.210
He was kind of like
Paul Revere in reverse.

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:33.410
[ Laughter ]

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:39.830
And then also the ACLU
rose in abject anguish

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.780
and called what we had in there --

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:48.650
we got to have a more secure
identifier to protect the employer.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.370
And they took it out because the
national rage created by the left

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:56.800
and the right was that that
was a national ID card.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.210
Boy, that's a way to kill stuff

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:02.710
around this joint:
Invent a flash word.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.810
National ID card.

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:08.170
Now they're talking about
retina scans and fingerprints.

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:13.020
And nobody's written any kind of an
editorial about the slippery slope.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.400
I mean, you know, it is madness.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:20.540
But if Congress won't function,
any president is going to function.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:23.490
And then if that doesn't
work, the court will function.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.660
And that's the way that works.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: We are going to open
to your questions in just a moment.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.940
Let me get you both before
we take these questions

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.500
to focus on immigration.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:38.920
Because that is the next
logical area in the kind

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.530
of national security debate that
we've had in the United States

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:45.200
and the court's decisions.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:50.670
Why, Senator Simpson, were you able
to get immigration legislation --

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.870
landmark legislation -- in 1986?

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:57.950
And is it ever going to be possible

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:01.330
in the early part of
the 21st century?

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:02.630
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Well,

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:06.990
when we started Ron Mazzoli
was a Democrat from Kentucky.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.890
Norm knew him well.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:14.740 position:56%
And he was the chairman of judiciary
and the Subcommittee on Immigration.

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.810
And I said, "Why are we having
a hearing in the House?"

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:24.600
on the issue of whatever it was,
security or whatever, or amnesty --

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.740
which we changed the
word to legalization,

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.420
which threw all of them off.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.030
And you have to learn how
to throw them off, you know,

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:37.510 position:56%
before they gnaw a hole through you.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:43.280
So I said, "Let's have
a joint hearing --

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.050
House and Senate together.

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:47.070
I'll come over to your shop."

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.510
We had to go to the
Speaker to get that done

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.070
because he controls the shop.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.590
And Tip O'Neill looked
as us both and said,

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:54.940
"What the hell's wrong with that?"

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.240
And we did.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.170
I think we had twenty
joint hearings.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.050
Covered a lot of ground.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.970
Kennedy was my ranking member.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:08.050
Sonny Montgomery was over
there in the Democrats,

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.660 position:56%
Ham Fish -- good, thoughtful people.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.580
The vote was bipartisan.

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:19.230
And then I remember very
swiftly I was still in the Senate

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:22.430
and they said, "Now,
the Republicans,

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:25.300
we need to do a Republican
immigration bill

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.800
and you're the wizard."

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:32.500
I said, "There is no such thing
as a Republican immigration bill,

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.520
and if you think there
is, you'll never get one.

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.650
It has to be a bipartisan bill."

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:43.230
And that's what they can't get
done now until they realize

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.850
that this is a national
issue that should be handled

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:50.200
by a national Congress of
bipartisan, good faith people.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.950
They're not going to get anywhere.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.250
Period.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.380
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: We're going
to start with some questions.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:58.020
We still have a lot of
area that we need to hit.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:03.430
So please, where would
you like to start us?

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.060
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: We'll
start with a question submitted

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:08.540
from the students in Hawaii
who are watching online.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:12.580
One of the students has a question
about American values and states

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.500
that American values are
what makes us unique.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.570
&gt;&gt; I had a mortar platoon
in the army

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.550
and I'm not getting -- it's blurry.

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:21.850
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
I'll repeat the question.

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:23.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, please.

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:25.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: The question
about American values which are seen

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:28.390
around the world as one of the
great things about this country.

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:31.620
The question is: How do
you each think we are doing

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:34.880
in role modeling our values
in the face of threats?

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.140
And what more do we need
to do to enhance security

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.860 position:56%
without undermining what many
internationally find most attractive

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.390
in the US?

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:47.500
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Could you hear
part of that, Secretary Mineta?

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.220
What do we need for
national security

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:57.680
that doesn't violate our sense
of privacy rights, of the honor?

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.090
What was the other phrase
that the student used?

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:03.390
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: Integrity.

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:04.690
Integrity.

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:07.200
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: The
integrity of Americans.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.690
Now, that's a -- it's
a great question,

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:13.060
but it's also a very tall order.

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.860
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Next question.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.490
[ Laughter ]

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:23.350
Well, I think first we
start with common sense.

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:25.050
But I think we also
[inaudible] baked

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:33.150
into there is the increased need
for the use of technology in terms

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:38.530
of being able to do things today
from a security perspective.

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:41.080
And I think there are
ways of doing that.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.750
And I think -- but as
Alan just pointed out,

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:49.350
the Apple case is a good
example of where you do get

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.580
into issues involving technology.

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:57.160
But I think what we
have done in TSA --

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.720
and one thing that TSA
does is they're looking

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.850
at that security issue every day.

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:12.650
I mean, in December of 2001, we
had to deal with the shoe bomber.

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:18.930
And then we had to deal with --
usually explosives are solids.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:24.760
But by 2003 we were
dealing with liquids.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:29.390
So now we were dealing
with containers

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:33.770
of less than 3.0 fluid ounces.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:38.130
So but it's something that's
just changing every day.

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:40.650 position:56%
And I think that's what is required.

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:41.950
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Senator?

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:44.680
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: There's got to
be something that you do that has

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.850
to do with identification.

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.090
Without getting into
the horror story,

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:52.350
something that would be
presented at the time of --

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.970
it wouldn't be carried
on your person,

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:59.640
it wouldn't be whatever,
all the horror stories.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:03.690 position:56%
But it would be something that you
presented at the time of employment.

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:07.410
And it would be presented
by bald white guys

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:09.480
like me, as well as others.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.200
The issue always comes up
we're just going to ask

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.200
that of people who look foreign.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.920
Well, that's absurd.

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.630
Nobody's for that.

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:20.450
But you have to do something
that has a universal --

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:23.920
at one time we talked about
having the maiden name

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.530
of a person's mother
on the back of a card.

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:29.160
Well, that will cost trillions.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.700
Well, you know, we've
all heard that one.

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:36.010
And then to put something
like a slide card like you do

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:43.940
in Macy's somewhere or something
that has to be done by everybody.

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.250
And at that point it
will be intrusive;

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:48.620
it will be reported as intrusive.

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:53.660 position:56%
But at some point in time there will
be one of these boobs of any color,

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.040
or shape, or form that's going

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:58.480
to ignite a shoe box
somewhere in this country.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.010
And then we'll all stand around and
blink like a frog in a hailstorm.

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:03.580
[ Laughter ]

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:07.300
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Next question.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.980
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: There are a
couple of questions about refugees

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.140
and what the United
States should do in light

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:18.810
of the current refugee situation
in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan,

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:22.850
and how we might protect
our national security

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:24.870
and accept refugees
from these countries?

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.890
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Good questions
on accepting refugees.

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:32.370
Pope Francis came back to
the Vatican from a visit

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.480
in Greece bringing
12 Syrian refugees.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.960
I don't know who vetted them,
but they got on the plane

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.910
and they came back [inaudible]
three families, I believe.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:42.910 position:56%
There are some Americans communities

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:45.980
that don't want Syrian
refugees anywhere near them.

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:50.540
There are some churches and
groups and community groups

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.340
who have welcomed them and
said, "Let us help you."

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.430
Do you, either of you
worry about the flood

00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:01.100
of Syrian refugees coming
into the United States?

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:08.010
And since the screening would be
so hard to do, is that a weak point

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:10.960
in the United States' security?

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.690
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Well, any
weak point is a weak point

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:15.450
if you don't understand
the difference

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:18.730
between an economic migrant, and
guy that just wants to get the hell

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:21.420
out of his country, and a refugee.

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:26.670
A refugee is something that is
cherished and then they can go

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:28.950
to sanctuary, which
is a cherished thing.

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:32.680
You can't be an economic migrant
that just doesn't like his country

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:36.110
or decides to hop on a
plane and close his shop

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:38.460
because his neighbor got shot.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:39.760
That is not a refugee.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.820
I know, don't throw
anything, please.

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.630
I've been here.

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:46.280 position:56%
So you have to do this case by case.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.750
And it's tedious but it works.

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:54.940 position:56%
But the economic migrant is flooding
the world because when you're

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:58.400
out of food and water and
you have a lovely family,

00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.840
you're going to start walking.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.830
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And you've lost
your home in Syria because of --

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:04.130
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: That's right.

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.370
But a refugee -- a real refugee --

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:10.950
the minute their foot hits
the next spot out, that's it.

00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:13.160
You don't get to pick
where you want to go.

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.380
I know that sound nasty,
I know it does.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:20.630
But once you're a refugee
or seeking asylum --

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:24.060
that's the same in a sense, you're
there or you're not there --

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:28.160
once you hit that next
piece of land where isn't

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.830
that oppression, that's it.

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:32.790
You cannot then say, "I want
to go to the United States.

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:34.220
I want to go to Germany.

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.520
I want to go to France.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.900
I want to go to Israel."

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.260
It's not the way it works.

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:42.200
And boy, you start playing that and
the violin music will overcome you.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.630
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Do you
want to add in on that?

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:47.300
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: The
status of refugee,

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:52.620
the investigation that's required
of that is very, very intensive.

00:55:52.620 --> 00:56:01.910 position:56%
And so it is very difficult, really,
to be I think vetted as a refugee.

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:08.820
And I think to the extent that
they are vetted as refugees,

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:13.540
I would say they're safe
and clear to come in.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:16.740
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Do you think
that the current system

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:21.280
for vetting refugees and
those who are trying to come

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.310
into the United States is adequate?

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:24.610
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Absolutely.

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:29.070
Because I think it requires the
personal signature of the Secretary

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:34.610
of Homeland Security and --

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:36.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Secretary of State.

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:37.630
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Secretary
of State.

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:39.140
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: George
Shultz, who was very helpful

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.010
to Kennedy and I on that.

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:42.310
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Yep.

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.260
Another question?

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.910
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: There
are a number of questions

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.640
about privacy and surveillance.

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.350
And one of the students from the
University of Hawaii actually asked

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:56.080
if the surveillance
measures employed now

00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:03.200
by the NSA create a sort
of virtual internment camp.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.580
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: That's interesting.

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:13.190
Do you think that the kind of
response to Edward Snowden's leaks

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:17.780
and the kind of surveillance
-- the broader surveillance,

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.490
whether it went through
the FISA court or not --

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:26.850
almost levees the threat or
the feeling of an interment

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:32.820
and a restriction that impinges too
much on Americans' privacy rights?

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:36.740
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Well, when I
was Secretary of Transportation,

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:45.820
I did ban -- not ban --
we were not processing any

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.290
of the applications as
it related to drones.

00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:53.080
Because I thought the
invasion of civil --

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.900
or just privacy was tremendous.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:06.250
In fact, just a month ago, my
wife and I and another couple were

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:11.100
at a restaurant in San
Francisco along the Bay.

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:17.710
And here comes a drone and it just
went back and forth in front of us.

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:22.120
And, you know, I was
thinking "Whose drone is that?

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.060
What are they looking for?"

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:29.830
And I thought back to 2003

00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:34.540
when I was saying we're
not going to allow drones.

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:38.110
And so --

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:39.560
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And
now they almost --

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.370
that genie seems out of
the bottle, isn't it?

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:43.670
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Oh, it is.

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:45.610
It really is.

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:47.500
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Senator?

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.800
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Well,

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:55.490
these technical things now are
quite dazzling for us old coots --

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:59.080
Twitter, tweety, Instagram.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.910
You know, it's amazing.

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:06.990
And then they're talking about some
new thing that I can't remember.

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:08.290
They're all new.

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:14.060 position:56%
But the point is the invasion -- if
anyone believes that there's privacy

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.720
in America, they're
in a dream world.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.680
There was a program -- I
don't remember what it was --

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.550
and they had a couple from
Dubuque or Boone, Iowa or Cheyenne

00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:27.480
and they said, "How much do
you think we know about you?"

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.630
And they said, "We've never
done anything important,

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:32.180
so you don't know too much."

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.280
And they ran up on the screen
and man, they knew lots

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:40.530
about those two people
through their media habits,

00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:41.830
through their buying habits --

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:43.150
they're buying stuff
on the Internet,

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:45.400
you're answering those
little questions,

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.570
or you're get that
stuff in the mail.

00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:51.950
And they know everything you
would never imagine they know

00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:53.250
about all of us.

00:59:53.250 --> 01:00:00.380
So this plea for privacy and then
to have it upheld by the media,

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:02.490 position:56%
crying for a right of privacy, well,

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:07.830
they're the greatest
invaders of anybody's privacy.

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:10.940
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Real
quickly for each of you,

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.490
should Apple have immediately
done what it could

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:18.040
to help the federal government
on cracking that phone?

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.010
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: You
take that Norm, quick.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:24.360
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: I think so,
but I'm on the minority on that.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.260
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: You think
that Apple should have?

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.480
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Oh, they
should have been much more open

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.520
about dealing with that issue.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.610
But I'm a real minority on that.

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:36.910
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Okay, okay.

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:38.390
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: But I
think that's the view

01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:41.860
of older people: What
do you got to hide?

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:46.420
And this -- who wouldn't want
to know what's on the cell phone

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:52.160
of a couple of cooks that destroyed
14 human beings and were in contact

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.980
with people maybe around the world?

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.060
Who wouldn't want to know that?

01:00:56.060 --> 01:01:01.330
It was like the old <i>Stanford
Daily</i> case; do you remember that?

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:04.940
They had a riot at Stanford and
the <i>Stanford Daily</i> paper --

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.400
the student paper -- knew
who had been involved.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.780
And the cops wanted
that information.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:15.280
It went clear to the US Supreme
Court and Justice Wyatt said,

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:17.740
"You can't have that
kind of protection.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.600
They want to know who did this.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.010
You can't pull this game of,
you know, the right of privacy

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:25.640
and protection of source
and all this stuff."

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.300
And when you have murderous
people in the world,

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:35.270
these other things sound good
and they are part of America,

01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:38.520 position:56%
but don't think America is
diminished when we're trying to wipe

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.470
out people who hate our guts.

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:43.490
I don't know, sick idea.

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:44.790
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: I want
to make sure we have time

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:49.870
for a few more questions from the
audience and from the students.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:51.820
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
Another question from Hawaii,

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.810
actually a couple questions
from Hawaii ask

01:01:54.810 --> 01:02:01.120
about providing military
equipment to local police forces.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.860
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Providing
what to local?

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.160
&gt;&gt; Military equipment.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.460
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Equipment.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.560
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: To police
forces, especially in light

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:12.010
of what occurred in Ferguson and on
Staten Island with Michael Brown,

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:14.880
is how do we balance security

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.440
in those instances
with civil liberties?

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.450
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Well, obviously in
the cases after Ferguson, Missouri

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:25.610
and in some other communities
-- Baltimore had some riots --

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:28.570
some people have objected
to what looked

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:31.490
like a huge military operation.

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:34.560
And isn't that really up
to the local community,

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.270
the local law enforcement?

01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:41.140 position:56%
Someday they might need that armored
troop carrier and the water canons.

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:43.510
Sometimes they may overuse it.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:46.990
But should local police
departments have access to quite

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:49.480
so much military fire power?

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.600
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: I
think that's a point.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.430
Both of us were in the military.

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:58.790
And, you know, we weren't
trained to hand out daisies;

01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:02.140
we were trained to kill people.

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:07.130
And so I do think that when you
have an armored personnel carrier

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:12.570
in the midst of a city and you
unload a squad from the back of it,

01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:15.920
if those are things
that I knew how to run,

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.250
I think that's highly intimidating.

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:22.840
But that came from that
funding source where they said,

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:28.520
"We got this leftover stuff and all
you have to do is apply for it."

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.980
And I think it has to be
rather frightening when you're

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:37.070
in the street and alone
or with or without arms.

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:40.060
I don't know, I think there's
real truth to the military.

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.790
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And some of those
incidents were racial incidents

01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:48.200
at a local level as
opposed to San Bernardino

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.510
where it was clearly an attack
by people who had a political

01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:58.660
or radical ideology that they were
trying to strike at a soft target.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.960
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Yeah.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.410
Having been mayor, I'm
not sure that I would want

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:07.850
to have a police force
with that equipment.

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:13.350
The whole issue of
policing is really --

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:19.360
the whole issue is how do
you relate to the community?

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.760
When I was mayor, police were
starting to put helmets on.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.500
And I finally said to
our chief of police,

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:34.250
"I'm not sure I want our police
with these hard helmets on.

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:35.550
They don't smile.

01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:41.610
They can't be friendly-looking
just having these hardhats on."

01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:48.550
And so we were one of
the first ones after --

01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:54.510
and I negotiated this
with our police union --

01:04:54.510 --> 01:05:02.420
and so we took the caps or the
hardhats off of our police.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:06.290
We were also one of
the first departments

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:11.230
to require psychological
testing of applicants.

01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:13.730
And this was in 1973.

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:21.200
And the -- at the time the
police, the union really came

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.960
down on me saying, you know,
"You think we're all psychotics?"

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.260
And I said.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.560
"No, not at all.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.590
Today every department
across the country is doing

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.320
psychological testing."

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.250
But it's really for
their own protection.

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:41.580
For the same thing with the
military type of equipment,

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.450 position:56%
I don't think it's really necessary.

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:51.210
Even in Katrina when General Honore
came in with the military forces

01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:55.640
and they were there with their
weapons out, and he was running up

01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:00.060
and down the street telling
people to get their weapons up.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:05.280
Not to, you know, point
them at the mass of people.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.740
And General Honore really, I think,

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:13.390
did a great service
in lifting those.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:19.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: But there's this
wonderful man that uses common sense

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:24.070
and doesn't get caught up in the
grinder of emotion, fear, guilt,

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:28.870
and racism or try to have a press
conference every few minutes

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:30.490
to blow your own horn.

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:35.760
This is happening and people
are so confounded by it.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.290
Where is common sense?

01:06:37.290 --> 01:06:38.590
What happened?

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:41.330
The most uncommon thing
is common sense.

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:44.320
And when Norm was mayor
I happened to know

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:48.910 position:56%
that he would gather people together
and talk and say, "Where are we?

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:50.210
What are we doing?"

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:51.510
That's what he did in Congress.

01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:52.810
That's how he got --

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.260
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Does
that work in 2016?

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.040
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Not when you've
got everybody stereotyped.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.990
I can tell you that here we
did this piece of work --

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:02.290
don't throw anything --

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:05.250
it was called the National
Commission on Deficit and Debt.

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:09.350
We got five Democrats, five
Republicans, one Independent.

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.140
That's 60%.

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.870 position:56%
And then say, "Well, who was on it?"

01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:15.840
Well, Dick Durbin.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.880
Dick Durbin?

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.580
That Commie from Illinois?

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:26.050
Is that what you -- I
said, "Well, Tom Corburn."

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:27.350
Tom Corburn?

01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:29.390
That guy from -- that
Republican from Oklahoma?

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:31.800
That's your country today.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.370
People don't dislike
somebody, they hate them

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:36.950
and they got them pegged
as a Democrat.

01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:40.560
They hate Obama, they hate
[inaudible], they hate Trump,

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.720
they hate Cruz, they hate Hillary.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.240
It's not dislike.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.540
It's disgusting.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.270
And hatred corrodes the
container it's carried in.

01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:51.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: So tell the
students especially who are watching

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:56.640
from Hawaii, how do Americans
bring the country back

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.740
from that kind of atmosphere?

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.220
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Well, they
could get off their butt

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.430
and get in the game.

01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:05.680
Because if you really want
to do something, pick a party

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.620 position:56%
and become a precinct committee man
-- that's the lowest form of amoeba.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:17.380
Or you could be a precinct
committee man or woman.

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:18.980
You could run for the school board.

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.360
I brought Norm to Harvard.

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.750
I couldn't have got into Harvard
if I had picked the locks.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:26.290
But I told him, "Get up here

01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:29.370
because they're protesting
the [inaudible] thing

01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:31.010
down in [inaudible]."

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:34.380
He came and he said,
"Anybody can carry a placard.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.910
Anybody can stand in the
street with a poster.

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.210
Use your brain.

01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:39.510
Get in the game."

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:40.810
And that's what it's all about.

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:44.880
If you're a young person today,
you pick your party and start

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:48.220
at the lowest level and bring
your influence and your brains

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:53.560
to that party -- to the lowest
level, then the county, whatever.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.930
Instead of just, you know,
carrying a placard or bitching.

01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:58.230
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Good advice.

01:08:58.230 --> 01:09:03.510
We have -- I think we have
two more quick questions.

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:08.180
[ Applause ]

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:11.040
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren: I want to
throw one in real quickly back

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.070
on security: Should
Guantanamo be shut down?

01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:17.710 position:56%
Is it more -- President Obama argues

01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:22.610
that it is inciting some terrorist
attacks against the United States.

01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:26.990
And why shouldn't some of those
detainees who are too dangerous

01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:29.920
to let them go back to wherever
they came from go into a kind

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.630
of a super max American prison?

01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:36.150
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Go ahead, Norm,
before I give them [inaudible].

01:09:36.150 --> 01:09:37.450
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Yeah.

01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:44.190
I, in fact, was at Guantanamo
on Thanksgiving Day of 2002

01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:47.040
when they were just
starting to come in.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:54.130 position:56%
And I think there were five Al-Qaeda
prisoners there at the time.

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:58.310
I think there was a great
deal of justification

01:09:58.310 --> 01:10:03.180
for establishing Guantanamo
at the time.

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:08.720
And since then I think we have
other ways of dealing with it.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:15.170
And I don't think we need
Guantanamo as it is, as we know it.

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:16.890
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Do you
agree with that, Senator?

01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:18.190
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: How
many are there now?

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:19.490
Eighty? Sixty?

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:20.790
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: It's under ninety.

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:23.350
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: But don't forget,
every one of them had a lawyer.

01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:26.080
They've all tried hard
and they failed.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.410
And at some point in time --

01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:29.720
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And no other
country wants them, either.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.020
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: What?

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.320
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: No other
country wants them, either.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.620
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: No.

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.940
And any Congressman
that will say, "Well,

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:38.800
bring them to my state,"
is not long in office.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.790
And they've already shown up.

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:42.870
Don't bring them to New York.

01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:45.420
And the president is
obsessed by this.

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:49.780
He made a promise and he wants
desperately to carry it out.

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:53.800
But it's never going to
happen under his jurisdiction.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.700 position:56%
We sent five guys off the other day.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.950
Five went before and now they're
head of the Yemen operation

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:01.940
down there blowing things up.

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.190
So at some point in
time we say in the West,

01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:06.710
"If your horse drops dead,
it's best to get off."

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:12.540
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: That's
Wyoming wisdom.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.160
Last question.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:23.200
I think we stumped our
questioner [inaudible].

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.270
No, please, go right ahead.

01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:27.570
&gt;&gt; For our final question
from Hawaii again:

01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:29.700
Have your political
views ever gotten

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.900
in the way of your friendship?

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:35.260
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Have your
political views ever gotten

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:38.920
in the way of your friendship?

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.920
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: Of our friendship?

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.840
I love this guy.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:48.380
And we -- when he called me to
work on the reparations bill,

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:50.230
it was very controversial.

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:54.190
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: What year was this?

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:55.490
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: This
was [inaudible]

01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:57.040 position:56%
but my colleague was Malcolm Wallop.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.880
There are people who
remember Malcolm;

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.470
he was violently opposed to it.

01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:02.860
He said, "Who's next?

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.710
We going to do something
with the blacks?

01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:06.080
How about the Native Americans?

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.880
Who is next of the aggrieved?"

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:14.390
And he was [inaudible] finally
said, "Look, I was there and I was

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:18.800
in that camp and I know Norm
and what they're doing."

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.360
Some people refused the money.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.220
They said, "It isn't about
money; I'm still embarrassed

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:27.670
that they threw me in
this incarceration."

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:34.730
So friendship is a beautiful thing.

01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:40.440
And we never -- I don't think
either of us ever since we were 12

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.810
and now we're 84 have ever looked
at each other and say, "By God,

01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:48.970
I don't agree with you at all
on that issue of politics."

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:53.250
And he served two presidents
-- a Democrat and a Republican.

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:56.540
I loved it when Bush appointed
him and Norm said, "Look,

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:00.210
if you're looking for a token
Japanese guy to go out and campaign

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:04.110
for the Republican Party,
you've got the wrong guy."

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:06.690
And Bush said, "I want you."

01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:11.580
And his loyalty to Bush and Bush's
toward him, you don't find that.

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.460
You don't find people
who invite other people.

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.400
Reagan made the White
House a social center.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.700
And Clinton was the same way.

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.260
They loved people.

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.560
But when you don't love people,

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.610
never invite the other
guy over to your shop.

01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:26.290
You're paying a dear price.

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:28.550
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Secretary
Mineta, you get the last word

01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:33.100
on whether politics ever
affect that friendship.

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:37.270
And on a broader scale, too, you've
lived and worked in Washington

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:40.990
through Republican and Democratic
administrations, Republican

01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:44.940
and Democratic control of
the House and the Senate.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.250
&gt;&gt; Norman Mineta: Not really.

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:52.500
I suppose the closest
I got to thinking

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.880
that he had gotten off the
horse -- the wrong horse --

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:02.590
was during the Justice
Thomas hearings.

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:04.380
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Clarence
Thomas hearings.

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:08.300
&gt;&gt; Alan Simpson: He did
have a comment on that.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:14.750
Wasn't nasty, but I
voiced my opinion.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.510
And he told me to --

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:23.080
[ Laughter ]

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.640
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Gentlemen,
what a treat for all of us.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:42.340
Thank you, Senator Alan
Simpson, Secretary Norman Mineta,

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:47.270
and for the kind of perspective you
have shared not only with friends

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:50.750
and neighbors in Washington but the
kind of perspective you have shown

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:52.610
to students who in Daniel Inouye's
institute are the positive forces

01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:53.910
that we all hope will be taking

01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:55.210
over when we get past 84,
all the way to 86 or 90.

01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:57.010
Thank you all very much for coming.

01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:05.020
[ Applause ]

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.320
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
And thank you, Anne,

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.680
for a wonderful job in moderating.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:13.130
The Kluge Center and the Inouye
Institute will be putting forth

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:16.070
three more programs in this
series in the coming years.

01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:19.720
So please watch for
the announcements.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.180
We invite you to stay in touch
with us via social media or email

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:27.330
to learn more about the activities
of the Kluge Center and the Library

01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:31.500
of Congress in general and
of the Inouye Institute.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.650
A video of this event will
be posted on our website

01:15:34.650 --> 01:15:37.340
and the institute website
in the weeks ahead.

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.520
Thank you, again, for your
attendance this evening.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.510
And once again, let's give a round
of applause for our [inaudible].

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:46.450
[ Applause ]

01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:50.110

of the Library of Congress.
