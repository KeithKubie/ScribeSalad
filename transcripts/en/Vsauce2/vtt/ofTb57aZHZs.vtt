00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:02.460
Vsauce!

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.840
Kevin here.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.240
I’ve got 23 babies.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.840
Which means there’s a 50% chance one of
them can hack one of the others and replace

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.400
their DNA.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.460
Wait.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.449
Humans can’t hack each other.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:21.619
Yet.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.150
But computers can and luckily for us, it turns
out that the fine folks at BitDefender are

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.999
big fans of Vsauce2.

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:33.260
And I’ll get into the ways Bitdefender is
a great solution for protecting your devices,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.730
like… that open wifi connections aren’t
safe, but why exactly?

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.100
And how can you get hacked for connecting
to public, unsecured wifi?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.000
But first, what do hacking and babies have
in common?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.870
Birthdays.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.870
Let me explain.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.410
Each one of these babies has a random birthday,
meaning that they each have the same chance

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.910
of having been born on any 1 of the 365 days
in a year.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.140
So, what are the odds that two of them share
the same birthday?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.360
We’ll keep it simple: no twins, no leap
years, no patterns that suggested parents

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.410
made their babies at non-random, specific
times.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.170
The odds aren’t 23 out of 365, which would
be about 6%.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.220
The odds are actually 50%.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:38.350
There’s a 50% chance that out of 23 random
people, 2 have the same exact birthday.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.810
Which seems impossible given that we’ve
got so few babies and so many possible birthdays.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.700
And if we have just 50 babies, the odds of
a birthday match jump up to 97%.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.560
At 75, it’s 99.97%, making it a virtual
certainty that when you get 75 babies together

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.390
-- or 75 things with birthdays, they don’t
have to be babies -- two of them will share

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.640
a birthday.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.270
The Birthday Paradox is a veridical paradox.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.920
It’s surprising and absurd-sounding, but
we have the math to prove it’s true.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.700
How is it possible that so few babies can
have such a high chance of sharing a birthday?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.350
And how is it that despite 365 possibilities,
we only need a sixth of that number to be

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.520
pretty sure there’s a match?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.550
The easiest way to do this isn’t to -- excuse
me, babies.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.160
Babies… aw, jeez.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.560
Awww, jeez.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.210
Babies… erasing babies!

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.210
Alright, that’s not good.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.240
The easiest way to do this isn’t to calculate
the probability that two of any number of

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.010
babies share the same birthday; it’s to
calculate the probability that they don’t.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.210
To do that, we assume that Baby #1 has been
born.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:15.360
So, the probability of this baby having a
birthday is 1, or 365/365.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.440
Then we multiply that by Baby #2’s probability
of not sharing that birthday: 364/365.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.950
We multiply that result by Baby #3’s probability
of not sharing a birthday with either Baby

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:38.569
#1 or Baby #2, which is 363/365… and we
keep doing this for as many babies as we want

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.250
to calculate the odds for.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.290
At Baby #23, we’re multiplying by 343/365.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.540
To simplify this calculation we can write
it as -- 364! Factorial -- we’ll start with

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.930
364 because 365 over 365 is just 1, over 342!

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:09.880
Because 365 minus our 23 babies gives us 342,
times 365 days out of the year raised to the

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.269
22nd power which is our 23 babies minus baby
one again.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.830
-- and the result of the whole equation gives
us .492703, or about 49.3%.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.949
Again, that’s the probability we don’t
have a birthday match with 23 babies, so we

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:41.800
subtract this from 1 to find the chance that
we do, which is 0.507297, which is about 50.7%.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.020
The trick here is that every baby is being
evaluated against each other; I actually broke

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.809
my pen trying to make all these evaluation
lines.

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:59.360
it’s not whether Babies #2 through #23 share
a birthday just with Baby #1 -- to have a

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.620
50% match with a single, pre-defined birthday,
like a 50% chance of finding a match with

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:13.650
Baby #5’s specific birthday, we’d need
a pool of 253 babies -- which sounds about

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.259
right and isn’t particularly surprising.

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:22.689
This is whether any two babies share any birthday
with one another.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:31.699
The high probability, 50%, with a low baby
count, 23, is surprising, but the math works.

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.849
And if we keep extending the series and the
results show that with 100 babies -- fewer

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.199
than a third of the possible birthdays in
a given year -- the chances of a match are

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:53.009
99.99997%, which means the chances of NOT
having a birthday overlap would be just .00003%,

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.819
or 3 in 10 million.

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.369
If we replace our birthday babies with online
passwords, we’ve got the basis for a type

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:03.659
of hack known as the Birthday Attack.

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.099
When you make a password for a website, that
password is crunched into a fixed-length hash

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.539
value that stores and identifies the combination
of characters you input.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:25.860
So like, “12345” becomes, “827ccb0eea8a706c4c34a16891f84e7b.”

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.189
Simple.

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:36.840
When the MD5 message-digest algorithm was
a standard for encryption, its 128-bit, 32-hexadecimal

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.669
hashes were vulnerable to a hack based on
my babies.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:49.039
The goal was to find and force a collision
-- when two hashes have the same exact value

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.479
regardless of what that value is.

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:58.710
So like if Vsauce2.doc and Kevin.doc had the
same hash value I could change information

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:06.819
in one and affect the other or I could eventually
use collisions like this to decode the encryption

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:11.340
algorithm itself and learn how it works.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.529
And the best way to do that wasn’t a trial-and-error,
or “brute force” attempt to guess a specific

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:22.860
match in the 3.4 × 10^38 possible outcomes
in a 128-bit hash.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.960
It was putting the Birthday Paradox to use.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.330
Hackers developed an algorithm based on the
math of the birthday paradox to more quickly

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:38.159
cause hash collisions and ultimately crack
one of the most widely-used cryptographic

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:40.719
algorithms of its time.

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:48.999
So, probability surrounding birthdays helped
lead to the improvement of internet security.

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:56.409
And right now online, as long as 70 people
are watching this video at the same time,

00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:06.020
there’s a 99.9% chance two of you blow out
birthday candles on the same day of the year.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.289
So… when were you born?

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:17.559
And as always -- thanks for watching.

00:08:17.559 --> 00:08:18.559
Okay now.

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:22.259
Here’s how you can get hacked by connecting
to open wifi.

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:27.419
Whenever you connect to a WIFI network, your
phone or laptop will remember it and then

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:30.099
automatically connect to it when in range.

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:34.279
Now, if you only connected to secured WIFI
networks, you’re fine.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:40.169
If, however, you connected to just one open
WIFI in your device’s history, an attacker

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.620
will have an easy time hijacking your device.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:49.470
All WIFI enabled devices, when not connected,
constantly broadcast their known WIFI access

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.470
point list.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.740
Basically, they keep shouting “is Starbucks
here?” “is McDonalds here?” is “the

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.889
Airport here?” and so on.

00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:03.529
Attackers can listen for these broadcasts
and once they see their target asking for

00:09:03.529 --> 00:09:08.500
something that looks like an open WIFI they
just create a new one with that same name.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.790
All the devices that have that name in their
memory will then automatically connect to

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.220
the attacker’s imposter wifi.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.829
And once you’re connected to their wifi,
the attackers are inside your device.

00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:22.410
So first of all, don’t do that to other
people.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.130
Don’t be an attacker.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:29.529
And second of all, stop cyber attacks before
they begin by protecting all of your privacy,
