00:00:02.236 --> 00:00:03.504
- WELCOME TO BRICKLEBERRY PARK

00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:06.707
AND THE 2013 RANGER GAMES.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:13.013
- AAH!

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.047
- [grunts]

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.382
crowd: OOH.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:21.421
[cheers and applause]

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:24.791
- WELL, WELL.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.827
IF IT ISN'T WOODY JOHNSON.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.295
I GUESS THEY'LL LET
ANY PSYCHOPATH

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.264
BACK IN THE RANGER GAMES
THESE DAYS.

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:31.398
[laughs]

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.534
- RADCLIFF,
I WILL RIP THE HEAD OFF

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.235
YOUR MOTHER'S ROTTEN CORPSE

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.970
AND MAKE HER GO DOWN
ON HERSELF.

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.873
HEY, WHO YOU CALLIN'
A PSYCHOPATH?

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.477
- OH, MAN, I'M MISSIN'
THE OPENING CEREMONIES.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.978
WE GOTTA GET
THIS TRAINING STARTED.

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:47.347
WHAT'S FIRST?
- IRON MY LAUNDRY, BITCH.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.416
- WHAT? HOW IS THAT
GONNA HELP ME ICE SKATE?

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.619
- HOW DARE YOU QUESTION
"CRISP SHIRT" CARRUTHERS?

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:55.122
NOW LET'S START
THE TRAINING MONTAGE.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.125
THEY DON'T CALL ME "BREAKING
THE FOURTH WALL" CARRUTHERS

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.493
FOR NOTHING.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.094
MOP THAT FLOOR.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.931
CUT THAT SANDWICH.

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:06.733
WIPE MY ASS.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:10.804
- I'M STILL NOT SURE
HOW BRINGING YOU

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:13.106
A KEG OF COLT 45
IS TRAINING TO BE--

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.076
WHAT?

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.277
I'VE BEEN DOING
ALL THESE CHORES

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.079
JUST TO SET UP
SOME STUPID PARTY?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.414
I KNEW THAT WASN'T TRAINING.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.583
- YOU'RE RIGHT, SON,
THAT WASN'T TRAINING.

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:24.618
THIS IS.
- GETTIN' DRUNK?

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.354
- MY SECRET TO SKATING
LIKE A STEED ON SPEED

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:31.124
IS TO DO IT WHILE [bleep] UP
AND LIQUOR AND WEED.

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:34.094
- IF IT RHYMES,
IT'S GOTTA BE TRUE.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.562
[rustling]

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:39.199
- WHAT IS IT, BOY?

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:40.534
- [growls]

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:44.104
[both grunting]

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.405
- OH, NO.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.241
THAT'S NOT ONE OF YOUR
REGULAR SCABS, BUDDY.

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:48.775
THAT STRAY HOBO BIT YOU.

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:50.744
- OH, NO.
OH, GOD, NO.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.279
BITTEN BY A RABID HOBO--

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.381
SON, I'M AFRAID WE'LL
HAVE TO PUT YOUR PET DOWN.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:57.217
BUT DON'T WORRY.
IT'LL BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL.

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:59.586
- NO!
- WELL, OKAY.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.722
BUT IF HE SHOWS ANY SIGN,
YOU'LL HAVE TO FOLLOW

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:03.757
THE AMERICAN MEDICAL
ASSOCIATION'S GUIDELINES

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.793
AND "CAP THAT CRACKER
IN HIS MOTHER[bleep] DOME."

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:11.365
[all cheering]

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:16.870
[puma growling]

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.606
[puma growls]

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.142
- NOW TAKING THE ICE
FOR TEAM BRICKLEBERRY,

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:25.179
DENZEL JACKSON.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.618
- WHOO!

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:32.653
[beatboxing]

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:33.921
[giggles]

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:37.958
[beatboxing]

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.494
[vomits]

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.829
I HOPE I MADE YOU PROUD,
MR. CARRUTHERS.

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:45.098
- MR. CARRUTHERS?
WHY, HE DIED IN 1998.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.266
THIS IS SILLY WILLIE.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.303
HE HAS SEVERE LATE STAGE
ALZHEIMER'S. VERY SAD.

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.505
- THEY DON'T CALL ME
"WHERE THE [bleep] AM I?" WILLIE

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.173
FOR NOTHING.

00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:57.211
- NOW, FOR OUR FINAL EVENT--
FOREST GYMNASTICS.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.746
- HA! LOOK AT 'EM, MAGNUS.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.415
YOU'VE GOT RADCLIFF
SO SCARED,

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:03.851
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE SOMEONE
TO GO UP AGAINST YOU.

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:07.487
THE GOLDEN ACORN
IS AS GOOD AS OURS.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:10.324
[laughs maniacally]

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:12.526
- YOU GUYS, I'M REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT STEVE.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.161
I CAN'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.096
- COMPETING FOR
TEAM BRICKLEBERRY,

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.068
THE SWISS FIST...
MAGNUS BLICKENSDERFER.

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:22.970
[cheers and applause]

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.705
AND FOR TEAM YELLOWSTONE,

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:29.676
THE RANGER OF DANGER
STEVE WILLIAMS.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.378
- WHAT'S UP, BITCHES?

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.547
[all groaning]

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.350
- [gasps] STEVE,
WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOURSELF?

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.818
- I TOOK A SHIT-TON
OF STEROIDS,

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:38.919
LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:40.687
- I NEVER TOLD YOU
TO DO THAT.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:41.788
- YOU IMPLIED IT.

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:43.657
AND NOW LOOK AT THE STEVE--

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.758
HE'S RIPPED!

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.093
- DID YOU WORK OUT AT ALL?

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:47.227
- YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT?

00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:49.429
WHAT THE HELL GOOD
ARE STEROIDS THEN?
