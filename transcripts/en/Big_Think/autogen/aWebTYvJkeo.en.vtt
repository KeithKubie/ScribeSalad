the world is becoming more and more an
 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.320
the world is becoming more and more an
urban place today there's 50% of the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
urban place today there's 50% of the
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.310
urban place today there's 50% of the
world's population living in urban areas

world's population living in urban areas
 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.140
world's population living in urban areas

our expectation is that 70% of the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
our expectation is that 70% of the
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.970

world's population will be living in
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.189
world's population will be living in
urban areas and I think the challenge

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
urban areas and I think the challenge
 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920
urban areas and I think the challenge
for all of us is to use this

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
for all of us is to use this
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.929
for all of us is to use this
urbanization as an opportunity to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
urbanization as an opportunity to
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000
urbanization as an opportunity to
address some of the real challenges that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010
address some of the real challenges that
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.859
address some of the real challenges that
the world faces economic challenges

some ways they have the potential to
expand if we don't get ahead of them I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489
expand if we don't get ahead of them I
 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270

think historically we have assumed that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
think historically we have assumed that
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.970
think historically we have assumed that
we can leave this all these challenges

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
we can leave this all these challenges
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.529
we can leave this all these challenges
to the government to solve these

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
to the government to solve these
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.959

doesn't need to get involved and I think

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
doesn't need to get involved and I think
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.639
doesn't need to get involved and I think
that's just no longer the case I think

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
that's just no longer the case I think
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189
that's just no longer the case I think

business has to step up has to play a
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.590
business has to step up has to play a
much more active role not to replace the

of the solution I mean the reality now

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
of the solution I mean the reality now
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.490
of the solution I mean the reality now
is government is able to do a lot less

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
is government is able to do a lot less
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.890
is government is able to do a lot less
they don't have the resources in many

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
they don't have the resources in many
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530
they don't have the resources in many
ways they don't have the collaboration

ways they don't have the collaboration
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.240
ways they don't have the collaboration
and what's interesting right now is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
and what's interesting right now is
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.210
and what's interesting right now is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.030
about but you're actually seeing the
kind of collaboration between the public

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
kind of collaboration between the public
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.260
