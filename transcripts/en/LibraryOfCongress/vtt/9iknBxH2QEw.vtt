&gt;&gt; Christina Barron:
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.040
Welcome to the National
Book Festival.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.080
My name is Christina Barron.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.380
I'm the KidsPost editor
at the Washington Post,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.130
one of the charter
sponsors of this event.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.160
I want to thank Festival
co-chairman, David Rubenstein,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.170
and the other generous sponsors

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.920
who have made this
event possible.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.370
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.850
please note the information
in the program.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.360
We may have time
for a few questions

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.380
at the end of this presentation.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.120
I've been asked to remind
you that if you come

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.470
up to the microphones
here, you will be included

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.910
in the videotape of this event,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.100
which may be broadcast
at a later date.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.600
Now, I'd like to welcome
Katherine Applegate back

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.170
to the book festival.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.620
She was here in 2013, which
was a very big year for her.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.380
Katherine won the Newbery
Medal, the top prize

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.560
in children's literature
that year,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.510
for "The One and Only Ivan."

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.000
[ Applause ]

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.400
It was a novel based on
a real silverback gorilla

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.660
who spent 27 years
confined to a shopping mall.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.100
She let Ivan narrate the story

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.750
and helped readers consider
what an animal might think

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.370
about its own captivity.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.480
The book has captivated
millions of kids and adults,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.970
not by preaching about cruelty,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.260
but by creating a
story that's also

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.140
about unexpected friendships,
courage, and self-discovery.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.460
Since then, Katherine has
woven other important issues

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.320
into compelling stories
with unusual characters.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.860
She tackled homelessness with
the help of an oversized,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.090
imaginary cat in "Crenshaw."

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.690
A gentle, red oak was
at the center of a story

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.500
about racism in "Wishtree."

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.500
And this year came the
first book in a trilogy

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.360
about a species so
close to extinction

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.590
that it's believed
there's only one left.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.060
In "Endling: The Last," we meet
Byx, an animal called a dairne.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.040
Dairnes look like dogs,
but they stand upright,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.690
have fingers, and a pouch.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.360
They can talk and glide
like flying squirrels.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.880
Pretty cool, right?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.780
But dairnes aren't the only
species Katherine dreamed

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.580
up for Endling.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.530
When the book landed on my
desk, I saw this adorable,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.510
big-eared creature on the cover,
you probably can't see it,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.970
and thought it has huge
ears, thought was it that.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.330
And as I dove into the
world of dairnes, wobbyxs,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.500
and other fascinating animals,
I realized Katherine had created

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.380
yet another story that would
enthrall, as well as educate.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.580
I happily included it in
this year's KidsPost summer

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.010
book club.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.400
I look forward to finding out
where the story goes from here.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.810
"Endling: The First" will be out
next spring and the final book,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.910
"Endling: The Only," in 2020.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.810
I'm delighted Katherine is here
to share more about Endling.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.510
Please welcome Katherine
Applegate.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:29.720
[ Applause ]

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.220
&gt;&gt; Katherine Applegate:
I'm so excited to be here.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.400
I used to live in
Alexandria and Annapolis.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.930
And I have family
all over Virginia.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.740
So it's kind of like
coming home.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.030
The humidity, immediately,
I knew what I was getting

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.300
into because I live
in California now,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.390
and we don't have humidity.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.610
We have earthquakes,
mudslides, and fires instead.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.950
But it's so cool
to see all of you.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.160
And I'm really excited, and
I'm going to talk really fast

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.040
because I have a
lot to show you.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.510
I'm going to start by
telling you a secret.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.060
Now when I do this at schools,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.170
I ask the adults to
cover their ears.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.310
And invariably, I get maybe
50% compliance because,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.990
you know, teachers.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.010
But I'm going to try it here.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.950
Okay. Grown-ups,
cover your ears.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.430
Kids, here we go.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.960
This is my terrible secret.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.130
When I was your age, I really,
really, really hated to read.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.770
And I know I'm not
supposed to say that.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.420
And most of the writers
you're going to talk to or see

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.530
or have sign your books,
they loved reading.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.870
I mean, they were reading in
the womb, and they reading

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.930
with a flashlight
under the covers.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.570
They love, love,
love, love to read.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.570
I just kind of thought
it was boring.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.670
And now I have a
daughter who has dyslexia,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.320
which makes it very
challenging to read.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.510
Although, with good teachers,
you can really overcome it.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.650
But that wasn't my problem.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.460
I just kind of didn't
get the point.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.910
And then, I found my book.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.450
And some of you may
have read this book,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.380
and you may think it's
your book, but no,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.640
this book is my book,
"Charlotte's Web."

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.540
And for me, that was
lightning going off.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.020
That was doors opening.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.660
It was everything I ever wanted.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.220
It was a perfect book.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.820
It was a perfect book for me.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.490
But you know what?

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.620
There may not be a lot

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.280
"Charlotte's Web"
enthusiasm in your soul.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.370
You may be somebody who
loves graphic novels,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.670
or maybe you love nonfiction,
or maybe you love poetry.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.970
It doesn't matter.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.120
There's a book out there
that is going to be

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.780
like your very best friend
in the whole wide world,

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.900
like it was written just
for you and you and you.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.510
And when you find it, you
are going to be a happy --

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:32.650
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.120
Wow. So you made the cut.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.010
Way to go!

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.750
I guess they're saying there
are so many people here today.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.070
That is really amazing.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.520
I love seeing that
many booklovers

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.840
in one giant place like this.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.580
And I wasn't always
a book lover,

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.280
nor was I always a reader.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.320
This is my official
author photo.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.020
You will notice I am, in fact,
wearing pajamas and surrounded

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.650
by tons of -- That's
not toilet paper.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.510
That's crumpled paper.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.250
And the reason is I
always show this to kids

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.130
because I want you
to know one thing.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.990
This is the only thing you
have to remember, okay.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.390
Writing is about
making mistakes.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.110
So when you try to write your
stories, be prepared to fail.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.240
You are going to
fail magnificently,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.500
and you're going to
fail a lot, okay.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.020
It's about making mistakes.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.110
It turns out, interestingly
enough,

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.030
life is about making
mistakes, too.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.320
It took me a while
to figure that out.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.790
But it's fun once you
realize that if you write,

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.340
you are going to rewrite.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.640
Now I realized something.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.730
Tell me, somebody, does
that cat look happy to you,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.030
just out of curiosity?

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.580
Wouldn't you say made?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.410
I looked all over the
Internet for a mad picture.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.960
And somehow, to me, this
was perfect, a wet cat.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.120
I write better books
when I'm made.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.190
And it took me a
while to realize that.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.490
I've written a lot of books.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.420
I mean, I wrote Disney books

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:14.130
and Little Mermaid 17 Sweet
Valley Twins for certain people

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.550
of a certain age
in this audience.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.220
Yes. Thank you, Jessica,
Elizabeth.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:26.690
And I found that when I was
mad, I wrote better books.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.270
I wrote "Home of
the Brave," which is

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.810
about a Sudanese refugee
who comes to our country,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.890
because I was mad
about the way refugees

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.440
and immigrants were
being treated.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.950
I think it's an amazing
thing to come to this country

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.340
and start from scratch.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.150
I think it's an amazingly
brave thing.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.740
I write -- I like you guys.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:52.430
I wrote Ivan because I was
mad about this little guy.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.360
That's Ivan on the left
and Burma, his twin sister,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.090
on the right, plucked from
the Democratic Republic

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:03.870
of the Congo, shipped off to, of
all places, Tacoma, Washington.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.170
The very top there where
it says world famous,

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.990
that's a picture of Ivan.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.450
Ivan lived for 27
years in a mall alone

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.090
because his sister died
almost immediately.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.540
And that story just freaked
me out and made me mad,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.970
and I thought nobody on Earth
is going to want to read a book

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.650
from the point of view of
a gorilla, but I'm going

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.860
to tell it anyway
because I'm mad.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.790
I wrote "Crenshaw" because I was
upset about the fact that one

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.630
in five kids in our
country hungry sometimes.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.310
And it's very much a book
about hunger and homelessness,

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.980
but it's also about a
great big invisible cat

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.920
because I just thought
that'd be really cool.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.510
Also, if you haven't seen,

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.850
there's an old Jimmy
Stewart movie called Harvey,

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.120
which was the catalyst for this.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.690
It's absolutely where
I got the idea.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.800
It's very old and very black
and white, but it's hilarious.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.790
And that's where I got
the idea for "Crenshaw."

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.460
I wrote "Wishtree" during
the throes of the election.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.640
And there was a whole lot
of red and gluing going on

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.440
and a whole lot of meanness
and a whole lot of vitriol

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.000
and a whole lot of othering
of entire groups of people.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.390
And I was so mad that I
wrote this book really fast

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.690
and with great ferocity,
although it's a very,

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.930
very gentle book because I
wanted it to be for young,

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:29.950
young kids so they could
understand what racism is about,

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.020
what unkindness was about.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.690
So I decided to tell it from
the point of view of a red oak,

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.980
a POV I had never attempted,
had some difficulties

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.880
because it turns out, trees
don't move around a whole lot.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.460
So that assemblage of
animals helped out.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.240
And it really helped
me because I wrote

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.640
about a little girl named
Samara, Muslim girl,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.420
who moves in next to this tree,
and someone carves the word

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.640
"leave," l-e-a-v-e,
into red spark.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.140
It's a hate crime.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.880
And the tree decides to
do something about it.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.360
So what I've discovered is
that books build bridges.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.810
And how does that happen?

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.300
It happens because we're
in somebody else's head

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.920
or maybe some tree's head
or some guerrilla's head.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.150
And all of a sudden, you're
thinking in a different way,

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.740
and we call that empathy,
which is just a very fancy way

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.460
of saying imagining
with your heart.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.620
After I wrote "Home of
the Brave," some kids

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.020
in Massachusetts
experienced empathy,

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.310
imagined with their hearts,
and raised enough money

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.330
for this young man,
whose name is Qual,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.600
to go back to Sudan
and find his brother.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.900
He was a lost boy.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:52.940
After I wrote "Crenshaw" or Ivan
rather, hundreds of schools,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.940
I mean, this is really
impressive,

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.360
have adopted gorillas
through various programs

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:04.270
like the Dian Fossey fund and
sponsored this incredibly rare

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.170
and vanishing species.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:11.390
Another side benefit of
having written Ivan is

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.900
that it's turning into a movie.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.860
And it should be out I think,
don't quote me, next summer.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.500
I went to London recently and
got to watch them filming it.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.600
It has the coolest cast.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.270
It's going to be CG
live-action hybrid.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.000
So Angelina Jolie is in
it and Bryan Cranston.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.320
Helen Mirren plays a poodle.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.420
Danny DeVito plays Bob the dog.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.810
It's just the coolest thing.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:43.150
And that would never have
happened had I not written

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.450
the book.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.750
That little girl, you
may recognize her.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.570
She was in a Disney show
called Stuck in the Middle.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.950
Her name's Ariana Greenblatt.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.420
And she is playing Julia.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.090
After I wrote "Crenshaw,"
there were lots and lots

00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:00.730
of nationwide food drives and
were continuing to do that,

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.290
and that has been
credibly gratifying.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.210
Excuse me, water.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:17.400
I also have rediscovered my
allergies since returning here.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.760
Excuse me.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.710
I shall talk quietly.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:26.790
I'm I wrote "Wishtree," people
started making wish trees.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.260
Wish trees are actually
very common.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.770
They're all over the world.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:34.070
You'd tie your wishes
onto the branches.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.580
So this is an outdoor version.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.980
This is an indoor version.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.350
This is just magnificent.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.900
But they're all beautiful.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.840
And people put their
wishes on them.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.030
I love this one: I wish there
would be no more bullying

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.330
in the world.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.490
And this one: I wish that
hugs could solve everything.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.640
I think we all wish that.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.940
But this is one of my favorites.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.650
This was an adult.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.700
She was at a book convention.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.150
You guys are all going to be
making this same wish by the end

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.450
of the day I guarantee you.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.410
So when I talk to kids, I
often have them make a wish

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.850
for themselves and a
wish for someone else

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.020
and a wish for the world.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:18.520
And it helps you think about
other people in a whole new way.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.820
By the way, I'm going

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.170
to be signing later,
I think 3:30 to 4:30.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.040
And I have these, I
have about a hundred

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.540
of them, these window clings.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.140
They're beautiful.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.440
They look like that.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.120
And you can put them on your
school window or wherever.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.020
And I'm happy to give them away.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.970
So feel free to grab one.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.330
So that brings me to Endling.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.150
And I wrote Endling because
I was mad about this.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.480
Endling is not a word you'll
yet find in most dictionaries.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.460
A couple are starting to use it.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.890
It was recently employed
because we are seeing what a lot

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.150
of people are calling the
sixth great extinction.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.550
We are losing massive
quantities of species.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:05.830
And this time, it
appears to be man-made.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.130
Sorry.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.060
Okay. It appears to be man-made.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:21.220
And endling is a word that
refers to the last animal.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.970
Oh, gah, this is
going to be good, huh?

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.200
I've never done this before.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.450
It's really weird.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:39.850
It refers to the last animal, or
it could be any kind of species,

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.550
but it's the very last
individual in a species.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.440
And we have a lot of
those, unfortunately.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.490
Now I had written
fantasy before,

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:55.020
including a series
called Animorphs,

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.010
which has like 63 books, with
my husband, Michael Grant.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:04.660
And we created some really
weird species, including yeerks.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.690
They're little slugs that climb
into your ear and kind of eat

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.300
out brain and take over.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.090
So I knew all about
making species.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.930
But I decided with Endling,

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.690
I was going to do
something really interesting.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.440
I love dogs.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.720
So I decided to create
the perfect dog.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.190
The perfect dog is Byx.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.990
Byx is a dairne,
sort of a Labrador.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.540
She can walk upright.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.900
She has a pouch because,
you know,

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.480
it's easier than
having a backpack.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.760
She walks, has fingers,
opposable thumbs,

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.920
very useful in an adventure.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.950
And she can glide like
a flying squirrel.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.050
I created Tobble
who was a wobbyx.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.670
I used a fennec fox.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.970
Have you ever seen a fennec fox?

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.660
They are so adorable.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.630
Only I made her bigger,
made him bigger.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:17:00.200
Giant ears, blue-gray fur,
really cute, great big eyes,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.370
and incredibly feisty
when needs be.

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:11.890
Now a lot of times when
I do school visits --

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.920
A lot of times when
I do school visits --

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.900
You're just going
to have to come back

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.200
in an hour [inaudible].

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.500
Geez Louise.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.980
Cough drop may be good.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.240
A lot of times what I do
is I have kids make their

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.670
own species.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:38.210
This is so fun because
you can take anything.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.150
Ask yourself, what would
my species look like,

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.610
what would they eat, who
would their enemy be.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.150
It's really fun.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.450
Do they have giant ears?

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.750
Can they fly?

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.050
Can they swim?

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.350
Can they do both?

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.650
Can they talk?

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.950
Do they have a religion?

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.250
Do they have a philosophy?

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.550
It is so much fun.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.320
And a lot of times at schools,

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.420
I'll have kids come
up with three traits.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.280
And they'll tell me, and
they are always the coolest

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.580
of cool species.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.190
You also, of course,
need to make a map.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.780
Where is that going to be?

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.080
Could be anywhere.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.380
Could be on Earth.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.680
Could be a whole
different place.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.980
And unique characters.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.360
I decided to have a couple
humans because what the heck.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.280
They're brave and
they're kind of fun.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.350
I decided to have
interesting home life.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.500
That's a [inaudible] bear hive.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.700
I decided to have
many adventures,

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.900
including giant serpents.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.390
Byx attends her own funeral.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.870
She meets up with giant raptors.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:46.830
And most interesting, I
gave Byx the ability to tell

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.130
when people are lying.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.310
I have a question for you.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.690
If you could have
the ability to tell

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.030
when your friends were lying
to you, would you like that?

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.510
Raise your hand if you
think that's a cool idea.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.520
Pretty good turnout.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.740
Okay. Now, let me ask you this.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.040
If your parents had
the ability to tell

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.550
when you were lying,
would you like that?

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:21.490
No. That is why Byx is both very
valuable and very dangerous.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.030
Now I talked about being
mad like a wet cat.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.430
Well, endangered
animals make me mad.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.610
And here are just a few of
them: tigers, whooping cranes,

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:39.080
blue whale, Asian elephants,
sea otter, orangutans, gorillas,

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.770
Eastern and Western
gorillas, red wolf.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.070
So what can you do?

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.290
Well, a lot of things,
and some of it starts

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.070
with politics when
you get older.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.700
But meantime, some of it has
to do with climate change.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.180
There are a whole lot of
reasons we're losing animals.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.010
And one of the things you can
do is turn off your lights.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.570
You can recycle.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.220
You can pick up trash.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.670
You can unplug electronics.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.230
I'm really bad at that.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.570
You can use both sides of paper.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.520
You can take shorter showers.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.550
You can volunteer
in your community.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.100
I like this one,
become an expert.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.810
Pick a species.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.150
And it doesn't have
to be a cute, cuddly,

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.550
adorable baby mountain gorilla.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.800
It can be anything you want
and become an expert on it.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.520
When you do that, you
see success stories.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.230
Manatees are coming back.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.710
Trumpeter swans are coming back.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.760
Bald eagles are coming back.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.420
So there is hope.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.080
Now, it's your turn
to take over.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.480
I want you guys to get mad.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.710
Think about something
that really makes you mad,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:46.170
build some bridges, and
you become our next heroes.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.890
Now we have time for
just a few questions

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.880
because I busy choking.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.180
Sorry about that.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.480
Does anybody want
to ask anything?

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.230
It can be about anything.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:21:00.590
I try to pretend I'm a gorilla
expert, but I'm really not.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.890
Yeah.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.850
Technology.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.750
It's wonderful when it works.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.050
You want to yell?

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.350
You could just yell.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.550
&gt;&gt; What made you
want to write Ivan?

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.020
&gt;&gt; Katherine Applegate:
You know what?

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:51.050
I saw that story, and I was
made, but I was also fascinated.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:54.560
How would a gorilla
survive living as a human?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.860
And he did.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.450
Do you know he lived
in a kid's house,

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.380
slept with a 10-year-old
boy for about two years?

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.240
And he would open the
refrigerator and watch TV,

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.850
and he liked cartoons, and
he ate all kinds of candy.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.260
And they would hold out his
lower lip and pour sodas in.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.040
Ivan lived like a
human for a long time.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.480
And I just thought that
would be a fascinating story.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:25.430
&gt;&gt; Do you have any advice about
writing from the perspective

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.840
of a suffering animal?

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.500
&gt;&gt; Katherine Applegate:
You sound like a writer.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.810
I hope you are.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.200
You know what you do?

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.350
You kind of forget who
you are for a while,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.210
and you do a lot of research.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.060
Research is fun,
and it's a great way

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.090
to procrastinate, by the way.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.960
And you find out everything
you can about the senses

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.540
of that animal and the
needs of that animal.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.050
And that's how you do it.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.350
Sorry.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.590
I think we have time
for about two more.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.160
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm a school librarian

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.490
from Montgomery County,
Maryland.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.320
I just spent my preservice
week building a wish tree

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.620
in the hallway.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.620
Thank you for answering
my Tweet the other day.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.880
And I wanted to tell you that
we're beginning our school year

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.060
with a schoolwide
read-aloud of this book.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.860
And each student will
be creating wishes

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.150
and hopefully turning them into
goals for their school year.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.800
We're going to use it
with our social-emotional

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.100
learning components.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.400
So I just wanted to share that
with you and how excited we are

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.630
to welcome Red and all of
his friends into our school.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.120
&gt;&gt; Katherine Applegate:
That is so lovely.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.120
It's been the kind of book
that people seem to be able

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.520
to connect with at
different levels.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.210
In fact, they're releasing
it as an adult novel.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.540
And what I think is great is
I don't care how young you are

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.470
or how old you are, we all
have things we wish for.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.490
We all have hopes and dreams.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:05.560
And I think Red is just a way
to help us think about that.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.860
So thank you.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.970
You know, that book, no
book would get anywhere

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.320
without school librarians.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.510
You guys are our heroes.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:15.390
[ Applause ]

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.440
Okay. We have one more
minute for one more question.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.360
&gt;&gt; What book do you think
would give the most impact

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.580
on a national perspective?

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:26.880
&gt;&gt; Katherine Applegate:
Could you, I'm sorry,

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.180
repeat the end of that?

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.480
The most impact?

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.730
&gt;&gt; On a national perspective.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.240
&gt;&gt; Katherine Applegate: Wow.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.540
You mean of mine?

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.140
&gt;&gt; Katherine Applegate: Well,

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.190
I like to think that's
even possible.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:44.180
You know, I think every
book is different.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.530
So a book that might
matter to a whole bunch

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.290
of people is wonderful.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.670
But if one person, I don't
know, "Home of the Brave"

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.770
and it meant something to them.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.700
I had a woman write
-- She's a woman now.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.940
She was a girl when she came
over as an African refugee.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.590
And her letter was
short and sweet.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.170
And it said, you wrote my life.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.360
And that, to me, you know --
If she had been the only person

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.820
who ever read that book,
that would have been enough.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.120
So thank you all so much.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.370
What a glorious audience.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:17.230
You've just been
absolutely wonderful.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.070
Give yourselves a round
of applause [applause].
