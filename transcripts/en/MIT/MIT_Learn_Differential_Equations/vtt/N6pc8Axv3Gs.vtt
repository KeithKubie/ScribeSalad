00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.420
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.740
Two equations, the question of
stability for two equations,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.860
stability around
a critical point.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.820
OK.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.110
So the idea will
be to linearize,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.720
to look very near that
critical point, that point.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.480
But now we're in two dimensions.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.500
So that's a little more to do.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.740
So here's the general picture,
and then here is an example.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.120
So here's the general setup.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.600
We have an equation
for the changes in y.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.540
But z is involved.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.790
And we have an equation for
the rate of change of z.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.120
But y is involved.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.100
So they're coupled together.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.210
It's that coupling
that's going to be new.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.150
So what's a critical point?

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.430
Critical point is when those
right-hand sides are 0.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.550
Because then y and
z are both constant.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.190
So they stay at that point.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.180
Wherever they are at this
critical point is steady state.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.240
They stay steady.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.200
They stay steady.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.110
They stay at that
constant value.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.780
So we want that to be 0.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.400
And we want this to be 0.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.200
We have two
equations, f equals 0,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.240
and g equals 0, two equations.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.070
But we have two
unknowns, y and z.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.280
So we expect some solutions.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.710
And each solution has to
be looked at separately.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.540
Each solution is
a critical point.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.680
It's like well, you could
think of a golf course,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.310
with a surface going up.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.440
So critical points will be
points where the maximum point

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.060
maybe, or the minimum
point, or we'll

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.750
see something called
a saddle point.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.190
Actually, let's do the example.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.190
The example is a famous one.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.590
Predator-prey it's known as.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.140
Predator like foxes,
prey like rabbits.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.710
So the foxes eat the rabbits.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.630
And the question is, what
are the steady states where

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.900
foxes' and rabbits'
constant values could stay?

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.900
So here this is the equation
for what happens to the prey.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.860
So if the rabbits are left
alone, the prey is the rabbits.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.440
If they're left alone they
multiply, plenty of grass.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.790
Go for it.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.340
But if there are foxes, and
z counts the number of foxes,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.000
then foxes eat, shall
I say, those rabbits.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.110
And we lose rabbits.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.580
So we see that
with a minus sign.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.340
And the amount of
preying that goes on

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.450
is proportional to
the number of foxes

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.320
times the number of rabbits.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.380
Because that gives the
number of possible meetings.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.220
And what about the
foxes, the predator?

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.360
The predator increases.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.010
So this is from
encountering the rabbits.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.760
That tends to make the
number of predators increase.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.860
But if there were no rabbits,
the foxes don't eat grass.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.640
They're out of luck,
and they decay.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.780
So I see a minus z there.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.480
So you see the pattern?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.760
So starting from 0
and 0, at that point,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.140
so I've defined critical points.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.100
So there's my f.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.830
And that should be 0.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.250
And there is my g,
and that should be 0.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.120
And it turns out there are
just two possibilities.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.245
This is one.

00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:19.450
If y and z are both 0, then
certainly I would get 0's.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.550
So that's like starting with
a very small number of foxes

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.550
and rabbits.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.570
Or if y is 1 and z equal 1,
do you see that that would be,

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.800
they would be in
perfect balance?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.310
If y is 1, and z is 1,
then that's 0 and that's 0.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.010
So the equation is satisfied.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.410
We can stay at-- y can stay
at 1, and z can stay at 1.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.130
It's a steady state.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.060
And the question is, is that
steady state where rabbits

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.860
are staying--
their population is

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.970
staying at 1, because
they're eating grass, good.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.790
But they're getting
eaten by the foxes, bad.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.810
And those two balance, and
give a rate of change of zero.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.410
And the foxes similarly, the
foxes get a positive push

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.290
from eating rabbits.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:31.230
But natural causes
cut them back.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.470
And they balance
at z equal to 1.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.230
OK.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.430
So what I have to
do is linearize.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.870
And that's the real
point of the lecture.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.050
That's the real point
for linear-- how

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.810
do linearize for two functions?

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.940
And how do you linearize
for these two functions?

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.450
So let me-- I have to write
the general formula first,

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.620
so you'll see it.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.250
And then I'll apply it
to those two functions.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.650
OK.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.310
So here is the
idea of linearize.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.520
So I'm linearizing.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:19.640
So my first function is whatever
its value is at this point,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.840
it's like a tangent line.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.920
But now I've got
two derivatives.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.030
Because the function
depends on two variables.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.090
So I have a y minus
capital Y, times now I

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.870
have to do partial derivative.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.880
So that's the slope in the
y direction, multiplied

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.380
by the movement.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:48.870
And then similar term, z minus
capital Z times the movement

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.350
in the z direction.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.540
And I have to,
because I stopped,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.690
this is the linear
part of the function.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.670
I have to put an
approximate symbol.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.560
Because I've ignored
higher derivatives.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.410
And of course this is 0.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.890
So that's why we have
linear in y and linear in z,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.730
times some numbers, the slopes.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.070
But we have two more slopes.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:27.210
Because we have another
function g of y and z.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.390
And that again will
just be approximately

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:38.330
g at the critical point, which
is 0 plus y minus capital Y,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:50.500
times dg dy plus z minus
capital Z times dg dz.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:57.140
So altogether, the linear
stuff and four numbers,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.230
the derivatives of f in
the y and z directions,

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.320
the derivatives of g in
the y and the z directions.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.230
OK.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.380
Now we had an example going.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.110
Let me bring that
example down again.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.000
There was my f.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.060
There was my g.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.780
Can easily find those
partial derivatives.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.390
So let me do it.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:26.810
So the partial derivative with
respect to y will be 1 minus z,

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.080
z held constant for
that partial derivative.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.020
And the partial derivative with
respect to z will be minus y.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.020
Let me write all
those things down.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.370
So here is in the example.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:46.800
So can I create a
little matrix, df dy?

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.860
It's the nice way, if I've
got four things, 2 by 2 matrix

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.080
is great.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:09:03.270
df, dz; that number,
dg, dy; and dg dz.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.370
You could say this is the
first derivative matrix.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.420
It's the matrix of
first derivatives

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.840
and it's always named after
Jacobi who studied these first.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.470
So it's called the
Jacobian matrix.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.470
Maybe I'll put his name to
give him credit, Jacobi.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.283
And the matrix is
the Jacobian matrix.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.380
And its determinant
is important.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.590
It's a very important matrix,
important in economics.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.690
We're doing things--
I'm speaking here

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.850
about predator-prey, little
animals running around.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.370
But serious stuff
is the economy.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.820
Is the economy stable?

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.540
If it's a running along
at some steady state

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.210
and we move it a
little bit, does it

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.340
return to that steady
state, or does it

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.540
get totally out of hand?

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.970
So there is the Jacobian matrix.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.785
And what are those derivatives?

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.630
Remember again, what functions.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:18.720
There's my functions.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.250
So the y derivative
is 1 minus z.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.530
And the z derivative is minus y.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:34.960
The y derivative is z, and
the z derivative is y minus 1.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.730
Is that all right?

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.660
This is what we need to
know from the functions.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.690
I've forgotten the functions
in the board that went up.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.580
Here are their derivatives.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.740
Now that's my Jacobian matrix.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.650
That's my matrix of
the-- that matrix

00:10:53.650 --> 00:11:00.140
has these four coefficients,
those four numbers.

00:11:04.115 --> 00:11:06.480
And really, so
the linearization,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.450
let me call that matrix.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.930
I should call it J for Jacobian.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.120
I will call it J for Jacobian.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.030
OK.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.380
That's the Jacobian matrix.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.680
So then my approximate--
what's my linearized equation?

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:32.750
My linearized equation is the
time derivative of y and z.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.790
So this left-hand side
is just dy dt, and dz dt.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.470
So I'm using vector
notations, putting y

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.210
and z together, instead of
separately, no big deal.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:49.460
So then I have this matrix
J, this 2 by 2 matrix,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:55.450
times you notice here
is a y minus capital Y

00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:06.020
and a z minus capital Z. There
is the linearized problem.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.000
Linearized because
this is constant,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.175
and this is linear, single y,
single z, and we have a matrix

00:12:14.175 --> 00:12:15.840
J.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.130
So I have to find-- so
now my little job is

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.890
find the critical points.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.720
I've got everything ready.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.170
I have to find the
critical points.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.630
Now remember, the critical
points are where f and g are 0.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:36.010
And let me remember
what those are.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.000
So there is the f.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.216
There's the g.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:41.480
One critical point was that one.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.420
Everything is 0.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.610
Another critical
point is that one.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.120
Again, everything is 0.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.380
So I have two critical
points, two Jacobian matrices,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.960
one at the first point,
one at the second point.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.930
So what are those matrices?

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.830
At y and z equals 0, I have
the matrix-- I'll put it here,

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.680
and then I'll copy it.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:10.510
If y and z are 0, I have a 1
and a 0 and a 0 and a minus 1.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.070
I just took y and z to be 0.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.960
That was the first
critical point.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.150
The second critical point
gives me the Jacobian

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.260
at that second point.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.020
The second point
was when z was 1.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.930
So that's 0 now.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.890
And y was 1, so that's minus 1.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.520
z is a 1, y minus 1, y is a 1.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.030
So that's a 0.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.440
That's the second Jacobian.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.070
So we're seeing something
interesting here.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.480
We're seeing how 2
by 2 matrices will

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.120
work by really nice
examples, 1, 0, minus 1.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.090
What's that telling me?

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.000
That's telling me
that the rabbits grow.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.380
Because the rabbits
are the first, the y.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.850
And the foxes decay.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.280
And that's what's happening
when the two populations are

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.650
really small.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.900
When the two populations
are really small,

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.070
multiplying them together
is extremely small.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.510
So when the two populations
are really small,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.150
forget the eating.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.090
There aren't enough
people around, enough

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.120
foxes and rabbits around
to make a decent meal.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.810
So I just have dy dt equal y.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.370
Rabbits are growing
from eating grass.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:37.920
dz dt is minus z, foxes are
decaying from natural causes.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.760
So that's what kind of a
stationary point will 0, 0 be?

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.590
Rabbits are growing.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.520
It's an unstable point.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.400
We're leaving at 0, 0.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.290
Rabbits are increasing.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.890
Now how about the second point?

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.860
The second point was
when they were both 1.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:09.090
when they're both 1, then we
got this as the Jacobian matrix.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.900
Oh, this is the interesting one.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.430
Can I just stay with
this one to finish?

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.140
So I'm interested
in the-- and I'll

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.670
put these facts on a new board.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:26.412
So again, y prime
dy dt is y minus yz.

00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:36.060
z prime is yz, rabbits are
getting eaten, minus z.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:41.250
And I'm interested in the
point y equal 1, z equal 1.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:46.930
And my matrix of this
is the Jacobian matrix.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.690
The Jacobian matrix
had the derivatives,

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.960
which were 1 minus z, minus y.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.590
The y derivative of that is z.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.050
The z derivative is y minus 1.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:05.120
And at this point y and z are 1.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:12.250
So that became 0,
minus 1, 1 and 0.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.510
And what kind of a
problem do I have here?

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:19.460
So my linearized
equation, so linearized,

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:25.930
linearized around the point 1,1.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:35.840
My equation is y
minus 1 prime, sorry.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:44.430
It's the distance to
the critical points.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:52.250
the derivative of y minus
1 is, I see here a minus 1.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:59.270
I see a minus z minus 1.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:03.580
And here a plus y minus 1.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:12.710
You've got to understand this
pair of linearized equations.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:18.420
If I use some other variable,
the derivative of the first guy

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.310
is minus the second.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.945
The derivative of the second
guy is plus the first.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.730
What will happen?

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:38.050
Initially if I'm a little
bit-- if I have extra foxes,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.950
the rabbit population will drop.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.700
The rabbit population--
this will be negative.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.490
If z, the number of foxes,
is a little higher than 1,

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.550
then the rabbit
population drops.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.450
And when the rabbit population
drops, z starts dropping.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.630
As z starts dropping below
1, the rabbit population

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.790
starts increasing.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.630
I get, what shall we
say, sort of exchange

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.440
of rabbits and
foxes, oscillation

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.845
between rabbits and foxes?

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.560
So this is the--
right in the center

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.640
there, that would be the point
where y is 1 and z equal 1,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.980
the critical point.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.250
And if I start out with
some extra rabbits,

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:33.730
then the number of
rabbits will drop.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.630
Because foxes are eating them.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.620
The number of foxes
will increase.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.050
I'll go up.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:46.390
So there I have a little
bit later, I have foxes now,

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.420
but no rabbits to eat.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:55.400
So the foxes start
dropping, and what happens?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.390
I think, yeah.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:03.230
The number of rabbit
starts increasing.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.160
And this is what happens.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.950
I'll go around and
around in a circle.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:16.370
If you remember the pictures of
the paths for 2 by 2 equations,

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.440
there were saddle points.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.050
That's what this is.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:27.240
y equals 0, z equals
0 was a saddle point.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.775
So no, it's a saddle.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.960
And what I'm discovering
now for y equal 1

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.970
is an oscillation between
foxes and rabbits.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:47.960
So again, I could say
it'll be our center that

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.220
was the very special picture
where it didn't spiral out.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.010
It didn't spiral in.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:20:00.360
The special numbers,
the eigenvalues

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:07.290
of that matrix
are-- well, better

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.250
leave eigenvalues
for the future.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.690
Because they happen to
be i and minus i here.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.230
It's motion in a circle.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.710
It comes from this,
the equation here.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:28.060
Motion in a circle as in y
double prime plus y equals 0.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.860
That's motion in a circle.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.620
And that's what we've got.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.550
So this is a center.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.260
Now what about-- do I
call a center stable?

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:43.140
Not quite, because the rabbits
and foxes don't approach 1.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.280
They stay on a circle around 1.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.130
Either I've got extra
rabbits or extra foxes.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:56.930
But the total
energy or the total

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.230
stays a constant on that circle.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:08.730
And I would call that
neutrally neutral.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.260
Neutral stability, because
it doesn't blow up.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.970
I don't leave the area around.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.420
I stay close to
the critical point.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.531
But I don't approach it either.

00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:21.030
OK.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:28.270
So that's a case where we
could see the stability, based

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.300
on the linearization.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:31.920
OK.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.960
One more example to
come in another lecture.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.510
Thanks.
