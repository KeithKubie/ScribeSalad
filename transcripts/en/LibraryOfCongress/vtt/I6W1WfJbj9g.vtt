00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.130
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.280
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: I
want to welcome you

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.890
to the 17th National Book Festival.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.200
It's hard to believe 17, and
I've been around for all of them.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.310
Today we open the fiction
pavilion by following tradition,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.880
with a ceremony bestowing
this year's Library

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.760
of Congress prize in
American fiction.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.880
However, before I start, I
want to recognize Marie Arana.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.230
Marie has made invaluable
contributions to American letters,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.560
both as coordinator of this prize,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.400
and one of the driving forces
behind the National Book Festival.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.720 position:56%
This incredible program that we see
today is with great thanks to Marie.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.270
A gifted and highly praised writer,
and scholar in her own right,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.410
Marie brings passion and a generous
spirit to everything she does,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.600
and it is a real privilege
to work with her.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.510
Marie, will you please stand?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:15.050
[ Applause ]

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.000
So, let me tell you a
little bit about the prize.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.530
It's meant to honor an American
literary writer whose body

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.400
of work is distinguished not
only for its mastery of the art,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.400
but also for its originality
of thought and imagination.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.140
The award seeks to commend
strong, unique, enduring voices

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.810
that throughout long, consistently
accomplished careers have told us

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.990
something about the
American experience.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.740
Previous winners of the prize
include Don DeLilo, E.L. Doctorow,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.500
Louise Erdrich, Toni
Morrison, Philip Roth,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.240
and last year, Marilynne Robinson.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.940
For 2017, the Library of Congress
and its distinguished jury

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.100
of 27 writers and critics

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.190
from around the world selected
Denis Johnson for this honor.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.220
Last March the Librarian
of Congress, Dr. Hayden,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.220
offered the prize to Mr. Johnson,
and he enthusiastically accepted.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.350
It was the last major honor he was

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.110
to receive before his
tragic death on May 24th.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.550
Today we pay homage
to his life and work,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.510
with some very special guests
reading citations from just a few

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.800
of Johnson's fellow
writers and admirers.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.170
First though, let's begin with a
video tribute to our prizewinner.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.550
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: English
words are like prisms, empty.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.200
Nothing inside.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.270
And still, they make rainbows.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.500
So says a character in Already
Dead, a novel by the late,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.160 position:56%
great American writer Denis Johnson.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.990
Johnson's stories, as legions of
his fans know, are also prisms.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.140
They are hard, merciless, flinty,
and yet they too make rainbows.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.980
He has been called a
writer's writer's writer.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.910
And, for all the enigma
of that string of words,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.840
they hold a simple truth.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.780 position:56%
Those who bring language to life
recognize Johnson's gifts instantly.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.170
Louise Erdrich calls his work
profound and transcendent.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.220 position:56%
Jonathan Franzen finds his sentences
miracles of transparency and tone.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.610
Philip Roth calls him daring,
terrifying, and an emissary

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.730
for tortured, broken souls.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.660
Marilynne Robinson marvels that
a writer's personal passions

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.350
and energies can be so
inextricably wedded to his words.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.310
All agree Denis Johnson has
managed to give us minimalist,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.230
yet distinctly ecstatic and
hallucinatory, rainbow prose.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.530
He is an American original.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.240
He was born in 1949 in Munich,
Germany, and raised in Tokyo

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.380
and Manila, the child
of American diplomats.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.170
As a teenager, moving
back to Washington,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.680
D.C. during the tumultuous '60's,
he came to know the country

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.090 position:56%
and the restless characters he would
capture so vividly in his fiction.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.000
He graduated in English literature
from the University of Iowa,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.200
and earned an M.F.A. from
the Iowa Writers Workshop,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.500
where he returned as a teacher.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.490
He has also taught at
Texas State University,

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.890
and the University
of Texas at Austin.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.770
In the course of his fevered
career, he published novels,

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.630
short stories, journalism,
and poetry.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.250
Among his best-known works
are those about the flotsam

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.860
and jetsam of American life.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.730
The Laughing Monsters.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.960
Nobody Move.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.520
Tree of Smoke.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.110
Already Dead.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.640
Jesus' Son.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.380
Resuscitation of a Hanged Man.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.070
The Stars at Noon.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.420
Fiskadoro.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.610
Angels. He's received
numerous award for these,

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.070
including a National Book Award,
a Lannan Fellowship in Fiction,

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.360
a Writing Writers award,
and in 2008,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.550
he was named a finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.090
Throughout he has chronicled
an America

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.720
that has gone unobserved,
unrecorded.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.070
Here are our drug addicts, our
war veterans, our disaffected,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.950
our used up and left behind.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.760
And yet, the most affecting
and rewarding aspect

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.020
of Denis Johnson's fiction
is that in work after work,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.640
he has proved that beauty often
lurks in unexpected places.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.040
That strength can be
found in failure.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.430
That the human spirit is a
fragile, but resilient vessel.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.020
His is a very American story.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.680
He once described his works as
pressure cookers of language.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.130
His characters as those who
inhabit life's perilous edge.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.050
As time wore on, he found that
he himself was all too vulnerable

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.350
to these human frailties.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.710
When the Librarian of Congress,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.990
Carla Hayden offered Denis Johnson
the Library of Congress Prize

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:15.050
for American Fiction in March of
2017, he wrote in an email message,

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.760
"My head is spinning
from such great news."

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.590
Two months later, tragically,
he was dead.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.250
The Library is very proud
to honor, posthumously,

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.940
this extraordinary human being
and writer, whose contributions

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.280
to the American canon have
been lasting and invaluable.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.930
As the Librarian wrote when the
prize was announced in June 2017,

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.000
Denis Johnson was a
writer for our times.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.180
In prose that fused grace with
grit, he spun tale after tale

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.670
about our walking wounded,

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.020
the demons that haunt,
the salvation we seek.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.660
We emerge from his imagined
world with profound empathy,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.360
a different perspective--
a little changed.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.360
We're very proud to count Denis
Johnson among the distinguished

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.510
winners of the Library of Congress
Prize for American Fiction.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.510
[ Music ]

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:14.270
[ Applause ]

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.410
As you can see, he was a
towering figure in letters,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:23.260
and I hope that we send out
the word for more readers

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.050
for Denis Johnson's work.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.750
We received at the Library
of Congress right away,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:38.650
upon Denis' death, pleas,
really from so many writers,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.570
and so many people around the world
who were familiar with his work,

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.300
and who were in publishing or
who were writers themselves,

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.900
wanting to give citations for
this moment, for this ceremony.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.780
So, we are going to read
a few of those citations.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.890
To help me do that, is the
publisher at Random House,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.890
Susan Kamil, who's a great friend.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.690
Let's give her a hand.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:08.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.180
Thank you, Susan, for
coming from New York.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.330
And, also Sam Nicholson,

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:17.510
who was Denis Johnson's
editor, also of Random House.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.340
We'll just start in.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.170
This is from Philip Roth.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.070
"When I was asked to nominate a
writer for this year's Library

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.910
of Congress Prize for American
Fiction, I did so in eight words.

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.320
'My sole nominee is the
great Denis Johnson.'

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.800
Johnson brought news from
the darkest, wildest depths

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.770
of American life, as Mark Twain did
in chapters of Huckleberry Finn,

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.790
and Faulkner in a slew of novels.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:54.080
From the moment I began reading
his terrifying first novel, Angels,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.800
I felt the strength, and his
daring, and recognized his place

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.070
of eminence among those of
brilliant American predecessors

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.650
for whom desperation and
savagery were depicted

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:10.380
with searing originality in a
prose style uniquely evocative

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.810
of the broken souls, each brought
remorselessly into tortured being.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.720
There was no one like him, tracking
the descent of what he called,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.470
in Already Dead, isolated
minds bending

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.350
around tightly, to
feed on themselves."

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.450
&gt;&gt; Susan Kamil: And,
this from Louise Erdrich.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.090
"Denis Johnson's are the
rarest sort of books,

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.370
works of radical human sympathy,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.390
written with cliff-walking
literary genius.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.650
His books involve us in the
implosion of the spirit,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.830
and the fragility of
personal salvation.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.940
Johnson's work lays bare our
faltering human glory and shame.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.240
From the stirring, surreal
incantation that is Train Dreams,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.830
to the meticulous hyperreality
of Tree of Smoke,

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.360
his reach will always be profound.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.320
Although I never had
the chance to meet him,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.090
I mourn Denis Johnson's
loss personally,

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.270
as a reader and fellow writer.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.640
I'm glad he took pleasure in
receiving this grand recognition.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.300
Everyone who reads Denis Johnson
comes away thinking he has spoken

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.520
directly to some wracked and
ragged, yet transcendent,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.950
aspect of their own secret heart.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.660
&gt;&gt; Sam Nicholson: From
Jonathan Franzen.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.300
"You can tell he started as a poet.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.630
His sentences, at their best, are
miracles of transparency and tone.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.110
Perfect in the way
they inhabit the page,

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.230
but devoid of vanity
about their perfection.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.260
Always vivid in their
reference to the actual,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.430
but also always conveying
something larger.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.850
Their creator's own
self-knowledge and compassion,

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.250
and sense of cosmic comedy."

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.800
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And this
from Marilynne Robinson.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.220
"I have never known a writer who
was so identical with his work,

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.150
whose thoughts and passions
and energies were so entirely

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.330
of one substance with the
world he remade as fiction.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.940
The great energy of his
imagination was a fusion of honesty

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.690
and seriousness, pain and laughter.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.460
His life was a thing
of moment and urgency.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.030
Pure and undistracted."

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:33.590
&gt;&gt; Susan Kamil: And
this from Zadie Smith.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.590
"No writer was more admired by
his peers than Denis Johnson.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.410
His thousands of readers
adored him too, of course,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.740
but for writers there was an
added layer of professional awe.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.960
How does one go about writing a
book as luminous as Train Dreams?

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.270 position:56%
How were the stories of Jesus' Son
constructed, with their seamless mix

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.020
of the sacred and profane?

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.030
So much of Denis' fiction
reads like apocrypha

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.300
from some long-suppressed
American bible.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.600
I loved it all.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.400
He worked at a level
different from the rest of us.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.700
A true master."

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.520
&gt;&gt; Sam Nicholson: From
Nathan Englander.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.780 position:56%
"I fell in love with Denis Johnson's
writing in the purest way possible.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.370 position:56%
Someone, I can't remember who, gave
me a Xeroxed copy of the first story

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.470
in Jesus' Son, Car
Crash While Hitchhiking.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.810
If you look at the book, you'll
see Denis Johnson's name is absent

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.110
from the margins.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.020
And, not even the whole
title of the story is there.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.900
So, I read what I thought
was called Car Crash,

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.450
a standalone story by
an anonymous author.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.240
I was instantly blown away.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.610
Deeply moved by it, and then, in
the way good reading makes you feel

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.650
like your connection to it was
faded, I soon ended up with a copy

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.780
of the collection in
which the story appears.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.670
I was living in Iowa City at the
time, and this book, for my friends

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.130
and me, became sort of
a young writers bible.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.340
We marveled at those
stripped-down, honest stories

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.220
that contained all the
bigness of great work.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.730
And, as young writers we
thought, this is the kind

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.840
of thing that could be done.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.770
We took hope away from the
work, is what I'm saying,

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.540
and we found hope inside
those stories as well.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.760
In Car Crash While Hitchhiking,
the narrator ends up back

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.130
in detox and at rock bottom.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.910
He's hearing voices, seeing things,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.600
and acknowledging his
pitiable state,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.430
he addresses us, his dear readers.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.730
He says quite frankly, 'and
you, you ridiculous people,

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.130
you expect me to help you.'

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.180
Yes. We did.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.150
We expected it and will
continue to expect it,

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.200
as we return to those stories
and novels and essays and poems,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.410
to mine all the help within."

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:59.100
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And now, for
the ceremony itself, Robert,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.940
would you come back
and confer the prize?

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.060
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Thank you, Marie,
Susan, and Sam for your commitment

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.490
to our prize winner and his work.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.100
I would now like to
officially bestow the prize.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.300
Denis Johnson's widow, Cindy,
could not be with us today,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.310
and has asked that Johnson's agent,

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.520
Nicole Aragi, accept
it in her place.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.640
Nicole, could you please
come to the stage?

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:57.310
Nicole, on behalf of the
Librarian of Congress,

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:02.150
I'm pleased to award the 2017
Library of Congress Prize

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.810
in American Fiction
to Denis Johnson.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.290
Please accept this crystal
commemorating the prize.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.090
&gt;&gt; Nicole Aragi: Thank you.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:23.250
[ Applause ]

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.850
OK. As you'll see, Denis had a
healthy skepticism of authority,

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.900
institutions, and praise
of any sort.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.190
But, deep down, I know he was
proud to receive this anyway.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:38.340
I'm receiving this on behalf of
Denis Johnson's wife, Cindy Lee.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.350
Denis was honored when he heard
he'd been chosen for this award.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.290
He said yes, and then
immediately began stewing over it.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.920
By the time Marie Arana called in
early May, he had made a decision.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.570
He told her, I don't want some old
white guy winning this award during

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.170
the Trump administration.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.330
[ Laughter ]

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.020
I'm glad you're laughing.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.810
I'm sure Marie was flabbergasted.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.510
I know I was.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.060
Even after 28 years together,
he could still surprise me.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.630
In the days that followed,
I made my case.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.710
I argued that presidents
come and go,

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.060
while the Library of
Congress abides.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.320
And, I insisted that his singular
talent deserved to be recognized

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.260
by such a noble American
institution.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.560
Denis was unmoved.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.990
The only caveat I could get out of
him was his belief that the Library

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.440
of Congress has the right to give
their award to anyone they choose.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.870
Everyone is gathered here today

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.300
because Denis Johnson was
an extraordinary writer,

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.800
and because he defended freedom,
even when he didn't approve of it.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.600
[inaudible]

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:50.490
[ Applause ]

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.140
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Nicole, we have a
gift from the Library of Congress.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.120
This is a notebook of all
the citations-- excuse me--

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.950
of the tributes that we
heard today and others,

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.770
and we knew the Johnson
family would want

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.160
to have a permanent copy of this.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.460
So, we present it to you.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.760
&gt;&gt; Nicole Aragi: Thank you.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.560
Thank you.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:16.480
[ Applause ]

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.650
Thank you so much.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.950
I've lost it.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.750
I've lost his award.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.450
[ Applause ]

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.960
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Nicole,
thank you so much.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.310
And, thanks to all of you who
have joined us in remembering one

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.950
of America's greatest writers.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.340
We at the Library are also
thankful we had the opportunity

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.160
to award him our highest
honor in fiction,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.200
and we hope you will help us keep
his work alive into the future.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.090
We also hope you will take the
opportunity to hear the wealth

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:50.060
of other voices we have here today
at the National Book Festival,

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.370 position:56%
a testament to the power of writing.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.670
Thank you so much.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.990

of the Library of Congress.
