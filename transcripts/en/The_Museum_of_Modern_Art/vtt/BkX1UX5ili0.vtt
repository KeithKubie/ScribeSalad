00:00:02.408 --> 00:00:04.586
“Migration Portraiture”

00:00:06.883 --> 00:00:09.216
“When the subject
is strong

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:14.221
simplicity
is the only way to treat it.”

00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:16.725
-Jacob Lawrence

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.393
North

00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:25.275
First time Colored could sit
on something moving fast for free,

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.445
ride the shoe leather of the train

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:32.108
all the way up to men
standing on Harlem corners

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:34.491
with faces like ours,

00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:38.830
they, moving along in a white man’s coat

00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:42.000
never nodding back our way.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.461
Cotton still stuck in their shoes,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.506
Zoots! waiting to be shipped back

00:00:49.823 --> 00:00:51.635
to green pastures.

00:00:52.098 --> 00:00:53.428
Sixty.

00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:56.430
South

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:02.311
The snapped bloody rope
the undertaker pulled off my Jack’s neck

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:06.525
is wrapped around
my little girl’s depot suitcase

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.275
like a wedding garter,

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:09.526
tight.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.905
Recognize, I tell her.

00:01:13.363 --> 00:01:17.576
Decamp from the field,
learn to read blood on a rope

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.495
like an encyclopedia,

00:01:19.703 --> 00:01:22.123
then Get!

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.961
Persimmon hat pulled back
sideways on her little head,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.131
pencil eyes pointing that a way.

00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:33.468
Sixty.

00:01:35.388 --> 00:01:36.638
South

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:39.765
From Mexico to Carolina

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.686
they tore through cotton
like beetles from the Bible.

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:48.106
We human boll weevils sally forth now,

00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:51.986
ready to land in a new northern field,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.488
push our long snouts

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:58.618
down into the bud
of something fat and sweet

00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:00.036
and suck.

00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:04.990
A three-lettered poison
will help the cotton

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.166
ride the rails back.

00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:12.715
What about dusty black us?

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:14.968
Sixty.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:18.053
North

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.940
Mama hammers hot steel

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:25.186
pretending she is a man
in a heavy heat suit.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.815
Her bald head and sexless hands

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:31.735
pay for coal and bread

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:33.570
and new books.

00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:37.740
On the new fire escape she whispers

00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:39.325
and smokes,

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:46.666
I didn’t come all this way to clean
and polish another white house,

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:53.590
then asks me to memorize
her new northern words,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.676
Flying &amp; Dutchman.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.096
Sixty.
