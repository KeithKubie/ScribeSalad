00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.030
TOMER ULLMAN: So yeah,
I'm going to spend

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.700
the rest of the tutorial
talking about Amazon Mechanical

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.420
Turk, although some of the stuff
just applies to, in general,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.030
sort of making large scale
experiments on people

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.320
and crowds and things like that.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.630
There are other alternatives.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.745
I think Google has
some in-house things.

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:40.980
There's like crowd
flower or crowd

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.370
clicker or things like that.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.870
But most of the
psychologists I know

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.770
that are doing stuff online
and large scale things

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.150
use Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.927
So I'll be talking about that.

00:00:49.927 --> 00:00:51.510
This is a crowdsourcing
platform which

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.550
is designed to do all
sorts of small tasks,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.180
not necessarily psychophysics.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.130
It was invented in around
or built in around 2005.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.040
And the signature
tagline for it is

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.870
"Artificial artificial
intelligence."

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.850
So these are all sorts
of tasks that you

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.706
wish computers could do.

00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:09.330
You don't want to
put people through it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.120
but computers can't do it yet.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.840
So let's have people
do it for now.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.200
Amazon sort of invented
it for in-house purposes

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.180
to get rid of duplicate pages.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.370
They really wanted
an algorithm to do

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.160
that for duplicate postings,
but there really wasn't one.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.800
So they just paid some
people very little money

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.510
to do a lot of these pages.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.220
And then they figured, wait
a minute, a lot of companies

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.636
probably want this
sort of service

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:34.380
so they offered it to
the general public.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.472
Do people know what
the original turk was,

00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:37.680
the original Mechanical Turk?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.660
Who doesn't know,
raise their hands.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.760
OK, so Mechanical Turk, the name
comes from this 18th century

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.090
mechanical contraption
called the turk,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.480
which was a chess playing
device that supposedly ran

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.840
on clockwork and could beat some
of the finest minds in Europe.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.320
I think at some point it played
like the Austrian duchess

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.570
or whatever it was the empress
and Napoleon and things

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.119
like that.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.910
And it floored people,
how could this work?

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.050
And you know, the
inventor said, well,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.383
I've invented a thinking device.

00:02:05.383 --> 00:02:06.990
And the clockwork
just solves it.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.840
And a lot of people of course
figured that it must be a hoax

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.750
but they couldn't be sure
exactly how it worked.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.030
And it was, of course, a hoax.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.780
All of these gears and
boxes and clockwork

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.660
is just designed to
distract you from the fact

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.242
that you could fit
a person inside.

00:02:20.242 --> 00:02:22.200
I mean, people have
thought of that, obviously,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.690
but it was cleverly designed
so that you couldn't quite

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.280
find it.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.280
And nobody knows for sure
because the original work was

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.550
destroyed before people put
forward the exact hypothesis,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.200
but the consensus
now is that it must

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.002
have been just some person
inside making the moves.

00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:40.460
At some point people
have suggested

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.720
it must have been a well-trained
child or a small person

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.845
or something like that
because the compartment must

00:02:44.845 --> 00:02:45.830
be really small.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.240
That's not thinking right now.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.240
It was just some more magic, but
not magic in the Harry Potter

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.750
sense magic, in the
stage magic sense.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.910
So, what sorts of
tasks do people

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.350
run on Amazon Mechanical Turk?

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.820
Well actually, the
majority is not

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.260
psychophysics or psychologists.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.426
There are a lot of companies
using Amazon Mechanical

00:03:03.426 --> 00:03:06.130
Turk to do things like, hey,
garner positive reviews for us.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.190
Go to this website and
write something nice

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.110
about our product.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.150
Or you know, translate
some text for me instead

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.010
of hiring some
professional to do it,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.937
most people who-- there's a lot
of people on Amazon Mechanical

00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:19.020
Turk that can probably
translate something for you

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.180
from English to Spanish and
back, English to Chinese

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.304
and back, things like that.

00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:23.970
And they can do it
for much less money

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.460
than you would need to pay
a professional translator.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.460
Another thing that may be more
up your alley is, you know,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.280
you've heard a lot about
supervised training and things

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.990
like that, and big
data sets that are

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.530
used to train things like
convolutional neural networks.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.390
The supervised part usually
comes from somewhere.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.920
Somebody has to
tag those images.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.660
Somebody has to go
over a million images

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.220
and say dog, not dog, dog, not
dog, not dog, two dogs, one

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.900
dog.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.840
You want somebody to
go ahead and do that.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.590
And you don't have
artificial intelligence

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.757
to do it for you, yet.

00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:55.590
I mean, CNN's are getting
better but someone

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.850
had to tag it for them.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.870
And that's the sort of
thing that you would

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.359
use Amazon Mechanical Turk for.

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:00.150
Look at this image.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.400
Tell me, is there a social
interaction or isn't there?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.930
Now do that for the
next 100 images.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.640
Let's get 1,000
people to do that.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.100
You get the sense of like why
you would want to crowdsource

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.680
this kind of problem.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.996
But there's also, you know,
just psychology, psychophysics,

00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:15.870
the sort of thing that
you would bring people

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.350
into the lab to do but you don't
want to do for various reasons.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.089
So the idea is you could collect
a lot of people responding

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.380
to stuff on the screen right,
exactly the sort of thing

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.880
that you would bring them into
the lab and measure something

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.190
that they're doing to a screen.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.860
You could just have them doing
that to the screen at home,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.290
or wherever the hell it is
that they're doing this thing.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.734
So let's see, you could
do things like perception.

00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:39.900
You know, just look at this.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.530
Is it a dog?

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.100
Yes or no.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.980
Or rather things
like the Stroop task.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.660
If nobody had invented
the Stroop task,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.200
you could do that on Amazon
Mechanical Turk and get famous.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.509
I was going to say rich and
famous, but just famous.

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.050
You could do various
attention tasks.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.560
You could do things like
learning and categorization

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.130
and bias.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.630
Learning things like, here's
a tufa, here's a tufa,

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.790
here's a tufa.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.260
Is this a tufa?

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.250
I mean, it's very easy
to do that on a screen.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.180
You can do that on
Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.830
You could do things
like implicit bias.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.480
A lot of social
psychologists are

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.515
interested in that
sort of thing.

00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:12.390
Let's see, what else.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.217
You could do things like
morality, the trolley problem.

00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:17.550
You could do things like
decision making, and economics,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.082
and prisoner dilemmas,
and making predictions,

00:05:20.082 --> 00:05:22.540
and tell us which one of these
two movies based on trailers

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.970
do you think will
win the best actor

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.446
award and things like that.

00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:30.820
How would you actually run
something on Amazon Mechanical

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.150
Turk?

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.483
The first thing you would do
is register as a requester.

00:05:33.483 --> 00:05:35.609
You would go to
requester.amazon.--

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:36.650
I'll send you the slides.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.233
You can just click on that link
and it'll take you to the page

00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:40.540
to register as a requester.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.725
You would then you
do one of two things.

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:44.350
You could either do
the vanilla version

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.187
which is to just use
the Amazon template.

00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:47.770
Amazon has made it
very simple for you

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.560
as a requester to bring up a
new experiment and just say,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.660
I want to ask a simple
set of questions.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.250
Now go.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.333
And there are some parameters
that you need to set

00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:58.450
and I'll show you those
in a second, what they do.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.670
And if you're only interested
in very simple things,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.470
like fill out this
box or click on one

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.653
of these two images or something
like that, that's perfect

00:06:04.653 --> 00:06:05.240
and it's fine.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.880
And Amazon takes care of
a lot of things for you

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.110
like saving the data.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.500
You don't have to mess around
with like SQL databases

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.425
and things like
that on your own.

00:06:13.425 --> 00:06:14.800
The other thing
that you could do

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.960
is to point people to
an external website.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.750
Then you would have
to host it somehow.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.550
The advantage there
is that then you

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.047
could do any sort of
fanciness that you want.

00:06:24.047 --> 00:06:25.630
You could show them
custom animations,

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.870
have them play a game, record
how they're playing that game,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.450
send them new things based on
how they're playing that game.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.160
Or you could do
things like, you wait

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.630
until you record two people.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.770
You record two people.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.020
If you just recruit
one person, it just

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.320
says waiting, waiting, waiting.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.370
Now you wait for
the next person.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.203
Now you have them pitted
against one another

00:06:41.203 --> 00:06:42.310
in some sort of game.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.061
This has become more
popular in economics.

00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.643
That's not the sort
of thing you could

00:06:45.643 --> 00:06:47.050
do with the Amazon template.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.640
But if you're good
at coding or you

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.590
can hire someone that's
reasonable at coding,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.923
you can do that by pointing
them to an external website.

00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:56.050
And we can show some
examples of that.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.324
Then once you decide-- you
register as a requester.

00:06:59.324 --> 00:07:01.240
You decide which one of
these things you want.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.030
You build your website, either
you build the external website

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.730
or you just use the
Amazon template.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.860
And then you test
it on a sandbox.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.430
Don't run your experiments
live immediately.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.530
I'll be giving sort of
tips throughout the thing.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.210
This might be redundant for
some of you but not redundant

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.420
for others.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.930
So there's a sandbox
where you can just

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.940
run it and get sort
of false responses

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.640
that don't count exactly where
people can sort of fill it in.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.556
You might want to used
that before you go live

00:07:26.556 --> 00:07:28.150
with 1,000 people
and say, oh god,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.820
I miscoded that variable
and nothing is working.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.097
So test it ahead of time.

00:07:33.097 --> 00:07:34.930
And then, once you're
finally, finally done,

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.010
you would submit it.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.180
You would just click, you
know, submit this thing.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.030
You would pay the
money to Amazon.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.940
And you also want to announce
it on several Mechanical Turk

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.530
forums, which I'll
get to in the end.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.940
These are very helpful people.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.940
They're very nice to you
if you're nice to them.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.100
And it gets you a lot
more results very fast.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.010
OK, let's see.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.390
Why don't I show
you an example--

00:07:57.695 --> 00:08:00.070
let me show you an example of
what a requester page looks

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.900
like, just to get a sense of it
for those of you who have not

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.464
seen this sort of thing before.

00:08:03.464 --> 00:08:05.380
You can see our experiment
is almost finished.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.360
I asked for 100 people on that.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.790
So let's go to
something like create.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.780
So this is what the
requester page looks like.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.238
Here's all sorts
of projects that I

00:08:18.238 --> 00:08:19.990
run on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.640
And you would do
something like new

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.390
or you would copy
something from something

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.431
old that you already did.

00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:25.810
Let's just edit
that and show you

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.520
some examples of
what you can do.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.440
You give a name,
you know, a title

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.100
for your own internal
title, like AI estimate.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.630
You then give a title that
Amazon Mechanical Turkers see,

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.669
something like artificial
intelligence estimate,

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.260
short psychology study.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.360
There, you probably want
to give a time estimate.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.045
Turkers would prefer it if
you give them a time estimate.

00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:44.169
They care about their time.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.630
They care about their money.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.049
They do like doing psychology.

00:08:48.049 --> 00:08:49.840
They don't like filling
in endless bubbles,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.640
you know, the standard
psychology things

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.150
where you rate 100 things like,
I feel this way or that way.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.110
Don't do that.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.693
But the sort of fun psychology
they're actually on board with.

00:08:58.693 --> 00:09:01.810
It's much more fun than
writing show reviews.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.360
You might want to give it a nice
title that will entice them,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.190
an honest description,
like you know,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.690
you'll answer a few
simple questions

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.898
on you'll watch a movie and
then answer two questions

00:09:09.898 --> 00:09:10.800
or things like that.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.690
Key words like easy, fun,
something descriptive

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.670
about the task, like AI, short.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.710
Again, this is sort
of luring, and it's

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.440
good to do that if
you're honest about it.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.490
Some people do things
like easy, fun,

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.987
100 pages of filling in
bubbles and things like that.

00:09:24.987 --> 00:09:25.570
Don't do that.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.695
They publish it in the
forums, like, this is a lie.

00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:29.179
Don't do that.

00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:31.720
This is where you say how much
you want to pay per assignment

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.290
and we'll get to how much you
should pay per assignment.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.010
You'll notice it's very little.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.900
You're paying these
people very little.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.910
How much assignments
you want per hit.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.070
Hit is just the
name for your task.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.350
How much time you are
allotting them per assignment.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.450
So someone has
accepted your hit, now

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.120
how long do they
have to carry it out.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.070
You might think,
oh, my task only

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.085
takes two to three minutes,
so only give people

00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:53.960
two to three minutes.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.570
I don't want them
like taking the hit

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.195
and then going and
drinking some coffee

00:09:57.195 --> 00:09:59.740
and then coming back to
it or something like that.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.914
Consider still giving them
a whole bunch of time,

00:10:01.914 --> 00:10:04.330
because a lot of the time,
you'll find that people if they

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.440
see that there's only a
five minute mark on it,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.760
and if they don't
completed in five minutes

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.926
they're sort of concerned,
like, what is this thing?

00:10:09.926 --> 00:10:12.820
And if I won't get done through
it in five minutes, you know,

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.357
I'll get disqualified
or something like that.

00:10:15.357 --> 00:10:16.190
Give them some time.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.030
Give them more than the ample
time to finish this thing.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.190
You can, yourself,
keep around some timer

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.315
within the external website
or something like that,

00:10:23.315 --> 00:10:25.810
or they actually actively
participating right now.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.000
How long will this
hit stay up for?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.850
And auto approve,
and things like that.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.395
I'll talk a little bit
about rewards and incentives

00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:34.270
and things like that.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.479
Obviously, they care a lot
about things like money.

00:10:37.479 --> 00:10:39.520
They care a lot about
things like how much you're

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.160
going to pay them.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.034
They care about doing
it quickly so that they

00:10:42.034 --> 00:10:43.720
can move on and get more money.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.370
They care about it
being somewhat fun,

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.270
but that's not such
a big deal for them.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.510
And they care about getting
it approved quickly.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.210
OK, so you as a
requester, you will

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.110
get reviewed on various
forums and things like that.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.610
If you get bad reviews, people
don't want to do your things.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.370
One of the things that people
care a lot about is something

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.157
like getting approved quickly.

00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:04.490
And quickly can be in a day
or two, something like that.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.031
They don't want to have to wait
two weeks for that $0.50 that

00:11:07.031 --> 00:11:09.160
you were supposed to give them.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.570
You can do that if you want to.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.160
You have the power
as the requester.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.770
But if you want to
incentivize people,

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.810
try to make sure that
you approve them quickly

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.990
and let them know that you're
going to approve them quickly.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.830
So that was just a
very general statement.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.680
So who are the
sort of people that

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.032
are on Amazon Mechanical Turk?

00:11:27.032 --> 00:11:29.490
Have people read these sort of
papers and things like that?

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.580
Do you know more or less?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.205
Some of you do.

00:11:31.205 --> 00:11:32.590
Some of you don't.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.664
The use in India
make up about 80%--

00:11:34.664 --> 00:11:35.830
by the way, this is in flux.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.920
Like a study came out two years
ago about this sort of thing.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.080
It's changed since then.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.819
But the study two years ago, the
US and India make up about 80%,

00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:44.860
with the US taking up
50-something percent, India

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.195
taking up the rest.

00:11:46.195 --> 00:11:48.820
There are slightly more females
than males on Amazon Mechanical

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.920
Turk, and at least
the US population

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.310
is biased towards young and
educated people, educated

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.110
meaning a bachelor's degree.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.880
It's certainly
more representative

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.130
of the general population
than just hiring,

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.010
you know, college students
during their bachelor's degree.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.310
But it is still skewed,
keep that in mind.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.560
It's skewed towards, basically,
the sort of population

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.150
that you would expect to find
on the internet in the United

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.650
States.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:15.542
OK, so somewhat younger
people, somewhat more educated.

00:12:15.542 --> 00:12:17.500
In general, you might
want to look at something

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.070
like Mason and
Siddharth were looking

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.070
at these sort of things.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.940
I can send you the links later.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.690
I was talking a little
bit about payments.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.190
There's been a whole
load of studies

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.920
looking at querying the
Amazon Mechanical Turk pool.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.460
Who are you?

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.376
What's your education?

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:32.680
Why are you doing this?

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.500
And then they ask why are you
doing this in various ways.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.400
Are you doing it for fun?

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.460
Are you doing it to kill time?

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.780
Are you doing this as
a supplementary thing?

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.840
They're in it for money.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.798
It's very obvious that
they're in it for money.

00:12:40.798 --> 00:12:41.980
That's OK.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.220
And keep that in mind
when you post hits.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.090
You have a lot of
power as a requester.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.090
You have a ton of power.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.256
You have a ton of power to
dictate the terms of what

00:12:51.256 --> 00:12:52.300
you're going to pay them.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.600
You have a ton of power
to reject their work.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.100
Once they basically do the hit
for you, you can then go back

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.200
and say, you failed
this question

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.970
or you didn't quite
get what we wanted,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.130
or you actually did the
study two months ago

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.999
but I didn't implement checks
for that, I just asked you,

00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:08.290
did you take the study before
and they didn't remember.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.159
Something like that.

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:10.450
And then you reject their work.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.320
And if you reject it too many
times, then they get banned.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.970
First of all, if you
reject, they don't get paid.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.980
If you reject it too many
times, they get banned.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.396
These are people that are doing
it either as supplementary

00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:21.210
or as their main income.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.617
I don't know-- this may
seem obvious to some of you.

00:13:23.617 --> 00:13:25.783
If this doesn't seem obvious
to at least one of you,

00:13:25.783 --> 00:13:30.860
then I'll count it as
worthwhile to stress this.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.020
You don't care about the $0.20.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.292
These people do care
about the $0.20.

00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:37.250
And again, it's not
because they're necessarily

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.010
from poor economical
backgrounds,

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.760
but they're in it for
the money and that's

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.410
what they're doing this for.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.854
Try to give them fair pay.

00:13:44.854 --> 00:13:46.520
And we'll stress that
again and tell you

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.080
what I mean by fair pay.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.520
Try not to reject them.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.620
OK, except in
extreme situations.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.520
Even if they failed.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.311
Even if they didn't do
your catch question.

00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:56.480
Even if you think that they
just zoomed through this

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.490
or something like that,
that's usually on you

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.130
to catch that, as a
psychology researcher.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.190
You're not a company.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.040
You're a psychology researcher.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.600
Try not to reject people.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.730
Make sure you have some
ways set up ahead of time,

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.040
and I'll get to that,
to know who to reject.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.100
But don't actually reject
people except in really extreme

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.204
situations.

00:14:16.204 --> 00:14:18.620
Something about payments is
that Amazon takes up about 10.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.940
They actually raise this to
20% to 40% of the payments.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.440
And this is what I
was going to say.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.898
There have been some attempts
within the psychologists that

00:14:26.898 --> 00:14:28.910
has been doing Amazon
Mechanical Turk studies,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.380
and this has also been fueled
by the community of Amazon

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.640
Mechanical Turkers, or
Turkers, to establish some sort

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.430
of guidelines for minimum pay.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.990
So if people come
into the lab, there

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.323
are some guidelines on what
you're supposed to pay them.

00:14:41.323 --> 00:14:43.170
There are no exact guidelines.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.314
There's no enforcing
guidelines, at least not--

00:14:46.314 --> 00:14:48.230
maybe there are within
particular universities

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.676
but there's no cross
university one guideline

00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:52.550
to tell you you have to
pay people this much.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.000
And that might be
tempting to say,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.580
oh, I'll just pay
people, you know,

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.100
the minimum I can get away with.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.680
I mean, if I can pay people
$0.05 to do a 10 minute task,

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.310
I'll do that.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.350
Fine, I can get the
20 subjects I need.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.240
It's a free market.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.470
We're not trying to live here in
some sort of capitalist fantasy

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.140
of some sort.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.807
I'm not going to get into
economics too much because I

00:15:12.807 --> 00:15:15.140
think you guys know that
better than I do you don't need

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.880
my lecturing in that sense.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.540
But a lot of people who have
looked into the ethics of this

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.760
recommend that you try
to estimate ahead of time

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.240
through a pilot how long
is this test going to take.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.950
Based on that, pay them such
that it matches minimum wage.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.930
Minimum wage being
somewhat flux, like,

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.182
you know, I forget if
it's like $10 an hour

00:15:35.182 --> 00:15:36.140
or something like that.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.348
It's probably less than that.

00:15:37.348 --> 00:15:39.399
But something like that.

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:40.940
I'm not going to
tell you exactly how

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.981
much you should pay them.

00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:44.840
But try to figure out more or
less minimum wage, more or less

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.200
how long your task takes and
pay them according to that.

00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:51.710
Some general advantages
of Mechanical Turk,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.430
in case you guys have not been
persuaded yet, let me say.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.020
You can run large
scale experiments.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.405
I started running
this experiment

00:15:59.405 --> 00:16:01.530
on 100 people that would
have taken me a long time.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.440
It's a silly experiment
as Nori pointed out.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.939
It's not even exactly
an experiment.

00:16:04.939 --> 00:16:08.480
But I wanted to check
how people's responses

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.430
compared to people in CBMM.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.290
First of all, I wouldn't
do that in the lab.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.497
So there's that.

00:16:15.497 --> 00:16:18.080
But even if I were to do it in
a lab, getting 100 participants

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.850
would take a long, long time.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.800
And for your more
serious experiments,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.440
getting 100 participants
would take a long, long time.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.220
Each one has to come in and
you have to talk to them.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.553
And you have to explain to
them exactly what's going on.

00:16:28.553 --> 00:16:30.380
And you usually can't
run them in parallel,

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.546
or at least you can run
only one or two in parallel.

00:16:32.546 --> 00:16:35.260
Here we run 100
subjects in an hour.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.760
And that's still amazing.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.900
That's still flooring me.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.040
And we can do it, so we
can do it very quickly.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.421
A lot of people very quickly.

00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:44.420
And what you can do with
large scale experiments

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.342
is usually test some very fine
grain things of your model.

00:16:47.342 --> 00:16:48.800
If your model has
some things like,

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.260
well, I need to show people
all of these different things

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.490
and make all of these
different predictions.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.500
And I just need 300
people to do that.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.960
Or for example, what my dad
was presenting yesterday,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.292
these minimal images.

00:16:58.292 --> 00:16:59.750
Did he mention how
many people they

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.416
had to recruit on
Amazon Mechanical Turk

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:03.320
to do those minimal images?

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.180
Yes?

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.900
It's like it's thousands.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.949
I think it's over 10,000 at this
point, or something like that.

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:10.490
And the reason is
because once you've

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.874
seen that thing, once you've
seen the minimal image,

00:17:12.874 --> 00:17:14.040
you already know what it is.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.869
You're biased.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.660
You know it's a horse even
though a naive participant

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.950
wouldn't know it's a horse.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.140
So you want to make sure
that you want 10,000

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.599
participants for this thing.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.890
You're not going to get 10,000
participants in the lab.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:27.329
No way.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.330
So another thing
is that, as I said,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.040
even if you're paying
people minimum wage

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.360
and things like that,
it's still pretty cheap

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.420
to get 100 subjects.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.430
It's cheapish.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.100
The ish is because you should
pay people some minimum wage.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.070
It's replicable, ish.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.202
What I mean here by replicable
is not what you might think,

00:17:43.202 --> 00:17:44.660
which I'll get to
in another slide.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.810
It's just if you want to hand
it off to another person.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.670
Someone says, I don't quite
understand your protocol,

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.330
or I don't quite believe it, or
I want to tweak it in some way.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.460
It's much harder, usually,
with lab protocols and things

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:55.960
like that.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.490
We certainly know that
in baby experiments.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.579
Wouldn't it be nice if we
could just port, you know,

00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:03.620
I won't say who because
it doesn't really matter,

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.940
but some experiments of people.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.648
They describe their
methods in the paper.

00:18:06.648 --> 00:18:07.773
It's not really that great.

00:18:07.773 --> 00:18:09.314
Wouldn't it be great
if we could just

00:18:09.314 --> 00:18:11.990
copy paste their experiment
and run it with some tweaking.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.550
With this sort of
thing, you can.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.530
I mean, you need to be somewhat
on good terms with the person

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.240
you're asking for, but they can
just tell you, oh yeah, sure.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.220
Here's the code for my website.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.450
Just run it again.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.990
Run it with your tweaks
and things like that.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.555
There's an ish there and
I'll get to it in a second.

00:18:27.555 --> 00:18:29.680
The participant pool, as
I said, it's more diverse.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.820
So I was I was harping
before about this point

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.210
that the pool doesn't quite
represent the US in general,

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.760
it's more like the US
population on the internet.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.920
That's still a lot more
diverse than recruiting

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.570
college students.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.510
It's a lot more diverse, let's
see, I have here in response

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.721
to gender, socioeconomic status,
geographic region, and age.

00:18:47.721 --> 00:18:49.220
On all these things
that people have

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.594
tested on Amazon
Mechanical Turk,

00:18:50.594 --> 00:18:52.089
the sample is a
lot more diverse,

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:54.380
is a lot more representative
of the general population,

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.750
is a lot less weird.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:02.390
Weird being like Western,
educated, industrialized, rich,

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.370
democracies, which is
usually the pool that's

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.930
been studied in psychology.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.970
These pools are a
lot more diverse.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.977
They're not diverse
enough for certain things

00:19:09.977 --> 00:19:12.560
in social psychology, and that's
this paper by Weinberg, where

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.710
he says, you know, sometimes
social psychologists really,

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.630
really, really want to
control for making sure

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.070
that age is not a factor,
or something like that.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.430
Or they really want to get
it what the population is,

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.930
or age they think plays a
factor, or something like that.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.929
So you need a population
where they call it

00:19:26.929 --> 00:19:28.220
sort of like knowledge experts.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.666
You build some pool.

00:19:29.666 --> 00:19:31.040
You build some
pool that you say,

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.990
OK, the reason
this pool exists is

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.040
because it's representative
of the population.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.140
And now we're going
to go to this pool

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.030
and just try them again
and again and again

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.330
on many different experiments.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.240
It's sort of like
your, you know,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.120
not exactly private but shared
between some universities

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.309
pool of social
psychology participants.

00:19:48.309 --> 00:19:49.850
They've tested that
and they've shown

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.266
that mechanical
turkers are better

00:19:51.266 --> 00:19:53.990
than those pools in terms
of things like attention,

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.430
filling out the
correct responses,

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.360
and things like that.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.170
So yay Mechanical Turk.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.770
But there are some things like
implicit biases and things

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.480
that social
psychologists care about,

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.722
where you don't know if the
effect is something like age,

00:20:05.722 --> 00:20:06.680
or something like that.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.513
I don't know if this
matters to a lot of you

00:20:08.513 --> 00:20:11.110
but it's important to keep in
mind for those of you who do.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.860
Here's this point about
will it replicate.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.540
You know, some people
who are being introduced

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.880
to Amazon Mechanical Turk,
or thinking about it, usually

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.180
say, yeah, that's fine.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.360
But how do I know that
people are actually doing

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.340
what will happen in the lab?

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.744
I might do it on
Mechanical Turk,

00:20:23.744 --> 00:20:25.160
but then if I do
it in the lab, it

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.000
won't replicate or
things like that.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
So people have tried a
bunch of the psychophysics

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.360
that Leyla was talking
about before, and more.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.060
They tried stroop, switching,
Flanker, Simon, Posner, cueing,

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.944
intentional, blink, subliminal
priming, and category learning.

00:20:37.944 --> 00:20:39.360
And they've done
a whole lot more.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.340
This is just from one
study by Crump et al.,

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.510
where one of the et al.
is Todd Gureckis, who

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.180
we'll get to in a second.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.370
And what they find was
basically replication

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.724
on all of these classic
psychology stuff, the sort

00:20:51.724 --> 00:20:52.890
of effects you would expect.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.945
The sort of effect
sizes you would expect.

00:20:54.945 --> 00:20:56.570
The only thing that
was a bit different

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.903
was in category learning where
you show people something

00:20:58.903 --> 00:21:00.025
like, this is a tufa.

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:00.650
This is a tufa.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.275
This is a tufa.

00:21:01.275 --> 00:21:02.450
Is this a tufa?

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.310
Where there are different
types of learning,

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.770
type one being easier, type
two being of a little harder,

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.270
type three being much harder.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.830
Where the classic finding was
something like a graded thing.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.030
And for Amazon Mechanical
Turk, it was more--

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.610
it was really hard for
them beyond type one.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.170
Now is that a failure
of replication

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.878
or is that because
the original study was

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:22.204
done on college students
who are young and educated?

00:21:22.204 --> 00:21:23.870
And this is actually
more representative

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.210
of the population, but
this is harder to learn.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.530
I'm not quite sure.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.010
The takeaway here is that, yeah,
it seems like, in general, it

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.020
will replicate,
at least certainly

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.370
for simple perceptual stuff.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.260
Concerns of running things
on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.150
And I can send a whole
bunch of recent papers

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.387
that are very nice about it.

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:46.970
One of them was
specifically-- there's

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.720
been a bunch of like
New York Times papers

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.442
on Amazon Mechanical
Turk in general.

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:52.400
There's been a very recent
one a few months ago

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.160
on using it for psychophysics
experiments in particular.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.520
It's called the Internet's
Hidden Science Factory.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.210
It's a very nice
paper to check out.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.501
And they make all these points
about the sort of things

00:22:01.501 --> 00:22:03.700
that you probably thought
about as a researcher

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.654
but it bears
thinking about again,

00:22:05.654 --> 00:22:07.070
which is, people
don't necessarily

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.840
pay that much
attention to your task.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.140
You have no control.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.510
They're not in the lab.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.700
They give some quotes
there, which is, you know,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.169
Nancy's employees don't know--

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:17.210
yeah, I think it's Nancy.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.350
I changed the name.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.030
Nancy's employers
don't know that Nancy

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.190
works while negotiating
her toddlers milk bottles

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.265
and giving him hugs.

00:22:23.265 --> 00:22:24.890
They don't know that
she's seen studies

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.280
similar to theirs, maybe
hundreds, possibly thousands

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.110
of times.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.240
So that brings us,
actually, to another thing,

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.580
which is repeated exposure.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.587
This is a big concern.

00:22:37.587 --> 00:22:39.920
By the way, sorry, I'm going
sort of back and forth here

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.150
because before I
leave attention,

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.774
I want to mention
just one thing, which

00:22:42.774 --> 00:22:45.430
is attention is a problem you
want to put in attention cues.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.910
And I'll talk about how
to do that in a second.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.210
But we've had this a lot
with people in the lab.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:51.860
I'm sure that some of you
have experienced this as well.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.870
You put them in a room because
they need to have privacy

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.203
while they're doing the task,
you go in to check on them

00:22:56.203 --> 00:22:57.769
and they're on their phone.

00:22:57.769 --> 00:22:58.560
This happens a lot.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.680
So attention is something that
you want to check in the lab

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.040
as well.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.510
A lot of these concerns are
not just about Mechanical Turk,

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.801
but it's certainly easier
for people in Mechanical Turk

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:08.480
to not quite pay attention.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.570
Repeated exposure
is a huge problem.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:15.270
And it's a problem for
two different reasons.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.597
One is that it
destroys intuition.

00:23:17.597 --> 00:23:19.930
I was asking about the trolley
problem and you all went,

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.000
oh, the trolley problem.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.170
People on Turk are doing
that even more than you are.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.100
They see the trolley
problem, they've seen it.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.290
I guarantee you,
it's very difficult

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.624
to find a Turker that has
not seen the trolley problem.

00:23:31.624 --> 00:23:32.290
They've seen it.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.180
They've seen it 1,000 times.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.876
They've seen all the variations.

00:23:35.876 --> 00:23:37.000
And they complain about it.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.690
And they're satiated.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:38.470
And they're sick of it.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.600
They will say things like, if
I see one more trolley problem,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.404
just kill them all.

00:23:41.404 --> 00:23:43.570
Is there a way to kill the
five and the other person

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:44.861
on the other side of the track?

00:23:44.861 --> 00:23:46.420
I don't care anymore.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.190
OK, they're completely satiated.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.565
It's kind of like saying,
hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer.

00:23:50.565 --> 00:23:52.300
It loses all meaning
at some point.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.850
You don't have the gut
intuitive response.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.406
And even if they're
doing their best,

00:23:56.406 --> 00:23:58.030
even if they're not
trying to fool you,

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.488
even if they're honestly trying
to answer, they just can't.

00:24:00.488 --> 00:24:02.680
They don't have the
gut intuitive response

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.560
anymore for the stuff
that you're asking them.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.362
Some ways to get around that
is to try even simple changes.

00:24:09.362 --> 00:24:11.320
Just don't call it the
trolley problem anymore.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.880
Set up something
else, which is not

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.160
5 versus 1, which is 10 versus
2 and it involves pineapples.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:18.890
Like something.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.270
You know, these small
changes can matter a lot.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.390
So that's one thing
about repeated exposure,

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.176
that it destroys intuition
and related to that,

00:24:28.176 --> 00:24:29.800
there's something
called super Turkers.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.716
These are people that,
you know, 1% of Turkers

00:24:31.716 --> 00:24:34.210
is responsible for about
10% to 15% of all studies.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.307
So when I say people
have seen it a lot,

00:24:36.307 --> 00:24:37.390
that's part of the reason.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.301
There's a lot of people doing--

00:24:39.301 --> 00:24:41.050
the same small group
of people is probably

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.750
responsible for a
lot of these studies.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.160
The other reason that repeated
exposure ruined things for us

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:53.040
is because, you know, it just
ruins basic correlations.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.730
So let me let me
give you an example.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.450
Who here has heard of the
ball and bat question?

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.640
Who here has not heard of
the ball and bat question?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.560
OK, let me pose it to you.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.280
Those of you who suddenly
say, oh yeah, I know this.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.527
Sh.

00:25:06.527 --> 00:25:08.860
I'm interested in people who
have not heard this before.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.040
So it's a simple question.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.190
A ball and a bat
together cost $1.10.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.510
The bat costs $1
more than the ball.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.900
How much does the ball cost?

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.900
I'll explain that again.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.930
A bat and a ball
costs $1.10 together.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.830
The bat costs dollar
more than the ball.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.660
How much does the ball cost?

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.300
Anyone?

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.774
Shout it out.

00:25:33.774 --> 00:25:34.440
AUDIENCE: $0.05.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.523
TOMER ULLMAN: Yeah, $0.05.

00:25:35.523 --> 00:25:38.080
Who would have said
$0.10, don't be shy.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.340
Thank you.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.500
Thank you for
being brave enough.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.060
A lot of people say $0.10.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:43.960
They say immediately.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.060
The ball costs $0.10.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.360
The bat costs $1.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.390
Wait, but it costs $1.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:49.270
No, no, it costs $1 more.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.634
So it's-- does everyone get
why $0.10 is not the answer,

00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:53.425
it should be $0.05?

00:25:53.425 --> 00:25:54.760
OK, good.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.262
This was sort of
a classic question

00:25:56.262 --> 00:25:58.720
along with two other questions
called the lily pad question

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.220
and the widget question.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.330
The widget question is something
like five widget machines

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.220
make five widgets
in five minutes.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:12.870
How long does it take 100 widget
machines to make 100 widgets?

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:13.810
Five minutes, right.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.590
Not 100.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.820
These sort of three
questions were found out

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.730
to correlate a lot better
with things like IQ tests

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:25.330
or even better, sorry, than IQ
on a lot of different things.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.930
They've been found, you
know, many smart people

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:31.080
from MIT and Harvard included
have failed this question.

00:26:34.272 --> 00:26:35.730
And the point was,
you know, people

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.979
have made a big deal about it.

00:26:36.979 --> 00:26:39.750
Like this is even better than IQ
tests on all sorts of measures.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.740
And it's so simple.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.584
We don't have to run
100 IQ test questions.

00:26:42.584 --> 00:26:44.250
Let's just ask the
ball and bat question

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.985
and then see what
that correlates with.

00:26:45.985 --> 00:26:47.360
And it also relates
to, you know,

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.180
Kahneman makes a
big deal about it.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.910
It's system one
versus system two.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:54.360
System one really wants to
answer that it costs $0.10.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.350
And you could solve it.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.460
Of course you
could all solve it.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.350
It's not hard for you if you
wrote down the simple equation,

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.220
it's trivial.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.990
Right, you wrote
it down as like x.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.062
And x costs this.

00:27:02.062 --> 00:27:03.270
And you could all solve this.

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.460
You could all solve
this in middle school.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.240
But you don't.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.260
Like system to-- some of you do.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.450
But usually the first time
you hear it, you don't.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.039
And you don't-- even
if people are warned,

00:27:14.039 --> 00:27:16.080
like this is a bit of a
trick question, you know,

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.020
think about it,
they don't, usually.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.619
And people have used this as
like ways to test system one--

00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:23.160
do people know what
I mean when I say

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.140
system one versus system two?

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:25.700
Who doesn't?

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.750
Raise your hand.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.490
So very, very quickly
because it's not

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.230
that relevant to Mechanical
Turk, but very, very quickly,

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.380
you should read Thinking
Fast and Slow by Kahneman.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.270
The point is that the
mind can generally

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.100
be categorized into two systems,
even Kahneman doesn't quite

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.100
believe that, but it's
sort of this thing that's

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.180
easy to talk about.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.720
System one is the fast,
heuristic system that gives you

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.910
the cache response system.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.680
Two is the slow, laborious,
can't do many things

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.472
at one time system.

00:27:50.472 --> 00:27:52.096
That's the sort of
thing that you would

00:27:52.096 --> 00:27:53.380
use to solve algebra problems.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.350
That's the reason you need to
slow down when you're thinking

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.434
about something very hard.

00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:57.933
System one is the
sort of thing that

00:27:57.933 --> 00:28:00.270
gives you biases and heuristics
and things like that.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.590
This was given as an
example of the bat and ball

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.590
was like one of the prime
examples of system one

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.370
wants to do this, system
two wants to do that.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.870
System two is lazy,
doesn't actually

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.430
get engaged unless it
really, really has to.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.690
Why am I bring this up?

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.190
The reason I bring this
up is because people

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.290
thought it was a great idea
to put it on Amazon Mechanical

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.670
Turk and ask people
a lot of questions

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.961
to see what it correlates with.

00:28:18.961 --> 00:28:21.390
Everybody knows about
the ball and bat problem

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:22.800
on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.239
Everybody.

00:28:24.239 --> 00:28:25.780
Don't think that
you're being unique.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.196
Don't ask them the
widget problem.

00:28:27.196 --> 00:28:29.100
Don't ask them the
lily pad problem.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.230
They all know about it.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.450
And here it's not a
problem for intuitive,

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.610
you know, being satiated
and things like that.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.049
Even if they want to,
right, I said before,

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:40.590
like they want to tell you what
the thing is, they just don't

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.910
have the gut response anymore.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.320
Here they just know it.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.680
The reason most of you
answered, or those of you

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.570
who knew about it
said, haha, $0.05.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:49.290
I know that one.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.490
I've solved it before.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.350
People on Mechanical
Turk know that too.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.266
And it's sort of destroyed
any sort of measure

00:28:54.266 --> 00:28:58.504
it had for whatever the heck
it was trying to measure.

00:28:58.504 --> 00:29:00.420
In general, there's sort
of this growing sense

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.110
that since 2010,
people have been

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.860
trying to make Amazon
Mechanical Turk more

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.110
popular for a few years.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.420
It feels almost like an
overexploited resource,

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.140
a little bit.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.889
Like you have this tribe which
doesn't know about numbers.

00:29:12.889 --> 00:29:15.430
Let's all go and study them and
ask them a billion questions.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.500
And the reason they
don't know about numbers

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.610
is because they
don't know English.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.860
And by the time we are done with
them, they will know English.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.090
And the one thing
they'll know in English

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.548
is how to count to
10 because we've

00:29:22.548 --> 00:29:24.362
asked them all these questions.

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:26.070
Amazon Mechanical Turk
feels a little bit

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.460
like this over exploited
resource at sometimes.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.050
These have been more
concerns for you

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.390
as a requester working on
Amazon Mechanical Turk, things

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.620
to sort of keep in
mind and watch out for.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.220
Here are some concerns for
people on Mechanical Turk

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.767
that you can try to alleviate.

00:29:39.767 --> 00:29:41.100
And these sort of things about--

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.970
I've already mentioned sort
of two of them about low pay

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.204
and rejecting people for no good
reason and things like that.

00:29:48.204 --> 00:29:49.620
One more thing I
want to point out

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.170
is this thing about
no de-briefing.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.970
When people coming
to the lab, you

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.040
can tell them why they
were in the study.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.920
That's a basic part of the
protocol of psychology.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.674
When people are on
Amazon Mechanical Turk,

00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:02.590
it's a good thing to put
it in the experiment,

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.010
why were you in this experiment
if you have such a thing,

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.691
and you're running
an experiment.

00:30:06.691 --> 00:30:08.190
People might drop
out in the middle,

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.232
might decide it's not for
me, actually, I'm done.

00:30:10.232 --> 00:30:11.856
And they never actually
figure out what

00:30:11.856 --> 00:30:13.200
the point of the experiment was.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.497
You might say, well, who cares?

00:30:14.497 --> 00:30:16.830
But you might say, well, who
cares to de-briefing people

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:17.430
in the lab.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.300
If there's a reason for
de-briefing people in the lab

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.510
there's probably a good
reason for de-briefing people

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.470
on Mechanical Turk.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.180
If they drop out
before their de-brief,

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.540
that's kind of a problem.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.040
I don't have a good
solution for it.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.340
It's something to keep in mind.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.070
There's also the
problem that you

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.940
should keep in mind
and report, probably,

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.440
if it's a problem, the amount
of people who have dropped out

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.231
in the middle because
otherwise it can lead

00:30:39.231 --> 00:30:41.700
to all sorts of small effects.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.280
Like if your task is really
hard, and a lot of people

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.170
drop out, you had
like a 90% dropout

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.630
and then you say, oh, people
are brilliant at my task

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.730
because the 10% who actually
stuck through with it

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.580
are the sort of crazy people
who are willing to do it.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.410
That's actually
really, really skewed.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.770
So keep in mind the
dropout should be low.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.337
It should be like a few
percent or something like that.

00:31:00.337 --> 00:31:02.670
The flip side, by the way,
of the no de-briefing problem

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.790
is a coercion problem.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:07.290
So when you bring people into
the lab and you say, you know,

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.020
do the study.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.210
You can stop at any time.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.900
No problem at all let me shut
the door and wait over here.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.934
There's sort of a slight
feeling of coercion,

00:31:14.934 --> 00:31:16.350
even if the study
is not something

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.570
they really are enjoying doing.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.890
They'll still do it because
they feel pressured to.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.390
That problem doesn't
exist, at least

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.370
on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:24.744
I mean, they're
in it for the pay

00:31:24.744 --> 00:31:26.500
and there's some
cost and all that.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.320
But if they really
don't want to do it,

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.550
if it offends them in
some way, they'll stop.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.480
So that's actually a bonus.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.620
Some general tips.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.220
Let's see.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.860
And I think I'll
have two more slides

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.970
and then we'll wrap it up.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:39.780
Some general tips.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.940
In general, when you're thinking
about your task, the lower

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.530
level it is, the
closer level it is

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.210
to-- think about
the Stroop task.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.000
OK, let's put the Stroop task
in one case and the question

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.550
I actually asked
you in another case.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.020
The Stroop task is low
level, hard to beat,

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.850
even if you've seen
it a million times,

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.690
you will still find that effect.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.860
If your task is like that, you
should expect to replicate it.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.110
If it's much more higher
level, the sort of thing that

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.719
relies on them not
having seen that before,

00:32:04.719 --> 00:32:05.760
it's harder to replicate.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.593
You want to make sure
that people who see it

00:32:07.593 --> 00:32:08.737
have not seen it before.

00:32:08.737 --> 00:32:11.070
If it's high level and relies
on some sort of zeitgeist,

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.070
like what people think about AI
right now, in two years you'll

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.170
find a different result.
Don't expect the thing

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.570
that I put online
today to replicate

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.840
in some sense in two years.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.875
Have participants give comments.

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:25.500
At the end of your
survey, once they're

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.200
done, before the de-briefing,
collect some demographics

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.246
and leave them something
optional to just say,

00:32:30.246 --> 00:32:31.620
what did you think
of this study?

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.730
Do you have any comments?

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:33.750
Or anything like that.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.766
Most of the time you
won't get any comments.

00:32:35.766 --> 00:32:37.140
After that, the
most likely thing

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.250
is they'll say, fun study.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.750
Thanks, if you've
done it correctly.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.035
Interesting, stuff like that.

00:32:41.035 --> 00:32:43.410
Some studies we've done have
been crazy and they're very,

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.659
you know, they really like it.

00:32:44.659 --> 00:32:46.290
And it's nice to
get good feedback.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.760
Or they'll tell
you something like,

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.640
that was really interesting,
could you tell me a bit more.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.670
Here's my email address.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.470
Or this button that
didn't work for me.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.886
Or I was actually a bit bothered
by the fact that you said

00:32:54.886 --> 00:32:56.250
that you would kill the robot.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.570
Things like that.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.497
Or you ask them things like--
give them comments like, why.

00:33:00.497 --> 00:33:02.580
You don't put that necessarily
in your experiment.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.440
But you tell them,
like, you know, do this.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.310
Do that.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:06.501
Make a decision.

00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:07.000
Why?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.220
Like the trolley problem.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:08.735
Why?

00:33:08.735 --> 00:33:10.110
OK, it's the sort
of thing that's

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.490
not likely to be
published immediately,

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.660
but it's definitely
the sort of thing

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.034
that will help
you think of where

00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:15.970
to take your experiment next.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.880
It's very, very
important to communicate.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.810
And what I mean by that is give
them an email at the beginning

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.310
to reach you in some
way, say like, you

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.212
know, in the consent statement.

00:33:26.212 --> 00:33:27.420
You're doing this experiment.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.740
You're doing it for x.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.546
Here's a way to reach
x if you want to.

00:33:31.546 --> 00:33:33.420
AUDIENCE: Do you give
them your actual email?

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.753
TOMER ULLMAN: You can set up
a bogus email and the sense

00:33:35.753 --> 00:33:37.350
of, like, tomer@mechanicalturk.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:39.080
I personally give
them my email at MIT.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.580
I do.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.705
And make sure that you
respond to their concerns.

00:33:44.705 --> 00:33:46.830
And they will write to you,
especially if something

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:47.880
goes technically wrong.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.670
They'll say, like, you know,
the screen didn't load for me.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.190
I forgot to paste in the
code that you wanted,

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.190
things like that.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.430
Or this didn't work quite well.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.330
Write back to them.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.380
Explain what happened.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.255
If they want to know
what the study is about,

00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:02.692
you should explain to them
what this study is about.

00:34:02.692 --> 00:34:04.150
You should do that
for two reasons.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.400
It feels silly to mention this.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.900
I'm sure you're all, you
know, you've figured it out

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.470
by yourselves.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.090
But I'll mention it
anyway, just on the chance

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.040
that there's one person
that says, oh yeah,

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.085
that's a good reason.

00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:14.460
For two reasons, one is that
they'll like you a lot more.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.920
OK, these people, they
go to their own forums.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.600
There's a lot of
Mechanical Turk forums.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.530
There's hundreds of them.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.600
And they tell each other
what things they should do.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.350
They do a good job of
policing each other.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.049
They're like, they try never
to post answers to things,

00:34:27.049 --> 00:34:29.340
or like, oh you can do this
by answering this question.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:29.670
No.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.878
It's like, they don't tolerate
that because they know

00:34:31.878 --> 00:34:35.250
that we don't tolerate that.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.960
You want them to like
you in that sense.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.920
You want to get good
reviews on these things.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.056
And one way to garner good
favor is to communicate.

00:34:42.056 --> 00:34:44.139
The other reason is because
it's just a good idea.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:45.250
These are people in the public.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.469
You wouldn't think
about not answering

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.260
a question of someone
who came into the lab

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.650
and asked you something.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.260
Keep in mind, there's a real
people behind the screen.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.194
Make sure that you treat
them as real people.

00:34:54.194 --> 00:34:56.610
I don't mean-- I sound like
I'm berating you or something,

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.530
like that you guys have not been
communicating and it's awful.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.160
No.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.035
That's not the point.

00:35:00.035 --> 00:35:02.040
I'm sure you all mean
to do that I'm just

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.200
trying to emphasize it.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.120
Like I said before,
don't reject unless it's

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.500
an extreme situation.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.200
Also, decide ahead of time
how you're going to reject.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.970
Decide ahead of time
on a catch question,

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:13.416
something I'll get
to in a second.

00:35:13.416 --> 00:35:15.540
And say, I'm going to reject
people if they do this

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.220
and stick to it.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.350
Because otherwise, if you
don't do that, then when

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.766
it comes time to actually try
to write a paper you'll say,

00:35:21.766 --> 00:35:24.374
well, I think I'll try throwing
out all the people that did it

00:35:24.374 --> 00:35:26.790
in under 20 seconds because I
don't think they were paying

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.110
attention that much.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.154
Maybe 30 seconds.

00:35:29.154 --> 00:35:31.070
Yeah, this test should
really take 40 seconds.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.250
You got the point.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.310
Decide ahead of time on
the rejection criteria.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.000
Have good catch questions.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.390
This is good both for, you
know, knowing who to reject

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:41.340
and making sure that
they're paying attention.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.510
Catch questions are
the sort of thing

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.920
that you would put in
the middle of your survey

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.840
or at the end of survey, or at
the start of the survey, just

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.760
to make sure that they
are paying attention.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.872
Ideally it would be also
that they have actually

00:35:49.872 --> 00:35:51.330
read the instructions
and know what

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:52.900
they're supposed to be doing.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.240
So sometimes even if
they're paying attention,

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.280
they didn't get the instructions
or something like that.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.279
There's a bunch of different
ways of doing this.

00:35:58.279 --> 00:36:00.312
One way of doing
it, you know, I'm

00:36:00.312 --> 00:36:02.520
sure you guys can come up
with your own ways I'm just

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.853
giving you some examples of
the stuff that people I know

00:36:04.853 --> 00:36:05.550
have done.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.530
Toby, for example,
that you've seen

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.305
doing some counterfactual
stuff maybe,

00:36:09.305 --> 00:36:11.430
he just gives people a
screen with the instructions

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:12.380
and asks them some questions.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.650
And until they get
the question right,

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.191
they don't move onto
the next screen.

00:36:15.191 --> 00:36:16.960
So he doesn't reject them later.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.270
He just says, in order to
pass to the next screen,

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.061
you have to answer this
question correctly.

00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:22.761
And he has some way
of checking that.

00:36:22.761 --> 00:36:23.760
That's been really good.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.680
Like once he implemented
that, the data is

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.654
much, much better and cleaner.

00:36:27.654 --> 00:36:29.070
Here's the sort
of catch questions

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.520
you don't necessarily
want to do.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.790
They're very popular.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.373
You don't necessarily
want to do them.

00:36:34.373 --> 00:36:36.990
They're things like, have you
ever had a fatal heart attack.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.500
And the answer
is, of course, no.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.430
Have you ever eaten
a sandwich on Mars.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.270
It's the sort of
thing that like you're

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.400
trying to catch people that are
going through it very quickly

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.320
and are just marking
things randomly.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.520
One of the reasons you
don't want to do that

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.853
is because even if they're
answering randomly yes or no,

00:36:49.853 --> 00:36:53.590
you'll still miss 50% who
just got it right by error.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:55.619
The other reason is
the standard stuff.

00:36:55.619 --> 00:36:57.910
I mean, I'm sure you guys
could come up with something.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:59.100
But there's a lot of
examples out there.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.475
The two examples
I just gave you,

00:37:00.475 --> 00:37:02.280
the Martian, the
fatal heart attack,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.340
this is stuff that gets used
over and over and over again.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.190
And they sort of just know it.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:09.750
One of them said
like, any time I

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.306
see the person I
told you before was

00:37:11.306 --> 00:37:13.680
like juggling kids and trying
to answer at the same time.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.750
He says, oh yeah, whenever
I see the word vacuum,

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.450
I know it's time for
an attention check

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:18.450
because it's going to
be like, have you ever

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.824
eaten a sandwich in a vacuum
or like something like that.

00:37:20.824 --> 00:37:23.460
But whenever I see vacuum, it's
obviously an attention check.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.552
You don't want to do that.

00:37:24.552 --> 00:37:26.010
Ideally, you want
to have something

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.810
that relates to the task.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:29.520
So in one of our
examples, we were

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.260
doing some sort of Turing task.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.290
And we just wanted
to say, like, here,

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.970
complete the following sentence.

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.760
You were playing
the game against a--

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.080
and then it's an open text box.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.205
OK, some of these people
have like automatic robots

00:37:42.205 --> 00:37:43.170
that fill it in.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.210
So they'll do
something like, thanks.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.110
Or yes.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.410
Or something like that.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:50.010
Then they just hope
that yes will match.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.490
But here the correct
answer was robot.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.240
You were playing the
game against a robot,

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.700
or against a human, or
something like that.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.690
Did people get that example?

00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:59.232
OK.

00:37:59.232 --> 00:38:00.690
So ideally, the
good catch question

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:02.482
is an open field,
something that's

00:38:02.482 --> 00:38:04.440
not just you can click
and get right by mistake

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.148
and relates something
to the instructions

00:38:06.148 --> 00:38:08.190
that you were giving.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.060
This is not a tip.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.800
This is something you should do.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.634
Again, it's trivial.

00:38:12.634 --> 00:38:14.841
You'll have to do it if
you're thinking of running it

00:38:14.841 --> 00:38:16.650
in your own university
and your university

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.570
has never done
Mechanical Turk before,

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:22.830
get IRB approval specifically
for Mechanical Turk.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:24.644
So just make sure
you get IRB approval.

00:38:24.644 --> 00:38:26.060
Make sure you get
informed consent

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.200
at the beginning of your
study, say like, we're

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.640
going to be doing this.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.460
If it's OK click on this
button that says, I agree.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.700
Usually the IRB will force
you to do that anyway.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.210
And as I said, ethical pay, I
just keep going back to that.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:45.080
OK, there's various helpful
tools for running experiments.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.580
If any of you are interested
in this, reading more about it,

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.180
much more in depth
how to actually run

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.260
an experiment and
things like that,

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.390
come talk to me afterwards.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.182
Or look at Todd
Gureckis's website.

00:38:54.182 --> 00:38:55.890
Other websites that
you should check out.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.380
These are the forums
you should probably

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.507
know about, TurkerNation,
mTurkGrind, and TurkOpticon.

00:39:01.507 --> 00:39:03.840
These are useful both to get
a sense of how your task is

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.787
doing, are people sort
of responding to it

00:39:05.787 --> 00:39:06.870
saying something about it.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.150
It's also a good place
to publicize your study.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.910
If I need 300 participants
within two hours,

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.430
I can put it on Turk and
hope the pay is enough.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:15.810
Or I can put it on mTurkGrind.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:17.619
People there have
liked our tasks before

00:39:17.619 --> 00:39:19.410
and they'll give you
a thumbs up and you'll

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.570
get 200 people within an
hour just because they

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:24.240
know about you and they know
that you're an OK person,

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.920
and you communicate.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.550
So it's a good practice
to get a user name

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.600
on one of these things,
or both of them,

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.120
when you run an
actual experiment.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.290
Explain what you're doing.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.640
Put it on there.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.850
Be willing to answer questions.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.657
TurkOpticon is the usual
thing that will then be used--

00:39:40.657 --> 00:39:42.990
this is what one of these
forums looks like, by the way.

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:46.050
They're like, you
know, oh it's terrible.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:46.611
It's Tuesday.

00:39:46.611 --> 00:39:47.610
What should we do today?

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.110
Here's how much I've done today.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.840
Somebody says, I didn't
see this posted anywhere.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.846
Very interesting to those of
you who want to do 3D printing.

00:39:54.846 --> 00:39:56.720
Then there's like the
title of the experiment

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.036
and a description of it.

00:39:58.036 --> 00:39:59.910
And people can just
click directly from there

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.074
to the experiment.

00:40:01.074 --> 00:40:03.240
Usually the experiments
that they post on the forums

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.380
looks something like this.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.630
They're getting these numbers
off of that last website

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.110
that I just mentioned,
TurkOpticon.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.740
So usually when people want to
rate you on Mechanical Turk,

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.630
they're not going to complain
to Amazon because Amazon's not

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:13.997
going to do anything about it.

00:40:13.997 --> 00:40:16.080
Like I said before,
requesters have a lot of power

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.470
and Amazon doesn't bother
to arbitrate, usually.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.110
So one of the ways that they
do have of either rewarding

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.660
or punishing you is
to go to TurkOpticon

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.970
and give you a rating for
communication, generosity,

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.580
fairness, and promptness.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.010
And those numbers will then
be used on most of the forums

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.134
when you publish your task.

00:40:33.134 --> 00:40:36.000
People can see, like, these guys
have actually cheated people

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.310
before, or something like that.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.780
So you can go, once you've
registered, go to TurkOpticon

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.770
and you can check out your own
ratings and things like that.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:49.104
So yeah, in summary, Mechanical
Turk is a wonderful resource.

00:40:49.104 --> 00:40:51.520
I hope I haven't scared you
away from it, those of you who

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.830
are thinking about doing it.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.990
It amplifies everything.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.480
You can do a lot
more a lot faster.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.310
But it doesn't get
rid of concerns,

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:00.640
it amplifies those concerns.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.849
So things like ethical
concerns and payment concerns,

00:41:02.849 --> 00:41:05.140
and things like that, the
sort of same sort of concerns

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.680
that you would have in the
lab, those are included there,

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.140
and other magnified
100-fold because you're

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.890
recruiting a lot more people.
