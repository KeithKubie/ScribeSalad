Wow! Congratulations! In this unit we've learned a powerful new predictive tool.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The conservation of energy. We can learn about work and power.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I can answer your problems like the problem of keeping the Netherlands dry

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
in terms of their energy requirements.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Next time, we're going to see how the conservation of energy will help us create incredible

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
timekeeping devices that will let us answer the question--

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
