00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:01.407
- [ Voiceover] Which
of the following graphs

00:00:01.407 --> 00:00:03.764
can represent the hyperbola, y squared

00:00:03.764 --> 00:00:08.764
over nine minus x squared
over four is equal to one.

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:10.623
And we have our four choices here.

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:13.584
Choices A and C open up to the top

00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:16.567
and the bottom or up and down.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.307
Choices B and D, you could see D here,

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:21.385
open to the left and the right.

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:22.685
And you can see within the ones

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:23.892
that open up to the left, to the right

00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:27.445
or the up, down ones, they
have different vertices.

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:28.941
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:30.532
and see if you can figure out,

00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:33.063
which of the following graphs represent

00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:35.210
the equation of a hyperbola, or the graphs

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.904
of this equation right over here.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.052
Alright, so there's a bunch
of ways to think about it.

00:00:40.052 --> 00:00:40.981
One thing you might say, well,

00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.001
what's the center of this hyperbola?

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.881
And since in our equation, we just have

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.482
a simple y squared or a simple x squared

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:50.326
we know that the center is
going to be at zero, zero.

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:51.829
If the center was anywhere else,

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.829
if the center was at the point h comma k,

00:00:57.726 --> 00:01:01.267
then this equation
would be y squared minus

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:02.939
the y-coordinate of the center.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:06.584
Sorry, not y-squared,
it would be y minus k,

00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:11.181
so y minus the y-coordinate of
the center squared over nine

00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:14.002
minus x minus the x-coordinate

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:17.822
of the center squared
over four is equal to one.

00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:19.958
And in this case, well,
this is just a case,

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.022
where k and h, or h and
k, are both equal to zero.

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:24.178
So we just get, you could view this

00:01:24.178 --> 00:01:27.927
as y minus zero squared
and x minus zero squared.

00:01:27.927 --> 00:01:31.596
So the center in this case
is going to be at zero, zero.

00:01:31.596 --> 00:01:34.567
And you see that for all of them.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:35.972
Now the next question you might ask,

00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:38.237
well, is this going to
be opening up and down,

00:01:38.237 --> 00:01:40.325
or is it going to be
opening left and right?

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:42.010
And the key thing to realize is that

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.913
you just need to look at whichever term,

00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:45.828
and when it's written in
standard form like this,

00:01:45.828 --> 00:01:49.671
when you have y minus k
squared over something squared

00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:52.294
minus x minus h squared over something

00:01:52.294 --> 00:01:53.449
squared is equal to one.

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:54.657
Or it could be the other way around.

00:01:54.657 --> 00:01:57.257
The x-term might be positive

00:01:57.257 --> 00:01:58.929
and then the y-term would be negative,

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.531
if we're dealing with the hyperbola.

00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:03.456
So the key is to just look at
whichever term is positive.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.393
That will tell you which
direction the hyperbola opens in.

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:09.714
Since the y-term here is
the one that is positive,

00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:11.931
it tells us that this hyperbola is

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:16.192
going to open up and down.

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:18.131
Now you could just memorize that

00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:19.720
but I, that's never too satisfying.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.681
I always want to know why does that work.

00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:26.976
And the key thing to
realize is, if the y-term

00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:30.656
is positive than you can set
the other term equal to zero.

00:02:30.656 --> 00:02:31.956
And the way you would set the other term

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:34.116
equal to zero in this case is by making

00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:38.062
your x equal to the
x-coordinate of your center

00:02:38.062 --> 00:02:41.558
and that's zero, so if
x is, if you, x is equal

00:02:41.558 --> 00:02:43.264
to the x squared of your center

00:02:43.264 --> 00:02:46.699
and this term becomes
zero, you can actually

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.185
solve this equation.

00:02:48.185 --> 00:02:51.703
You can solve y squared
over nine equals one.

00:02:51.703 --> 00:02:54.803
So if x is equal to zero, so x is equal

00:02:54.803 --> 00:02:56.800
to the x-coordinate of its center,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.261
then this term goes away and you would get

00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:03.324
y squared over nine is equal to one.

00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:06.655
Or y squared is equal to nine.

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:10.324
Or y is equal to plus or minus three.

00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:13.860
So you know that the coordinates,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.870
the x-coordinate of the
center, plus or minus three.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.156
That they're on the
hyperbola, that they're,

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:21.479
and so you know that it's going

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.257
to open upwards and downwards so you go

00:03:23.257 --> 00:03:25.160
to the center, the
x-coordinate of the center

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.979
plus three and minus three
are on the hyperbola.

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:29.768
Notice over here.

00:03:29.768 --> 00:03:33.448
Plus three and minus three
are not on this hyperbola.

00:03:33.448 --> 00:03:34.825
In fact, if plus three and minus three

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:36.207
were on this hyperbola, you wouldn't

00:03:36.207 --> 00:03:39.260
be able to open up to
the right and the left.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.186
And so that's why,
whichever term is positive,

00:03:42.186 --> 00:03:46.202
that is the direction that
you open up or down with,

00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:48.686
or if, so if the x-term was
positive we would be opening

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:51.321
to the left and the right,
for the exact same reason.

00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:53.914
And you can see, if we did
it the other way around,

00:03:53.914 --> 00:03:57.559
if we had the y equaling the
y-coordinate of the center,

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.589
so this term, if the
y-term was zeroed out,

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:02.249
you would end up with negative x

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.652
squared over four is equal to one.

00:04:04.652 --> 00:04:06.870
Which is the same thing
as x squared over four

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.560
is equal to negative
one, which is equal to

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.021
x squared is equal to negative four.

00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:15.459
I just multiplied both
sides by negative one there.

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.386
And then I multiplied both sides by four

00:04:17.386 --> 00:04:19.604
and this has no solution.

00:04:19.604 --> 00:04:22.099
And so that's why we
know that we're not going

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.302
to intercept the, we're not
going to intercept the line.

00:04:26.302 --> 00:04:28.624
We're never going to
have a situation where

00:04:28.624 --> 00:04:33.279
y is equal to the
y-coordinate of the center.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:38.279
So that's, so y is never
going to be equal to zero.

00:04:38.515 --> 00:04:41.359
In this case, in cases B and D, y,

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.263
there are points where y equals zero.

00:04:43.263 --> 00:04:45.585
So the thing to realize is whichever term

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:48.359
is positive, that, and
whatever variable that is,

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:50.797
so if it's the y-variable,
that's the direction

00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:52.759
we're going to open up in.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.059
And when I figured out what the

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.799
actual vertices are, we
saw that the point zero,

00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:58.656
plus or minus three are on the graph,

00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:01.013
so A looks like a really good candidate.

00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:03.079
If we look at the other
choice, it opens up and down.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.958
It doesn't have zero, plus
or minus three on the graph.

00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.978
It has zero, plus or minus two.

00:05:07.978 --> 00:05:12.978
So we can feel pretty good
that, about, choice A.
