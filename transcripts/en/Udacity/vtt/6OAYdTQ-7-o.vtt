00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.670
Maybe this is not a great example.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.460
But I want to say if we were in the
situation, what would we we actually do?

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.260
I mean if it really is kind, if we're
doing don't boost reach for example.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.920
What would you do to encourage me to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.820
maybe participate in
the other nash equilibrium?

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.190
&gt;&gt; I guess I would just state
that's what we're going to do and

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.210
you have no reason not to do it.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah but I'd be like I have
no reason to do it either.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.130
&gt;&gt; This is true, but

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.470
since all the utilities are inside
the Matrix, might as well just do it.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.224
&gt;&gt; I might as well not do it.

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:26.978
&gt;&gt; Well, you gotta do something.

00:00:26.978 --> 00:00:28.382
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to don't boost.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:29.256
&gt;&gt; But why?
They're both the same.

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:31.270
They're both 0.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.130
I thought you wanted to make me happy?

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.150
&gt;&gt; That's not game theory.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.260
Me making you happy is not game theory.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.540
Game theory is about utilities.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.190
So is there anything that you could
do to change the utility for me?

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.710
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.760
I could offer you a banana.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.870
&gt;&gt; Aha!

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.710
Could share.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.550
Yes, and so the essence of what happens
in Cocoa Values is that we're going to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.390
talk about making side payments.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.220
So the punch line is going to be we're
going to do this thing that actually

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.580
benefits us mutually.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.720
Like the sum of the payoffs is maximal.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.970
And then we're going to
dispense the spoils.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.740
Right, we're going to get
as many bananas as we can.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.962
And then give them out in
a way that's fair sort of.

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:13.330
A priori might not be so
obvious what would be fair.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.600
Like maybe I would say I'd hold out for

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.172
no I'm not going to give you boost
unless you give me three of the bananas.

00:01:18.172 --> 00:01:19.540
You can keep just one.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.110
But it's going to turn out
in this particular case that

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.470
one banana payment
actually is justifiable.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.880
&gt;&gt; That's cool because
that's what I was thinking.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.678
I was thinking,
look man I'll give you one banana.

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:32.010
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Now what if this was forty?

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.960
Would you still feel like
one banana would suffice.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.720
&gt;&gt; For me?
Yeah.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.710
&gt;&gt; But for
me to act to actually give you a boost?

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.800
&gt;&gt; I guess you would expect more.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.080
&gt;&gt; Maybe more.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.026
&gt;&gt; So I don't know that I
really thought this through.

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:49.560
But if, when the number was four like
look I can get two if I want to.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.320
So, really this is about why
don't we split the extra benefit?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.000
&gt;&gt; There, nice nice.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.590
Okay and
that is a really powerful intuition for

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.880
understanding how these things go.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.380
&gt;&gt; Okay.
