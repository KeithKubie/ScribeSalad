00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:15.460
The Hindenburg disaster will probably always
be remembered as the singular event that killed

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.800
airship travel.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.820
In truth, there were other events that occurred
which also contributed, but none stand out

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.730
in the public consciousness more than the
demise of the Hindenburg.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.600
The image of that huge ship falling from the
sky and erupting into flames before burning

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.570
to nothing in seconds was too jarring for
the public to ever put their trust in these

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.600
giants of sky again.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.970
However, few realise that the disaster, though
terrible, wasn’t as bad as it seemed at

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.970
first glance.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.500
For example, more than half of the people
involved in the crash actually survived it.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.100
The final death toll for people on board was
as follows: of the 97 people on board (36

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.770
passengers and 61 members of the crew) only
35 of them were killed.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.809
(The actual death toll is logged as 36, since
the crash also killed a crewman working on

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:02.809
the ground.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.170
A German Shepherd dog, Ulla, aboard also lost
her life, if you want to count the canine.)

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.790
This puts the survival rate for humans in
the disaster at well over 60%, though 100%

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.170
of the dogs aboard were killed, which presumably
had the effect of dogs the world over swearing

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.170
off airship travel.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.490
So how did over 60% of the people travelling
on an exploding ball of gas hundreds of feet

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.960
in the air survive when they had literally
only seconds to react and escape?

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.950
The short answer is that most jumped out of
the window before the Hindenburg hit the ground.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.619
Yes, as unbelievable as it sounds, a good
number of the passengers survived the disaster

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.009
by just waiting for the airship to be a split
second from crashing into the ground before

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.009
escaping.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.820
(In the video below, you can actually see
a bunch of them running away from the ship.)

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.049
However, not all the passengers were as lucky,
with some opting to leap from the craft when

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.380
it was still high in the air, sending them
plummeting to their inevitable death.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.270
Several passengers who didn’t have a chance
to escape before the ship hit the ground were

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.179
also later pulled out of the wreckage alive,
meaning the people who leapt to their deaths

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.179
would have almost certainly been more likely
to survive if they’d stayed on the giant

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.179
exploding airship.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.179
So the ones who kept their heads and the ones
who were deer in headlights seem to have had

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.179
the best survival strategy over the “OH
MY GOD THE SHIPS EXPLODING!!” jumpers.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.729
So at this point, you might be wondering,
“What caused the Hindenburg disaster?”

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.270
On the evening of May the 3rd, 1937, the LZ
129 Hindenburg, now colloquially known as

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.369
“The Hindenburg” was preparing for its
final and history changing flight from Frankfurt,

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.369
Germany.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.580
The airship sailed for 3 days with no incident
until around 7 PM on May 6th as it approached

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.784
the Lakehurst Naval Air Station which coincidentally
is in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:22.599
It’s noted that the airship went through
its usual docking procedure for around 25

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.630
minutes before the very first signs that something
terrible was about to happen presented themselves.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.730
At approximately 7:25 PM, eyewitnesses at
the time claimed that they saw a “glowing

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.560
aura” coming from the tail section of the
ship.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.650
This aura was later presumed to be either
fire or static electricity.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.000
Regardless of what the aura was, the entire
ship was soon in flames and within seconds

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.390
it had burnt and crashed to the ground.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.581
No one actually knows how long it took for
the ship to burn; eyewitness accounts of the

00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:56.890
time consistently indicate that the airship
took between 30–40 seconds to burn off all

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.260
the hydrogen and the skin of the craft.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.780
However, since no cameras present filmed the
entire crash from start to finish, it has

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.420
been impossible to confirm these reports either
way.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.379
Perhaps due to this inconsistency in data,
most sources use the phrase “within seconds”,

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.430
like we just did in the last paragraph as
it sounds more dramatic that way.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.052
I mean, really, if it took 20 minutes, it’s
still technically within seconds as 20 minutes

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.590
is of course just 1200 seconds.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.459
Literally “within seconds” has no bounds.

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.670
This how modern journalism works.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.670
😉

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.629
As for what caused the fire, again, no one
is entirely sure.

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.280
Airship crash investigation techniques weren’t
exactly top notch back in 1937 and even today,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.880
the cause of the fire is a source of a significant
amount of debate.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.330
That being said, at the time of the disaster,
many theories were put forward.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.441
The two most enduring were that the fire was
caused by sabotage, and another that claims

00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:51.040
the fire was the result of static electricity
igniting the hydrogen the Hindenburg used

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.040
to fly.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.220
Not surprisingly, the sabotage theory has
been largely debunked owing to the fact that

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.909
there was zero evidence of any sabotage at
the time, and no one has managed to come up

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.040
with any tangible evidence since.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.530
As such, most sources today agree that the
fire and resulting crash was the result of

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.909
an accidental static spark of some kind.

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.120
This is also largely believed to be the cause
of the mysterious “blue aura” eyewitnesses

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.700
claimed to have seen.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.860
So what caused the static charge?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.360
Originally it was believed that a static spark
of some sort was perhaps caused by a build

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.860
up of electrical potential on the craft from
friction between the Hindenburg and the ambient

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.860
air.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.050
There was probably a difference of potential
between the skin of the craft and the internal

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.050
frame, as the cords used as separators provided
insufficient conductivity to keep the charge

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.550
equal; thus, a spark occurred igniting the
hydrogen within the airship.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.250
This is more or less what was concluded in
the original investigation back in 1937.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.620
Yet, modern investigators have come up with
a slight twist on that theory.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.720
This second theory, first put forward by NASA
scientist and hydrogen expert, Addison Bain,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.030
states that that spark that probably caused
the fire most likely ignited the Hindenburg’s

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.790
coating first, instead the hydrogen within
it.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.070
But in either case, the result was the same:
zzzzzt -&gt; Boom -&gt; IT BURNS US!!!

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.070
-&gt; OH THE HUMANITY!!!

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.360
Arguments have been thrown back and forth
for both theories, culminating in a special

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.770
Mythbusters episode where it was concluded
that it was indeed the hydrogen that originally

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.780
caused the fire.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:06:10.790
Which of course just caused more arguments-
proof if it was ever needed that people should

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:28.040
never try and prove things… or really try
anything at all.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:45.470
You know what 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:55.280
the first step towards failure is?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.580
Trying to do something.
