1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.520
What Jamie said,
this is what yours looks like,
but it has light.
Oh,
that's bad.

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:07.050
A similar,
she goes,
looks like Sorta,
sorta not like black.
And it's like,
whoa.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.820
Mine is mine is the state of the art.
You have lights inside of yours?
No,

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.390
there's no lights.
No lights,
Bro.
Yeah,
I know what I'm doing.
Yeah,
I've been,

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.090
I had one of these in 2002 so I've had one forever.
Huh?
I loved them.

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.650
We should all love them.
Yeah.

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.830
I think one of the best tools ever for like thinking what else is a good

8
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:30.690
thinking tool?
Marijuana.
Yeah.
I heard you like marijuana.
Do you know,

9
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:33.270
like I,
you know what you have interesting thing for you.

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.420
What are you going to things?
Um,
so because I'm on a budget,

11
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.450
I left my job and everything.
I stayed at a hostel.
Dan,

12
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.830
I'm doing some broke people's Shit,
right?
You're saying hostile?
Probably not.

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.620
I've never stayed at a hostel.
So a in case you don't know what a hostile is,

14
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.810
which everyone listening to some of the is it's,

15
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.310
I shared a room with three other people with bunk beds.
Right,
right.
So,

16
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
you know,
Massachusetts just said,
hey listen,
you know,

17
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.820
we're gonna allow marijuana,
but it's still kind of like a taboo thing.
Right.

18
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:04.500
They don't want it getting too widespread.
So when I came here to the hostile,
uh,

19
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.880
I walked in and there's a giant bag of marijuana on the table and I was like,

20
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.180
I'm sorry if someone's selling this.
Is this like,
no,
it's for you man.

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.090
Like we welcome all the guests like this.
You could have as much as you want.

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.710
I was like,
where am I?
Or
Dude,
crazy,

23
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.190
crazy shit.
Now you reels smoke box the other day?
Yeah,

24
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.200
I think I'm just starting to be non,
not high really from that,

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.890
from the other day.
So is it out yet?
I don't know if he's released yet.
Anyway,

26
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.130
they gave me a bag of weed that every time I opened up the trunk of my Tesla,

27
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:37.740
it's like,
whoa.
So what?
So over a skunk.

28
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.290
I'm not very familiar with with smoking marijuana.

29
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:44.460
I think I've done it like once you work for the government,
I don't know.

30
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.560
I don't like once and it's like I try to be cool like,
yeah,
you smoke,
right?

31
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:53.610
I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Who Does it right then?
So I was,

32
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.730
so they offered me this big bag of weed and I was like terrified.
I should be,

33
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.820
because the thing is like if I try it,
I want to be where I'm somewhere safe.

34
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.120
I'm not going do Croak.
It's only marijuana.
It's not like,
you know,

35
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.830
you don't want to freak out.
Right.
That could happen and you,

36
00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:07.860
you should only take a little,
like if you're gonna,

37
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.560
if you're gonna say this is what you do,
you go like this,
like this,

38
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:14.130
like it's a little,
yeah,
just a touch.
You know,

39
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.840
there's the smoke box.
First of all,
be real smoke me in Tacoma,

40
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.060
I quit maybe five minutes into the smoke box and I was like,

41
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.170
what in the fuck am I doing?

42
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:25.790
We got high before we got into the smoke box to somebody.

43
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.300
So it's still the souls of stoners.

44
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:30.870
So smoke box and you quit or were you in a car?
It was like a dedicated system.

45
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.800
That's the car.
It's a,
an old Cadillac look.
A barbecued.
I am.

46
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:37.800
I can't even keep my eyes open.
Wait,
that's you a,
yeah.
I'm like,

47
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:40.500
I can't believe you still smoke cause even look like you.
Exactly.
I'm so high.

48
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.050
I'm on another dimension.
Holy Shit.
Let's look.
You're freaking great.

49
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:48.000
Grandfather looked at me.
Uh,
that's followed lighting.

50
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.950
But the uh,
that's crazy.

51
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.980
What be real does is he gets you in that car and then everybody has a fat tube,

52
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.400
like a big giant joint of the most ridiculous weed on the planet earth.

53
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.950
Those nuns stronger.
So why not?
So I don't understand.

54
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.920
What's the point of having a joint?
Just go in the car and get high that way.

55
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:08.770
Everybody's so hot.
You can't breathe.
There's no air in there.

56
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.770
When I got out of there,
my inside of my mouth was cooked.
Yeah.

57
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:14.660
If he's never smoked weed,
he doesn't understand the hotbox constant on it.

58
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.160
I don't understand this sound busy.
All that smoke you're breathing in,
right?

59
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.641
So you're,

60
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:21.400
you're smoking it so you're getting high from that and then you breathe in and

61
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.070
other people smoke.
You get an extra hot.
That's what I'm saying.
There's no air,

62
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.140
so why don't I just go in there and just be like,
Hey,
you know what?

63
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:28.380
I'm just going to sit in here for five minutes and get high than,
yeah,

64
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.720
you'd get high from that.
I probably wouldn't get really high from that.

65
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.860
Your professional?
Yeah.
He smoked every day?
No.
Okay.
Every other day?
No.

66
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.370
Sundays on,
no,
but I've been taking this stuff every day.
Is that the DMT?

67
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:42.490
This is CBD with THC.

68
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:46.060
It's 10 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD.

69
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.150
So it's not a lot of THC,
but it's enough.

70
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.270
So you just put those pills in like your coffee or something?
I just swallow it.

71
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.540
It's like a little joke cap.
Well isn't that like not fun because it's not,

72
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.470
you're not smoking.
It looks like it's like a fish oil pill.
Yeah,
exactly.

73
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.030
But it's CBD oil with THC.
It's a hemp oil.
So you just,

74
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.470
you just pop it in and you're like,
oh swallow it.
No,
I take that back.

75
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.090
I did have a marijuana chocolate.
When was this?
Yeah,
this was like,

76
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.390
uh,
last year.
How'd it go?
Nothing.
It was,
it was like nothing.

77
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:14.230
I probably didn't take enough.

78
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:16.690
My friends like you didn't take enough so I had it and they're like an hour,

79
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.780
an hour later.
This is dumb.
I just sat there,

80
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.420
got a little high and I was just like,
Nah,

81
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:25.480
it wore off and went to sleep and it was fine.
I didn't take enough.
Yeah,

82
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:28.390
you definitely didn't take it though.
Yeah,
I was worried the other way.
Yes.

83
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:31.090
Way Too much.
Like this is dumb and to have like five more pieces of Trump's,

84
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.081
that's what people do.

85
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:34.810
The worst thing anybody could ever say when they eat pot is,
man,

86
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:37.650
I don't feel shit is dumb.
And then they take another one.
Yeah.

87
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.620
And then it kicks in and then it gets in your DNA and you're like,
oh no.

88
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:43.810
Then your kids are high and then you're a wild ride.

89
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.720
You're on a ride for like hours.
Really?
Oh my God.

90
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:51.721
I have a friend who ate too many edibles and he was high for 27 or 28 hours.

91
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.350
Wow.
A full day later,
he was still high and it took like four hours after that.

92
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.590
What is this guy's doing?
The leaf blower.
What does that do?

93
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:04.530
And it's making a giant hotbox out of this [inaudible] biggest fans go crazy.

94
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.931
It gets,

95
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:08.480
and why you would want to see some stoners like that girl right there at,

96
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.510
they just get too high.
Yeah,
like me.
So it was in the hot box.
Like what?

97
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:17.080
Can you not do?
Everything.
Can't do anything.
So good at talking.

98
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:20.650
So is it like getting drunk?
No,
no,
no,
no.

99
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.360
You get paranoid and get freaked out.

100
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.710
I think about people you fingered in high school.
Oh,
you start,
you'll fucking,

101
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:29.700
you comb over everything you've ever done,
ever.

102
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.450
That might be even remotely questionable.
