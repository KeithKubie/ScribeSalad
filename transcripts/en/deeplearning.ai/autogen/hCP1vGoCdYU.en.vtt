full-blown neural network let's say that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
full-blown neural network let's say that
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010
full-blown neural network let's say that
we're trying to compute a function J

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
we're trying to compute a function J
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110
we're trying to compute a function J
which is a function of three variables a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
which is a function of three variables a
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.020
which is a function of three variables a
B and C and let's say that function is

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
B and C and let's say that function is
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.500
B and C and let's say that function is
three times a plus B times C computing

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
three times a plus B times C computing
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.600
three times a plus B times C computing
this function actually has three

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
this function actually has three
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.240
this function actually has three
distinct steps the first is you need to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
distinct steps the first is you need to
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.090
distinct steps the first is you need to
compute what is B times C and let's say

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
compute what is B times C and let's say
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340
compute what is B times C and let's say
we store that in a variable called u so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
we store that in a variable called u so
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.430
we store that in a variable called u so
U is equal to B times C and then you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
U is equal to B times C and then you
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.760
U is equal to B times C and then you
might compute to be musical a times u so

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
might compute to be musical a times u so
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.240
might compute to be musical a times u so
let's say you know this is V and then

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
let's say you know this is V and then
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.530
let's say you know this is V and then
finally your output J is V times V so

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
finally your output J is V times V so
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.969
finally your output J is V times V so
this is your final function J you trying

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
this is your final function J you trying
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.270
this is your final function J you trying
to compute we can take these three steps

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280
to compute we can take these three steps
 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850
to compute we can take these three steps
and draw them in a computation graph as

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
and draw them in a computation graph as
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.539
and draw them in a computation graph as
follows

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
follows
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.890
follows
let's say I draw your three variables a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
let's say I draw your three variables a
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.560
let's say I draw your three variables a
B and C here so the first thing we did

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
B and C here so the first thing we did
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.090
B and C here so the first thing we did
was compute u equals B times C I'm going

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
was compute u equals B times C I'm going
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.999
was compute u equals B times C I'm going
to put a rectangular box around that and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
to put a rectangular box around that and
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.880
to put a rectangular box around that and
so the inputs of that are B and C and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
so the inputs of that are B and C and
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.770
so the inputs of that are B and C and
then you might have V equals a plus u so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
then you might have V equals a plus u so
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.910
then you might have V equals a plus u so
the inputs to that ah B so the inputs to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
the inputs to that ah B so the inputs to
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.830
the inputs to that ah B so the inputs to
that are you which we just computed

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
that are you which we just computed
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.219
that are you which we just computed
together with a and then finally we have

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
together with a and then finally we have
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.780
together with a and then finally we have
J equals three times B so as I can

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790
J equals three times B so as I can
 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.380
J equals three times B so as I can
for example if equals five B equals V

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390
for example if equals five B equals V
 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.820
for example if equals five B equals V
and C equals two then du equals BC would

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
and C equals two then du equals BC would
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.570
and C equals two then du equals BC would
be six V equals a plus u be five plus

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580
be six V equals a plus u be five plus
 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.210
be six V equals a plus u be five plus
six and eleven J is three times at so J

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220
six and eleven J is three times at so J
 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.610
six and eleven J is three times at so J
is equal to 33 and and indeed hope you

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620
is equal to 33 and and indeed hope you
 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.820
is equal to 33 and and indeed hope you
can verify that you know this is a three

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830
can verify that you know this is a three
 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.680
can verify that you know this is a three
times five plus three times two and if

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690
times five plus three times two and if
 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.700
times five plus three times two and if
you expand that out

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710
you expand that out
 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.890
you expand that out
you know you actually get so these three

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900
you know you actually get so these three
 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.920
you know you actually get so these three
has the value of J so the computation

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
has the value of J so the computation
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.310
has the value of J so the computation
