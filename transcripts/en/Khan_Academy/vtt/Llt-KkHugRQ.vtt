00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.360
Welcome to the presentation
on ordering numbers.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.940
Let's get started with some
problems that I think, as you

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.270
go through the examples
hopefully, you'll understand

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.910
how to do these problems.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.700
So let's see.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:23.200
The first set of numbers that
we have to order is 35.7%,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:44.590
108.1% 0.5, 13/93,
and 1 and 7/68.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.590
So let's do this problem.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.810
The important thing to remember
whenever you're doing this type

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.820
of ordering of numbers is to
realize that these are all just

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.940
different ways to represent--
these are all a percent or a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.270
decimal or a fraction or a
mixed-- are all just different

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.680
ways of representing numbers.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.110
It's very hard to compare when
you just look at it like this,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.130
so what I like to do is I
like to convert them

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.190
all to decimals.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.100
But there could be someone who
likes to convert them all to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.220
percentages or convert them all
to fractions and then compare.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.920
But I always find decimals to
be the easiest way to compare.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.370
So let's start with this 35.7%.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.940
Let's turn this into a decimal.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.090
Well, the easiest thing to
remember is if you have a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.490
percent you just get rid of
the percent sign and

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.580
put it over 100.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:38.970
So 35.7% is the same
thing as 35.7/100.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.020
Like 5%, that's the same thing
as 5/100 or 50% is just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050
the same thing as 50/100.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:53.990
So 35.7/100, well, that
just equals 0.357.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.730
If this got you a little
confused another way to think

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.970
about percentage points is if I
write 35.7%, all you have to do

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.540
is get rid of the percent sign
and move the decimal to the

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.140
left two spaces and
it becomes 0.357.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.870
Let me give you a couple of
more examples down here.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.050
Let's say I had 5%.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.020
That is the same
thing as 5/100.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.670
Or if you do the decimal
technique, 5%, you could just

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.730
move the decimal and you
get rid of the percent.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.630
And you move the decimal over 1
and 2, and you put a 0 here.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.370
It's 0.05.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.280
And that's the same
thing as 0.05.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.380
You also know that 0.05 and
5/100 are the same thing.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.620
So let's get back
to the problem.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.772
I hope that distraction didn't
distract you too much.

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:43.190
Let me scratch out all this.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.050
So 35.7% is equal to 0.357.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.870
Similarly, 108.1%.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.080
Let's to the technique where we
just get rid of the percent and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.350
move the decimal space over
1, 2 spaces to the left.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:08.600
So then that equals 1.081.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.570
See we already know that
this is smaller than this.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.140
Well the next one is easy,
it's already in decimal form.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.040
0.5 is just going to
be equal to 0.5.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.050
Now 13/93.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.340
To convert a fraction into
a decimal we just take the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.320
denominator and divide
it into the numerator.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.350
So let's do that.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.020
93 goes into 13?

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.760
Well, we know it goes
into 13 zero times.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.990
So let's add a
decimal point here.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.550
So how many times
does 93 go into 130?

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.530
Well, it goes into it one time.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.410
1 times 93 is 93.

00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:56.550
Becomes a 10.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.960
That becomes a 2.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.700
Then we're going to
borrow, so get 37.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.590
Bring down a 0.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.010
So 93 goes into 370?

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.470
Let's see.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.790
4 times 93 would be 372,
so it actually goes into

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.695
it only three times.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.880
3 times 3 is 9.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.270
3 times 9 is 27.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.605
So this equals?

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:38.050
Let's see, this equals-- if we
say that this 0 becomes a 10.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.620
This become a 16.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.440
This becomes a 2.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.210
81.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.120
And then we say, how many
times does 93 go into 810?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.860
It goes roughly 8 times.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.860
And we could actually keep
going, but for the sake of

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.640
comparing these numbers, we've
already gotten to a pretty

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.580
good level of accuracy.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.740
So let's just stop this problem
here because the decimal

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.720
numbers could keep going on,
but for the sake of comparison

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.410
I think we've already got a
good sense of what this

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.360
decimal looks like.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.330
It's 0.138 and then
it'll just keep going.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.010
So let's write that down.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.340
And then finally, we have
this mixed number here.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.070
And let me erase some of
my work because I don't

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.840
want to confuse you.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.700
Actually, let me keep it
the way it is right now.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.120
The easiest way to convert a
mixed number into a decimal is

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.630
to just say, OK, this is 1
and then some fraction

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.920
that's less than 1.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.420
Or we could convert it to a
fraction, an improper fraction

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.790
like-- oh, actually there are
no improper fractions here.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.640
Actually, let's do it that way.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.630
Let's convert to an improper
fraction and then convert

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.110
that into a decimal.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.060
Actually, I think I'm going to
need more space, so let me

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.740
clean up this a little bit.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.595
There.

00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:01.040
We have a little more
space to work with now.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.570
So 1 and 7/68.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.700
So to go from a mixed number to
an improper fraction, what you

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.760
do is you take the 68 times 1
and add it to the

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.720
numerator here.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.000
And why does this make sense?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.120
Because this is the same
thing as 1 plus 7/68.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.680
1 and 7/68 is the same
thing as 1 plus 7/68.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.800
And that's the same thing as
you know from the fractions

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.330
module, as 68/68 plus 7/68.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:47.650
And that's the same thing
as 68 plus 7-- 75/68.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.790
So 1 and 7/68 is
equal to 75/68.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.870
And now we convert this to a
decimal using the technique

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.350
we did for 13/93.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.570
So we say-- let me
get some space.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:05.000
We say 68 goes into 75--
suspicion I'm going

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.360
to run out of space.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.160
68 goes into 75 one time.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.290
1 times 68 is 68.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.460
75 minus 68 is 7.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.350
Bring down the 0.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.490
Actually, you don't have to
write the decimal there.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.100
Ignore that decimal.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.400
68 goes into 70 one time.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.150
1 times 68 is 68.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.990
70 minus 68 is 2,
bring down another 0.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.240
68 goes into 20 zero times.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.550
And the problem's going to keep
going on, but I think we've

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.990
already once again, gotten to
enough accuracy that

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.040
we can compare.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:48.320
So 1 and 7/68 we've now figured
out is equal to 1.10-- and if

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.000
we kept dividing we'll keep
getting more decimals of

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.510
accuracy, but I think we're
now ready to compare.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.550
So all of these numbers I just
rewrote them as decimals.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.550
So 35.7% is 0.357.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.000
108.1%-- ignore this for
now because we just used

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.720
that to do the work.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.660
It's 108.1% is equal to 1.081.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.260
0.5 is 0.5.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.770
13/93 is 0.138.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.850
And 1 and 7/68 is 1.10
and it'll keep going on.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.010
So what's the smallest?

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.320
So the smallest is
0.-- actually, no.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.300
The smallest is right here.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.450
So I'm going to rank them
from smallest to largest.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.250
So the smallest is 0.138.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.640
Then the next largest
is going to be 0.357.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.470
Then the next largest
is going to be 0.5.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.460
Then you're going to have 1.08.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:54.620
And then you're going
to have 1 and 7/68.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.840
Well, actually, I'm going to do
more examples of this, but for

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.890
this video I think this is the
only one I have time for.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.910
But hopefully this gives you a
sense of doing these problems.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.370
I always find it easier
to go into the decimal

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.280
mode to compare.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.680
And actually, the hints
on the module will

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.670
be the same for you.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.040
But I think you're ready at
least now to try the problems.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.170
If you're not, if you want to
see other examples, you might

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.830
just want to either re-watch
this video and/or I might

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.530
record some more videos with
more examples right now.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.560
Anyway, have fun.
