[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:09.720
LAURA LING: What was
different about your body

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.024
when you were born?

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:12.690
EZRA FRECH: I was
actually born with one

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.020
finger on my left hand
and a full left leg,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.200
but it was curved.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.980
I had surgery when I was 2
and 1/2 years old to remove

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.280
the part that was curved.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.420
So I had a stump that they
could put a prosthetic leg on.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.365
And then they took
the big toe from that.

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:28.080
And they put it on my left hand.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.710
So I have two fingers.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.740
I did tons of physical
therapy to try

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.620
to get my new finger to
work like a real finger,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.196
and not like a toe.

00:00:36.196 --> 00:00:38.695
I was always trying to figure
out how to bring them together

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:41.500
and how to get them to
come together and touch.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.260
And I was sitting in the shower.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.240
And they touched.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.560
And then it was amazing.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.610
I was running around the house
screaming, yay, I did it.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.020
Because that was
the first milestone.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.250
LAURA LING: Do you feel
different than other kids?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.040
EZRA FRECH: Sometimes I do.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.700
People do stare and whisper.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.235
I'll be thinking, there's
tons of kids in this world.

00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:08.240
How did he happen to choose me
to be one of the kids that had

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.030
to get their leg taken away.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.660
And I asked God, can
you please give me

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.522
a leg, somehow, some way.

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:21.570
But then I have to think,
I was born like this.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.790
I can't change it.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.320
And when I play sports,
I don't feel different.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.880
I don't think about
anything else.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.890
I just think about what's
happening in the game.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.624
LAURA LING: Would you say sports
have become a ritual for you?

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:35.290
EZRA FRECH: Yes.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.790
Because I feel like if I
don't play sports every day,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.632
I feel weird.

00:01:41.632 --> 00:01:46.490
I've always felt like sports
is where I can go when

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.120
I'm sad or lonely or anything.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.492
I love competition.

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:53.030
I love the feeling.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.534
I love being under
pressure and everything.

00:01:56.534 --> 00:02:00.262
When I'm playing sports, I
go from thinking about all

00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:02.400
the other things to game mode.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.490
When I'm in the
zone, I feel like I

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.560
have this fire around me.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.220
And then the flames pop up and
have this circle around it.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.500
So any thoughts
that try to come in,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.310
and they get burned by the fire.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.990
And they don't let in.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.720
LAURA LING: Do you feel you have
to work harder than other kids?

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.810
EZRA FRECH: Oh, yes.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.350
I bet kids, when they take
a step, oh, I took a step.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.380
Big deal.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.400
For me, when I take a step,
I say, oh, no big deal.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.840
But I thought about
every little bit.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.210
I put so much
pressure on my body

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.710
from being in a prosthetic
all day, I come home.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.825
I'm like dying from back pain.

00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:39.814
And I have to stretch before
I go to bed every night.

00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:41.480
LAURA LING: So how
do you stay positive?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.355
EZRA FRECH: I have to
think about what I have

00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:44.955
instead of what I don't have.

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:47.120
I have a great life.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.510
I have a great family.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.520
I have great legs.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.560
I have great friends.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.740
I have a great school.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.210
I could go on for years.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.690
I'm just grateful that I
have so many things that

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.230
are great in my life.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.520
There's lots of challenges
in people's life.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.370
And that's a little
wall right there.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.710
So I try to break
down that wall.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.300
If I'm just running around
playing soccer or shooting

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.764
a lay-up, I don't
think about it.

00:03:15.764 --> 00:03:17.430
I don't feel different
when I'm playing.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.720
Sports because that takes
me away from my disability.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.800
But it's a good thing
that I'm born like this.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.670
I've learned to be
confident in myself.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.233
I've learned how to be strong.
