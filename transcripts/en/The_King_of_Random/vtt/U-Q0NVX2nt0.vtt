00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.100
Hey, what's up guys?

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.600
I brought you back out
to the beach again today

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.500
because I discovered a cool little trick 
for turning these fibers

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.900
on a coconut husk into a bundle of rope.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.400
It's not that difficult to do
and it's a really cool trick,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.800
especially if you find yourself
in a survival situation.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.940
Now after you bust your coconut open,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.200
one of the first things
you're going to notice

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.300
is all these hairy fibers in here.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.520
And if it's a mature coconut,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.560
like the brown ones,
it's going to be very dry.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.700
Now just go ahead and use your fingertips
and pull off the bits of that fluff.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560
We want to try
and get the finest fibers possible.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.900
Now you can see when this first
comes out of the shell.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.200
It's kind of dirty, grungy.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.200
There's some hard pieces
of fibers in there.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.400
Get rid of any of the fibers
that are a little bit too hard.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.700
We just want to keep the fine fluffy stuff
as much as possible.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.440
Now this is where things get really cool.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.960
Once you got your little ball
of coconut fuzz like this,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.600
just grab a few fibers up top.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.640
Give it a little pinch
and start twisting it,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.900
and as you're twisting,
give it a little tug,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.400
and you'll find, just like magic,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.400
it starts pulling a string right out
of the center of the fuzzy ball.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.100
And as long as you pull and twist,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.140
it'll keep that string going
until there's nothing left of the ball.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.300
It's entirely consumed.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.600
How cool is that?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.060
So there you go. Just like that,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.940
we got a little piece of cordage
made out of our coconut husk.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.400
The problem is it's not very strong.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.100
So we're going to reinforce this thing 
using a reverse twist,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.400
which isn't too difficult
once you see how it's done

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.940
Twist the cord
so you put some tension on it,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.900
the same direction
you were twisting it before.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.700
Then put it over,
pinch it with your thumb and finger,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.140
and grab the one from underneath
and do the same thing.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.380
What we're doing
is creating a reverse twist

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.540
that essentially locks
these two cords together.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.900
It binds them so they can't come undone.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.300
So you can see we've got a few inches 
of double-stranded coconut husk rope,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.500
which actually is impressively strong.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.900
It takes quite a bit to break this.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.200
Now if you want to make your rope longer,
all we have to do is

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.700
take another piece of cordage
and graft it onto the end here.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.500
And you basically do that
by running the two fibers together,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.000
unraveling them a little bit,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.200
and then breaking the fibers together
and giving it a twist.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.600
And what that essentially does,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.960
is it grafts it into one continuous piece
like we had before.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.500
You can see that
when the grafted parts are twisted it in,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.900
the cord is virtually seamless.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.260
So you can really make your rope 
about as long as you want.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.400
So check this out, guys.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.400
I just spent about 45 minutes
on the beach,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.500
made myself a little wristband, here,
out of some rope,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.380
and I got about maybe four or five feet
of rope stranded out here.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.100
Use it for a clothesline, put it
on your wrist, use it for decorations.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.880
Maybe you could use this
for making torches, candle wicks.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.000
You can double this up
and make it stronger.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.300
We're going to do that same concept again,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.760
but this time we're going
to do the opposite twist we did last time.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.600
Before we were going clockwise,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700
but this time we're going
to go counterclockwise

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.400
so that it makes a nice twist,
and we're going to go underneath.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.400
Then we're going to grab the one on top,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.300
we're going to go counterclockwise
and go underneath.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.200
And we're going to repeat that process 
for the full length of the rope here.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.400
What's cool about this is
I'm weaving it by hand,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.740
but if you look closely here,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.000
It almost looks like a legitimate rope,
doesn't it?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.800
With the double strands in there.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.500
There we go made it to the end.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.860
Now we're down to about two feet of cord,
but that's quite a bit stronger.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.800
And we can pull it
to work out some of that tension,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.820
And then if we wanted to,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.860
we could just repeat
that process all over again

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.260
and make it even stronger.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.200
There we go.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.200
So we've gone from six feet
of relatively strong rope

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.840
to about one, maybe one and a half feet,
of really strong rope.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.300
And that is holding it really good.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.580
I'd be curious to know how much weight
that would actually hold,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.140
but I'd be willing to bet it'll hold
at least 100 pounds.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:29.780
*Music*

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.800
So there you have it guys.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.020
That's how to take a coconut husk
and turn it into a rope.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.540
Any length or any thickness
you want it to be.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.500
Thanks so much for joining me
for this experiment

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.000
and I'll be looking for you
in the next one.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.200
Talk to you then.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.740
[tree branch snaps]

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.440
[laughter]

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.300
Alright, well looks like
we got some firewood.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:59.900
