00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.540
Some people faint at the sight of blood, but
me?

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.630
I like blood.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.070
It keeps me alive and healthy.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.850
And I’m not a vampire, those rumors are
totally unproven.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.039
And now there’s another reason blood makes
me happy.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:19.090
Hey gang, Julian here for DNews!

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.540
Researchers have developed a test for diagnosing
depression.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.840
Well, they already had a series of questions
they’d ask and would diagnose you based

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.140
on your responses.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.550
But now there’s an objective test and this
time it’s your blood that has the answers.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.380
The test measures the levels of nine different
RNA, which are large macromolecules that are

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.699
synthesized from your DNA and are vital to
how your genes are expressed.

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.829
Researchers used a small sample size of 64
patients total, half of them had been diagnosed

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.319
with depression and the other half were a
control group.

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:50.570
Just from the varying levels of each type
of RNA, researchers could tell who had been

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.109
diagnosed and who hadn’t.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.629
More than that, about 40% of the depressed
subjects had a different levels of these RNA

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.100
from the other 60%, and as it happens, all
of them have successfully responded to cognitive

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.300
behavioral therapy.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.150
So it’s possible we can determine who will
benefit from working with a therapist for

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.220
months with a simple blood test.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.580
But even those patients still have much higher
levels of 3 biomarkers than the control group,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.570
which could explain why most people have relapses
into depression even after successful therapy.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.500
Granted the sample size needs to be expanded
before we can say with any certainty that

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.910
this
is definitive.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.701
But it is a step towards expanding our understanding
of depression, and more importantly, it may

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:32.000
help change the way we as a society think
about it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.350
It’s estimated that in the US about 10%
of adults suffer from depression, and yet

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.700
it’s still something people feel ashamed
to seek help for.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.210
Instead of getting real care, they try to
fight it on their own and sometimes it ends

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.380
tragically.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.840
But if there is concrete evidence that some
people are hard-wired to be depressed, maybe

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.140
those who need it most will be willing to
seek help.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.140
There’s no reason that suffering from mental
illness should be any less acceptable than

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.140
a physical one.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.850
Heck, sometimes it’s even trendy to claim
to have a physical disorder, like there’s

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.420
no evidence that non-celiac gluten intolerance
exists, and yet my orange juice this morning

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.280
proudly advertised it was gluten free.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.840
If you’re living gluten free and don’t
believe me, Tara has an excellent video on

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.140
the subject that you can find here.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.180
And, to end on a lighter note, let’s talk
about what makes you happy.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.640
Let us know the one surefire way you brighten
your day in the comments.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.740
Like for me it makes me happy when people
subscribe…

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.630
I know, I know, shameless plug.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.390
I’m Julian, and this is DNews.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.940
Thanks for watching.
