00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.980
We're asked to simplify
7x plus 10 squared.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.190
And your temptation when you see
something like this might

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.990
be to just make it 7x squared
plus 10 squared and that would

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.500
be incorrect.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.020
Remember, when you're squaring
something, you're multiplying

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.390
something by itself.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.830
So this wouldn't be 7x squared
plus 10 squared.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:31.110
This is equal to 7x plus
10 times 7x plus 10.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.460
This is not equal to-- sometimes
if you said this is

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.170
7x times 10 squared, then you
could say this is equal to 7x

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.260
squared times 10 squared.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.740
You would be able to do it in
this situation right here.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.940
But that's not what's
going on here.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.460
This is 7x plus 10 squared,
which is just 7x plus 10 times

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.100
7x plus 10.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.050
So let me delete
that up there.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.450
That's probably the single
biggest point of confusion

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.980
when people first learn
to take a square of an

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.320
expression like this.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.070
So always remember that it's 7x
plus 10 times 7x plus 10.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.890
And now we can multiply
it out.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.790
So one, we could distribute this
yellow 7x plus 10 onto

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.480
each of the terms into
the green one.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:25.650
So it would be 7x plus 10
times 7x right here.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.950
So we put the 7x out front.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.260
And then we could say plus
7x plus 10 times 10.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.900
Or we could say plus 10
times 7 x plus 10.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.240
I just distributed the 7x plus
10 on each of these terms.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.090
Then you do the distributive
property again.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.570
7x times 7x is 49x squared.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.780
7x times 10 is 70x.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.990
And then you have 10 times
7x is another 70x.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.039
And then you have 10 times
10, which is 100.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.350
Now, there's something
interesting you might want to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.020
notice right now is that this
expression, it is the first

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.840
expression squared, right?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.510
7x, the whole expression
squared is 49x squared.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.860
And then you do have your
last expression squared,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.620
10 squared is 100.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.420
But then in between, you have
the product of these two

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.080
things twice, and that's just
a byproduct of having to do

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.330
all of the different
combinations of products.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.620
So the end expression, when you
simplify everything, it

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.530
becomes 49x x squared
plus 140x plus 100.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.730
So if you want to remember
a quick way of squaring a

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.470
binomial like this, and just
remember, it is coming out of

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.200
this distributive property, but
if you had to do it really

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.410
fast, it's just going to be this
first term squared, which

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.510
is that right there, plus 2
times the product of these two

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.210
terms. 7x times 10 is 70x,
and then you multiply it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.860
by 2, you get 140x.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.030
You get that right there.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.170
And then the last term is just
going to be the square of the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.280
second term right there.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.470
10 squared is 100.
