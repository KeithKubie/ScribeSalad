00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.660
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Great,
thank you, and welcome.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.387
I'm so excited.

00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:15.970
I've never been to
this Google office,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.870
and this is totally cool.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.590
It's nice to see everyone
here today, and a nice crowd,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.780
packed house.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.660
Congratulations,
Women Techmakers.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.370
Appreciate that.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.160
So I'm going to go down
and start with Saron.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.209
What we'll do is just
introduce yourselves,

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:34.000
what you're doing right
now, and then we'll

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.160
get started with
a few questions.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.090
SARON YITBAREK: Sure.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.840
Hi, everyone.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.070
I'm Saron.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.916
So I have two jobs.

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:41.290
Here I'm representing
CodeNewbie.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.110
I'm the founder.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.150
We are the most
supportive community

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.000
of programmers and
people learning to code.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.560
We have a weekly Twitter chat.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.370
I'm the host of a
weekly podcast called

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.342
the CodeNewbie podcast, which
you should all subscribe to.

00:00:52.342 --> 00:00:54.550
And then in my day job, I
actually work at Microsoft.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.210
I'm a program manager for
a new technical training

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.010
program called Tech
Jobs Academy, where

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.620
we offer four months of free
education and technical skills

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.684
for unemployed and
underemployed New Yorkers.

00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:08.350
And applications are open, so if
you know anyone, let them know.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.789
They go to techjobsacademy.com.

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:11.830
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Shanna?

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.110
SHANNA GREGORY: Yeah.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.810
Hi, everyone.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.320
I'm Shanna.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200
I am the dean of
Grace Hopper Academy,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.070
which is in the middle
of the first class.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.630
Those of you who are familiar
with web development programs,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.030
it's an immersive 13-week
program here in New York City.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.420
It's the only program in
New York that's for women,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.430
and our tuition model
is that the women

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.850
will pay once they get jobs.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.270
So trying to create
the opportunity

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.830
for those who are financially
restricted from things

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.160
like this.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.190
Very excited to be here.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.540
I have a background in
working in coding boot camps,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.616
and some of my students from
Fullstack Academy are here.

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:47.460
Very excited to
see them here now

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.430
that they're kind of flourishing
as female developers.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.942
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Rebecca?

00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:55.150
REBECCA GARCIA: Hi, everyone.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.120
Good morning.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.890
My name is Rebecca Garcia.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.480
I'm the co-founder of a
nonprofit called CoderDojo NYC.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.030
And it's part of a global
movement of free coding

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.490
clubs for youth, where we
do one-on-one mentorship

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.330
in mini hackathon-style
workshops once a month for web,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.520
game, and app development.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.540
And we also have girls' programs
and longer-term programs

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.800
for advanced iOS, Android app
development, JavaScript, things

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.300
like that, which are all free.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.920
And my day job is I
am the technical head

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.610
of product at a data API
company called Next Caller.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.580
ROSARIO ROBINSON: And
not least, but Christina.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.400
CHRISTINA MORILLO: Do
I need a microphone?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.490
Oh.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.448
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:40.880
CHRISTINA MORILLO:
So hi, everyone.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.290
My name is Christina Morillo.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.979
I'm also on Twitter
as @divinetechiegirl.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.270
I know a few of you have said
hello to me this morning.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.580
So I'm happy to be here.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.310
I'm one of the co-founders of
Women of Color in Tech Chat.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.400
So we're pretty much a
supportive community of women

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.220
and non-binary people
in the tech industry.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.360
And we're also the creators
of the Women of Color

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.748
in Tech Chat Stock Photos.

00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:06.361
So if you want to
have our stock photos,

00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:08.360
you can just search Women
of Color in Tech Chat,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.693
and you'll see our stock photos.

00:03:09.693 --> 00:03:11.000
They're also on Flickr.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.510
During the day, I'm
actually vice president

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.870
of technology and information
risk at Morgan Stanley.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.510
But don't tell them I told you.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.420
They're very strict.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.280
So anyway, I wanted
to be here, which

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.660
pretty much means I'm part of
the information security team.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.580
So I'm more of a information
sec, data security engineer.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.830
And I'm very happy to be here.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.190
Oh, and I also have three kids.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.514
So I feel your pain, girl.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.212
ROSARIO ROBINSON: And I am Rose
Robinson again with the Anita

00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:45.837
Borg Institute.

00:03:45.837 --> 00:03:48.910
I manage all of our communities.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.740
That includes Systers, our
ABI.Local, our Grace Hopper

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.472
conference, as well as our
open-source communities,

00:03:55.472 --> 00:03:58.130
which I'll talk about
a little bit later.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.380
It's really great
that Heather talked

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.160
about the last piece of the
white elephant opportunities

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.360
because that's actually
what this panel is about.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.210
It's actually women creating
opportunities in tech.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.834
And we'll hear about
some of the opportunities

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:14.125
that they've mentioned already.

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:18.029
But let's get started with maybe
just creating opportunities

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.112
for yourself in your career.

00:04:21.112 --> 00:04:22.570
Saron, do you want
to start us off?

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.840
SARON YITBAREK: Sure.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.950
Am I gonna go first
on every question?

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.450
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.070
SARON YITBAREK: That's fine.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.990
That's what I get for
being on this side.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.800
So creating
opportunities for myself.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.110
I think the biggest thing has
been to always raise my hand

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.755
when opportunities arise.

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:39.255
A great example of
that is-- are you

00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:40.760
all familiar with RailsConf?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.150
Show of hands?

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.799
So it's a really big-- I
think one of the biggest--

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:46.840
conferences for Rails
developers, and I'm a Rails

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.144
developer by trade.

00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:50.532
And I saw this conference,
and I heard from a friend

00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:52.740
that she was organizing a
different conference called

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.230
RubyConf.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.710
And I thought, man,
that's really cool.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.001
I didn't think that that was
a thing that you could do.

00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:59.922
And so I just cold-emailed
one of the organizers.

00:04:59.922 --> 00:05:01.880
And I said, hey, I'd love
to be a part of this.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.880
Any help you need,
I would love to be

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.590
a part of this organization.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.660
And this current
RailsConf, they invited

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.290
me to be on the
programming committee.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.706
So I got to review all the
talks and make recommendations.

00:05:13.706 --> 00:05:15.870
And I'm running
two of the tracks.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.600
And so for me,
creating opportunities

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.720
has been about seeing
what other people are

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.827
doing-- men or
women-- and seeing

00:05:21.827 --> 00:05:24.542
great opportunities
and really great things

00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:26.250
going on, and raising
my hand and saying,

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.791
I'd really like to
be a part of that,

00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:31.710
and not waiting to be asked, and
not waiting for an invitation.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.750
ROSARIO ROBINSON:
Yeah, thank you.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.500
SHANNA GREGORY: Yeah,
that's really great.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.560
I think for me, it's
finding one thing

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.980
that I can convince
myself I'm very good at.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.230
So starting out, I come from
creative writing and literature

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.860
background.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.500
The one thing I thought I was
good at coming out of college

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.670
was writing emails.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.510
So I found the job that I
could write the best emails.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.840
And that kind of
snowballed from there.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.160
I ended up helping
people write resumes

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.440
and creating their own stories
and narratives for becoming

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.240
developers specifically.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.030
I became very good at
helping people find a job,

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.250
and that is something that
wins you a lot of favors.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.720
And people are
very, very excited

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.386
when you're helping them prepare
for interviews and all of that.

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:14.820
And just taking one thing
and becoming good at it,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.850
and just allowing that to turn
into more and more and bigger

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.940
and bigger, and taking
on more responsibilities

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.025
and allowing yourself to attract
more skills and build that up,

00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:27.180
it just has to start with
one very small thing.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.810
If you're very good at writing
emails, you can go from there.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.920
Email as many people
as you want to.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.550
Make it as creative as you'd
like to, and then kind of allow

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.280
yourself to accept
whatever opportunities

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.216
are coming your way.

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:42.840
ROSARIO ROBINSON: And Rebecca?

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.490
REBECCA GARCIA: So I'm
a really big believer

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.100
in personal branding and sharing
what you're passionate about.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.510
And so that doesn't
necessarily mean being like,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.240
I have to share every single
thing that I eat on Twitter.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.600
Like, that's what everybody
wants to hear about.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.620
I think it's a matter of
your unique blend of what

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.200
you care about.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.450
And so I talk a lot about
mindfulness and technology

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.510
and yoga and this mix
of my own personality.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.350
And I've kind of let that
blend into other opportunities.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.100
So I blog.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.020
I'm also on Twitter
@geekgirlweb.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.670
And it's opened so
many doors for me.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.030
Twitter by itself, I've gotten
a roommate from Twitter.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.210
I've gotten speaking
opportunities

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.180
to go abroad from Twitter,
from people that I've met.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.922
That's, I believe, how we
met originally, as well.

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.130
Did we also meet off Twitter?

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.820
We also met off Twitter.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.890
So I am a huge believer in
putting yourself out there

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.260
and also finding those
opportunities for yourself

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.410
and really being able to
create yourself and create

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.200
those opportunities through
putting yourself out there.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.920
And it can be really scary
because by default, I'm

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.580
an introvert.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.940
And now I do a lot
of public speaking.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.000
And I think it's
brought me a lot of joy

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.720
to share my stories
with other people,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.202
and hopefully then in
turn inspire other people.

00:08:06.202 --> 00:08:07.410
CHRISTINA MORILLO: Thank you.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.930
Yeah, we did meet on Twitter.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:09.616
Yeah.

00:08:09.616 --> 00:08:10.990
So I forgot to
mention one thing.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.310
I'm also the community
manager for CodeNewbie.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.489
So I work with Saron.

00:08:14.489 --> 00:08:15.905
SARON YITBAREK:
And she's amazing.

00:08:15.905 --> 00:08:16.180
Amazing.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.530
CHRISTINA MORILLO: In
boosting the brand.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.310
And that was a white
elephant opportunity

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.210
because when she asked
me, I was like, why?

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.302
SARON YITBAREK: I had no
idea she felt this way.

00:08:25.302 --> 00:08:27.010
CHRISTINA MORILLO:
Meaning, like, why me?

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.390
But anyway, so I'm a big
believer in community,

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.929
very big believer in community.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.400
I feel like we need each other.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.049
We need to support each other.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.419
And when Heather mentioned
giving opportunities

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.419
to other people,
being a connector,

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.220
I'm very big on that.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.550
That's just capital
me, connector, right?

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.880
But another thing I'm big on is
taking action, so taking things

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.920
into your own hands.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.650
If you see a problem
that you think

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.540
you may be able to contribute
to, contribute to it.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.460
Don't wait for
anyone's validation,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.640
or don't wait for anyone to
give you the OK or the go-ahead.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.630
There's a problem.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.250
Try to fix it, contribute.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:06.750
That's it.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.240
That's an opportunity, right?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.880
So just a quick
example-- when I was

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.120
building the website for
Women of Color in Tech Chat,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.830
I didn't see any stock images
of people that looked like me.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.589
And I've been in the tech
industry for over 17 years.

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:20.630
And I didn't feel like
taking a selfie that night

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.754
because my hair was a mess.

00:09:21.754 --> 00:09:28.500
So anyways, I decided-- out
of anger, I started tweeting,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.240
I wish I could just
hire a photographer

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.650
and get some women of
color in technology

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.800
and take some photos.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.890
And then I said, wait, I
could hire a photographer

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.430
and get some women in
technology and take some photos.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.603
And so one of the things for
me is that anger activates.

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:44.350
So usually, like
I said, if there's

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.770
a problem that makes
you angry, by you

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.410
activating it and just realizing
it, you can take action on it.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.680
So I say that's one way
to create opportunities.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.519
And also by being
present and listening.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:59.060
Become a good
listener, because a lot

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.670
of times when you listen to
people instead of talking

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.840
so much about what
you think or you

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.450
feel-- which is also important.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.990
But if you listen
to other people,

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.790
you will hear what
opportunities they may

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.550
have that they don't even know.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.780
So someone like Shanna
could be listening

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.590
to me complain
about I need a job

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.960
and I need to update my resume.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.000
She could say, well,
hey, I'm really

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.070
good at updating resumes.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.986
And she's just created
an opportunity herself.

00:10:21.986 --> 00:10:23.560
So just kind of
working together.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.101
And that's the best
part of community.

00:10:27.101 --> 00:10:29.100
ROSARIO ROBINSON: So I
can add to that, as well.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.190
And I have a similar
story as Heather,

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.520
as well, because I was in
a career and had two kids

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.660
and really wasn't
planning for two kids.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.320
But all through school, I was
the only woman in my class.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.130
I majored in math
and computer science.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.820
And particularly
in grad school, I

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.530
was also the only
person of color.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:55.120
So to have those two, gender
and race, to challenge,

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.640
it was pretty hard.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.760
And what I did is really--
how I created opportunities

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.400
for myself was to
give myself a voice

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.120
and just make sure that I am
heard, that my issues matter

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.180
to everyone.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.630
And so that was really
important for me

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.460
in creating opportunities for
myself, but also to others.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.280
Sometimes when you're out
there speaking on Twitter,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.490
you're giving others
permission-- and not

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.840
only permission, but letting
people know that it's OK.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.550
That you're not alone.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.274
That's one of our communities
at Anita Borg Institute.

00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:31.440
It's really the flagship
that started the institute,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.740
was Systers.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.120
And Systers is really just
supporting women in technology

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.920
across the globe, similar
to what Women Techmakers is

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.130
doing right now, as well.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.780
So we really partner
really well together.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.430
So let's talk about some
of the opportunities

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.150
that you are involved in
that create opportunities

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.630
for other women in tech.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.630
And why don't-- I'm not
going to start with you.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.910
I'm going to start with
Christina this time.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.410
Christina?

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.820
CHRISTINA MORILLO: OK.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.154
So this is the last time
I'll talk about the photos.

00:12:03.154 --> 00:12:08.168
But they're very important
because representation matters.

00:12:08.168 --> 00:12:10.820
And now our photos
are on TechCrunch.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.510
And the reason why
I'm bringing them up

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.490
is because of the fact
that I know of, confirmed,

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.110
one of the women that was
featured actually got a job.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.700
She got hired by GitHub.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.644
And the reason was because
she was at a conference.

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:26.435
And she's actually in
the room, but I'm not

00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:28.393
gonna shout her out.

00:12:28.393 --> 00:12:31.940
So I believe the story goes
that she was at a conference,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.360
and someone recognized her.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.330
And they started-- he was
like, were you in the photos?

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.580
And she said yes or something.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.570
And they sparked
up a conversation.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.880
And they started talking.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.340
And if you find her, you can
talk to her about it some more.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.490
But when she told me
that, I was really

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.620
taken aback because
I just thought I was

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.970
solving a problem for myself.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.160
And I had no idea
that it could span

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.790
across different
people and different--

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.260
so it was not only
about the photos.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.267
It was about so much more.

00:13:01.267 --> 00:13:04.632
So yeah, I don't know if
that answers the questions.

00:13:04.632 --> 00:13:06.090
ROSARIO ROBINSON:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.095
I think-- and this is
the last time we'll

00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:09.820
talk about the photos, really.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.200
CHRISTINA MORILLO: I'll try.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.075
ROSARIO ROBINSON: No.

00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:18.500
But your photos actually gave
the industry an in into, OK,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.140
well, this is important.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.240
So we need to make sure
that we have representation

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.390
across the board.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.650
And now, you see your photos
on TechCrunch and Huffington

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.870
Post, all of the online.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.503
So you got to give it up
for Women of Color in Tech.

00:13:35.503 --> 00:13:36.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.440
I mean, that's exactly
what voices do.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.923
And we appreciate that.

00:13:40.923 --> 00:13:41.306
CHRISTINA MORILLO: Thank you.

00:13:41.306 --> 00:13:41.690
OK.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.773
I'll just say there's a
brand new batch coming out

00:13:43.773 --> 00:13:44.660
this month.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.160
That's it.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:45.659
That's it.

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:46.776
That's it.

00:13:46.776 --> 00:13:48.650
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Rebecca?

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.260
REBECCA GARCIA: Awesome.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.300
How come I didn't get that deal
out of being in the photos?

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.109
I didn't get a job out of it.

00:13:55.109 --> 00:13:57.400
CHRISTINA MORILLO: But you
were on TechCrunch and a lot

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.412
of other sites, right?

00:13:58.412 --> 00:13:59.520
REBECCA GARCIA: Oh, I guess so.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.020
We'll see.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.020
I'm teasing.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.520
I'm teasing.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.090
Yeah, so I think
through CoderDojo NYC,

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.080
I feel in a similar
way of seeing a need

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.510
and wanting to help others.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.920
I actually co-founded CoderDojo
NYC because when I was younger,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.350
I had the opportunity to
go to a computer camp.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.740
And my sister
sponsored me to go.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.890
And I slept on her
couch the whole summer

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:28.080
in what I call indentured
servitude of babysitting.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.040
Because I babysat,
and she sponsored

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.460
me to go to a
computer camp at MIT.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.810
And I later went
to that program.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.694
I went and I returned to
teach at that program.

00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:40.110
And when I came
to New York, there

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.700
weren't any programs
like that that

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.230
were accessible to families.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.750
The program I had gone
to was $1,000 a week,

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.620
not including food
or accommodations.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.510
And it's still very expensive.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.770
And it's a really
fantastic program,

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.280
but it was inaccessible.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.000
And I heard about CoderDojo,
and I tweeted at them.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.140
And I said, hey, is there
a chapter in New York?

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.205
I would love to help out.

00:15:01.205 --> 00:15:03.460
And they're like, no,
but you can start one.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.100
Found my other
co-founder on Twitter.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.430
We met up for coffee, decided
that we weren't serial killers.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.740
And then we co-founded
CoderDojo NYC.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.370
And it's been this
amazing opportunity

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.410
to bring technology
education that's

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.430
coed to both boys and girls.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.720
And to me, diversity
isn't just seeing--

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.960
I think it's really
important to get more women

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.950
and to get more
minorities in technology.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.520
But to me, the
answer to diversity

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.070
is having everyone
together in the same room,

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.760
where it becomes normal
to have everyone together.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.820
And so not only providing
opportunities to youth,

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.450
but also the chance to mentor.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.670
So having more women mentor.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.700
And we're really proud of
our naturally-occurring 50/50

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.580
gender ratio and ethnic
diversity at our programs.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.045
And so that for me has been
the best way to give back.

00:15:57.982 --> 00:15:58.940
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.840
Shanna.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.160
SHANNA GREGORY: I would
echo a lot of what everyone

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.640
is saying about community.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.610
When I came to New York for
a job from the Bay Area,

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.580
I had no network
and no community

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.480
and a very, very small
handful of friends.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.030
So I started going to meetups
and meeting with, specifically,

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.515
Women Who Code NYC.

00:16:16.515 --> 00:16:17.311
[CHEER]

00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:19.283
Yeah.

00:16:19.283 --> 00:16:21.116
I'm trying to find the
person who said that,

00:16:21.116 --> 00:16:23.300
so I can-- oh, hey.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.320
But yeah, that really gave me
insight into how many women

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.820
in New York City are in
technology, or the small sample

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.780
size that we had there.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.300
There are now over 5,000
members in our chapter, which

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.130
is very exciting.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.920
But the ones who
are learning how

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.750
to code, what their
problems are--

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.920
what are you encountering?

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.310
What is stopping you
from participating

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.752
in education programs?

00:16:44.752 --> 00:16:46.710
Or what is stopping you
from teaching yourself?

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.640
Is it mentorship?

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.570
Is it financial?

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.582
Is it all of the above?

00:16:51.582 --> 00:16:53.730
Is it a representation
in technology,

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.700
that you don't see yourself
in "Silicon Valley," the show?

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.760
So that's stopping you
from thinking that that is

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.370
a viable route for you to take?

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.770
So really collecting all of
the information from people

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.270
and having conversations
and getting

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.990
to meet so many amazing
women who really need

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.230
the opportunity
presented to them,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.621
and encouragement and help and
mentorship and all of that,

00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:17.829
really inspired the creation
of Grace Hopper Academy.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.220
It wasn't that we were hoping
to take the female students

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.200
that we had at Fullstack
Academy and put them

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.390
in our own experimental program.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.260
It's still a coed
program, but it's

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.190
being able to give the
same level of education,

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.860
the same opportunities, to
women who otherwise were being

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.980
held back from participating.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.280
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Saron?

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.800
SARON YITBAREK:
So at CodeNewbie,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.920
we don't have a diversity goal.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.710
We have a mission of inclusion.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.270
And so for me, my
goal has never been

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.621
to be in a room full of
people who look like me.

00:17:50.621 --> 00:17:52.870
My goal has always been to
be in a room full of people

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:56.030
who look so different that what
I look like doesn't matter,

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.050
so that it's my ideas
and my skills that

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:59.400
are the most important thing.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.160
And so with CodeNewbie,
I feel very,

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.530
very privileged to
have the opportunity

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.360
to pick the people
that I work with

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.500
and to pick the voices
that I get to amplify.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.330
And so we have a weekly podcast.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.900
We've done 77 episodes.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.930
And every single time I pick a
guest, I'm thinking about, OK,

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.780
by picking this person,
what message am I sending?

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.730
And I think that
when a lot of people

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.890
pick their leadership teams
and pick their speaker panels

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.900
and pick the people they
really put up on a pedestal,

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.410
I don't think they are
always aware that they're

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.490
sending a message.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.740
If you have a leadership
team and it's all white guys,

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.781
you're sending a message.

00:18:32.781 --> 00:18:33.837
You may not mean to.

00:18:33.837 --> 00:18:34.670
You may not want to.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:35.580
But you are.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.010
And it's all those
little messages

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.220
that tell a story of
who should be here.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.830
And so when I get to pick
who my guests are, and I

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.930
get to pick whose stories
to tell, I'm thinking,

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.610
OK, if I have
gender balance, I'm

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.745
sending a positive message
of who gets to be here.

00:18:48.745 --> 00:18:50.790
If I'm taking more
international people, which

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.000
I'm making a huge effort
to, I'm sending a message

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.055
of who gets to be here.

00:18:54.055 --> 00:18:56.900
And so it's about me being
very purposeful with who

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.100
I pick for my community manager,
who I pick for my team leads,

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.320
who I pick on the show, and
being mindful that every time I

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.460
pick someone, I'm
contributing to the story

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.809
and making sure that the
story is incredibly inclusive.

00:19:08.809 --> 00:19:09.975
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:19:09.975 --> 00:19:10.600
That's awesome.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.805
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:20.590
So in the opportunities that
you are working on right now,

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:25.990
how can you share some of those
stories of the opportunities

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.100
for women in tech, particularly?

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.670
How have they impacted
those particular women?

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.750
And is that on a global scale?

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.690
Is that on a local scale?

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.010
Or more in tech
or more training?

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.950
Yeah, I'm gonna to start with--
I'm actually going to start

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.485
with Rebecca this time.

00:19:47.485 --> 00:19:48.610
REBECCA GARCIA: All righty.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:53.510
So two quick stories
that I want to share

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.390
from some of the girls who
come out of our programs.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:01.760
And the idea behind
CoderDojo NYC, I think,

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:08.192
is creativity,
collaboration through code,

00:20:08.192 --> 00:20:09.650
being able to do
that through code,

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.760
and whatever excited you
when you were younger.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.590
And our goal isn't to make the
next big tech star, whoever.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:22.340
It's more of if we can instill
that excitement of learning

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.360
in you, then that's great.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.501
Or if you ended up not
liking programming,

00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:31.000
now you know before you get to
college what you didn't like.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.310
And so I had that experience.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.780
I thought that I wanted to make
video games when I was younger.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.239
And then I actually
tried to do it,

00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:38.904
and I was like, oh,
this is really hard.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.000
I don't want to do that.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.570
And that's what I did at
the summer program at MIT

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.580
that I went to
when I was younger.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:52.230
And one of our girls, one of
the first girls who joined us,

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.240
she was with us
for a few months.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.460
And her parents
eventually approached us.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.730
And she started to get
more and more interested

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.850
and started doing HTML and CSS.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.800
And her parents came
up to us and said,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.530
you know, thanks so
much for doing this.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.520
She actually has ADD.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.167
This is actually
really hard for her,

00:21:11.167 --> 00:21:13.250
for her to really pay
attention and find something

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.041
that she's interested
and passionate about,

00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:16.500
so this is really great.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.680
And so we built a
relationship with the parents.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.350
And she kept coming
back to our programs

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.500
and wanting to learn more.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.070
But I think the real
success is actually

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.100
when she stopped
coming to our programs,

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.070
and we reached out
to her parents.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.310
And we're like,
hey, we miss you.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.740
Our next workshop
is on this date.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.880
Are you guys coming?

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.270
And each time, we would
get a different excuse.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.600
And so it would be,
oh, we're so sorry.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.720
She can't make it because
she's entering her first robot

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.580
in the science fair.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.540
Or the next one we got
was, well, actually,

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.910
she's going to space
camp this summer.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.520
And so the fact that we
were able to spark something

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.190
in her, that maybe she's not
going to be a programmer,

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.400
but she found something
that she's passionate about.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.570
And our next girl who
also-- it sparked something

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:09.240
within her, as well-- she went
through one of our programs.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.230
And she's been doing
iOS app development.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:15.500
She was 12 when she wrote
our iOS app curriculum.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.380
And she last year was
the youngest recipient

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.590
of a WWDC scholarship, the
Apple developers conference.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.170
She had to have her
parents write in

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.980
because she didn't meet the
minimum age requirement of 13.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.956
And so there's videos of
her with Tim Cook showing--

00:22:31.956 --> 00:22:33.330
and she's really
deadpan, so it's

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.920
really funny to see her being
like, yeah, this is my app.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.840
And he's like, wow!

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.720
This is amazing!

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:42.580
And you're like,
oh, OK, [? Kiera. ?]

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.990
So those to me are
the success stories.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.920
And being able to
mentor those girls

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.460
and have that experience that I
didn't have when I was younger

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.124
really is what makes me do
what I do on the weekends.

00:22:54.124 --> 00:22:56.040
I actually, after this,
have to go run and run

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.860
our girls program.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.886
So that's why I do what I do.

00:22:58.886 --> 00:23:00.052
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:23:00.052 --> 00:23:00.746
You want to--

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:01.870
SHANNA GREGORY: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.460
I'm so jealous that you get
to work with kids because I

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.470
work with adults.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.614
And I love the adults.

00:23:07.614 --> 00:23:09.530
And I think that it's a
very important message

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.390
to send to children--
you can do this.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.560
You can build your iOS app.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.962
You can figure out if you like
making video games or not.

00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:18.420
And that's really,
really powerful.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.650
But I think what I
really enjoy working

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.720
with adults is working with
people who are changing careers

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.370
so radically.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.730
Some of them are coming
from design or electrical

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.606
engineering or architecture
and things that

00:23:30.606 --> 00:23:31.730
are not quite so different.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.910
But I also have
ceramicists, and I

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:39.420
have someone who curated art
museums and things like that,

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.802
who've always been
interested or figured out

00:23:41.802 --> 00:23:44.010
that they were interested
in programming a little bit

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.350
too late-- too late meaning
in traditional education,

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.600
you need to make that
decision when you're about 18

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.370
to follow the right track
for your four-year education.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:58.470
But people who are being able
to come back into our wonderful

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.980
fold that we have, coming
back and learning these skills

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.440
at a very different age.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.880
You don't need to be 18
to pick up the skills.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.950
You can be 45, and you can
have already had a career.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.050
You could have
children and still

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.870
be able to learn these skills.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.900
And I think building a
community that is inclusive,

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.380
but also, especially
age diversity

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.480
is pretty important in tech
and something that is lacking.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.440
But it's great that we
can range through teaching

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.930
children and
encouraging children,

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.410
and especially young girls,
and then also kind of carry

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.710
that through and let
people know it's not

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.670
too late for them to join.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.450
ROSARIO ROBINSON: I'm gonna
jump in here, if you don't mind.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:43.370
So I had a conversation
probably about a month ago

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.870
with a friend of mine.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.620
She's probably in her 30's.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.130
And she says, Rose, you
know, you can't leave.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.099
You can't leave tech because
you're getting too old.

00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:53.890
And I was like, what
are you talking about?

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.620
She's like, well, because
you're just getting too old,

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.890
and there's not a lot of
opportunities for you.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.562
I was like, well, I'm just
really getting started.

00:25:02.562 --> 00:25:04.180
I have a lot of plans.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.110
I have great experience
under my belt.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.560
Thank you, thank you.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.900
And I think my
path is leading me

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.840
to something a lot bigger
that I don't know right now.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.610
But I certainly
applaud that, as well,

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.960
because I'm certainly not done.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.160
And I learn a lot.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.790
You all can learn a lot from me.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.380
But one of the things also,
we, as Anita Borg Institute,

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:36.560
I know that it was mentioned
earlier--- our time to lead.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.610
That really is very strong
and powerful, as well.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.370
So we have the Grace
Hopper Celebration

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.120
for women in
computing every year.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.940
But what happens is that, OK,
this three-day conference,

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:47.790
what's now?

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.140
What happens now?

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.980
So now we started-- we
launched five cities

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:57.110
of ABI.Local cities, which is
really trying to bring and add

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.010
to all of these other
wonderful groups

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.710
and bringing them together
and helping our own community.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.600
So I live in Washington, DC.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.685
But that is really very
Washington, DC-centric.

00:26:08.685 --> 00:26:11.940
And so there's a lot
of great communities.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.680
And I guess the makeup
of each is so different.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.520
Like, the New York-- I attended
an ABI.New York event, as well.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.610
And it was just phenomenal.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:26.220
But DC, because we're
in the nation's capital,

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.710
there's a lot of policy work.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.860
And so I get to learn more about
the policy and the technology.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:36.020
So that's more where
our programs really

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.430
help women to
create opportunities

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.680
in their local communities,
because you don't really

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.470
hear about the women that are
in your local communities that

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.820
are contributing on
a very regular basis.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.180
So making sure that story
is told at a local level

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.610
is what we do, as well.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.400
So just wanted to
put that in there.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.160
Saron, did you--

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.900
SARON YITBAREK: Just to
make sure I understand,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.330
the question is, how has our
work impacted women in tech,

00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.830
right?

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.760
OK So for me, it's
on two levels.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.480
So for myself personally, one
of the things that I try to do

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.280
is be very aware
of who I connect

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.822
and who I recommend compared
to who other people are

00:27:12.822 --> 00:27:13.655
trying to recommend.

00:27:13.655 --> 00:27:16.350
So, for example, when I'm
on the programming committee

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.310
and we're trying
to pick keynotes

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.110
and I see who other
people are picking,

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.787
and they all kind of come
from-- they all look alike.

00:27:23.787 --> 00:27:26.120
And so I go, OK, well, I need
to go the other direction.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.070
And so I go out of my
way to find and make

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.550
sure to get really high-quality
people who are different--

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.590
again, going back to this idea
of showing inclusion and making

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.360
sure that all voices are heard.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.750
So that applies
to speaker panels.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.550
That applies to making
job introductions.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.890
That applies to retweets.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.140
I mean, really any way that
I can amplify and connect

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.820
someone, I try to do that.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.250
And for CodeNewbie specifically,
one of the biggest joys that I

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.660
get is when I get emails
from people who say,

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.610
I know CodeNewbie isn't
a diversity thing,

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.810
but your lineup
is really diverse.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.300
And it's just really
great to get to see people

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.660
from my country and who speak my
language and who look like me.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.350
And I've just never
seen that before.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.933
And so for me, that's
just the biggest

00:28:06.933 --> 00:28:08.420
win because we don't push that.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.680
We don't push the whole, look
at us, we're speaking to women.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.470
We don't do that.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.180
But to know that by
being very consistent

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.330
and being very inclusive
and welcoming, that people

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.640
are still receiving that message
and people feel validated

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.300
and people feel like
they have a place

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.296
at the table, that is one of
the biggest rewards we can get.

00:28:25.296 --> 00:28:26.782
ROSARIO ROBINSON:
Yeah, thank you.

00:28:26.782 --> 00:28:27.766
And Christina?

00:28:27.766 --> 00:28:28.750
CHRISTINA MORILLO: Do I have
to answer this question?

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.708
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.200
Yeah, I think we
still have time.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:38.540
CHRISTINA MORILLO: So I'm
not a metrics-based person.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:42.130
I don't like metrics,
for me, personally.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.350
They make me feel limited.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.350
And I don't like to walk
around, like, oh, yeah,

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.080
so I'm impacting everybody.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.102
And everybody loves me.

00:28:48.102 --> 00:28:48.810
And I'm the bomb.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.275
No, no, no.

00:28:50.275 --> 00:28:51.816
When it comes to
it, I'm very humble.

00:28:51.816 --> 00:28:54.870
So I normally walk
around-- my days,

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.470
I don't feel like I'm
changing anybody's lives.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.270
I'm just trying to create
a better life for myself

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.874
and my children and my family.

00:29:01.874 --> 00:29:05.410
And I get reminders
that I'm impacting

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.730
when people come up to me at
different events and are like,

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:09.813
oh, hey, you're Christina.

00:29:09.813 --> 00:29:10.896
It's so great to meet you.

00:29:10.896 --> 00:29:13.170
And I'm like, um, yeah, hi.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.580
But they make me
feel really good.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.660
Like, oh, my god.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.580
You're a superstar.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.730
And I'm like, I'm just me.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.395
And when they tell me their
stories-- like, because of you,

00:29:22.395 --> 00:29:23.780
I changed careers.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:28.060
Or because of you, I also have
two kids, or I'm a single mom.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.140
And I know that I can do this.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.980
Those are my metrics.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.230
So I don't have accounts.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.750
But I'm really just passionate
about people's stories

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.130
and listening to
people's stories,

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.540
whether it's on
Twitter or in person.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.220
Knowing that I may
be contributing

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:52.620
to someone's self-esteem, but on
the other end of the spectrum,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.080
they're helping me, as well.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.717
So it's almost like
a mutual thing.

00:29:55.717 --> 00:29:56.675
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:29:56.675 --> 00:30:00.410
When you're helping, when you're
giving other opportunities

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.300
to other people, you're actually
helping yourself, as well.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.620
So we're going to do
a Q and A session.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.500
And I encourage you
all to say, hey, yes.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.120
Come up.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.240
So we have two mics, here
and on the other side here.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.370
So if you want to come up and
ask any of us any questions

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.298
that you want, please feel free.

00:30:20.298 --> 00:30:23.338
We have about five minutes
for the Q and A, maybe?

00:30:23.338 --> 00:30:24.650
Two or three?

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.922
Five minutes?

00:30:25.922 --> 00:30:26.422
10?

00:30:26.422 --> 00:30:26.922
Oh, cool.

00:30:26.922 --> 00:30:28.310
Cool, cool.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.890
Very cool.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:29.690
OK, go ahead.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.414
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:31.414 --> 00:30:33.580
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Give us
your name and what you do.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.560
AUDIENCE: OK, I'm Maya.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.084
I'm a business
intelligence developer

00:30:38.084 --> 00:30:39.167
looking for opportunities.

00:30:41.662 --> 00:30:42.870
SARON YITBAREK: Good for you.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.120
That's right.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.420
AUDIENCE: My question is, I was
sitting here for the last hour.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.455
And I'm so much inspired by you.

00:30:51.455 --> 00:30:54.150
But there are only
24 hours in a day.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.640
How do you do that?

00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.060
Some people with five kids.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.430
I have one child.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.850
How do you find the
time to be engaged

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.764
in all of the nonprofit
activities and inspiring others

00:31:08.764 --> 00:31:11.410
and then do your
day job, and not

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:16.320
to mention the house
and the family?

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.080
ROSARIO ROBINSON: So
I'll take that one, too.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.030
Very little sleep.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.510
No, I'm just kidding.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.540
But this is what Heather
mentioned earlier--

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.060
find your passion, right?

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.640
I had great opportunities.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.470
It was lots of challenges due to
the gender factor and the race

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.040
factor.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.400
But I have an African
American daughter

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.400
who's majoring in
computer science

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:50.340
and an African American son
who's majoring in economics.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.010
I don't want them to have to
go through what I went through.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:54.880
I mean, this is 2016.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.896
We should be so further along
than where we are right now.

00:31:58.896 --> 00:32:01.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.543
But I have-- thank you.

00:32:03.543 --> 00:32:07.232
And I'm sure that everyone
here is sharing that, as well.

00:32:07.232 --> 00:32:08.232
We have to do something.

00:32:08.232 --> 00:32:10.820
And this is my passion.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:17.022
I want my kids-- and now my
niece has two kids, also.

00:32:17.022 --> 00:32:18.730
What are we going to
do, just leave it up

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.650
to their generations, as well?

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:24.620
It's something we have to
do as a whole, as a group,

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.092
as women, as minorities.

00:32:26.092 --> 00:32:27.550
CHRISTINA MORILLO:
Help each other.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:28.050
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.180
We have to help each other.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:29.530
CHRISTINA MORILLO: Yeah.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.040
Can I just take this, as well?

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.330
That's a really great question,
because people are always

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.382
talking about balance.

00:32:35.382 --> 00:32:36.673
And I don't believe in balance.

00:32:36.673 --> 00:32:37.400
That's a lie.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.456
Balance is a myth.

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:41.420
Unless you're balancing
something on your head,

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.676
it's a lie.

00:32:42.676 --> 00:32:47.360
So for me, it's
really about purpose.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.240
So to be really
honest in this room--

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.970
and do not tweet this 'cause
I will deny it-- my day job

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.490
doesn't give me purpose.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:00.362
But my evening activities
give me purpose.

00:33:00.362 --> 00:33:02.070
Being a part of the
CodeNewbie community,

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.960
being a part of the Women of
Color in Tech Chat community,

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.870
working on all of
these initiatives,

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.120
chatting with Natalie, the
head of Woman Techmakers,

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.510
and meeting all these amazing
people, that gives me purpose.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.240
And that is better than a
Red Bull, which I do drink.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.668
But--

00:33:17.668 --> 00:33:19.572
AUDIENCE: Love is
the great motivator.

00:33:19.572 --> 00:33:21.000
CHRISTINA MORILLO: Yeah.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.050
It's just purpose.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:23.528
I'm not going to lie.

00:33:23.528 --> 00:33:24.694
Most of the time, I'm tired.

00:33:24.694 --> 00:33:25.587
I'm exhausted.

00:33:25.587 --> 00:33:27.420
I have makeup on because
I don't want people

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.370
to see my bags under my eyes.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:35.160
But it's almost like I'm willing
to give that because it makes

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:39.320
me feel like I'm contributing
to something, to a greater good.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:45.780
So not too much sleep,
a supportive husband.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.720
I don't have much
family around me.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.180
It's just really my husband and
I. So We try to do what we can.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:56.230
Sometimes kids miss school
because I have a early meeting

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:57.810
or something.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.720
Saturdays, they're
like, where you going?

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.270
Now they're like, are you going
to a conference or to work?

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.614
And I'm like-- and
my four-year-old.

00:34:05.614 --> 00:34:07.280
And I'm like, I'm
going to a conference.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.699
She's like, OK, I see you later.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.159
But it's also for
my girls and my son

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.500
to see that there's more than
fitting into this little box

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.679
and having to do this routine.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:18.239
There's more.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:19.322
You can break out of that.

00:34:19.322 --> 00:34:20.440
So that's what drives me.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.880
But it's not easy.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.160
SARON YITBAREK: Can I take
a stab at that, as well?

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.909
So for me, I think
that-- so first of all,

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:27.867
let me preface this by
saying I'm not a parent.

00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:28.639
I don't have kids.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.440
I don't understand how
Christina's-- and, you know,

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.710
I don't understand
how that works.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.719
So much respect for all
the work that you do.

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:37.500
I have a husband.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.880
He's generally self-sufficient.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.171
That's all I have to deal with.

00:34:40.171 --> 00:34:41.634
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:41.634 --> 00:34:44.070
So I'll preface it with that.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.210
But having said
that, for me, there

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.940
was a big kind of mind-set shift
that I had a couple months ago

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.670
where I stopped saying,
I don't have time for it,

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.949
and I started saying, this
isn't important enough.

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:57.200
And so for me, it
wasn't about how many

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.250
hours do I have in a day.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.080
It was about is this
thing important enough

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.060
to fit into my limited time.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.400
And so I started cutting
out a lot of activities.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.800
I hate cooking.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.808
I just-- no, not me.

00:35:07.808 --> 00:35:09.224
I tried the Blue
Apron thing once.

00:35:09.224 --> 00:35:10.200
CHRISTINA MORILLO: She
cooks really good, though.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.033
SARON YITBAREK: That
one time, just for you.

00:35:12.033 --> 00:35:14.110
But otherwise-- my husband
doesn't even get that.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.690
And so for me, I do meal prep.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.950
I spend one to two hours a week.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.324
I organize all my meals.

00:35:20.324 --> 00:35:20.990
I have my lunch.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.290
I have my little oatmeal
in a little plastic bag,

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:24.660
and my berries in another bag.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.799
And I will not give more than
two hours a week on cooking.

00:35:27.799 --> 00:35:28.590
I just won't do it.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.200
It's not worth my time.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.270
I'm sorry.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.020
Even things like
going out, I try

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.880
to prioritize and re-prioritize.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.960
Every single day, I have
a very long to-do list,

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.850
and I re-prioritize
that to-do list.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.210
I rewrite it every single day.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:44.870
I have a notebook
full of each day.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:48.500
And I break it down into these
are the things that really need

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.777
to get done today and will
have a huge impact on the goals

00:35:51.777 --> 00:35:52.610
that I want to meet.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.870
And then these are the
things that are easy to do,

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:57.810
that are quick to do, but
aren't actually that impactful.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.390
And for me, when I was able
to split those two lists

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.920
and really focus on the things
that might take four hours

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.330
but will get me much
further compared

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.150
to responding to a
bunch of emails that

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.441
will make other people happy
but aren't really reaching

00:36:09.441 --> 00:36:11.900
my goals, when I was able
to focus on that big list,

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.774
that really, really helped
me a lot more productive.

00:36:14.774 --> 00:36:16.190
AUDIENCE: OK, thank
you very much.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.356
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:36:17.356 --> 00:36:21.890
And I want to get through a
lot of the questions, as well.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:23.400
So one question over here?

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.206
Oh, that's very loud.

00:36:25.206 --> 00:36:26.080
I'm gonna stand back.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.940
And I'm already loud enough.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.870
Hi.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.450
I really can't speak enough
about how much I just

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:35.729
love wonderful women coming
together and banding together.

00:36:35.729 --> 00:36:37.270
It's one of the
biggest things that I

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.450
support in the community
at large, and inclusion

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.350
and diversity.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.100
One of the things I
want to do, especially

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.683
because you talked so much about
it because it was wonderful--

00:36:46.683 --> 00:36:48.610
but the photos, how can
we contribute to that?

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.860
Because if you can't
see it, you can't be it.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.230
And I'm a big believer in that.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:54.770
And I don't want
my nieces to think

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.710
they're weird because they're
I'm sending them a computer.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.960
You're going to learn to code.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:36:59.990
They're like, what?

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.630
I want them be like, oh, no.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.083
There's 1,000 pictures online.

00:37:03.083 --> 00:37:03.582
It's fine.

00:37:03.582 --> 00:37:06.040
Just do it.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.720
So how can we be part of that?

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.740
How can we help that message?

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.730
Is there a way that
we can upload things?

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.310
Because I run a
program for it, and I

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.790
know many other women who
run women-lead programs that

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.339
are just-- let's help.

00:37:18.339 --> 00:37:19.380
Let's get this out there.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.680
And I think you're right.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.827
Photos are so powerful
in that respect.

00:37:22.827 --> 00:37:25.410
CHRISTINA MORILLO: That might
be a white elephant opportunity,

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:26.342
actually.

00:37:26.342 --> 00:37:27.800
AUDIENCE: I would
love to help out.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.580
I've got a camera.

00:37:32.367 --> 00:37:34.700
CHRISTINA MORILLO: So we can
definitely talk after this.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.075
But I've been
thinking about ways

00:37:36.075 --> 00:37:40.890
to make it more-- because it
was a three-series initiative.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.540
So we've completed
the series, and we

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.910
have two new batches of
photos that will be uploaded.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.897
But I've heard this before.

00:37:47.897 --> 00:37:50.340
So they're open source.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.050
By the way, the photos are
100% free on a Creative Commons

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:53.950
attribution license.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:57.120
You just have to give us
a little mini-shout-out.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:57.830
But they're free.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.490
Anybody can use
them, any company.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:00.330
We don't charge.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.050
The goal was never to
make money on the photos.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.915
So I have to think about
that, because maybe this

00:38:05.915 --> 00:38:08.123
can be something a little
bit bigger than what it is.

00:38:08.123 --> 00:38:10.571
AUDIENCE: If you're at Civic
Hall ever, I'll just grab you.

00:38:10.571 --> 00:38:11.640
CHRISTINA MORILLO:
Or you can find her

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.984
because she can find me, too.

00:38:12.984 --> 00:38:14.584
She's at Civic Hall.

00:38:14.584 --> 00:38:15.750
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.154
And I have an idea, too.

00:38:17.154 --> 00:38:19.341
And so we should talk more.

00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:19.840
Hi.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.263
Welcome.

00:38:20.263 --> 00:38:20.686
AUDIENCE: How you doing?

00:38:20.686 --> 00:38:21.110
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Good.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:21.530
AUDIENCE: I'm Christina.

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:22.930
I'm from Morgan Stanley.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.360
I'm not actually a coder.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.780
I actually do stuff
with physical security.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.915
So I deal with hardware
and software and people.

00:38:28.915 --> 00:38:30.956
CHRISTINA MORILLO: Christine,
don't snitch on me.

00:38:30.956 --> 00:38:32.349
AUDIENCE: I promise.

00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:34.390
CHRISTINA MORILLO: I didn't
put this through OBI.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:35.460
Don't snitch on me.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.690
AUDIENCE: I promise.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:38.270
We are all in this together.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.792
What happens here, stays here.

00:38:41.792 --> 00:38:43.500
So I had my own white
elephant experience

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.720
to get into my career.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.020
I had the flu.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.992
My boss at the
time was a jackass.

00:38:48.992 --> 00:38:51.200
We didn't have insurance
that we were being paid for.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.230
I was 19 years old.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.220
And I was basically lambasted
for being sick for two days.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.060
So I went back to my desk.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.037
I wrote "I quit" on a piece of
paper, stuck a pen in the wall,

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:00.870
out the door I went.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.770
I was working for a
cruise travel agency.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.820
It was nothing to
do with where I was.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.250
And I took the opportunity.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.620
I said, gee, I
have bills to pay.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.020
I've got a car payment
due in three days.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.240
And don't know that
waitressing's going

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.670
to get that to me that weekend.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.480
So that Monday, I found
myself in a temp job

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.450
for one day, which
turned into my career.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.900
So I found myself
in a situation where

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.640
I didn't know where I was
headed and found opportunities

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.190
while there.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.960
I was working for AT&amp;T. And
the management team there

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.380
found ways to--
they saw, I guess,

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.910
a spark that I was
interested in learning.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.210
So it turned into the
career I have today.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.070
So today, I'm interested
in, obviously,

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.820
also creating white
elephant opportunities

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.800
for women in tech and also in
the physical security industry.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.470
Similar to the technology
world, in physical security,

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.460
a lot of it is retired police,
retired government officials,

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.140
which is very heavy in the
men's side of the world.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:57.230
So when you find yourself
talking to security folks,

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:00.540
probably even here at Google,
very well many of them

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.927
are going to be men, especially
in the leadership roles.

00:40:02.927 --> 00:40:04.760
So I'm lucky in the
opportunity that I have.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.810
I'm a director.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.080
So I have several
women that work for me.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.127
One of them has moved
on, and she actually

00:40:10.127 --> 00:40:11.710
had an opportunity
in another company,

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.850
and I was very excited for her.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.700
So the thing I
struggle with now is

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.060
how to not only
create and represent

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.530
opportunities for them to
learn about technology,

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:27.310
but to show them they can trust
that this is something that's

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:28.710
going to continue forward.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:29.820
Because there's a
lot of times there's

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.486
still that fear and
that stigma that I'm

00:40:31.486 --> 00:40:32.840
sure we all experience.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.400
What is the statistic?

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.070
It's like one woman to
four in the industry.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:40.440
And it's hard to sometimes
still perpetuate the message.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.710
And I'm going to be 40 soon.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.680
And I find that while I'm
ready and able to move forward,

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.280
it's hard sometimes to excite
some of the younger folks

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.860
to still take that step, to
enlighten them and incite them

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.560
that there is a future
here and it's exciting.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.290
Do any of you guys have
situations in your past

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:06.080
that would help to find the
path to take those first steps?

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.110
You all talked very excitedly
about what you're doing today

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.580
and how you kind of got there.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.112
But what's the
first memory for you

00:41:13.112 --> 00:41:14.820
that made you see,
gee, this is something

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:18.486
I'm doing that's different,
and it does have a purpose,

00:41:18.486 --> 00:41:21.860
and I'm going to do
something someday with photos

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.210
and be very exciting?

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.110
But how do you instill
that excitement

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.167
to have women come
along to trust?

00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:31.750
ROSARIO ROBINSON: And I'm just
going to butt in here, as well,

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.250
is that this is going to
have to be the last question.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:38.260
But all of us will be
around the whole entire day.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.540
So please find us.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.220
Ask us anything that you want.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.830
And I apologize that we
can't get to everyone.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.330
But we got to keep
to time, as well.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:48.347
So any one person wants
to answer that question?

00:41:48.347 --> 00:41:50.430
SARON YITBAREK: Yeah, I'd
love to answer that one.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.587
So one of my first memories
of being the person who

00:41:53.587 --> 00:41:55.170
wasn't really sure
what I wanted to do

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.170
and was kind of afraid
of taking the first steps

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:59.960
and having someone encourage
me-- her name is Vanessa Hurst.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.400
If you all don't know who she,
she started Girl Develop It.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.050
Absolutely amazing, one
of my biggest heroes,

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.950
really important mentor, really
important person in my life.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:11.600
And she had a meetup.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.240
And she said, let's
all come together.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.650
And let's all talk
about conference talks.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.314
And let's talk about
what topics you

00:42:18.314 --> 00:42:20.230
might want to propose
for a future conference.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.392
And I said, sure, great.

00:42:22.392 --> 00:42:23.350
No idea what to expect.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:24.080
Let's go do this.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.490
And it ended up being me, her,
and just one other person.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.130
And we were sitting at a table.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.620
And I think at that
point, I was a month out

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.110
of my programming bootcamp,
just learned how to code.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.920
I think I'd just started a job
at that point, felt totally

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.960
unqualified to speak to anyone
about anything related to tech.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.767
And I pitched this idea
about a reading code group

00:42:44.767 --> 00:42:45.850
that my friends and I did.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:49.300
For every Saturday
for one hour, we

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.890
got together and read code
as a way of developing

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:52.950
our programming skills.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:54.690
And I pitched it to her, and I
thought it was a terrible idea.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:57.070
I thought no one would ever
be interested in hearing

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:57.750
about this.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.890
And she said, no, you
should definitely do it.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:00.626
And I said, OK.

00:43:00.626 --> 00:43:02.500
Well, if Vanessa Hurst
thinks it's good, then

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.890
maybe there's some value.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.650
And I said, but do you think
I should shop it around

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.780
at meetups and kind
of smaller places

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.110
first before pitching it
to-- this was for RailsConf.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.892
So it was the big conference.

00:43:12.892 --> 00:43:14.350
And she looked at
me, and she goes,

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:15.860
I don't believe in
stepping stones.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.220
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.971
And that has been
my motto ever since.

00:43:21.971 --> 00:43:23.470
It's been, OK, do
I want to do this?

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:24.900
Or do I want to try
this other thing first?

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.420
And then I hear
Vanessa's voice go,

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.700
I don't believe in
stepping stones.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:28.920
And I go for the big thing.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.060
That was the first talk I
proposed, and I got accepted.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.544
And I've given that talk
about 10 to 12 times

00:43:34.544 --> 00:43:36.710
all over the world since
then in the last two years.

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:38.390
And I've gotten paid
to give that talk.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:42.680
And so it's been a huge, huge
moment for me in my career.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.680
And so what I've
learned from that

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.090
is to be that voice
for other people.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.092
And so a lot of times, I'll
hear someone tell a story,

00:43:50.092 --> 00:43:52.300
and I'll go, that's be a
really good conference talk.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.420
And I'll say to them,
hey, did you ever

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.410
think about pitching that
and submitting a CFP?

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:57.600
And they'll go, no, I don't
really think it's good enough.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.970
And I haven't really
done it that long.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:59.886
And I'll yell at them.

00:43:59.886 --> 00:44:00.560
I really will.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.309
And I'll pull them
aside, and I'll go, no.

00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:03.030
That is amazing.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:04.285
And I'll give them facts.

00:44:04.285 --> 00:44:05.160
And that's the thing.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.210
I think that people don't really
appreciate their own skills

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:10.050
until they hear
someone else say it.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.714
And so I'll say, no, you've
been doing this for three years.

00:44:12.714 --> 00:44:14.130
You have a very
interesting story.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.170
We need voices like you.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.800
And I give them a pitch of how
you would structure the story

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.690
and kind of give them
something to work with.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:21.910
And I'll say, submit it.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:23.720
If you want, I'm
happy to review it.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.280
And I'll pester
them until they do.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.150
Christina knows.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.780
I've sent text
messages late at night.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.040
I'll do whatever I need to do.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.420
And eventually, they do it.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.170
And then they get picked.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.130
And they come back
to me, and they go,

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.550
I never would have taken that
step if you hadn't pushed.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.440
So I'm very comfortable being
the mama bear of the situation.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.250
I'm very comfortable pushing
you if I believe in you.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.570
And I think that for a lot of
women and men that I've helped,

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.540
it's been me being that very
persistent voice, saying,

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.204
you are good enough, and you do
know what you're talking about.

00:44:49.204 --> 00:44:51.120
And the worst case
scenario is they'll say no,

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.720
and you're in the exact
same situation you'd

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.760
be in if you hadn't applied.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.935
So what's the worst
that can happen?

00:44:54.935 --> 00:44:56.855
And I think being that
has been really helpful.

00:44:56.855 --> 00:44:57.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:57.806
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:44:57.806 --> 00:44:59.770
Thank you.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.010
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.050
Appreciate it.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:06.360
And we probably
have-- lunch is here.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.861
So we're going to
serve-- yeah, go ahead.

00:45:08.861 --> 00:45:11.320
Clap.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.380
So we have a final round,
final advice that you

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:17.940
want to leave everyone with.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.232
So do you want to start, Saron?

00:45:19.232 --> 00:45:20.606
SARON YITBAREK:
Yeah, I'll start.

00:45:20.606 --> 00:45:21.510
Sure.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:24.340
So the biggest advice
that I have-- so

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:28.770
I gave a talk at ELA Conf in
Philly a couple months ago.

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:30.850
And the talk was titled
"Punching Your Feelings

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.030
in the Face."

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:36.809
And the talk is about how I
feel like a lot of people--

00:45:36.809 --> 00:45:38.475
and I see this more
with women, but I'll

00:45:38.475 --> 00:45:40.610
say I think everyone feels
this way at some point.

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:43.450
We wait until we feel
good to do something.

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:44.960
We wait until we
feel comfortable.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.160
We wait until we feel like
things are just right.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.080
We just wait,
expecting the feeling

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.580
to come and have all these
good feelings come before we

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:53.900
actually take that step.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.000
And a huge, huge
thing in my career

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.990
has been being afraid, being
terrified, feeling totally

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.240
unqualified to apply for that
job or to be on this panel

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.240
or to do whatever it
is, but doing it anyway.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.740
Feeling good and
feeling comfortable

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.609
is not a prerequisite
for action.

00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:13.150
And so the biggest advice I have
for you is if you're afraid,

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.940
that's OK.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.110
You can be afraid
and click Submit.

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.144
You can.

00:46:17.144 --> 00:46:19.560
So please take action and don't
let your feelings hold you

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.094
back.

00:46:20.094 --> 00:46:21.260
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.447
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:22.447 --> 00:46:24.780
SHANNA GREGORY: I just want
to reiterate everything that

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.946
has been said at this point.

00:46:25.946 --> 00:46:28.830
I feel like I don't have
anything novel to contribute

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.930
to this advice because
everything that Heather has

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.721
said in her white
elephant talk, everything

00:46:32.721 --> 00:46:36.030
that Saron just shared about
being afraid and feeling

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.060
like you're not good
enough to be on this panel,

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.900
some people felt like
that coming up here.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.630
But there really
is nothing to lose.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:45.000
And that's true.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.394
What is the worst case scenario?

00:46:46.394 --> 00:46:48.310
Sometimes it doesn't
help to think about that.

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:50.768
But honestly, if the worst case
scenario is someone telling

00:46:50.768 --> 00:46:52.540
you no or you're not
going to get the job

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.917
or you're not going to do
that, you are still yourself

00:46:54.917 --> 00:46:56.250
and you still have those skills.

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:58.220
You can still try again.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.290
And definitely, if you
are in a position where

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:03.070
you can support
other people, do that

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.320
as much as humanly possible.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:10.880
Do that hiring or having
more inclusive panels or more

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.710
inclusive teams.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:13.960
That's really important.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.210
The woman who just asked a
question, she's a director.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:17.460
She has people underneath her.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.260
She's in that position where
you can support your other women

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.320
that you're working with.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.590
But you can also have
very frank conversations

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.740
with people who are a detriment
to those women, as well.

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.130
So don't be afraid to
extend the conversation

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.440
past these wonderful
people in this room.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.640
Share that with everyone.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.400
I think that's the biggest
thing I have to contribute.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.340
ROSARIO ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.890
REBECCA GARCIA: So one of the
quotes that stayed with me

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.400
for a while from an author
I like called Jon Acuff--

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:51.340
J-O-N A-C-U-F-F. He writes
really great inspirational

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:56.040
books on getting started,
on just getting things done.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:00.210
And what's really, really
stuck with me is along

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.810
the same lines of
having imposter syndrome

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:05.551
or kind of getting caught
off of how do I get there?

00:48:05.551 --> 00:48:07.384
CHRISTINA MORILLO: I
quote her all the time.

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:14.180
REBECCA GARCIA: My favorite
quote, our favorite quote is,

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.398
don't compare your beginning
to someone else's middle.

00:48:17.398 --> 00:48:20.230
Because it's very
easy to do that.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.000
I've been doing
the nonprofit thing

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.740
on the side for four years now.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.990
And it's been a long journey.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.620
And it starts somewhere.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.300
And it starts with that
small spark of whatever

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.550
it is you're passionate about.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:37.980
And it doesn't have to
be teaching kids to code.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.080
It doesn't have to be this
big, grand gesture of changing

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.000
the world, but knowing
that what you're doing,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.124
however small it is,
makes a difference.

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:48.998
CHRISTINA MORILLO: I
love that quote so much.

00:48:48.998 --> 00:48:50.480
Oh, my god.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:55.663
OK, so that quote, plus just
remember the anger activates.

00:48:55.663 --> 00:48:57.470
So just remember that.

00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:58.590
Anger activates.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.280
But use it in a positive way.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.350
So anger activates positively.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:07.880
And number two is
don't follow the crowd.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.970
If everyone is learning to code,
and if you don't like code,

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:12.100
don't learn to code.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:12.950
It's fine.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:13.530
It's OK.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:14.920
Learn something else.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.320
The tech ecosystem
is huge, and there's

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.920
so many different positions
that people don't talk about.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.160
And I think it's important
to get out there.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.910
If you don't want to
go to a meetup, fine.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.190
Go on Twitter.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:27.380
Read up on things.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.372
Meet people that are in
different-- QA analysts

00:49:30.372 --> 00:49:31.830
or information
security architects.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:34.970
There's so many positions out
there that don't necessarily

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:35.810
involve code.

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.640
And although I
always support people

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.930
that want to learn
another language,

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:43.020
because it's kind of
like another language,

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:47.800
I'm very big on-- I'm a lover
of education and learning,

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.500
whether it's
self-taught or whatever.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:53.630
So I think just don't follow
the crowd, and just do you.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:55.050
Just remember to do you.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.390
Don't worry about what
other people are doing.

00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:59.010
Don't compare yourself.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:02.740
And don't give yourself
this stress for no reason.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.240
Just follow your own path.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.720
Create your own path.

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.554
And I think that's the
most important thing.

00:50:07.554 --> 00:50:09.428
ROSARIO ROBINSON: So I
say that all the time.

00:50:09.428 --> 00:50:10.980
I tell my kids, you do you.

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.380
Don't worry about
what's going on.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.430
And incidentally, my
background and my expertise

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:17.750
is in infrastructure.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.527
So while all the
apps are being made,

00:50:20.527 --> 00:50:21.985
just know that
their infrastructure

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:26.190
needs to happen to
support that, as well.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:31.400
But remember the theme of
today is our time to lead.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.620
And you have to trust yourself.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.620
Start with that.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:35.520
Trust yourself.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.130
You're here for a reason.

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:40.220
You're present in this
industry for a reason.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:44.045
So take that to heart,
and go out and lead.

00:50:44.045 --> 00:50:44.920
And we appreciate it.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.669
And thank you so much
for your time today.

00:50:46.669 --> 00:50:48.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.790
