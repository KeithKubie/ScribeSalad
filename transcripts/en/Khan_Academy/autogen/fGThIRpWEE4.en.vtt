00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
 . 

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.590
 In this demo I will hit a set of 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.500
 Polynomials, and I hope this will give you 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.630
 Feeling confident enough when you have to hit it 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.450
 Yourself 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.810
 Let's start with a simple issue 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.810
 Suppose we want to multiply 2x × (4x - 5) 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.440
 Well, here we will use 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.680
 Directly Distribute 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 In fact, when we multiply all these polynomials 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.140
 All we use is 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.990
 The distribution property is several times 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.710
 But let's use the distribution function here 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.240
 This is equal to (2x × 4x) + (2x × -5) 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.700
 Or you can say -5 × 2x 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.520
 So we will say, -5 × 2x 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.480
 All I did was distribute the 2x 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.740
 The first phrase will be equal - we can strike 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.440
 Transactions - 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.560
 Remember that 2x x 4x is equivalent - you can 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.530
 Reorder the multiplication process-- 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.170
 This is equivalent to 2 × 4 × x × x 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.020
 Equivalent to 8 × x ^ 2 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.880
 Remember that when you hit x ^ x ^ x ^ 1, we collect the bases 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.380
 I mean, you know that x x x = x ^ 2 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.070
 If the first phrase equals 8x ^ 2 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.520
 The second term, -5 × 2 = -10x 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.720
 Not bad 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.620
 Let's do one more solution 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:34.140
 Suppose we have 9x ^ 3 × (3x ^ 2 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.570
 - 2x + 7) 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.720
 If again, we will use 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.810
 Distribution property here 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.260
 We will hit 9x ^ 3 each 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.650
 These words 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.100
 If 9x ^ 3 × 3x ^ 2 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.750
 I will type it this time 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 On the following issues, we will begin to do so 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.420
 It's mentally 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.230
 If this equals 9x ^ 3 × 3x ^ 2 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.710
 And then we have - let me write it down 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.960
 Method - - (2x × 9x ^ 3) and then + (7 × 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.400
 9x ^ 3) 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.606
 At times I have written 9x ^ 3 first, and at some times have 

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:18.610
 We wrote later because I wanted to put these 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.400
 Negative sign here 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.770
 But this does not change the order in which 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.980
 We hit it 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.730
 So how much is this first sentence? 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.720
 9 × 3 = 27, × x ^ - we can gather 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.190
 The basics, we learned that in studying the properties of the foundations - 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.670
 This is x ^ 5, and 2 × 9 = 18x ^ 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.770
 - We have x ^ 1 and x ^ 3-- 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.970
 x ^ 4 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.160
 + 7 × 9 = 63x ^ 3 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
 If we've ended up to 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.920
 Multi-border Class V 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.640
 Now let's make one solution that contains two double-border expressions 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.400
 I will explain to you what I mean quickly 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.680
 You will see this 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.510
 Much in algebra 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.215
 So let's assume that we have (x-3) (x + 2) 

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:16.920
 In fact I want to make it clear to you that all we do here is 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.990
 Use the Distribute property 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.510
 So let me put it this way: x (x + 2) 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.940
 So let's pretend that this is just a large number 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.510
 It is 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.100
 As you know, if we have a set of x, this would be a number here 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.770
 So let's distribute these to each of these variables 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:44.790
 This is equal to x (3) × x written in green, + (x 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.760
 - 3 × × 2 written in green 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.530
 All we did was distribute the x - 3 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.980
 This is a distribution property 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.920
 Remember, if I have a x (x + 2), what should I do? 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.750
 Equal? 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:19.810
 This will equal (a × x) + (a × 2) 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.620
 If here, you can see it when X - 3 is tied 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.220
 a, we distribute it 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.910
 Now we will use the distribution feature again 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.960
 In this case, we will now distribute x on 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.050
 x - 3 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.850
 We will distribute 2 on x - 3 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.760
 You may have been used to seeing the x on the other side, however 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.730
 In any way, you will hit 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.840
 If this equals - I will continue coloring - 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:56.390
 This is equal to (x x x) - (3 x x) + (x x 2) 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.870
 - I bear the trouble of this until it continues 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.030
 They are painted for you 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.640
 I think this will help you - - (3 × 2) 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.640
 All I did was distribute x and divide 2 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.450
 And soon you will get used to this 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.480
 We can do one step 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.740
 You actually hit every word here 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.200
 With each subsequent phrase, we will find faster ways 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.940
 In the future to do this 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.960
 But I really want to show you the idea here 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.590
 How much is this? 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.050
 This equals x ^ 2 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.040
 This is equal to -3x 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.800
 This is equal to 2x 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.720
 And then this is equal to -6 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.950
 Thus the output is x ^ 2 - 3 of something 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.940
 + 2 of something, and this equals 1 of that thing 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.860
 - x - 6 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.510
 We hit them 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.630
 Now before we continue and solve another issue, I want to 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.450
 I explained to you that you can do it mentally 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.000
 You do not have to go through all these steps 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.670
 Just wanted to explain to you that this is about 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.270
 Distributive property 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.980
 The faster way to do this, if we have (x - 3) (x 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.880
 + 2), you will actually hit each phrase 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.240
 Here in each of these statements 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.510
 So you'll say, x these x x ones 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.130
 And you get x ^ 2 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.000
 Then we have x these x 2 ones, this is equal to 2x 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.250
 Then we have -3x, this is equal to -3x 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.070
 Then -3 × 2 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.750
 Which equals -6 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.930
 So when you hit again you'll get x ^ 2 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.140
 - x - 6 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.680
 This needs some practice to 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.680
 You get really used to it 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.910
 Now the other thing I want to do - and the main thing is 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.160
 It's exactly the same way - but I'll hit 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.290
 A double-edged phrase with three words, that's what 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.720
 Many people find him tired 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.840
 But we will see, if you remain calm 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.010
 This is not so bad 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:56.000
 (3x + 2) (9x - 6x + 4) 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.910
 Now, how to use the same method we used in 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.160
 Previous view 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.720
 We can take (3x + 2) and distribute it on 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.860
 Each of these three statements, multiply 3x + 2 each 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.860
 Of these terms, and then distribute 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.920
 Both of these statements are on 3x + 2 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.460
 It will take a long time, and in fact, you will not hit it 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.090
 this way 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.930
 But you will get the same answer we will get 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.130
 When you have multiple integers larger than these, the simplest way is that 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.450
 I can think of it to hit, how to do it 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.730
 By multiplying the long numbers 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.300
 We'll write it that way 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.110
 9x ^ 2 - 6x + 4 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.010
 We will multiply it by 3x + 2 

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.670
 What I imagine is, when you hit normal numbers 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.930
 You have the status of the individual, the status of dozens 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.760
 And the status of hundreds 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.590
 Here, we have the status of constants 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.090
 First Class, Second Class 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.650
 And the third degree status, if any 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.300
 In fact, it's present in this show 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.910
 So you have to put things in their proper place 

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.270
 let's do it 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.250
 We will start from here, beating exactly as 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.480
 We do the traditional beating 

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.370
 2 x 4 = 8 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.440
 And go to the status of the individual, or the status of the constants 

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.520
 2 × 6, 2 × 6 = - or 

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:20.640
 2 x -6x = -12x 

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.580
 We will put + here 

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.390
 This was = 8 

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:28.060
 2 × 9x ^ 2 = 18x ^ 2, if we put this in 

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.360
 Status x ^ 2 

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.000
 Now let's move on to part 3x 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.710
 I will do it in purple, and as you can see it is different 

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:43.480
 3x × 4 = 12x, positive 12x 

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.940
 3x × -6x, how much is this? 

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.190
 x x x = x ^ 2, so 

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.780
 Will go here 

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:59.330
 And 3 × -6 = -18 

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.330
 Finally, we have 3x × 9x, x x x ^ 2 

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.150
 = x ^ 3 

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.500
 3 × 9 = 27 

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.670
 You typed it in x ^ 3 

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.620
 Again, you will collect 

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.230
 Similar phrases, get 8 

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.460
 There is no other constant, if we have only 8 

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.670
 -12x + 12x, these are deleted 

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.650
 18x ^ 2 - 18x ^ 2 are deleted, so we have left 

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.620
 Here is 27x ^ 3 

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.940
 If this equals 27x ^ 3 + 8 

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.110
 We're done 

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.840
 You can use this technique to hit a triangular border 

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.910
 With double-edged words, a trigeminal term × a trigonometric term, or in fact 

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.290
 As you know, you can get five phrases here 

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.930
 A phrase of the fifth grade × a term of the fifth degree 

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.480
 This will always succeed as long as you keep stuff in 

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.000
 Her proper stature
