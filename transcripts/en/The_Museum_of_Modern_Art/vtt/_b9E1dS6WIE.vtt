00:00:02.448 --> 00:00:04.070
Terrance Hayes

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.506
“Four Premonitions of Migration”

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:12.245
To grasp the inextricable ghosts
riding you

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.378
into an inexplicable future,

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:17.448
you must place your lips
to panel thirteen

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:20.886
until you taste something human
in the colors of the dirt.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.790
To suit present life
you must revise

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:27.793
“The crops were left to dry and rot.

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:30.430
There was no one left to tend them,”

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:34.386
to read:
“The cops were left to cry and shoot.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.636
There was no one was left
To defend them.”

00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:42.503
To perceive the ghosts
in this particular picture

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:45.776
you must imagine the orb
above the field

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.916
is your eye waiting for bones or buds
to erupt.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.550
But let’s just head uptown,

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.278
someone there
is throwing a child named

00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:58.411
Jacob Lawrence a party.

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:01.761
It is fine to walk
without speaking to each other

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.696
if we are walking
beside a pair of tracks

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.266
or a river
with no burning bodies in it.

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:11.705
I wonder where the land
of the freedom really is.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:15.175
Not Ohio, maybe Canada,

00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:17.043
Guadalajara,

00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:19.511
someday maybe the Congo.

00:01:20.148 --> 00:01:23.250
Outside
it is always tomorrow.

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:28.091
At some point, I’ll be boxed
and stuffed in a suit

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:32.091
I currently mistakenly believe
I’ll never be caught dead in.

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:38.163
2015, 2040, some other year
that’s a fistful of syllables,

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:39.698
then in 2115

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.168
whoever
discovers panel thirteen

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.005
will assume the orb above the field

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.373
is an apocalyptic spaceship.

00:01:48.443 --> 00:01:51.743
Migration can,
of course, be spatial,

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:55.448
as well as mental, spiritual,
and temporal.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:00.253
Could black people be incarnations
of Time?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.790
Yes, because Time, like the Negro,

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:06.658
carries
the past as if it was a rucksack

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:10.496
holding the Sunday dress
a mother and daughter walking North

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.365
sewed
from the suit of a corpse

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.968
left to dry and rot in Dixie.

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.340
Each of the techniques useful
in the transferal of dirt

00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:22.841
requires work against gravity.

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:26.880
The dress
seems to get heavier, I imagine,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.400
though each night

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:31.785
when the ladies stop
to inspect it beside a shy campfire,

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:35.521
they find it is the same old dress
only a bit less clean.

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:41.160
They do not sense you and me
in the dirt overshadowing the fields

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:46.298
or know that dirt,
by definition, is made of history.
