00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.002
 Yokanan walked from his house to the bus stop 

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.517
 at an average speed of 5 kilometers per hour. 

00:00:06.517 --> 00:00:08.406
 He immediately got on the school bus 

00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:10.133
 and traveled at an average speed 

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.668
 60 kilometers per hour until he got to school. 

00:00:14.383 --> 00:00:16.374
 The total distance from his home to the school 

00:00:16.374 --> 00:00:18.526
 is 35 kilometers and the whole trip took him 

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:20.240
 hour and a half. 

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:22.286
 How many miles did Yokanan walk on 

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:24.094
 and how many kilometers 

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:27.137
 did he travel by bus? This is a fascinating task. 

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:28.620
 I recommend that you pause the video 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.037
 and try to think about it alone. 

00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:32.785
 Let's define a few variables here. 

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:34.837
 How many kilometers did he walk on? 

00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:38.230
 Let's name it with WL And how many miles 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.388
 did he travel by bus? 

00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:44.284
 Let's name it with B. 

00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:46.094
 What do we know so far? 

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:47.812
 We know that miles ... 

00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:49.243
 I can even draw it to make sure, 

00:00:49.243 --> 00:00:51.104
 that we imagine it, right? 

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:55.578
 This is his home, 

00:00:55.578 --> 00:00:59.627
 and then he leaves, 

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:02.935
 we are told that it is 35 kilometers from school, 

00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:05.618
 that's where his school is. 

00:01:05.618 --> 00:01:08.564
 I will draw a larger building, this is his school, 

00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:13.420
 and we know that this distance is 35 kilometers 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.719
 and we also know that it takes an hour and a half. 

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:17.910
 We know he's going 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.657
 with different speeds different distances. 

00:01:19.657 --> 00:01:23.678
 There is some distance to the school bus, 

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:26.862
 to the bus stop, 

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:30.437
 here is the bus stop, 

00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:32.611
 and we are looking for this distance to the bus stop, 

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:34.696
 the distance that has passed on foot. 

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:37.053
 This distance is here 

00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:40.141
 is W, and the rest of the distance 

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.839
 he went by the bus. 

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:45.876
 This whole distance is right there 

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:48.468
 will be B. 

00:01:48.468 --> 00:01:49.452
 What do we know so far? 

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:51.464
 We know that the distance traveled on foot, 

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:53.008
 plus the distance traveled by bus, 

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.554
 will be 35 kilometers, 

00:01:56.554 --> 00:02:00.557
 this is the whole distance 

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:03.997
 from home to school, that is, we know that W plus B 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 is equal 

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:17.403
 35 km and just one equation 

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.468
 we will not be able to find W and B. 

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:20.527
 But we have another condition. 

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:22.631
 We know the total time. 

00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:24.805
 The total time is 

00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:27.934
 hour and a half. We'll write it here. 

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:32.934
 That will be 1.5. How much time ... 

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:35.256
 How much time did he go through? 

00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:38.827
 Let's write it here, 

00:02:38.827 --> 00:02:43.477
 the time he spent walking. 

00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:46.334
 We will divide the distance traveled. 

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:50.003
 The distance traveled is W kilometers, 

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:55.003
 divided by its speed. 

00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:56.322
 The distance, divided by the speed, 

00:02:56.322 --> 00:02:58.556
 will give you the time. Let's see. 

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:00.913
 Its speed is 5 kilometers per hour, 

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:05.078
 kilometers 

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:06.419
 are shortened by miles, 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.507
 and if you have one on the lessons 

00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:12.453
 in the denominator, it will be the same, 

00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:17.390
 this will be W over 5 hours so the units coincide. 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.397
 The time spent W on 5. 

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:23.424
 By the same logic 

00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:25.802
 his bus time will be the distance 

00:03:25.802 --> 00:03:30.353
 on the bus divided by the average speed 

00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:33.278
 the school bus will be 60. 

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:35.188
 It's all in hours. 

00:03:35.188 --> 00:03:37.829
 Now we can solve this system of equations. 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.999
 We have two linear equations with two unknowns. 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:42.604
 We should be able to find W and B, 

00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:45.631
 to satisfy both. 

00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:48.232
 How is it easiest to do it? 

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:50.343
 Let's see if I can multiply the second equation 

00:03:50.343 --> 00:03:53.972
 minus 5, 

00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:55.355
 this here will be minus W, 

00:03:55.355 --> 00:03:57.671
 it is shortened by this W here above. 

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.800
 Let's do it, multiply the second equation 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.461
 by ... I will switch to one color. 

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:08.461
 The above equation will be W plus B equals 35. 

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:11.580
 And the bottom equation ... 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.388
 If I multiply both sides 

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:19.526
 minus 5, 

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:22.411
 i will get minus 5 by w on 5 

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:27.411
 is minus W, minus 5 B on 60. 

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:29.176
 Let's see it will be minus 5 

00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:34.032
 on 60, it's minus 1/12, so it's minus B 

00:04:34.032 --> 00:04:38.644
 on 12, then this will be equal to ... 

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:43.644
 1.5 by minus 5 minus 7.5. 

00:04:45.186 --> 00:04:46.567
 Now we can just collect her left 

00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:49.147
 right side of these two equations. 

00:04:49.147 --> 00:04:51.403
 I will write it a bit clearer, 

00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:54.674
 I will delete it and sort it out 

00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:58.493
 a little better, I delete that. 

00:04:58.493 --> 00:05:02.394
 The first equation 

00:05:02.394 --> 00:05:07.394
 is W plus B equals 35, 

00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:11.674
 are now better arranged and can be collected 

00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:13.830
 left sides 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.016
 and the right sides of the equations. 

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:18.162
 On the left, W is shortened. That's what we wanted. 

00:05:18.162 --> 00:05:22.530
 B minus B on 12 or B minus twelve of B 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.582
 will be 11 / 12B, 

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:28.930
 11 / 12B is equal to, let's see, 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.930
 35 minus 7.5 and that's it 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.604
 28, then we take another 1/2 and we get 27.5. 

00:05:41.678 --> 00:05:45.497
 And because I have it here 

00:05:45.497 --> 00:05:47.123
 common liver, 

00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:51.753
 this is the same as 55 on 2. 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.799
 Let me write it this way. 

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:58.058
 Same as 55 on 2. 

00:05:58.058 --> 00:05:59.703
 And to find B, I only have to multiply 

00:05:59.703 --> 00:06:01.447
 both sides on the reciprocal of this. 

00:06:01.447 --> 00:06:04.190
 I will change the colors to avoid uniformity. 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.190
 We multiply both sides by 12 on 11, 

00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:13.414
 and we get ... These are shortened and we get, 

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:16.543
 B, I will write it with this color, 

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:20.097
 B is equal to ... Let's see, I have 12 in the numerator, 

00:06:20.097 --> 00:06:21.459
 2 in the denominator, so I can 

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:25.542
 to write this as 6 and 1, then I have 55 and 11, 

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:29.151
 I can divide the two into 11, so it will be 5 and 1. 

00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:31.650
 We received ... 5 in 6, B equals 30, 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.868
 B is in kilometers. He has traveled 30 kilometers 

00:06:35.868 --> 00:06:39.606
 by bus, B is 30 km. 

00:06:39.606 --> 00:06:42.288
 The time we walked on can be easily found. 

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:43.853
 If this is 30, then the time, 

00:06:43.853 --> 00:06:46.472
 during which he walked, will be 5. 

00:06:46.892 --> 00:06:50.529
 It will be 5 kilometers, W, 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:53.475
 let me write it, W equals 5 kilometers. 

00:06:53.475 --> 00:06:55.141
 He walked 5 kilometers and then 

00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:58.916
 has traveled 30 km by bus.
