00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.050
- Who wants donuts?

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.706
- It's only itself and that number.

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:17.260
- What number comes before?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.010
- There are some pernicious effects

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.140
that come from the fact

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.560
that we are such social creatures,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.450
and one of them leads to the role

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.010
that identity plays in learning.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.460
As human beings,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.590
we are very aware of how we are the same

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.330
or different than others.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.600
We're conscious of how we look different,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.780
how we act different,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.430
how we speak with different languages.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.430
Each of those gives us a kind
of identity about ourselves.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.880
It turns out that the studies

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.010
have demonstrated that
your identity as a learner

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.550
plays a huge role in the pathway

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.590
that you take in school,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.150
the kinds of classes you
think you'd be attracted to,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.640
the disciplines or the careers

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.970
you think you'd be good at as

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.780
opposed to poor at.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.613
- You attach this.

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:05.127
Can you attach this?

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:08.990
(machine whirs)

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.040
- Tell me some ideas,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.423
what else could that graph be telling me?

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.160
- By second grade, girls have absorbed

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.295
the stereotype as to whether or not

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:22.900
their academic interests would tend

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.770
towards math or not.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.990
In the United States,
girls by second grade

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.670
will report, girls aren't
interested in math.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.820
Girls aren't good at math

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.760
and they don't care about math.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.260
By third grade, they've absorbed that

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.040
with regard to themselves.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.307
They say, "I'm not interested in math.

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:40.547
"I don't care about math.

00:01:40.547 --> 00:01:42.075
"I'm not good at math."

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:43.750
That's independent of what their

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.659
scores are in math.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.210
This work is demonstrating how important

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.300
the belief system is to academic skills.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.380
It doesn't matter where
in the world you live,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.570
you want to belong.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.910
You don't want to be alone.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.650
Teachers who have a tendency

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.480
to work on the math skill itself

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.390
can ignore this other part,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.013
the psychology of your belief system.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.910
It's so important for teachers

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.120
and parents to understand the power

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.600
of the social brain.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.300
If we're helping our children

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.340
negotiate their place in the world,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.690
we have to understand the degree

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.030
to which their social responses

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.790
to others and from others

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.700
are building identities that will

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.200
allow them or cut them off

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.223
from pathways that they might follow.
