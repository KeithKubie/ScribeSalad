DALILA STANFIELD: Advice that
I would give to educators

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.950
also planning or hoping to
teach this same kind of course

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.760
material or subject would be to
have somebody of the diaspora,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.700
or somebody who can relate
to the diaspora teach it.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.220
It's important to have
people of the background

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.820
or of the diaspora
educating others.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.470
Like, who better to
educate than those

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.970
that have experienced
it themselves,

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.100
or those that, you know,
come from that area.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.850
So I feel like that's
probably the biggest

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.810
advice I would give.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.360
I think maybe other advice
would be really making

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.941
sure to create safe
spaces for students

00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:51.190
to have conversations, because
I feel like we had that

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.420
in this class, and that you
can have a curriculum that

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.830
can be very diverse, and
like, can be very open.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.560
But if you don't
create an environment

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.680
where, like, in which
students can, like, openly

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.930
speak about things and openly
talk about things, like,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.510
it's not going to matter.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.010
And I feel like it limits the
kinds of discussions you have.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.176
And I feel like we've had
a lot of great discussions

00:01:14.176 --> 00:01:17.496
in this class because the
environment has been--

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:19.120
it's been a safe
environment, you know,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.920
and people can voice
their opinions.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.510
And things have gotten
very personal in this class

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.010
sometimes.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.630
You know, there have
been one or two instances

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.490
where students got up
and left, you know,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.870
because they were so emotional.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.780
And so, like, yeah.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.600
It's not, it's not just
about the curriculum, too.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.162
It's also about the
space that you create.
