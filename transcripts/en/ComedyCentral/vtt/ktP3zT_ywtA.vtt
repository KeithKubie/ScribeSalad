00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
- Hi!

00:00:00.973 --> 00:00:01.806
I'm Sugarboy.

00:00:01.806 --> 00:00:03.639
I'm a boy that ate a lot of sugar.

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:04.624
Wanna hear a story?

00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:06.340
I'm gonna tell you a story.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.730
It's a really cool tough lady
story called Kung Fu Mom.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.070
There once was this girl.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.591
It was around probably
about a hundred years ago.

00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:15.830
And she was super tough
even though she was a lady.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.780
She even smoked a cigarette once.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.400
Whenever someone would make her mad,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.680
she would usually kick them
in the face, break their arms,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.040
or pinch their nipples really hard.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.740
The only thing she loved
more than kicking butts

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.970
were baseball cards,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.170
because my mom said people
collected them back then.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.010
One day, she was organizing the
cards by coolest looking guy

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.710
when a letter slid under her doorway.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.040
She was like, "What the heck?"

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.240
So she opened it up and
read it and it said,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.520
hey there, I'm a bad guy.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.110
I stole your favorite baseball card.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.220
It's the Rollie Fingers rated rookie card.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.053
She loved Rollie Fingers

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:45.560
because he had a really
cool twirly mustache.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.660
The letter said that the bad guy

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.110
was gonna bend the card in
half and rough up the corners,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.180
so it wouldn't be in
mint condition anymore.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.230
It said that the bad
guy was at Coney Island

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.590
where we went on vacation once.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.960
So she grabbed her roller skates

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.710
and started rolling to Coney Island!

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.280
She was jumping over curbs,
high-fiving cool people,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.540
pushing off mean people.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.159
and sometimes she'd dance a little

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.240
'cause there was some cool
roller skating music playing.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.990
Then she saw a bus and got on,
but it said no roller skates.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.140
So she gave them to some old
grandma with an eye patch

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.130
and got on the bus!

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.280
But after a few stops,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.920
she realized she had sat on jelly

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.310
and she was so mad that she
jumped off and ran for a while.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.520
She was so fast she could run a mile

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.960
in about six minutes flat.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.500
Then a couple of ninjas popped out

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.770
and she knew they were bad,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.460
so she kicked one of them in the penis,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.203
then gave him a bad noogie
that knocked him out.

00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:27.920
Then she stole his nunchucks

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.280
and slapped another ninja with it.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.930
He got a bloody nose then passed out.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.470
Then she stole that ninja's grenade

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.120
and tricked the heck
out of the other ninja

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.020
by quickly painting it
to look like an apple,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.430
then giving it to him as a gift!

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.260
He smiled and took a bite like an idiot,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.740
and it blew chunks of his body everywhere.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.260
Then she saw a guy riding a bike,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.440
so she kicked him off and
rode that for a while,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.203
high-fiving more cool people
and punching out more idiots.

00:01:48.203 --> 00:01:49.810
Then she saw a taxi cab,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.880
so she hopped in and
rode that for a while,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.500
but it stunk like armpits in there,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.700
so she got out and ran some more.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.530
And wen she was crossing a bridge,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.050
some guy called her a cuss word,

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.340
so she tore his nipples off
and threw them in the water,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.570
then got on one of those
bike basket things.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.800
But after a few blocks,
the biker ripped one,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.110
so she got off and ran
to the subway train.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.640
And the whole time, she just kept thinking

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.800
about Rollie Fingers
and his twirly mustache.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.530
Then she looked around and
everyone had twirly mustaches.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.850
That was the last straw.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.200
She needed to get that card.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.600
She finally got to Coney Island

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.140
and ran through the carnival area,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.343
and played a quick round of
skeet ball, ate a funnel cake,

00:02:21.343 --> 00:02:22.977
and had a wizard read her fortune.

00:02:22.977 --> 00:02:25.550
And it said, Go Kick a
Butt Right Now, Baby!

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.650
So she went to the bad guy headquarters,

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.090
kicked the crap out of the door,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.863
and that's when she saw
the Rollie Fingers card,

00:02:30.863 --> 00:02:32.478
then she saw the bad guy.

00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:35.370
And so they both ran for the
card, but she got to it first.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.380
And she threw it right
at him like a ninja star.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.510
And it stuck in his forehead
and he said, "Oh, crap!"

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.160
Then she took her fingers and
put them right up his rollie,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.250
which meant his butt hole.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.700
She was so excited that she
picked up an electric guitar

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.710
with a wah-wah pedal
and played a loud solo

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.210
without making any mistakes.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.080
And while she was playing,
Rollie Fingers himself walked in

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.260
and fell in love with her right away.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.195
So they went in the
backroom and got naked,

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:57.287
and rubbed their butts together, I think.

00:02:57.287 --> 00:02:59.534
And that made a baby and
he was named Sugarboy

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:00.901
and he was awesome!

00:03:00.901 --> 00:03:01.734
Sugarboy!

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:06.779
I wish my dad was Rollie Fingers.

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.100
(upbeat music)
