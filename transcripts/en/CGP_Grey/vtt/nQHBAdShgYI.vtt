00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
In Star Trek, the transporter moves you from one spot to another, saving on shuttle fuel (and special effects budgets).

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.160
In-universe, it's 'the safest way to travel'.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.440
Yes, *sometimes*, two guys die horrible, mutilated deaths under rare circumstances...

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.540
...but trillions of individuals transport to work every morning without a hiccup.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.080
But, what if the transporter isn't as safe as claimed...

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.300
...what if the death rate isn't point almost nothing percent, but one-hundred percent...

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.100
...because the transporter is a suicide box.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.260
First, how does the transporter work?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.120
There are technical manuals, with pages and pages of hilariously over-specific details...

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.220
that yet say *so little*.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.980
Star Trek is nothing if not consistently inconsistent, but, taking the most common elements:

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.280
First, the transporter scans you down to the quark, takes apart your atoms and sends the pieces of you to the destination for reassembly.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.980
But, is it *you* on the other end?  Or a copy that thinks it's you?

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.700
Well, who *is* you?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.500
That's a hell of a big question, but let's try to be good scientists about it:

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.840
...we don't assume there's a magic part of you that can't be measured.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.320
After all, if it can't be measured, that means by definition it can't affect anything.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.180
So Occam's Razor it away and we take you as you seem to be: a collection of atoms arranged to think they're you.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.500
And because the arrangement of atoms in post-transport you is exactly the same as pre-transport...

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.700
...you must be you.  Case closed.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.300
Butâ€¦ You might still have this nagging feeling that your experience of stepping into the transporter will be...

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.380
...a funny sound, a bright light -- then nothingness eternal..

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.320
...while down on the planet, a brand-new life, complete with all your memories up to the moment before your death

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.860
...popped into existence and assumed it's you...

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.180
*How could it otherwise?*

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.160
It lives a life as short as the mission...

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.920
...and a new creature with the memories of you both makes it back to the ship.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.220
If true, multiply this by all the life forms in all the ships in all the star systems...

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.560
...and this transport technology is a silent holocaust...

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.140
...which makes an average episode of 'Trek rather grim watching.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.980
And it's a small mercy when a crew member takes the turbolift rather than site-to-site transport.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.480
But again, the measurements check out so perhaps we're being paranoid and we're already late for our holiday on Risa so just step inside already.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.400
But atom reassembly is the optimistic version and can't be how the transporter really works...

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.320
...because sometimes accidents combine two crew into one - or split one into two.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.500
There aren't enough atoms in you to make a second you, so the transporter has to be turning atoms into energy and energy into atoms.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.620
You are destroyed, used to charge a battery, then recreated anew.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.960
This really seems like death.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.260
But the philosophy majors in the room are *dying* to bring up "The Ship of Theseus" now -- so fine.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.920
You take this ship on an adventure.  As parts get worn, you replace each until eventually no piece is original.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.440
When you return is the "Ship of Theseus" still the same "Ship of Theseus" you left on?

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.060
Seems so - and this is what your body does daily via eating (bringing in new atoms) and excreting (losing atoms).

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.640
Compare to the "The Cutty Sark", a colonial tea ship burned down and restored with new parts.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.940
Is it still the same "Cutty Sark"?

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.720
The result is the same: all new parts - only the time it took is different.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.720
If you're happy "Ship of Theseus"-ing through life (as you already do), ...

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.640
...then getting "Cutty Sark"-ed by transport shouldn't matter.  Right...?

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.960
However... step into a working transporter with a broken disassembler - and death is revealed:

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.020
...pre-transport and post-transport you can disagree on who is you.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.280
And when Scotty tells pre-transport you "Sorry, the disassembler is broken, give us a minute to fix it", you aren't going to wait around.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.520
That a copy of you made it to the destination is no consolation.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.900
The transporter has to be a suicide box.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.120
OK, so why worry about the metaphysical implications of fictional technology?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.980
Because the transporter points us to the problem of consciousness.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.760
We were quick to cut out the idea of the unmeasurable before -- because everything we can measure about the copy is identical...

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.620
...but there is something unmeasurably different.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:04.580
The transporter forces confrontation with the possibility that there's something about being a conscious creature that isn't measurable from the outside.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.380
Did we not contain conscious brains ourselves, how would we know that other brains are conscious?

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.880
Truth be told, you can really only know that *you* are conscious...

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.520
-- and it seems polite to give other people the benefit of the doubt.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.880
But were a computer to claim that it was conscious, how would you know?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.380
Your continuous stream of consciousness is your life.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.880
And you are the only one who can experience it, who can know if it *exists* and if it is continuous.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.020
And transporters are scary because they cause breaks in that consciousness.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.140
Making a copy that lives the life that you have left, with no one the wiser.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.200
With no one able to be wiser.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.340
And while transporters aren't real, breaks in consciousness are.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.140
If you go for surgery, when they put you under, you can't be sure if it's you that woke up.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.120
For that matter, your bed might be a suicide machine.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.400
Every night's slip into unconsciousness, the warm embrace of the reaper...

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.500
...and every morning the first and only day of a new creature's conscious life.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.080
It's impossible to know.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.880
Sleep well tonight.
