Hi, I'm Stan Muller, and this is Crash Course
Intellectual Property. Today, we're talking

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.620
about international intellectual property
law, and the first thing I'm gonna tell you

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.760
is that there aren't really any international intellectual property rights. IP rights are territorial.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.240
They're created by each country's national law, and typically apply only to conduct that takes place

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.260
within that nation. So, there you have it.
Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.900
Crash Course Intellectual Property is filmed
in the Chad and Stacey Emig--is this really

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.980
all we have today? What about the complex
web of international IP treaties that establish

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.250
minimum standards for IP laws in countries around
the world? Can't we talk about that for eleven minutes?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.480
[Theme Music]

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.380
So all these international treaties set up
ground rules for stuff like how long a copyright

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.079
or patent should last, or the basic subject
matter of trademarks. Countries that join

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.530
these treaties can have higher protection
standards, but the treaties set up a baseline

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.909
of protection they must provide. The most
important minimum standard set up by these

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.669
treaties is the principle of national treatment,
which operates something like an international

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:05.480
IP golden rule, "Do onto other countries'
authors and inventors as you would have done

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.330
unto your own." Basically, each country has
to give foreigners IP protection that is no

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.010
less favorable than the protection granted
to its own people.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.860
These international treaties are a response
to globalization. Political reforms have torn

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.070
down the iron curtain, and trade with half
the world that was basically off limits to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.920
the West a few years ago is now possible.
China. Legal reforms have facilitated an expanded

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.540
economic exchanges, and IP rights play a significant
role in all channels of international trade.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.340
Sellers of goods are more likely to sell to
a country that has strong IP rights, especially

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.930
for products like computer software or films,
where the product is basically pure IP. Beyond

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.840
this, technological advances mean that someone
might be watching this right now in Antarctica

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.170
and to that person I say, do you really have
the bandwidth in Antarctica to watch Crash Course?

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.270
In any case, borders and distance mean less
and less in the digitized world. But as we

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.550
discussed in CrashCourse World History, globalization
is complicated. Some argue that ratcheting

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.729
up IP minimum standards, especially in a world
where around 90% of all technology royalties

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.709
and licensing fees are received by 5 developed
countries, is not always a good thing.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.180
Developed and developing nations often have
very different attitudes toward intellectual

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.259
property. Developed nations usually try to
get full economic benefits from their inventions

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.959
and knowledge through strong IP rights. They
argue that strong IP laws are necessary to

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.049
protect the significant investments of developing
these products. Pharmaceuticals and feature

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.879
films cost a lot to make, and the creators
want a return on their investment. Rich countries

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.019
also argue that strong intellectual property laws
will make developing countries more attractive trade

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.080
partners, because creators know their IP exports will
be protected, so they're more likely to send stuff there.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.900
Developing nations argue that they need access
to advanced technology and knowledge, which

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.810
are the tools they need to develop, modernize,
and compete in the modern world. They often

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.730
view strong IP rights as a tool used to either
deny access altogether to technology and knowledge

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.480
or to severely limit access via high royalties
and licensing fees. So it's an open question

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.180
as to who's right about this. Do you happen
to know? Don't count on it. Yeah, me either.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.200
So, we've got no answers, but let's take a look at the
international frameworks for copyright, patents, and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.300
trademarks. The oldest and most important copyright
treaty is the Berne Convention for the Protection

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.400
of Literary and Artistic Works. The Berne
Convention, as it's known, was first signed

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.859
in 1886 in Berne, Switzerland, and was aimed
at solving the problem of widely varying treatment

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.689
of foreign authors among countries. The United
States, for example, didn't grant copyrights

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.909
to foreign works until 1891. In his 1842 reading
tour of the United States, Charles Dickens

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.029
was treated like a rock star, mostly because
so many people were reading cheap, pirated

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:31.069
editions of his books. And so the US press
attacked him. To quote one outlet, "We are

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.949
mortified and grieved that he should have
been guilty of such great indelicacy and impropriety,

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:40.519
asking us to do honor to his genius but to
look after his purse also." So we steal this

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.169
guy's copyrights and then insult him for complaining
about it. Welcome to America, Dickens!

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.590
This state of affairs continued until 1878,
when France convened an international literary

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.410
congress with Victor Hugo, author of Les Miserables
and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, as its head.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.120
As with all things created by Victor Hugo,
it was way too long. The agreement was finally

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.799
signed in 1886 by ten countries. Today, there
are 168 members of this treaty, which is administered

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.849
by the World Intellectual Property Organization,
or WIPO.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.219
The United States didn't officially join the
Berne Convention until 1989, which also happens

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.090
to be the year that the cinema classic and
highly lucrative intellectual property Weekend

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.000
at Bernie's was released. Is that a coincidence?
Mmm... maybe.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.510
The Berne Convention adopts the aforementioned
principle of national treatment and sets up

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.480
certain minimum standards for the copyright
laws of any country that signs on. Things

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.820
like minimum copyright terms and the scope
of exceptions and limitations to exclusive rights.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.630
The treaty also largely eliminates what are
called "formalities". Berne countries can't

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.010
require that authors go through formalities
like copyright registration or require a copyright

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.880
notice or symbol to get protection. But without
requirements, the owners register their works

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.450
and record ownership transfers with their
particular government, ownership information

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.510
is often lost and authors can't be located.
This creates a lot of problems.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.630
Another problem with the Berne Convention
is that it doesn't have an effective enforcement

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.040
system. When a country violates the treaty,
there's no effective way to punish them for

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.060
it. Members do have the option of trying to
settle the dispute through the International

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.870
Court of Justice, but this option has been
used exactly 0 times. A lot of these issues

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.970
were "resolved" by the trade related aspects of
intellectual property rights, or TRIPS Agreement.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.860
Formed in 1994, this agreement incorporates
most of the Berne Convention and adds a few

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.220
copyright bits of its own. The TRIPS agreement
is administered by the World Trade Organization,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.120
and it has a strong enforcement mechanism
in place under the WTO's dispute settlement

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.920
body. So if a country doesn't comply, the
WTO's like, "WTF!" They then decide whether

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.550
there's a violation and what kind of punishment
they need to impart.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.150
Beyond the Berne Convention and TRIPS, the
World Intellectual Property Organization produced

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.810
two multi-lateral treaties: the WIPO Copyright Treaty
and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.760
These are referred to as the "Internet treaties"
and the US implemented them in 1998 through its

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.080
introduction of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or the DMCA which you, as an Internet user, probably hate.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.620
International copyright is enormously complex.
Luckily, international patent law is dead simple.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.520
Nah, it's enormously complex too.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.500
As the industrial revolution advanced across
Europe and North America, differences in countries'

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.720
patent laws piqued an interest in creating
international standards for patents. The International

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.400
Convention for the Protection of Intellectual
Property, commonly known as the Paris Convention,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.710
was signed in 1883. In Paris, France. Like
the Berne Convention, the Paris Convention

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.920
lacks an adequate enforcement mechanism. If
a country violates the treaty, everybody's

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.160
back in the International Court of Justice.
But, just as with copyrights, nobody does this.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.720
Because the Paris Convention didn't really
set minimum standards, countries had great

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.290
freedom to tailor their patent laws to their
own needs and interests. Developing countries,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.080
for example, might exclude pharmaceutical
products from patentability because they feel

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.280
like health-related products and medicine
should be affordable for people to buy. Many

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.180
developed nations successfully sought to close
this gap during negotiations of our old frenemy,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.830
the TRIPS Agreement. TRIPS incorporates parts
of the Paris Convention and sets forth a number

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.060
of minimum standards for patent protection.
TRIPS prevents World Trade Organization members

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.160
from denying patents to pharmaceuticals or
biotechnology products or processes.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.720
Unlike the Berne Convention, which does away
with copyright formalities, the Paris Convention

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.470
assumes that the inventor has to apply to
his or her particular government's patent

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.130
office or government. Countries that are party
to the convention can't give foreign inventors

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.420
a hard time. They get the same protections
that apply to domestic inventors. The Patent

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.310
Cooperation Treaty makes this easier. It helps
coordinate procedures for filing multiple

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.760
patent applications for the same invention
in several countries around the world.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.680
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.080
So, the Paris Convention also governs trademarks.
In many ways, it treats trademarks like patents.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.680
It requires countries to provide for national
treatment. Because trademark law is territorial

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.140
and you have to apply for protection in each
country where use is planned, there are two

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.920
special agreements that establish a common
international registration system. These are

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.160
the 1891 Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and the 1989 Madrid

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.560
Protocol for Relating to the Madrid Agreement.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.870
Aside from all these European capitals and
their agreements and conventions and protocols,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.150
the TRIPS Agreement extends protection to
geographical indications. This means that

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.440
the word "Champagne" can only be used for
sparkling wine produced in France's Champagne

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.000
region. It also extends to words like Bordeaux,
Chablis, Parma ham, Roquefort cheese, Florida

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.850
orange juice, Vermont white cheddar, all that
business.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.800
These issues have been a point of contention
between the US and the EU. Europe has long

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.630
pushed for greater protection of geographical
indications. Every time you eat Greek yogurt

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.710
or Feta cheese, every time you smoke a Cuban
cigar, every time you stir up a cup of Swiss

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.130
Miss hot chocolate, every time you're confounded
by a Chinese finger trap, you're seeing a

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.800
potential geographical indication violation.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.980
At the end of the day, international intellectual
property is all about setting minimum standards

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.410
and national treatment. It's about countries
treating the nationals of other countries

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.300
at least as well as they treat their own.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.840
This push for standardization has caused some
problems. There are now so many IP treaties

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.419
and agreements and protocols in place that
it makes intellectual property reform difficult.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.790
So, for example, changing the law to reduce
the copyright term in the United States isn't

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.740
just a matter of changing the US law. It's a matter of changing all of these international agreements.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.760
Just as individual nations struggle to keep
pace with our increasingly globalized world,

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.760
so does the international intellectual
property system. Both national and international

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.990
systems are struggling to find the right balance
of exclusive rights and public access to knowledge

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.540
in a world where borders are traversed with
a click.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.720
