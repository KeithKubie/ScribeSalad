00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.769
Nailing a movie’s story is the best way
to make it a hit with audiences, so there’s

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.150
lots of pressure on the screenwriter to craft
a narrative that compels and makes sense.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.240
And even if they do a great job highlighting
interesting themes and character arcs, sometimes

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.500
the script can get derailed just by one tiny
mishap that becomes a point of confusion.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.300
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Movies That Make
No Sense Because Of One Small Detail.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.390
Star Wars: Attack of the Clones

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.149
The romance between Anakin and Padme is a
forbidden one, as it’s against the Jedi

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.910
Code for Jedi Knights to fall in love. But
this is something that doesn’t make a whole

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.640
lot of sense. The Phantom Menace clearly introduces
a biological component to the Force, and those

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.399
with high midichlorian counts are more powerful
with it. You’d think that the Jedi Order

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.059
would want their members to pass on their
midichlorians to a new generation to ensure

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.969
strong Force users instead of hoping they
come across children with the right blood

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.210
samples. We get rejecting temptation, but
Anakin should have been allowed to love.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.530
Django Unchained

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.460
Quentin Tarantino films are known for hyper-realism,
but this is an instance where even he went

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.030
off the rails. Django Unchained is set in
the late 1850s, a couple of years before the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.950
Civil War. Throughout the film, particularly
in the explosive destruction of the Candie

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.720
Land plantation, dynamite is used. The time
period should make this impossible. Dynamite

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.850
was not invented until almost 10 years later
in 1867. While it is fun to see Django win

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.119
and give the villains their comeuppance, it
might have been better if he played by the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.360
real-world rules to get his upper hand.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.360
Gravity

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.280
The thrilling space drama is essentially a
race against the clock, as astronaut Matt

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.540
Kowalski says they have 90 minutes before
the debris completes an orbit around Earth

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.350
and threatens them again. But in reality,
the chances of the debris presenting further

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.530
danger is quite small. After the explosion,
the debris would have been sent in several

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.810
directions, and the film depicts several impacts
that are separated by time and distance. After

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.369
the initial hit, all of the debris would be
in completely different orbital tracks and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.540
would not return to cause harm to Kowalski
and Ryan Stone. Alfonso Cuarón went the extra

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.129
mile to portray space, but even he had to
suspend disbelief.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.129
Inception

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.040
To tell the difference between the real world
and dreams, extractors use a totem that only

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.310
they know the exact properties of. There’s
a strict rule that says you can’t let anybody

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.930
– even your trusted allies – touch your
totem. But Cobb goes against that guideline.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.730
The totem he uses in the film is the spinning
top, but the top originally belonged to his

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.849
wife Mal before she died. Inception makes
a point of saying that Cobb frequently does

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.150
things he advises against, but viewers have
to question how reliable the totem is, since

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.959
it wasn’t Cobb’s to begin with. How’s
that for a mind-bender?

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:38.959
Frozen

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.010
Disney films are typically fairy tales, but
they need to be grounded in some form of reality.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.019
In Frozen, Hans’ plan is to marry Anna and
take the throne by killing Anna and her sister

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.150
Elsa. But that’s not how monarchies work.
Someone married to royalty cannot take the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.330
throne for their own, there would have to
be a cousin, uncle, or someone else from the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.409
bloodline to be next in line. Hans would always
be a prince no matter what, and since he is

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.519
a prince when we first meet him, he should
already know about this rule. Can Frozen fans

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.540
let this one go?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.730
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.480
When he’s deemed a universal blood donor,
he’s connected to the sick war boy Nux,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.670
who needs fresh blood to recover. It is true
that type O is the “universal donor,”

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.810
but that refers to the packed red cells only.
When Max’s blood is being transfused, it’s

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.040
the whole blood – which includes red blood
cells and plasma. There’s no universal donor

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.580
type for the whole blood, so the plasma should
cause a transfusion reaction because it contains

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.379
A and B antibodies. It’s worth the risk
in an emergency case like Furiosa, but it’s

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.959
typically not wise medical practice.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:34.959
Whiplash

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.040
J.K. Simmons’ Fletcher is a tyrannical teacher,
who uses intimidation tactics and extremely

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.560
tough love to motivate his students. He justifies
his actions by telling the story of Charlie

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.440
Parker and Jo Jones, saying that Jones once
threw a cymbal at Parker’s head to make

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.290
him the great player jazz fans know today.
Fletcher actually bent the truth to fit his

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.189
needs. According to Charlie Parker himself,
he was so distraught after the incident that

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.989
he didn’t practice his instrument for another
three months. This means that Fletcher teaches

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.860
on faulty logic and his whole philosophy is
incorrect. Hard criticism can inspire greatness,

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.189
but he goes too far.

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.549
Pulp Fiction

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.860
In Pulp Fiction’s “Bonnie Situation”
story, Jules has an epiphany when he and Vincent

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.380
survive an attack. Instead of being fired
down at point blank range, the hitmen watch

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.970
in amusement as their assaulter hits the wall
behind them. But someone had already shot

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.699
the wall. Before the man pulls the trigger,
a shot of Jules and Vincent show bullet holes

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.020
in the wall, meaning that the miracle Jules
witnesses is unfounded and he should remain

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.889
in “the life.” Call it a continuity error,
but Tarantino should have made sure the wall

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.340
was intact to ensure the maximum effect.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.340
Moneyball

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.240
The Oakland A’s of Moneyball buck traditional
team building practices and adapt advanced

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.220
statistics to sign undervalued, yet productive,
players to help them win games. Their success

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.680
is credited to some of Billy Beane’s key
pickups like Scott Hatteberg and Chad Bradford,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.820
but they were hardly the stars of the team.
In 2002, Oakland had the American League Cy

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.520
Young winner in Barry Zito, and shortstop
Miguel Tejada was named MVP. They may have

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.389
had something to do with the 103 wins too,
and the movie doesn’t even mention them.

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.539
Big stars go against Moneyball’s theme,
but that’s a glaring oversight.

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:08.539
Nightcrawler

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.430
The ambitious Lou Bloom quickly rises to prominence
in shady TV news with his coverage of horrifying

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.530
events, but he never should have gotten that
opportunity. He makes his first connection

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.840
by simply walking into a TV station and sharing
his footage with the producer. This goes against

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.590
real-world security practices, where stations
are on total lock down and employ even stricter

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.690
methods at night, such as password protected
doors. How Lou was able to get in without

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.780
being challenged by any authorities is a mystery
we’re still trying to solve. No matter how

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.620
great his footage is, he needs to set up a
formal meeting.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.470
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.990
Are there any movie details that drive you
crazy?
