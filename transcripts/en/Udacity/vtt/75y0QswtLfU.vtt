00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.730
&gt;&gt; Alright, so that was helpful with the HTML. Can you do

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.530
something similar and tell me how you think about reading a CSS file?

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.588
&gt;&gt; Alright, sure. Let's go look at it. Alright, so we've

00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:12.570
got the CSS file. So CSS stands for cascading style sheets.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.550
&gt;&gt; Okay. The cascading part is, sort of, you can define things in multiple

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.620
different ways, and it will always be the last definition that, that gets used.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.228
&gt;&gt; Okay. What's going on, like, with these sorts

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:25.610
of things? Yeah, so, so we've got HTML and body.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.930
So, all of these rules will be applied to any element

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.160
that starts with HTML or body. And then this rule will

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.710
apply just to the ones with body, and you'll notice it's

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.990
one of the same attributes between the two of them so.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.600
&gt;&gt; So, this margin is going to supersede that one?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, it'll over ride it.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.470
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Okay, so and this could say

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.080
Div for example? This could be just any HTML thing.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you could define

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.420
styles for all Divs. That would be kind of weird

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.220
because there are so many Divs that it would just

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.590
be kind of, kind of strange. But, so here we've

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.040
got inputs. Those are like boxes that you type stuff in.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.129
&gt;&gt; Now this is different. This is green.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.735
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so this guy is talking about a class.

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:10.910
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, these other ones, where they don't have dots

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.135
in front of them, those are the main, the element themselves.

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:16.952
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So the thing right after the open

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:18.922
angle bracket.

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:19.900
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.360
&gt;&gt; When its got a dot, it's talking about the, the part

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.715
that says class equals. So, this one is referring to this particular class.

00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:27.162
&gt;&gt; Heading class, okay.

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:27.715
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:28.520
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.800
&gt;&gt; And then, here, we've got an element dot class name,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.580
so it's only that kind of element's class names. So if.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.040
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.690
&gt;&gt; If we'd had a Div with a, with

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.810
a class title, this rule wouldn't be applied to it.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.990
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.650
&gt;&gt; It's only going to be applied to heading once.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.116
&gt;&gt; So, what about these? So, what's going on with

00:01:46.116 --> 00:01:50.250
these like, at dash webkit dash keyframes? What is this?

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.790
&gt;&gt; This looks like it's probably some kind

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.980
of animation or like, maybe a hover over, something.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.980
&gt;&gt; Okay. What do webkit and moz, what do those things mean?

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is, this is clearly referring to different kinds of browsers.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.050
So it's probably like different ways of

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.140
doing things based on which browser you're in.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.120
&gt;&gt; Oh, so is this, so when our front end engineers are all complaining

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.530
about, you know, lack of browser specification,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.520
they're complaining about having to write these things?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, or, or probably more like this sort of

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.050
thing. Okay. I can, I can see why that'd be annoying.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.059
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.930
&gt;&gt; Alright. It gets super annoying.

00:02:23.545 --> 00:02:24.740
&gt;&gt; And is that about it? I mean,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.560
there's elements. We've got classes. We've got this

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.770
blue stuff, which is just the rules you're

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.540
applying, the font size, the height. Is that about

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.390
all that's going on?

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.762
&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much. I mean you, you can do more complicated stuff in

00:02:37.762 --> 00:02:42.733
CSS, but it's sort of preferable not to. [LAUGH] You mostly want the CSS file

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:48.627
to be as simple as possible. And just, sort of, give the basic positioning and

00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:51.005
like coloring and all of that, and

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.970
then have the JavaScript deal with everything else.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.011
&gt;&gt; Okay. Alright. well, I'm going to actually

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:01.720
try and do that thing that you said I shouldn't do. I going to try and change

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.320
the, some of the styling of all the

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.980
Divs and see if that does anything interesting.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.490
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.630
&gt;&gt; Okay.
