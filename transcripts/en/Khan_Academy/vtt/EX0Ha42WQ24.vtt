00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:01.741
- [Voiceover] Let's get some more practice

00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:05.618
finding the angle, in these
cases the positive angle,

00:00:05.618 --> 00:00:08.625
between the positive X axis and a vector

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:10.900
drawn in standard form
where it's initial point,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.360
or it's tail, is sitting at the origin.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.191
Here for vector A we can write
it in two different ways.

00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:19.216
In engineering notation

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:21.852
it would be -2 times a unit vector I,

00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:23.977
that's the unit vector in the X direction,

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:26.670
minus four times the unit
vector in the Y direction,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.222
or we could just say
it's X component is -2,

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:29.742
it's Y component is -4.

00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:30.821
And we see that here.

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:34.688
If we're starting at the
origin we go two to the left

00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:38.310
and we go four down to
get to the terminal point

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.829
or the head of the vector.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.582
Also figure out what theta is.

00:00:42.582 --> 00:00:45.315
What we've seen before when
we're thinking about vectors

00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:48.136
drawn in standard form,
we could say the tangent

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:51.712
of this angle is going to
be equal to the Y component

00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:53.813
over the X component.

00:00:53.813 --> 00:00:56.224
So the Y component is -4

00:00:56.224 --> 00:01:00.334
and the X component is -2.

00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:02.714
And in the previous video
we explained why this is,

00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:05.337
it really comes straight out
of the unit circle definition

00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:07.578
of trig functions, tangent of theta

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:10.736
is equal to the Y coordinate
over the X coordinate

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:14.462
of where a line that
defines an angle intersects

00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:16.018
the unit circle.

00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:17.678
And I encourage you to watch that video

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:19.976
if that doesn't make much sense.

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:24.574
But so we could say tangent
of theta is equal to two.

00:01:24.574 --> 00:01:27.557
And so we might want to say,
if we want to solve for theta,

00:01:27.557 --> 00:01:28.892
we could say theta is equal to

00:01:28.892 --> 00:01:33.141
the inverse tangent function of two.

00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:34.302
And I'm gonna put a question mark,

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:36.554
and I think you might know why

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:37.599
I'm putting that question mark.

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:39.630
So let's see what that gets us.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.558
So if we were to take two,

00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:43.531
and I wanna take the inverse
tangent not just the tangent.

00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:46.793
I wanna figure out what angle
gives me a tangent of two.

00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:50.024
So inverse tangent,

00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:53.263
it's about 63.4 degrees roughly.

00:01:53.263 --> 00:01:55.903
So this gives me theta is approximately

00:01:55.903 --> 00:02:00.442
63.4 degrees.

00:02:02.118 --> 00:02:04.277
And I'm gonna put a question mark here.

00:02:04.277 --> 00:02:06.482
And I think you might sense why that is.

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:08.061
If you don't, pause the video

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.965
and think about why am I
putting a question mark here?

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:13.738
Why does this angle look fishy?

00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:17.256
Well, it looks fishy because
an angle of 63.4 degrees

00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:20.403
would put us squarely

00:02:20.403 --> 00:02:22.423
in the first quadrant.

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:27.124
If our vector looked like this,

00:02:27.124 --> 00:02:28.276
let me see if I can draw it.

00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:36.074
If our vector looked like this,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.547
so if our vector's
components were positive two

00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:46.366
and positive four then that
looks like a 63-degree angle.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.337
This looks like a 63-degree angle.

00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:50.707
But we're not in the first quadrant.

00:02:50.707 --> 00:02:53.958
Our vector A that we care
about is in the third quadrant.

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.577
So it's clear that it's in
the exact opposite direction,

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.237
and I think you see why.

00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:03.534
When we take the inverse tangent
function on our calculator

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:06.764
it assumes that the angle
is between -90 degrees

00:03:06.764 --> 00:03:08.331
and positive 90 degrees.

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:11.650
Well, here we have an angle
that's over 180 degrees.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.797
It's between 180 and 270 degrees.

00:03:14.797 --> 00:03:15.738
And so to find this angle,

00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:18.138
and this is why if you're
ever using the inverse tangent

00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:20.599
function on your calculator
it's very, very important,

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.340
whether you're doing
vectors or anything else,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.078
to think about where does
your angle actually sit?

00:03:26.078 --> 00:03:28.202
What quadrant does it actually put you in

00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:30.456
because you might have
to adjust those figures.

00:03:30.456 --> 00:03:34.065
So, it's not going to be 63.4
degrees it's going to be that

00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:38.025
plus another 180 degrees to
go all the way over here.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:42.262
So, theta is going to be 180,
and I should say approximately

00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:47.262
'cause I still rounded,
180 plus 63.4 degrees

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.992
is going to be 200 and, what is that?

00:03:50.992 --> 00:03:53.097
180 plus 60 is 240,

00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:57.636
so 243.4 degrees.

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:58.959
So let's do one more.

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.281
So here I have a vector
sitting in the fourth quadrant

00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:02.280
like we just did.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.661
Pause the video and see
if you can figure out

00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:07.956
the positive angle that it
forms with the positive X axis.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.423
Well, we could do the same drill

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:12.500
and maybe we could skip a few steps here

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.694
now that we've done it many times.

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:18.700
We might wanna say that
the inverse tangent of,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.218
let me write it this way,
we might want to write,

00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:22.576
I'll do the same color.

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:26.198
We might wanna say that
theta is equal to the inverse

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:30.540
tangent of my Y component
over my X component

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.423
of -6 over four, and we know what that is

00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:38.137
but let me just actually
not skip too many steps.

00:04:38.137 --> 00:04:42.406
So the inverse tangent of -1.5.

00:04:42.406 --> 00:04:46.560
- 1, -1.5 and once again,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.138
I get to get my calculator out

00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:53.685
and so 1.5 negative,

00:04:53.685 --> 00:04:55.926
and I wanna find the
inverse tangent of it,

00:04:55.926 --> 00:05:00.082
I get roughly -56.3 degrees.

00:05:00.082 --> 00:05:03.260
So this is approximately equal to

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.754
- 53.6 degrees.

00:05:06.754 --> 00:05:09.647
Did I do that right, 56.3,

00:05:09.647 --> 00:05:13.745
56.3 degrees.

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:16.426
And once again, I'm gonna
put the question marks here.

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:17.483
And why did I do that?

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:19.445
Because the angle that it's giving,

00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:21.406
and this isn't wrong
actually in this case,

00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:23.369
it's just not giving
us the positive angle.

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:25.470
Because if you start the positive X axis

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.186
and you were to go clockwise,

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:30.565
well now your angle is
going to be negative,

00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:33.190
and that is -56.3 degrees.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.881
But we wanna figure out the
positive angle right over here.

00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:38.286
So, there's a couple of ways

00:05:38.286 --> 00:05:40.527
that you could think about doing it.

00:05:40.527 --> 00:05:41.804
One way to think about it is

00:05:41.804 --> 00:05:44.137
well to go from this negative angle

00:05:44.137 --> 00:05:45.844
to the positive version of it

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:48.142
we have to go completely around once.

00:05:48.142 --> 00:05:51.577
So we have to add 360 degrees.

00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:53.028
So if it's really

00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:56.963
approximately -56.3 degrees

00:05:56.963 --> 00:06:00.380
plus 360 degrees,

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.259
which is going to be, what is that?

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.749
So it's going to be,

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:07.745
so it's going to be approximately,

00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:11.633
see if I subtracted 50 degrees
I would get to 310 degrees,

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:15.824
I subtract another six
degrees, so it's 304 degrees,

00:06:15.824 --> 00:06:17.219
and then .3,

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:21.478
so 303.7 degrees.

00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:22.558
Did I do that right?

00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:25.507
Let's see, if I add this .3 to the seven,

00:06:25.507 --> 00:06:28.579
that's gonna get to
304, then at 310 to 360.

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:29.566
So there ya go.

00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:33.304
That is our positive angle that we form.

00:06:33.304 --> 00:06:36.937
So always really think about
what they're asking from you,

00:06:36.937 --> 00:06:38.435
or what a question is asking from you.

00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:40.554
Anyway, you get the idea.
