things that are important to you so what
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.050
things that are important to you so what
does this mean for your development of

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060
does this mean for your development of
 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.630
does this mean for your development of
apps so to start with it's a very

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640
apps so to start with it's a very
 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.120
apps so to start with it's a very
different interaction model so with

experience on wearable devices you
 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.780
experience on wearable devices you
really need to rethink the way that you

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790
really need to rethink the way that you
 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.340
really need to rethink the way that you
program for it and the way you use it

make it really tiny but that's not
 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.480
make it really tiny but that's not
really what you want to be doing so the

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490
really what you want to be doing so the
 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.680
really what you want to be doing so the
way you should think about designing

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690
way you should think about designing
 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.570

apps for wearables is to say to yourself

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580
apps for wearables is to say to yourself
 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.630
apps for wearables is to say to yourself
what what couldn't we do on the phone

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640
what what couldn't we do on the phone
 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.090
what what couldn't we do on the phone
that a wearable device now makes

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100
that a wearable device now makes
 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.430
that a wearable device now makes
possible and that's the kind of app you

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440
possible and that's the kind of app you
 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.670
possible and that's the kind of app you
should be building and I think the

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680
should be building and I think the
 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.189
should be building and I think the
for wearables in general is coming and

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199
for wearables in general is coming and
 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.629
for wearables in general is coming and
it's gonna be made by one of you people

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639
it's gonna be made by one of you people
 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.059
it's gonna be made by one of you people
here a developer who's like you know

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069
here a developer who's like you know
 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.950
here a developer who's like you know
what I have this really amazing idea and

what I have this really amazing idea and
it's going to change the world when you

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599
it's going to change the world when you
 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.239
it's going to change the world when you
know Android and iPhones came out many

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:37.249
know Android and iPhones came out many
 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.519
know Android and iPhones came out many
years ago everyone thought they're just

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:39.529
years ago everyone thought they're just
 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:40.689
years ago everyone thought they're just
going to be browsing the web and

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699
going to be browsing the web and
 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.550
going to be browsing the web and
checking their email and now we've got

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560
checking their email and now we've got
 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.320
checking their email and now we've got
all these exciting apps that people use

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330
all these exciting apps that people use
 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.879
all these exciting apps that people use
that they couldn't live without those

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889
that they couldn't live without those
 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.230
that they couldn't live without those
are the killer apps that define the

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240
are the killer apps that define the
 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.629
are the killer apps that define the
platform and so the killer app for wear

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639
platform and so the killer app for wear
 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.670
platform and so the killer app for wear
can be created just by you because it's

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680
can be created just by you because it's
 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.550
can be created just by you because it's
an open platform and the next thing is

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560
an open platform and the next thing is
 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.929
an open platform and the next thing is
is that when you build a wearable app

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:55.939
is that when you build a wearable app
 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.390
is that when you build a wearable app
you have to actually try it so you can't

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400
you have to actually try it so you can't
 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.010
you have to actually try it so you can't
just run it on an emulator on a massive

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020
just run it on an emulator on a massive
 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.170
just run it on an emulator on a massive
desktop screen with a mouse you have to

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180
desktop screen with a mouse you have to
 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.149
desktop screen with a mouse you have to
actually put it on your wrist and go for

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159
actually put it on your wrist and go for
 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.189
actually put it on your wrist and go for
a run and while you're jogging you

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199
a run and while you're jogging you
 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.420
a run and while you're jogging you
should try to use your app by touching

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430
should try to use your app by touching
 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.429
should try to use your app by touching
the screen that's when you'll discover

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:09.439
the screen that's when you'll discover
 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.830
the screen that's when you'll discover
if your little buttons are too small or

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840
if your little buttons are too small or
 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.300
if your little buttons are too small or
if there's some kind of problem with how

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310
if there's some kind of problem with how
 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.159
if there's some kind of problem with how
you're doing things so you got to get

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169
you're doing things so you got to get
 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.079
you're doing things so you got to get
yourself in the situation and try it

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:17.089
yourself in the situation and try it
 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:18.700
yourself in the situation and try it
just like a user would do and so that's

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710
just like a user would do and so that's
 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.200
just like a user would do and so that's
these are things that make we're

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210
these are things that make we're
 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.529
these are things that make we're
different so this here is the Android

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539
different so this here is the Android
 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.469
different so this here is the Android
wear interface and so you can see that

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479
wear interface and so you can see that
 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.749
wear interface and so you can see that
we have there's no grid of icons to

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759
we have there's no grid of icons to
 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.659
we have there's no grid of icons to
launch it's simple it's glanceable and

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669
launch it's simple it's glanceable and
 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.100
launch it's simple it's glanceable and
it's built around micro interactions

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110
it's built around micro interactions
 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.490
it's built around micro interactions
these very quick little gestures you can

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500
these very quick little gestures you can
 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.649
these very quick little gestures you can
look at your watch in the corner you

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659
look at your watch in the corner you
 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:39.969
look at your watch in the corner you
don't have to use it like you do with a

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979
don't have to use it like you do with a
 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.100
don't have to use it like you do with a
phone and the interface is divided up

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110
phone and the interface is divided up
 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.529
phone and the interface is divided up
into two primary behaviors so we have

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539
into two primary behaviors so we have
 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.899
into two primary behaviors so we have
the ability to talk to the wearable use

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909
the ability to talk to the wearable use
 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.629
the ability to talk to the wearable use
your voice you say okay Google send me a

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639
your voice you say okay Google send me a
 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.119
your voice you say okay Google send me a
send a message so you talk to the phone

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.129
send a message so you talk to the phone
 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.369
send a message so you talk to the phone
but sorry you talk to the watch to make

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379
but sorry you talk to the watch to make
 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.879
but sorry you talk to the watch to make
it do things and so we call these

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889
it do things and so we call these
 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.019
it do things and so we call these
actions and then the next thing is that

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:01.029
actions and then the next thing is that
 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.689
actions and then the next thing is that
once you say okay Google it then shows

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699
once you say okay Google it then shows
 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.279
once you say okay Google it then shows
you a list of commands that are possible

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289
you a list of commands that are possible
 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:07.719
you a list of commands that are possible
so you can do things like take a note

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729
so you can do things like take a note
 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.519
so you can do things like take a note
call me a ride things like that and

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:09.529
call me a ride things like that and
 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.260
call me a ride things like that and
these are the things that are available

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270
these are the things that are available
 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.800
these are the things that are available
to you now the wearable can send

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810
to you now the wearable can send
 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.540
to you now the wearable can send
information back to you as well so we

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550
information back to you as well so we
 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.459
information back to you as well so we
have these notification cards that pop

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469
have these notification cards that pop
 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.369
have these notification cards that pop
up so we call this the context Stream

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379
up so we call this the context Stream
 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.110
up so we call this the context Stream
and so there's a variety of different

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120
and so there's a variety of different
 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.089
and so there's a variety of different
things that the wearable can send to you

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099
things that the wearable can send to you
 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.129
things that the wearable can send to you
to show you on the screen are you ready

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139
to show you on the screen are you ready
 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.920
to show you on the screen are you ready
for the trip you have a flight to JFK

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930
for the trip you have a flight to JFK
 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.529
for the trip you have a flight to JFK
coming up your hotel information things

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539
coming up your hotel information things
 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.119
coming up your hotel information things
like that this is stuff that you're

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129
like that this is stuff that you're
 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:35.980
like that this is stuff that you're
walking around and you're you're

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990
walking around and you're you're
 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.360
walking around and you're you're
watching vibrate and you're like ah I've

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370
watching vibrate and you're like ah I've
 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.410
watching vibrate and you're like ah I've
got to get to the airport

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420
got to get to the airport
 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.030
got to get to the airport
it's telling you things that are

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040
it's telling you things that are
 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.790
it's telling you things that are
important right now in the right place

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800
important right now in the right place
 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.900
important right now in the right place
we don't want to tell someone about

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910
we don't want to tell someone about
 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.190
we don't want to tell someone about
something that's happening eight hours

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200
something that's happening eight hours
 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.390
something that's happening eight hours
from now you want to tell them about

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400
from now you want to tell them about
 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.830
from now you want to tell them about
something that's right now and it's

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840
something that's right now and it's
 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.740
something that's right now and it's
important so this is the framework that

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750
important so this is the framework that
 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.630
important so this is the framework that
helps you to set you up for success on

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640
helps you to set you up for success on
 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.080
helps you to set you up for success on
Android wear so if you want to make a

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090
Android wear so if you want to make a
 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.520
Android wear so if you want to make a
really good application you have to

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530
really good application you have to
 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.530
really good application you have to
carry this philosophy into your apps as

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540
carry this philosophy into your apps as
 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.680
carry this philosophy into your apps as
well so for example you have to build

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690
well so for example you have to build
 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.360
well so for example you have to build
wearable apps that are aware of the

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370
wearable apps that are aware of the
 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.970
wearable apps that are aware of the
user's context their time their location

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980
user's context their time their location
 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.040
user's context their time their location
their physical activity that card there

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050
their physical activity that card there
 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.360
their physical activity that card there
is aware of the fact that it's going to

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370
is aware of the fact that it's going to
 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.650
is aware of the fact that it's going to
take you 15 minutes to get home right

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660
take you 15 minutes to get home right
 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.390
take you 15 minutes to get home right
now because you've put something in your

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400
now because you've put something in your
 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.220
now because you've put something in your
calendar that tells you that you need to

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.230
calendar that tells you that you need to
 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.330
calendar that tells you that you need to
be home by then a watch is also designed

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.340
be home by then a watch is also designed
 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.000
be home by then a watch is also designed
to tell time in a split second so when a

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010
to tell time in a split second so when a
 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.490
to tell time in a split second so when a
user uses traditional watch they just

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500
user uses traditional watch they just
 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.810
user uses traditional watch they just
look at it know what the time is and

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820
look at it know what the time is and
 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.370
look at it know what the time is and
they're done and during this talk I'm

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380
they're done and during this talk I'm
 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.450
they're done and during this talk I'm
going to glance at my watch multiple

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460
going to glance at my watch multiple
 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.340
going to glance at my watch multiple
times to find out how I'm going for time

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.350
times to find out how I'm going for time
 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.890
times to find out how I'm going for time
and so it's very quick you're not seeing

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:32.900
and so it's very quick you're not seeing
 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.450
and so it's very quick you're not seeing
me pulling my phone out and unlocking it

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460
me pulling my phone out and unlocking it
 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.090
me pulling my phone out and unlocking it
checking the time and so if you can

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:37.100
checking the time and so if you can
 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.890
checking the time and so if you can
check the time in a split second you

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:38.900
check the time in a split second you
 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.630
check the time in a split second you
should also be able to check whatever's

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:40.640
should also be able to check whatever's
 

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.190
should also be able to check whatever's
going on in a split second so here it's

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.200
going on in a split second so here it's
 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.900
going on in a split second so here it's
like turn right onto Washington Street

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:43.910
like turn right onto Washington Street
 

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.000
like turn right onto Washington Street
this is a direction right now this is

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.010
this is a direction right now this is
 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.560
this is a direction right now this is
something you have to do and it's very

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.570
something you have to do and it's very
 

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.030
something you have to do and it's very
quick and easy and there's an arrow

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.040
quick and easy and there's an arrow
 

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.450
quick and easy and there's an arrow
pointing to where you need to go you can

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:52.460
pointing to where you need to go you can
 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.860
pointing to where you need to go you can
think of Android wear is kind of like a

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:53.870
think of Android wear is kind of like a
 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.780
think of Android wear is kind of like a
personal assistant you ask it to do

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:55.790
personal assistant you ask it to do
 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.610
personal assistant you ask it to do
things and it does the right thing for

you and it just gets it right
so here it's got you know send a note to

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.370
so here it's got you know send a note to
 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.790
so here it's got you know send a note to
Jeff I'm on my way so these are very

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800
Jeff I'm on my way so these are very
 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.680
Jeff I'm on my way so these are very
simple actions you want and it would be

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:05.690
simple actions you want and it would be
 

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.640
simple actions you want and it would be
the kind of thing that if you had a

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:06.650
the kind of thing that if you had a
 

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.380
the kind of thing that if you had a
friend next to you hey can you send a

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:08.390
friend next to you hey can you send a
 

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.790
friend next to you hey can you send a
message to Jeff tell me be there in five

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800
message to Jeff tell me be there in five
 

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.140
message to Jeff tell me be there in five
minutes that's something your friend

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.150
minutes that's something your friend
 

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.430
minutes that's something your friend
could do for you it's a personal

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440
could do for you it's a personal
 

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.780
could do for you it's a personal
assistant that's designed to help you

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:13.790
assistant that's designed to help you
 

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.600
assistant that's designed to help you
and finally you've got to focus on very

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:16.610
and finally you've got to focus on very
 

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.000
and finally you've got to focus on very
simple interactions you've got to only

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.010
simple interactions you've got to only
 

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.800
simple interactions you've got to only
require input when it's necessary you

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:20.810
require input when it's necessary you
 

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.970
require input when it's necessary you
should try to do the right thing

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:21.980
should try to do the right thing
 

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.000
should try to do the right thing
automatically and most inputs are going

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.010
automatically and most inputs are going
 

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.650
automatically and most inputs are going
to be done with touches or swipes and

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:26.660
to be done with touches or swipes and
 

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.330
to be done with touches or swipes and
because the screen is very small you

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:28.340
because the screen is very small you
 

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.950
because the screen is very small you
have to make sure that you've got very

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960
have to make sure that you've got very
 

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.920
have to make sure that you've got very
small very large touch targets things

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:32.930
small very large touch targets things
 

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.480
small very large touch targets things
that are easy to click while a person is

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:34.490
that are easy to click while a person is
 

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.190
that are easy to click while a person is
running like we talked about before so

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200
running like we talked about before so
 

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.290
running like we talked about before so
you want to avoid fine-grained finger

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:38.300
you want to avoid fine-grained finger
 

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.580
you want to avoid fine-grained finger
movements you don't want to have tiny

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:39.590
movements you don't want to have tiny
 

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.150
movements you don't want to have tiny
little keyboards and things like that so

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:43.160
little keyboards and things like that so
 

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.770
little keyboards and things like that so
when you design your Android wear

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:44.780
when you design your Android wear
 

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.300
when you design your Android wear
experience you've got to keep these kind

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:46.310
experience you've got to keep these kind
 

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.510
experience you've got to keep these kind
of things in mind so with that now we're

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:49.520
of things in mind so with that now we're
 

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.950
of things in mind so with that now we're
going to talk about the nuts and bolts

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:50.960
going to talk about the nuts and bolts
 

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.310
going to talk about the nuts and bolts
of how we go about building up

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320
of how we go about building up
 

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.870
of how we go about building up
but I really wanted to sort of set the

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880
but I really wanted to sort of set the
 

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.060
but I really wanted to sort of set the
stage for how this works because it

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.070
stage for how this works because it
 

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.430
stage for how this works because it
helps to understand that with Android

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440
helps to understand that with Android
 

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.019
helps to understand that with Android
wear the UI is probably the most

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:00.029
wear the UI is probably the most
 

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:01.579
wear the UI is probably the most
important thing how it interacts with

00:09:01.579 --> 00:09:01.589
important thing how it interacts with
 

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:03.949
important thing how it interacts with
the user is everything it you can't

00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959
the user is everything it you can't
 

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:05.749
the user is everything it you can't
write good code for this until you've

00:09:05.749 --> 00:09:05.759
write good code for this until you've
 

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:11.360
write good code for this until you've
seen how it works all right so let's go

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:11.370
seen how it works all right so let's go
 

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.040
seen how it works all right so let's go
through three topics now we're going to

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.050
through three topics now we're going to
 

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.960
through three topics now we're going to
talk about how to do notifications how

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:14.970
talk about how to do notifications how
 

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.730
talk about how to do notifications how
to make your own watch faces and then

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:16.740
to make your own watch faces and then
 

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.290
to make your own watch faces and then
how to design your own full-blown apps

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300
how to design your own full-blown apps
 

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.509
how to design your own full-blown apps
that run on web so the first is

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519
that run on web so the first is
 

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:22.400
that run on web so the first is
notifications now the cool thing about

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:22.410
notifications now the cool thing about
 

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.740
notifications now the cool thing about
notifications is that if you have a

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:24.750
notifications is that if you have a
 

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.379
notifications is that if you have a
notification on your phone they're

00:09:27.379 --> 00:09:27.389
notification on your phone they're
 

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:29.269
notification on your phone they're
automatically sent over to the wearable

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279
automatically sent over to the wearable
 

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:31.309
automatically sent over to the wearable
by the wearable companion app so any

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:31.319
by the wearable companion app so any
 

00:09:31.319 --> 00:09:33.829
by the wearable companion app so any
standard Android notification works for

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839
standard Android notification works for
 

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.360
standard Android notification works for
free on Android wear you don't really

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.370
free on Android wear you don't really
 

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.280
free on Android wear you don't really
need to do anything now you can extend

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:37.290
need to do anything now you can extend
 

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.019
need to do anything now you can extend
them to add features but you don't need

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:39.029
them to add features but you don't need
 

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:42.590
them to add features but you don't need
to so to get this done there's no work

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600
to so to get this done there's no work
 

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.360
to so to get this done there's no work
required they're just automatic also if

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.370
required they're just automatic also if
 

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.329
required they're just automatic also if
you've implemented the meteor api's or

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339
you've implemented the meteor api's or
 

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:52.550
you've implemented the meteor api's or
remote control client the actual

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560
remote control client the actual
 

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.170
remote control client the actual
controls for those are automatically

controls for those are automatically
sent to the wearable as well so any

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:55.709
sent to the wearable as well so any
 

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:57.680
sent to the wearable as well so any
standard music playing app when you're

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:57.690
standard music playing app when you're
 

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.420
standard music playing app when you're
playing music on your phone you'll see a

00:09:59.420 --> 00:09:59.430

notification on your wearable that you
 

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.840
notification on your wearable that you
can use to change tracks pick a

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:02.850
can use to change tracks pick a
 

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.550

to get this done

00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:05.819
to get this done
 

00:10:05.819 --> 00:10:09.110
to get this done
once again no work required now if you

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120
once again no work required now if you
 

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.879
once again no work required now if you
want to implement slightly more

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:10.889
want to implement slightly more
 

00:10:10.889 --> 00:10:12.889
want to implement slightly more
complicated notifications we have some

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899
complicated notifications we have some
 

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:14.269
complicated notifications we have some
extensions that we've added to

00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279
extensions that we've added to
 

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.309
extensions that we've added to
notifications so we have stacks pages

00:10:16.309 --> 00:10:16.319
notifications so we have stacks pages
 

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:17.960
notifications so we have stacks pages
and replies which allow you to make

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:17.970
and replies which allow you to make
 

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.850
and replies which allow you to make
slightly more complicated notifications

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860
slightly more complicated notifications
 

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.800
slightly more complicated notifications
that'll appear in a special way on the

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:21.810
that'll appear in a special way on the
 

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.329
that'll appear in a special way on the
wearable but they'll still be regular

00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339
wearable but they'll still be regular
 

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:25.490
wearable but they'll still be regular
notifications on a phone and you can add

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500
notifications on a phone and you can add
 

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.559
notifications on a phone and you can add
these features and it won't break your

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:27.569
these features and it won't break your
 

00:10:27.569 --> 00:10:29.240
these features and it won't break your
app even if your app is needed to run on

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.250
app even if your app is needed to run on
 

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.379
app even if your app is needed to run on
a gingerbread phone or something like

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:30.389
a gingerbread phone or something like
 

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:33.410
a gingerbread phone or something like
that so these extensions allow you to

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420
that so these extensions allow you to
 

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.460
that so these extensions allow you to
add a little bit more to your

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:34.470
add a little bit more to your
 

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.079
add a little bit more to your
notifications to make them slightly more

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:36.089
notifications to make them slightly more
 

00:10:36.089 --> 00:10:38.240
notifications to make them slightly more
useful the really cool part is you don't

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:38.250
useful the really cool part is you don't
 

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.800
useful the really cool part is you don't
need to do anything to your app except

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:39.810
need to do anything to your app except
 

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.420
need to do anything to your app except
adding a couple extra lines of code in

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:41.430
adding a couple extra lines of code in
 

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.280
adding a couple extra lines of code in
your notifications section and your app

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.290
your notifications section and your app
 

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.590
your notifications section and your app
is already sort of on the way there for

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600
is already sort of on the way there for
 

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.750
is already sort of on the way there for
Android wear support so that's really

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760
Android wear support so that's really
 

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.569
Android wear support so that's really
nice thing about notifications later on

00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579
nice thing about notifications later on
 

00:10:50.579 --> 00:10:51.679
nice thing about notifications later on
we're going to talk about how to write

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:51.689
we're going to talk about how to write
 

00:10:51.689 --> 00:10:53.929
we're going to talk about how to write
full apps which are a very complete

00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:53.939
full apps which are a very complete
 

00:10:53.939 --> 00:10:55.939
full apps which are a very complete
Android wear experience this is a great

00:10:55.939 --> 00:10:55.949
Android wear experience this is a great
 

00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:57.079
Android wear experience this is a great
way to get started so if you're already

00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:57.089
way to get started so if you're already
 

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:59.179
way to get started so if you're already
an existing Android wear developer you

00:10:59.179 --> 00:10:59.189
an existing Android wear developer you
 

00:10:59.189 --> 00:11:00.860
an existing Android wear developer you
can easily add some quick Android wear

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:00.870
can easily add some quick Android wear
 

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.870
can easily add some quick Android wear
support have a think about it try it out

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880
support have a think about it try it out
 

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.750
support have a think about it try it out
and then you

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760
and then you
 

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.010
and then you
go the whole way if you decide that's

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:05.020
go the whole way if you decide that's
 

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.940
go the whole way if you decide that's
important for you so watch faces are

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:08.950
important for you so watch faces are
 

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.050
important for you so watch faces are
probably one of the most exciting things

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.060
probably one of the most exciting things
 

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.570
probably one of the most exciting things
that people love to talk about so you

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:12.580
that people love to talk about so you
 

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.790
that people love to talk about so you
can see we've got to watch the watch

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800
can see we've got to watch the watch
 

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.850
can see we've got to watch the watch
face is the screen that is running on

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:17.860
face is the screen that is running on
 

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.040
face is the screen that is running on
the watch all the time so when it's not

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.050
the watch all the time so when it's not
 

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.780
the watch all the time so when it's not
do it when the user is not using the

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:21.790
do it when the user is not using the
 

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.390
do it when the user is not using the
screen it is showing the watch face and

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:24.400
screen it is showing the watch face and
 

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.740
screen it is showing the watch face and
you can load many different watch faces

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:25.750
you can load many different watch faces
 

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.600
you can load many different watch faces
onto a device you download them by the

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:27.610
onto a device you download them by the
 

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.080
onto a device you download them by the
Play Store and it's probably the most

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.090
Play Store and it's probably the most
 

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.850
Play Store and it's probably the most
important part of a user's Android wear

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:32.860
important part of a user's Android wear
 

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.770
important part of a user's Android wear
experience and you as an app developer

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:34.780
experience and you as an app developer
 

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.150
experience and you as an app developer
have the ability to make your own watch

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160
have the ability to make your own watch
 

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.950
have the ability to make your own watch
faces of any kind analog digital

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:37.960
faces of any kind analog digital
 

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.850
faces of any kind analog digital
whatever you want and so this is

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:41.860
whatever you want and so this is
 

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.350
whatever you want and so this is
something that people are really

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360
something that people are really
 

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.240
something that people are really
particular about people like a watch

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.250
particular about people like a watch
 

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.680
particular about people like a watch
face that's designed for them I like a

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:46.690
face that's designed for them I like a
 

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:51.120
face that's designed for them I like a
digital watch face that I like a digital

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.130
digital watch face that I like a digital
 

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.800
digital watch face that I like a digital
watch face in orange a lot of people

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:52.810
watch face in orange a lot of people
 

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.270
watch face in orange a lot of people
don't they like analog watch faces so

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:54.280
don't they like analog watch faces so
 

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.950
don't they like analog watch faces so
everyone's got a different taste here so

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:55.960
everyone's got a different taste here so
 

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.270
everyone's got a different taste here so
there's a lot of opportunity to make

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:57.280
there's a lot of opportunity to make
 

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.580
there's a lot of opportunity to make
some really cool watch faces that really

00:11:59.580 --> 00:11:59.590
some really cool watch faces that really
 

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.020
some really cool watch faces that really
changed the way we tell time so I'm

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.030
changed the way we tell time so I'm
 

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.980
changed the way we tell time so I'm
going to talk to you a little bit more

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:01.990
going to talk to you a little bit more
 

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.130
going to talk to you a little bit more
about the api's that are used to do this

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140
about the api's that are used to do this
 

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.350
about the api's that are used to do this
so with a watch face of course the most

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360
so with a watch face of course the most
 

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.460
so with a watch face of course the most
important thing is that it has to

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:08.470
important thing is that it has to
 

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.050
important thing is that it has to
actually tell the time so make sure you

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.060
actually tell the time so make sure you
 

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.670
actually tell the time so make sure you
always have that it would be kind of

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680
always have that it would be kind of
 

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.410
always have that it would be kind of
silly to make a watch face that I don't

going to like that so you've got to make

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:19.810
going to like that so you've got to make
 

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:20.880
going to like that so you've got to make
sure you put that in so you can use

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:20.890
sure you put that in so you can use
 

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.280
sure you put that in so you can use
analogue hands like in this case or you

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.290
analogue hands like in this case or you
 

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.900
analogue hands like in this case or you
could put a digital representation on

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:24.910
could put a digital representation on
 

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.610
could put a digital representation on
top of it or you could use some other

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:26.620
top of it or you could use some other
 

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.290
top of it or you could use some other
kind of representation like you could

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:28.300
kind of representation like you could
 

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.960
kind of representation like you could
print it in binary or hex or whatever it

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:30.970
print it in binary or hex or whatever it
 

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.460

is that you think your developers want

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:32.470
is that you think your developers want
 

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.180
is that you think your developers want
so you can do that too now there is a

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:36.190
so you can do that too now there is a
 

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.830
so you can do that too now there is a
status bar area so you can see with a

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:37.840
status bar area so you can see with a
 

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.780
status bar area so you can see with a

it that's telling you that notifications
 

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.470
it that's telling you that notifications
and alarms have been suppressed so these

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.480
and alarms have been suppressed so these
 

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.030
and alarms have been suppressed so these
are going to be put on the screen by the

are going to be put on the screen by the
 

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.100
are going to be put on the screen by the
system and you need a place on your

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.110
system and you need a place on your
 

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.620

you you can own the whole watch face and
 

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.340
you you can own the whole watch face and
draw what you want but the system also

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:53.350
draw what you want but the system also
 

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.350
draw what you want but the system also
needs to put a few icons here and there

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360
needs to put a few icons here and there
 

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.030
needs to put a few icons here and there
that you need to make room for and also

you need to be prepared to deal with
 

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.390
you need to be prepared to deal with
them so what you can do in some cases is

you can resize your watch face to not be

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240
you can resize your watch face to not be
 

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.110
you can resize your watch face to not be
under the card in other cases you can

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120
under the card in other cases you can
 

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.880
under the card in other cases you can
also control how much the card pops up

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:14.890
also control how much the card pops up
 

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.170
also control how much the card pops up
and things like that so you get control

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:16.180
and things like that so you get control
 

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:16.930
and things like that so you get control
over all these things

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:16.940
over all these things

as part of the API for it and you can
also add other things such as the time

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:22.520
also add other things such as the time

different kinds of people depending on
 

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.840
different kinds of people depending on
what they want to do so here are a few

what they want to do so here are a few
 

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.430
what they want to do so here are a few
guidelines to make sure you get this

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440
guidelines to make sure you get this
 

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.710
guidelines to make sure you get this
right so the first thing is that Android

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720
right so the first thing is that Android
 

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.720
right so the first thing is that Android
wear comes in multiple form factors so

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:43.730
wear comes in multiple form factors so
 

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.100
wear comes in multiple form factors so
if you're designing a watch face you

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.110
if you're designing a watch face you
 

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.050
if you're designing a watch face you
really want it to run on both round and

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:47.060
really want it to run on both round and
 

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.540
really want it to run on both round and
square watches so it would be kind of a

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:49.550
square watches so it would be kind of a
 

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.430
square watches so it would be kind of a
bad idea to build a watch face that only

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440
bad idea to build a watch face that only
 

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.500
bad idea to build a watch face that only
runs on Square and if round people

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:53.510
runs on Square and if round people
 

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.000
runs on Square and if round people

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.300
gonna be upset they're gonna write bad

gonna be upset they're gonna write bad
reviews about your app so you really

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:58.250
reviews about your app so you really
 

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.200
reviews about your app so you really
want to make sure you cover both

00:13:59.200 --> 00:13:59.210
want to make sure you cover both
 

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.260
want to make sure you cover both
platforms and in some cases like an

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.270
platforms and in some cases like an
 

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.270
platforms and in some cases like an
analog watch face if it's just got some

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:04.280
analog watch face if it's just got some
 

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.740
analog watch face if it's just got some
hands on it that'll work both on a round

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:05.750
hands on it that'll work both on a round
 

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.840
hands on it that'll work both on a round
in a square device in other cases you

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:07.850
in a square device in other cases you
 

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.310
in a square device in other cases you
might have to redesign the watch face

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320
might have to redesign the watch face
 

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.200
might have to redesign the watch face
completely because Square is very

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.210
completely because Square is very
 

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.140
completely because Square is very
different the corners are present

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.150
different the corners are present
 

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.490
different the corners are present
whereas on a round watch they're chopped

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:15.500
whereas on a round watch they're chopped
 

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.210
whereas on a round watch they're chopped
off so you might need to deal with that

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:18.220
off so you might need to deal with that
 

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.040
off so you might need to deal with that
next Android wear displays have two

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.050
next Android wear displays have two
 

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.630
next Android wear displays have two
modes that they run in there is an

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:22.640
modes that they run in there is an
 

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.240
modes that they run in there is an
interactive mode and an ambient mode so

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:25.250
interactive mode and an ambient mode so
 

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.590
interactive mode and an ambient mode so
interactive mode is when you're touching

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.600
interactive mode is when you're touching
 

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.570
interactive mode is when you're touching
the screen and you're interacting with

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:28.580
the screen and you're interacting with
 

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.310
the screen and you're interacting with
the device you can actually detect

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320
the device you can actually detect
 

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.730
the device you can actually detect
touches as well and this is the mode

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:33.740
touches as well and this is the mode
 

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.080
touches as well and this is the mode
that's used when the user is giving

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.090
that's used when the user is giving
 

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.180
that's used when the user is giving
their attention to the watch now the

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:37.190
their attention to the watch now the
 

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.610
their attention to the watch now the
screen is fully active you can have all

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:39.620
screen is fully active you can have all
 

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.590
screen is fully active you can have all
the colors and everything like that but

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600
the colors and everything like that but
 

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.140
the colors and everything like that but
after a short period of idle time the

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.150
after a short period of idle time the
 

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.030
after a short period of idle time the
watch goes into what's called ambient or

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040
watch goes into what's called ambient or
 

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.670
watch goes into what's called ambient or
always-on mode in this mode the screen

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:48.680
always-on mode in this mode the screen
 

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.250
always-on mode in this mode the screen
goes into a low-power State it reduces

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:51.260
goes into a low-power State it reduces
 

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.390
goes into a low-power State it reduces
the amount of colors that are available

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:52.400
the amount of colors that are available
 

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.580
the amount of colors that are available
and you should also reduce the number of

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:54.590
and you should also reduce the number of
 

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.710
and you should also reduce the number of
pixels that are drawn on the screen to

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720
pixels that are drawn on the screen to
 

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.870
pixels that are drawn on the screen to
save power and to avoid burn and we'll

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880
save power and to avoid burn and we'll
 

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.700
save power and to avoid burn and we'll
talk about that a bit more in a sec but

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:00.710
talk about that a bit more in a sec but
 

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.920
talk about that a bit more in a sec but
um you'll see in this case here we have

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:02.930
um you'll see in this case here we have
 

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.480
um you'll see in this case here we have
a watch face on the Left which is full

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:04.490
a watch face on the Left which is full
 

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.640
a watch face on the Left which is full
color and then in ambient mode it's just

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:06.650
color and then in ambient mode it's just
 

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.500
color and then in ambient mode it's just
a black screen with hands on it so you

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:08.510
a black screen with hands on it so you
 

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.570
a black screen with hands on it so you
need to design your watch face to run in

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:10.580
need to design your watch face to run in
 

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.430
need to design your watch face to run in
both of these modes and you cannot

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440
both of these modes and you cannot
 

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.860
both of these modes and you cannot
render a full colored image constantly

in ambient mode when it's sleeping the

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.330
in ambient mode when it's sleeping the
 

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.800
in ambient mode when it's sleeping the
watch won't allow that and secondly the

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:20.810
watch won't allow that and secondly the
 

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.590
watch won't allow that and secondly the
watch face refreshes continuously when

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600
watch face refreshes continuously when
 

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.329
watch face refreshes continuously when
you're in active mode but when you're in

00:15:25.329 --> 00:15:25.339
you're in active mode but when you're in
 

00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:27.730
you're in active mode but when you're in
ambient mode the watch goes to sleep and

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:27.740
ambient mode the watch goes to sleep and
 

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.800
ambient mode the watch goes to sleep and
it only refreshes the screen once every

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:29.810
it only refreshes the screen once every
 

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:30.370
it only refreshes the screen once every
minute

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:30.380
minute
 

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.080
minute
so you should remove the second hand and

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:32.090
so you should remove the second hand and
 

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.690
so you should remove the second hand and
you should only draw hours and minutes

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:33.700
you should only draw hours and minutes
 

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.950
you should only draw hours and minutes
because we're trying to save power so

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:35.960
because we're trying to save power so
 

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.930
because we're trying to save power so
when the screen is in ambient mode the

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:37.940
when the screen is in ambient mode the
 

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.490
when the screen is in ambient mode the
watch is not running it's actually

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:39.500
watch is not running it's actually
 

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.930
watch is not running it's actually
asleep and the only thing that's awake

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:40.940
asleep and the only thing that's awake
 

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.610
asleep and the only thing that's awake
is the display driver just keeping that

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:42.620
is the display driver just keeping that
 

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.560
is the display driver just keeping that
screen going so it's a great way to save

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:44.570
screen going so it's a great way to save
 

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.290
screen going so it's a great way to save
power and it means that you don't have

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:47.300
power and it means that you don't have
 

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.850
power and it means that you don't have
to flick your watch up to look at the

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:48.860
to flick your watch up to look at the
 

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.130
to flick your watch up to look at the
time the watch is always showing the

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:51.140
time the watch is always showing the
 

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.900
time the watch is always showing the
time as you can see from as I'm walking

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:52.910
time as you can see from as I'm walking
 

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.090
time as you can see from as I'm walking
around this watch never shuts down and

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:55.100
around this watch never shuts down and
 

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.260
around this watch never shuts down and
that's one of the really cool features

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:56.270
that's one of the really cool features
 

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.940
that's one of the really cool features
of Android wear is the screen is running

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:57.950
of Android wear is the screen is running
 

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.750
of Android wear is the screen is running
all the time now when we talk about

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:01.760
all the time now when we talk about
 

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.520
all the time now when we talk about
ambient mode we also need to deal with

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:03.530
ambient mode we also need to deal with
 

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.970
ambient mode we also need to deal with
how it's implemented so for example

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:05.980
how it's implemented so for example
 

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.320
how it's implemented so for example
certain screens on Android wear are

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:08.330
certain screens on Android wear are
 

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.120
certain screens on Android wear are
called low bit screens when they go into

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:10.130
called low bit screens when they go into
 

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:11.920
called low bit screens when they go into
ambient mode they actually don't allow

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:11.930
ambient mode they actually don't allow
 

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.070
ambient mode they actually don't allow
full 24-bit color they only allow

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.080
full 24-bit color they only allow
 

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.570
full 24-bit color they only allow
primary red green and blue colors like

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:16.580
primary red green and blue colors like
 

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.700
primary red green and blue colors like
only certain colors are allowed you

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:18.710
only certain colors are allowed you
 

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.500
only certain colors are allowed you
can't render shades and all that kind of

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:20.510
can't render shades and all that kind of
 

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.210
can't render shades and all that kind of
thing it's a feature of the display

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:22.220
thing it's a feature of the display
 

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.590
thing it's a feature of the display
driver that allows it to save power

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600
driver that allows it to save power
 

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.750
driver that allows it to save power
other displays go into a black and white

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:25.760
other displays go into a black and white
 

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.870
other displays go into a black and white
mode and some displays such as OLED

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880
mode and some displays such as OLED
 

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.940
mode and some displays such as OLED
displays actually require you to only

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:30.950
displays actually require you to only
 

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.420
displays actually require you to only
illuminate 5% of the pixels in low-power

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:34.430
illuminate 5% of the pixels in low-power
 

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.520
illuminate 5% of the pixels in low-power
mode if you try to keep all the pixels

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:36.530
mode if you try to keep all the pixels
 

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.200
mode if you try to keep all the pixels
on the screen on all the time what will

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.210
on the screen on all the time what will
 

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.420
on the screen on all the time what will
happen is that over time the screen will

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:40.430
happen is that over time the screen will
 

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.630
happen is that over time the screen will
burn in and you'll actually permanently

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:42.640
burn in and you'll actually permanently
 

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.860
burn in and you'll actually permanently
you'll see the pixels penalty burnt into

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:44.870
you'll see the pixels penalty burnt into
 

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.110
you'll see the pixels penalty burnt into
the screen and the other trick that some

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120
the screen and the other trick that some
 

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.670
the screen and the other trick that some
of the displays do is they'll actually

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680
of the displays do is they'll actually
 

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.590
of the displays do is they'll actually
take your watch face and every minute

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600
take your watch face and every minute
 

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.630
take your watch face and every minute
they will jiggle it in a direction so

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:52.640
they will jiggle it in a direction so
 

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.100
they will jiggle it in a direction so
they'll jiggle it 10 pixels in either

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.110
they'll jiggle it 10 pixels in either
 

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.380
they'll jiggle it 10 pixels in either
direction and they use that to help the

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:56.390
direction and they use that to help the
 

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.210
direction and they use that to help the
watch face avoid burning your screen in

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:58.220
watch face avoid burning your screen in
 

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.920
watch face avoid burning your screen in
as well so you should never have large

00:16:59.920 --> 00:16:59.930
as well so you should never have large
 

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.460
as well so you should never have large
patches of solid color because they will

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:02.470
patches of solid color because they will
 

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.510
patches of solid color because they will
eventually burn into the screen and the

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520
eventually burn into the screen and the
 

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.490
eventually burn into the screen and the
jiggling can't get around that either so

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:06.500
jiggling can't get around that either so
 

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.140
jiggling can't get around that either so
definitely you want to try to make sure

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:08.150
definitely you want to try to make sure
 

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.820
definitely you want to try to make sure
that you're careful about when you

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:09.830
that you're careful about when you
 

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.470
that you're careful about when you
design your ambient mode because you

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480
design your ambient mode because you
 

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.360
design your ambient mode because you
need to keep a lot of the pixels off to

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:13.370
need to keep a lot of the pixels off to
 

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:16.360
need to keep a lot of the pixels off to
save power and to save the screen so

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:16.370
save power and to save the screen so
 

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.100
save power and to save the screen so
when you're writing a watch face there

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:18.110
when you're writing a watch face there
 

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:19.840
when you're writing a watch face there
is a class called canvas watch face

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:19.850
is a class called canvas watch face
 

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.150
is a class called canvas watch face
service and service engine that you're

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160
service and service engine that you're
 

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.800
service and service engine that you're
going to be sort of implementing here

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:23.810
going to be sort of implementing here
 

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.260
going to be sort of implementing here
and inside of that there are three

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:26.270
and inside of that there are three
 

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.180
and inside of that there are three
methods so there's oncreate which is

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:28.190
methods so there's oncreate which is
 

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.110
methods so there's oncreate which is
where you're going to take care of

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120
where you're going to take care of
 

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.120
where you're going to take care of
initialization steps so one thing you

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:31.130
initialization steps so one thing you
 

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.860
initialization steps so one thing you
want to make sure you do here is you can

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:32.870
want to make sure you do here is you can
 

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.210
want to make sure you do here is you can
have an image as the background of your

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:34.220
have an image as the background of your
 

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.650
have an image as the background of your
watch face but you've got to make sure

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:35.660
watch face but you've got to make sure
 

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.210
watch face but you've got to make sure
that you scale the image and do anything

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:37.220
that you scale the image and do anything
 

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.310
that you scale the image and do anything
like that in advance you don't want to

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320
like that in advance you don't want to
 

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.260
like that in advance you don't want to
be scaling the image on every redraw

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:41.270
be scaling the image on every redraw
 

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.910
be scaling the image on every redraw
because that's very expensive you'll

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:42.920
because that's very expensive you'll
 

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.690
because that's very expensive you'll
generate a lot of

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:43.700
generate a lot of
 

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.970
generate a lot of
and so forth so in oncreate you want to

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:45.980
and so forth so in oncreate you want to
 

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.519
and so forth so in oncreate you want to
do all of the initialization steps the

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:48.529
do all of the initialization steps the
 

00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:50.440
do all of the initialization steps the
next thing is there's a method called on

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:50.450
next thing is there's a method called on
 

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.629
next thing is there's a method called on
surface changed and on surface changed

00:17:52.629 --> 00:17:52.639
surface changed and on surface changed
 

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:57.100
surface changed and on surface changed
is cold when it announces the size of

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.110
is cold when it announces the size of
 

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.200
is cold when it announces the size of
the screen to you so this is where you

00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.210
the screen to you so this is where you
 

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.419
the screen to you so this is where you
would deal with things like resizing an

00:18:01.419 --> 00:18:01.429
would deal with things like resizing an
 

00:18:01.429 --> 00:18:04.360
would deal with things like resizing an
image or anything I guess it's possible

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:04.370
image or anything I guess it's possible
 

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.889
image or anything I guess it's possible
in the future that a watch could rotate

00:18:05.889 --> 00:18:05.899
in the future that a watch could rotate
 

00:18:05.899 --> 00:18:08.470
in the future that a watch could rotate
and if it rotates it would give you an

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480
and if it rotates it would give you an
 

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.330
and if it rotates it would give you an
update on surface change so on surface

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:10.340
update on surface change so on surface
 

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.370
update on surface change so on surface
change is where you're notified as to

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:12.380
change is where you're notified as to
 

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.090
change is where you're notified as to
changes in the screen and then finally

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:16.100
changes in the screen and then finally
 

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.039
changes in the screen and then finally
all the drawing itself is done in the

00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:18.049
all the drawing itself is done in the
 

00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:19.990
all the drawing itself is done in the
ondraw method so this is the method

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000
ondraw method so this is the method
 

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.370
ondraw method so this is the method
that's called by the frame by the

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:21.380
that's called by the frame by the
 

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.620
that's called by the frame by the
Android wear system that says draw the

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:23.630
Android wear system that says draw the
 

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.840
Android wear system that says draw the
watch right now and so you should be

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:25.850
watch right now and so you should be
 

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.600
watch right now and so you should be
doing no calendar queries you don't want

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:28.610
doing no calendar queries you don't want
 

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.070
doing no calendar queries you don't want
to be doing anything expensive

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080
to be doing anything expensive
 

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.009
to be doing anything expensive
everything has to be fast here and

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:32.019
everything has to be fast here and
 

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:34.870
everything has to be fast here and
that's where you draw everything and if

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880
that's where you draw everything and if
 

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.639
that's where you draw everything and if
you want you can have an animated watch

00:18:36.639 --> 00:18:36.649
you want you can have an animated watch
 

00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:39.190
you want you can have an animated watch
face with smooth ticking second hands so

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200
face with smooth ticking second hands so
 

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.080
face with smooth ticking second hands so
no ticking it'll just smoothly move by

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.090
no ticking it'll just smoothly move by
 

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.879
no ticking it'll just smoothly move by
just repeatedly calling on draw over and

00:18:42.879 --> 00:18:42.889
just repeatedly calling on draw over and
 

00:18:42.889 --> 00:18:44.440
just repeatedly calling on draw over and
over again and then you call an

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:44.450
over again and then you call an
 

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.060
over again and then you call an
invalidate method which then makes it

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.070
invalidate method which then makes it
 

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.580
invalidate method which then makes it
call on draw repeatedly but you don't

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:48.590
call on draw repeatedly but you don't
 

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.409
call on draw repeatedly but you don't
want to be doing that kind of work when

00:18:50.409 --> 00:18:50.419
want to be doing that kind of work when
 

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:52.419
want to be doing that kind of work when
you're in ambient mode because you want

00:18:52.419 --> 00:18:52.429
you're in ambient mode because you want
 

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:53.860
you're in ambient mode because you want
the display to sleep and you don't want

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:53.870
the display to sleep and you don't want
 

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.779
the display to sleep and you don't want
to be constantly hammering away trying

00:18:55.779 --> 00:18:55.789
to be constantly hammering away trying
 

00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:57.669
to be constantly hammering away trying
to refresh the screen so when you're in

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679
to refresh the screen so when you're in
 

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.409
to refresh the screen so when you're in
ambient mode your app needs to stop

00:18:59.409 --> 00:18:59.419
ambient mode your app needs to stop
 

00:18:59.419 --> 00:19:00.820
ambient mode your app needs to stop
doing things you don't want to be doing

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:00.830
doing things you don't want to be doing
 

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.430
doing things you don't want to be doing
too many any you don't wanna be doing

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440
too many any you don't wanna be doing
 

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.019
too many any you don't wanna be doing
any work you want to be sleeping while

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:05.029
any work you want to be sleeping while
 

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:08.350
any work you want to be sleeping while
the watch is in ambient mode so that's

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360
the watch is in ambient mode so that's
 

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.049
the watch is in ambient mode so that's
watch faces now let's talk about how we

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:11.059
watch faces now let's talk about how we
 

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:13.180
watch faces now let's talk about how we
go about actually building apps and

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:13.190
go about actually building apps and
 

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.970
go about actually building apps and
making them work on Android wear so

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:15.980
making them work on Android wear so
 

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.159
making them work on Android wear so
Android wear devices are actually

00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:18.169
Android wear devices are actually
 

00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:20.919
Android wear devices are actually
complete Android implementations they

00:19:20.919 --> 00:19:20.929
complete Android implementations they
 

00:19:20.929 --> 00:19:22.750
complete Android implementations they
have everything they have OpenGL they

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760
have everything they have OpenGL they
 

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.990
have everything they have OpenGL they
have all of the activities and

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000
have all of the activities and
 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.159
have all of the activities and
frameworks and everything that you've

00:19:27.159 --> 00:19:27.169
frameworks and everything that you've
 

00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:28.930
frameworks and everything that you've
come to be used to writing regular

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:28.940
come to be used to writing regular
 

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.730
come to be used to writing regular
Android apps probably the only two

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:30.740
Android apps probably the only two
 

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.230
Android apps probably the only two
things that are missing is that there's

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240
things that are missing is that there's
 

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.120
things that are missing is that there's
no video codecs and you don't have

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:34.130
no video codecs and you don't have
 

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.649
no video codecs and you don't have
direct access to the Internet so you

00:19:35.649 --> 00:19:35.659
direct access to the Internet so you
 

00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:37.860
direct access to the Internet so you
can't make HTTP requests to a web server

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:37.870
can't make HTTP requests to a web server
 

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.860
can't make HTTP requests to a web server
and you're not able to play video back

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:41.870
and you're not able to play video back
 

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.269
and you're not able to play video back
on the screen the codecs have been

00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:43.279
on the screen the codecs have been
 

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:45.009
on the screen the codecs have been
removed to save power and battery and

00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:45.019
removed to save power and battery and
 

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:47.680
removed to save power and battery and
space on the device and you also

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:47.690
space on the device and you also
 

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.269
space on the device and you also
probably shouldn't be playing videos on

00:19:49.269 --> 00:19:49.279
probably shouldn't be playing videos on
 

00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:51.100
probably shouldn't be playing videos on
Android wear device as well if you're

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.110
Android wear device as well if you're
 

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.810
Android wear device as well if you're
looking at something for 30 seconds on

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:52.820
looking at something for 30 seconds on
 

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.159
looking at something for 30 seconds on
the screen like watching a video you

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:54.169
the screen like watching a video you
 

00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:55.330
the screen like watching a video you
probably should be pulling your phone

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:55.340
probably should be pulling your phone
 

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.760
probably should be pulling your phone
out of your pocket and looking at

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:56.770
out of your pocket and looking at
 

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.410
out of your pocket and looking at
a regular screen so certain things you

00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:58.420
a regular screen so certain things you
 

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.120
a regular screen so certain things you
really don't want to be doing and

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:00.130
really don't want to be doing and
 

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.620
really don't want to be doing and
Android wear devices are very powerful

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:01.630
Android wear devices are very powerful
 

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.360
Android wear devices are very powerful
and they're capable of doing pretty much

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:03.370
and they're capable of doing pretty much
 

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.730
and they're capable of doing pretty much
anything you can throw at them the only

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:05.740
anything you can throw at them the only
 

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.590
anything you can throw at them the only
difference is the way they're packaged

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600
difference is the way they're packaged
 

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.860
difference is the way they're packaged
and so the way it works is that you

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:10.870
and so the way it works is that you
 

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.650
and so the way it works is that you
build a wearable apk that's going to be

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:13.660
build a wearable apk that's going to be
 

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.870
build a wearable apk that's going to be
installed to the Android wear device but

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880
installed to the Android wear device but
 

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.330
installed to the Android wear device but
the wearable apk is not sent directly to

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:18.340
the wearable apk is not sent directly to
 

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.520
the wearable apk is not sent directly to
the wearable what you do is you take the

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:20.530
the wearable what you do is you take the
 

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.440
the wearable what you do is you take the
wearable apk that you've built and you

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:22.450
wearable apk that you've built and you
 

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.570
wearable apk that you've built and you
put it inside the phone apk you put it

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:24.580
put it inside the phone apk you put it
 

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.150
put it inside the phone apk you put it
in the reservoir or directory basically

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160
in the reservoir or directory basically
 

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.620
in the reservoir or directory basically
when it's in the reservoir directory you

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:28.630
when it's in the reservoir directory you
 

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.080
when it's in the reservoir directory you
declare an XML file and then you put it

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.090
declare an XML file and then you put it
 

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.940
declare an XML file and then you put it
inside the main phone apk and you push

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:32.950
inside the main phone apk and you push
 

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.850
inside the main phone apk and you push
that phone apk to the Play Store when

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:35.860
that phone apk to the Play Store when
 

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.160
that phone apk to the Play Store when
the user downloads that phone apk it

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.170
the user downloads that phone apk it
 

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.020
the user downloads that phone apk it
arrives on their phone and then the

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.030
arrives on their phone and then the
 

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.460
arrives on their phone and then the
wearable companion app goes others a

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:41.470
wearable companion app goes others a
 

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.260
wearable companion app goes others a
wearable app in here it takes that and

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:43.270
wearable app in here it takes that and
 

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.600
wearable app in here it takes that and
installs it onto your wearable and then

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:45.610
installs it onto your wearable and then
 

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.790
installs it onto your wearable and then
it installs and it's ready to go

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:47.800
it installs and it's ready to go
 

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.620
it installs and it's ready to go
so the nice thing about Android wear is

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:49.630
so the nice thing about Android wear is
 

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.050
so the nice thing about Android wear is
that over time as different companies

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:52.060
that over time as different companies
 

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.970
that over time as different companies
add wear support to their apps your

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:53.980
add wear support to their apps your
 

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.410
add wear support to their apps your
customers just kind of get it for free

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:55.420
customers just kind of get it for free
 

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.880
customers just kind of get it for free
they don't need to go out of their way

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:56.890
they don't need to go out of their way
 

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.120
they don't need to go out of their way
to download a new app or to go and check

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:00.130
to download a new app or to go and check
 

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.980
to download a new app or to go and check
any boxes or do anything it just happens

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:01.990
any boxes or do anything it just happens
 

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.120
any boxes or do anything it just happens
automatically so that's the great thing

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:03.130
automatically so that's the great thing
 

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.590
automatically so that's the great thing
about wear is it's very easy for

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600
about wear is it's very easy for
 

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.400
about wear is it's very easy for
customers to deal with so one final

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.410
customers to deal with so one final
 

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.200
customers to deal with so one final
thing is that when you update your app

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.210
thing is that when you update your app
 

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.940
thing is that when you update your app
to the Play Store you bump the version

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:11.950
to the Play Store you bump the version
 

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.740
to the Play Store you bump the version
codes you push it on to the Play Store

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:13.750
codes you push it on to the Play Store
 

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.960
codes you push it on to the Play Store
and then it downloads to the phone and

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:15.970
and then it downloads to the phone and
 

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.610
and then it downloads to the phone and
the phone goes up there's a new version

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:17.620
the phone goes up there's a new version
 

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.930
the phone goes up there's a new version
of the app I'll push it to the wearable

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:18.940
of the app I'll push it to the wearable
 

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.090
of the app I'll push it to the wearable
as well so as a little tip very

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:21.100
as well so as a little tip very
 

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.770
as well so as a little tip very
important that you get the version codes

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:22.780
important that you get the version codes
 

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.570
important that you get the version codes
on the wearable and phone sights to be

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:24.580
on the wearable and phone sights to be
 

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.890
on the wearable and phone sights to be
the same they have to have the same

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:25.900
the same they have to have the same
 

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.600
the same they have to have the same
package name otherwise they won't be

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:27.610
package name otherwise they won't be
 

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.420
package name otherwise they won't be
able to talk to each other so in Gradle

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:30.430
able to talk to each other so in Gradle
 

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.030
able to talk to each other so in Gradle
in Android studio we have a wear app so

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:33.040
in Android studio we have a wear app so
 

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.740
in Android studio we have a wear app so
you'll see this in the build Gradle for

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:34.750
you'll see this in the build Gradle for
 

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.540
you'll see this in the build Gradle for
the application it'll say wear art

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:36.550
the application it'll say wear art
 

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.760
the application it'll say wear art
project brackets wear and what that says

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:38.770
project brackets wear and what that says
 

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.040
project brackets wear and what that says
is take the wearable project compile it

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.050
is take the wearable project compile it
 

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.170
is take the wearable project compile it
and then bring that apk and put it

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:43.180
and then bring that apk and put it
 

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.940
and then bring that apk and put it
inside the phone app so it actually

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:44.950
inside the phone app so it actually
 

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.530
inside the phone app so it actually
takes care of all this for you so when

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:46.540
takes care of all this for you so when
 

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.120
takes care of all this for you so when
you're building in release mode their

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.130
you're building in release mode their
 

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.650
you're building in release mode their
wearable apk is embedded into the phone

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:49.660
wearable apk is embedded into the phone
 

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.350
wearable apk is embedded into the phone
apk just takes care of it for you and a

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360
apk just takes care of it for you and a
 

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.270
apk just takes care of it for you and a
lot of our samples implement this as

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:54.280
lot of our samples implement this as
 

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.250
lot of our samples implement this as
well so you can see how it's done so

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260
well so you can see how it's done so
 

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.690
well so you can see how it's done so
let's talk now about things that are

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:00.700
let's talk now about things that are
 

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.370
let's talk now about things that are
wearable specifics so while they are

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:02.380
wearable specifics so while they are
 

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.200
wearable specifics so while they are
complete Android devices and they

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:04.210
complete Android devices and they
 

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.470
complete Android devices and they
implement everything that you've seen on

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480
implement everything that you've seen on
 

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.120
implement everything that you've seen on
Android before so you can reuse your

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.130
Android before so you can reuse your
 

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.620
Android before so you can reuse your
same skills and knowledge

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:10.630
same skills and knowledge
 

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:11.970
same skills and knowledge
there's a few things that Android wear

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:11.980
there's a few things that Android wear
 

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.169
there's a few things that Android wear
that are different that you need to be

00:22:13.169 --> 00:22:13.179
that are different that you need to be
 

00:22:13.179 --> 00:22:14.250
that are different that you need to be
aware of so the rest of the talk is

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:14.260
aware of so the rest of the talk is
 

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.419
aware of so the rest of the talk is
going to be talking about those things

00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:15.429
going to be talking about those things
 

00:22:15.429 --> 00:22:17.880
going to be talking about those things
so we're going to talk about sharing

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:17.890
so we're going to talk about sharing
 

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.380
so we're going to talk about sharing
data between the wearable and the phone

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:19.390
data between the wearable and the phone
 

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.000
data between the wearable and the phone
we're gonna talk about building custom

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.010
we're gonna talk about building custom
 

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.890
we're gonna talk about building custom
user interfaces and I'm gonna finish up

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:22.900
user interfaces and I'm gonna finish up
 

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.270
user interfaces and I'm gonna finish up
by talking quickly about how we

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:24.280
by talking quickly about how we
 

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.110
by talking quickly about how we
implement voice interactions so as I

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120
implement voice interactions so as I
 

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.419
implement voice interactions so as I
said before Android wear devices don't

00:22:30.419 --> 00:22:30.429
said before Android wear devices don't
 

00:22:30.429 --> 00:22:32.549
said before Android wear devices don't
have direct network access you'll

00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559
have direct network access you'll
 

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.590
have direct network access you'll
sometimes season that Android wear

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600
sometimes season that Android wear
 

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.510
sometimes season that Android wear
devices support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520
devices support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and
 

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.610
devices support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and
if the Android wear device is connected

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:38.620
if the Android wear device is connected
 

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.770
if the Android wear device is connected
in a certain way by Wi-Fi

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:40.780
in a certain way by Wi-Fi
 

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.799
in a certain way by Wi-Fi
sometimes there's access but you can't

00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:43.809
sometimes there's access but you can't
 

00:22:43.809 --> 00:22:46.440
sometimes there's access but you can't
rely on that behavior the only way to

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:46.450
rely on that behavior the only way to
 

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.020
rely on that behavior the only way to
get proper connectivity between the

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.030
get proper connectivity between the
 

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.750
get proper connectivity between the
phone and the wearable is to use what we

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760
phone and the wearable is to use what we
 

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.110
phone and the wearable is to use what we
call the data API and message API and so

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120
call the data API and message API and so
 

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.240
call the data API and message API and so
forth and what they do is they allow the

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.250
forth and what they do is they allow the
 

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.710
forth and what they do is they allow the
wearable on the phone to talk each other

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720
wearable on the phone to talk each other
 

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.590
wearable on the phone to talk each other
and then the phone can go and do the

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600
and then the phone can go and do the
 

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.060
and then the phone can go and do the
network access for you so if your

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:03.070
network access for you so if your
 

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.500
network access for you so if your
wearable app needs to go and find out

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:04.510
wearable app needs to go and find out
 

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.330
wearable app needs to go and find out
what the weather is the wearable app

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:06.340
what the weather is the wearable app
 

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.980
what the weather is the wearable app
will send a message to the phone app

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:07.990
will send a message to the phone app
 

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.240
will send a message to the phone app
saying hey tell me the current weather

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.250
saying hey tell me the current weather
 

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.640
saying hey tell me the current weather
the phone will then make an HTTP request

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:11.650
the phone will then make an HTTP request
 

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.010
the phone will then make an HTTP request
to a weather website it'll download the

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:14.020
to a weather website it'll download the
 

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.779
to a weather website it'll download the
weather information it will then go our

00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:15.789
weather information it will then go our
 

00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:17.520
weather information it will then go our
the temperature today is 56 it'll then

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:17.530
the temperature today is 56 it'll then
 

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.260
the temperature today is 56 it'll then
take that number send it over as a

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:19.270
take that number send it over as a
 

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.090
take that number send it over as a
message to the wearable and the wearable

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:21.100
message to the wearable and the wearable
 

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.950
message to the wearable and the wearable
can then draw it you don't want the

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960
can then draw it you don't want the
 

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.049
can then draw it you don't want the
wearable doing lots of heavy work if the

00:23:25.049 --> 00:23:25.059
wearable doing lots of heavy work if the
 

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:27.360
wearable doing lots of heavy work if the
wearable is able to make an HTTP request

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:27.370
wearable is able to make an HTTP request
 

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.799
wearable is able to make an HTTP request
you don't want it sitting there making

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:28.809
you don't want it sitting there making
 

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:31.110
you don't want it sitting there making
the query pausing all the HTML and

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120
the query pausing all the HTML and
 

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.399
the query pausing all the HTML and
cleaning it all up you don't want the

00:23:32.399 --> 00:23:32.409
cleaning it all up you don't want the
 

00:23:32.409 --> 00:23:34.340
cleaning it all up you don't want the
wearable doing these kind of things so

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:34.350
wearable doing these kind of things so
 

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.110
wearable doing these kind of things so
that's important and this communication

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120
that's important and this communication
 

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.060
that's important and this communication
mechanism is implemented by Google Play

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.070
mechanism is implemented by Google Play
 

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.190
mechanism is implemented by Google Play
services so Play services provides the

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200
services so Play services provides the
 

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.930
services so Play services provides the
framework that allows these devices to

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:42.940
framework that allows these devices to
 

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.210
framework that allows these devices to
talk to each other and they're done via

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:45.220
talk to each other and they're done via
 

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.130
talk to each other and they're done via
synchronous calls so we're going to go

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:47.140
synchronous calls so we're going to go
 

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.990
synchronous calls so we're going to go
through now how to go about doing this

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.000
through now how to go about doing this
 

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.120
through now how to go about doing this
so there are three kinds of data

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.130
so there are three kinds of data
 

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.250
so there are three kinds of data
exchange that are possible the first one

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:53.260
exchange that are possible the first one
 

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.529
exchange that are possible the first one
is the node API and what this does is it

00:23:55.529 --> 00:23:55.539
is the node API and what this does is it
 

00:23:55.539 --> 00:23:56.970
is the node API and what this does is it
tells you when two devices are connected

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:56.980
tells you when two devices are connected
 

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.600
tells you when two devices are connected
so if a wearable on a phone appear close

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:00.610
so if a wearable on a phone appear close
 

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.310
so if a wearable on a phone appear close
to each other the known API will say

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320
to each other the known API will say
 

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.590
to each other the known API will say
yeah a device has just become connected

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600
yeah a device has just become connected
 

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.659
yeah a device has just become connected
and if the wearable goes off for a walk

00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:06.669
and if the wearable goes off for a walk
 

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:08.669
and if the wearable goes off for a walk
or the phone goes for a walk then you'll

00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679
or the phone goes for a walk then you'll
 

00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:10.020
or the phone goes for a walk then you'll
get a disconnect message so that you

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.030
get a disconnect message so that you
 

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.190
get a disconnect message so that you
know that they're no longer paired to

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200
know that they're no longer paired to
 

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.190
know that they're no longer paired to
each other we have the message API which

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:14.200
each other we have the message API which
 

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.960
each other we have the message API which
allows you to exchange low latency

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:15.970
allows you to exchange low latency
 

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.169
allows you to exchange low latency
messages so these are messages where the

00:24:19.169 --> 00:24:19.179
messages so these are messages where the
 

00:24:19.179 --> 00:24:21.090
messages so these are messages where the
phone might say hey wearable make a

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:21.100
phone might say hey wearable make a
 

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.630
phone might say hey wearable make a
noise or do something right now

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640
noise or do something right now
 

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.670
noise or do something right now
and the web will do it however if the

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:24.680
and the web will do it however if the
 

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.710
and the web will do it however if the
wearable is disconnected that message

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720
wearable is disconnected that message
 

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.900
wearable is disconnected that message
will be lost so you only use messages in

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:28.910
will be lost so you only use messages in
 

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.880
will be lost so you only use messages in
cases when something has to happen right

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:30.890
cases when something has to happen right
 

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.800
cases when something has to happen right
now but if the message is lost it's no

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:32.810
now but if the message is lost it's no
 

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:33.310
now but if the message is lost it's no
big deal

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320
big deal
 

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.260
big deal
so they're kind of like EDP packets when

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:35.270
so they're kind of like EDP packets when
 

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.890
so they're kind of like EDP packets when
you're doing tcp/ip and then we also

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:38.900
you're doing tcp/ip and then we also
 

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.680
you're doing tcp/ip and then we also
have the data API the data API allows

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:41.690
have the data API the data API allows
 

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.140
have the data API the data API allows
you to create and like a key value

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.150
you to create and like a key value
 

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.210
you to create and like a key value
object that has something like

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:46.220
object that has something like
 

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.270
object that has something like
temperature 56 current weather raining

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:49.280
temperature 56 current weather raining
 

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.850
temperature 56 current weather raining
you can put that in an object and then

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:51.860
you can put that in an object and then
 

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.350
you can put that in an object and then
you can send it to all the wearable

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360
you can send it to all the wearable
 

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.970
you can send it to all the wearable
devices on the network and it'll

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:54.980
devices on the network and it'll
 

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.740
devices on the network and it'll
automatically synchronize it for you and

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:56.750
automatically synchronize it for you and
 

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.910
automatically synchronize it for you and
you don't need to worry about

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:57.920
you don't need to worry about
 

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.190
you don't need to worry about
retransmitting if the wearable is not

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200
retransmitting if the wearable is not
 

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.990
retransmitting if the wearable is not
connected when you bring it back later

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000
connected when you bring it back later
 

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.730
connected when you bring it back later
on the messages will be so the data

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:03.740
on the messages will be so the data
 

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.650
on the messages will be so the data
items will be synchronized up it takes

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:05.660
items will be synchronized up it takes
 

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.480
items will be synchronized up it takes
care of all those things for you so it's

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:07.490
care of all those things for you so it's
 

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.160
care of all those things for you so it's
really nice and actually we have another

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:09.170
really nice and actually we have another
 

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.350
really nice and actually we have another
API called the channel API which allows

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360
API called the channel API which allows
 

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.450
API called the channel API which allows
you to make connections to a wearable

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:13.460
you to make connections to a wearable
 

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.370
you to make connections to a wearable
and send data over so you could stream

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:15.380
and send data over so you could stream
 

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.410
and send data over so you could stream
some audio or something like that so

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:17.420
some audio or something like that so
 

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.210
some audio or something like that so
there's a variety of different API so

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:19.220
there's a variety of different API so
 

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.980
there's a variety of different API so
that we provide two way to communicate

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:20.990
that we provide two way to communicate
 

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.510
that we provide two way to communicate
back and forth from a phone to a

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520
back and forth from a phone to a
 

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.850
back and forth from a phone to a
wearable so to quickly walk through it

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:24.860
wearable so to quickly walk through it
 

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.400
wearable so to quickly walk through it
this is the node API so you can see here

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:27.410
this is the node API so you can see here
 

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:28.630
this is the node API so you can see here
where there's a get connected nodes

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640
where there's a get connected nodes
 

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.970
where there's a get connected nodes
method you call that it returns you a

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:30.980
method you call that it returns you a
 

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.260
method you call that it returns you a
list of all the wearables that are

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:32.270
list of all the wearables that are
 

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.720
list of all the wearables that are
connected important tip here is that

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:34.730
connected important tip here is that
 

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.310
connected important tip here is that
it's possible for users to have many

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320
it's possible for users to have many
 

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.930
it's possible for users to have many
Android wear devices connected to a

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:37.940
Android wear devices connected to a
 

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.300
Android wear devices connected to a
phone so when you get an array back from

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:40.310
phone so when you get an array back from
 

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.310
phone so when you get an array back from
that top call you should not just read

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320
that top call you should not just read
 

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.050
that top call you should not just read
the first element you should read all of

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:44.060
the first element you should read all of
 

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.970
the first element you should read all of
them because some people like me have

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:45.980
them because some people like me have
 

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.530
them because some people like me have
eight Android wear devices at their desk

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:47.540
eight Android wear devices at their desk
 

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.300
eight Android wear devices at their desk
and I want all of them to work all the

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:49.310
and I want all of them to work all the
 

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.890
and I want all of them to work all the
time so make sure you code that up for

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:50.900
time so make sure you code that up for
 

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.660
time so make sure you code that up for
me otherwise my functionality won't work

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:52.670
me otherwise my functionality won't work
 

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.540
me otherwise my functionality won't work
so yeah people can have many Android

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:55.550
so yeah people can have many Android
 

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.520
so yeah people can have many Android
wear devices that's a very key sort of

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:57.530
wear devices that's a very key sort of
 

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.020
wear devices that's a very key sort of
mistake that some people make is they

00:25:59.020 --> 00:25:59.030
mistake that some people make is they
 

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.540
mistake that some people make is they
don't do that right and then you simply

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:01.550
don't do that right and then you simply
 

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.640
don't do that right and then you simply
declare a node listener and you get

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:03.650
declare a node listener and you get
 

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.130
declare a node listener and you get
these methods that are called when peers

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:06.140
these methods that are called when peers
 

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.320
these methods that are called when peers
are connected or disconnected for the

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:08.330
are connected or disconnected for the
 

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.330
are connected or disconnected for the
message API we have a method called send

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:10.340
message API we have a method called send
 

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.760
message API we have a method called send
message you simply pass in the ID of the

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:12.770
message you simply pass in the ID of the
 

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.800
message you simply pass in the ID of the
device you want to send a message to you

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:14.810
device you want to send a message to you
 

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.750
device you want to send a message to you
can pass in a string I'm sorry you pass

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760
can pass in a string I'm sorry you pass
 

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.460
can pass in a string I'm sorry you pass
in a byte array it sends it to the

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:18.470
in a byte array it sends it to the
 

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.310
in a byte array it sends it to the
device and then you can register a

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:21.320
device and then you can register a
 

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.650
device and then you can register a
method to be called on message received

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:23.660
method to be called on message received
 

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.860
method to be called on message received
if a message arrives at your device and

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:26.870
if a message arrives at your device and
 

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.350
if a message arrives at your device and
finally for the data API

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360
finally for the data API
 

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.150
finally for the data API
you've got put data items and get data

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:31.160
you've got put data items and get data
 

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.030
you've got put data items and get data
items those allow you to put data items

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:34.040
items those allow you to put data items
 

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.410
items those allow you to put data items
into the store their sync

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:35.420
into the store their sync
 

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.630
into the store their sync
back and forth and then you can retrieve

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:37.640
back and forth and then you can retrieve
 

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.580
back and forth and then you can retrieve
them back if messages are sent to you

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:39.590
them back if messages are sent to you
 

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:41.440
them back if messages are sent to you
and then there's on data changed which

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:41.450
and then there's on data changed which
 

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.050
and then there's on data changed which
is called whenever an item has arrived

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:44.060
is called whenever an item has arrived
 

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.880
is called whenever an item has arrived
off the network so it's a very simple

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:45.890
off the network so it's a very simple
 

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.750
off the network so it's a very simple
API and it helps deal with all the

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760
API and it helps deal with all the
 

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.190
API and it helps deal with all the
complexities of sending data back and

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200
complexities of sending data back and
 

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.920
complexities of sending data back and
forth between wearables and phones and

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:53.930
forth between wearables and phones and
 

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.880
forth between wearables and phones and
finally there is a base class called

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:57.890
finally there is a base class called
 

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.710
finally there is a base class called
wearable listener service that you

00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720
wearable listener service that you
 

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.840
wearable listener service that you
implement which is what you put all

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:01.850
implement which is what you put all
 

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.430
implement which is what you put all
those other methods into and you have to

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440
those other methods into and you have to
 

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.170
those other methods into and you have to
declare it in your Android map in your

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:05.180
declare it in your Android map in your
 

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.810
declare it in your Android map in your
Android manifest XML file and that tells

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:07.820
Android manifest XML file and that tells
 

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.910
Android manifest XML file and that tells
Google Play services that it is allowed

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:09.920
Google Play services that it is allowed
 

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.430
Google Play services that it is allowed
to send these messages and data items to

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440
to send these messages and data items to
 

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.410
to send these messages and data items to
your app to allow them to communicate

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:14.420
your app to allow them to communicate
 

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.110
your app to allow them to communicate
with the wearable so that's basically it

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120
with the wearable so that's basically it
 

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.910
with the wearable so that's basically it
for sending data back and forth so it's

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:18.920
for sending data back and forth so it's
 

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.740
for sending data back and forth so it's
a very powerful API and it's how

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:20.750
a very powerful API and it's how
 

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.120
a very powerful API and it's how
communications have done and as I said

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.130
communications have done and as I said
 

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.610
communications have done and as I said
before make sure the package names and

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:24.620
before make sure the package names and
 

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.590
before make sure the package names and
the version codes and all that match

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600
the version codes and all that match
 

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.270
the version codes and all that match
between the wearable and the phone

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:28.280
between the wearable and the phone
 

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.770
between the wearable and the phone
application otherwise they won't be able

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:29.780
application otherwise they won't be able
 

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.330
application otherwise they won't be able
to talk to each other and it's not

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:31.340
to talk to each other and it's not
 

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.340
to talk to each other and it's not
possible to send data items or messages

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:33.350
possible to send data items or messages
 

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.310
possible to send data items or messages
to a different app on the system that

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.320
to a different app on the system that
 

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.330
to a different app on the system that
doesn't match your package name you'll

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:37.340
doesn't match your package name you'll
 

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.200
doesn't match your package name you'll
have to come up with some other

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.210
have to come up with some other
 

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:41.830
have to come up with some other
mechanism to do that so we've talked

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840
mechanism to do that so we've talked
 

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.720
mechanism to do that so we've talked
about sending data now let's talk about

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:43.730
about sending data now let's talk about
 

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.640
about sending data now let's talk about
how to build custom user interfaces on

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:45.650
how to build custom user interfaces on
 

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:46.360
how to build custom user interfaces on
Android wear

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:46.370
Android wear
 

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.370
Android wear
because while Android wear is based on

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:48.380
because while Android wear is based on
 

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.440
because while Android wear is based on
Android if you actually look at the user

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:50.450
Android if you actually look at the user
 

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.450
Android if you actually look at the user
interface on the screen it doesn't look

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:52.460
interface on the screen it doesn't look
 

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.650
interface on the screen it doesn't look
a lot like Android it looks very

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:53.660
a lot like Android it looks very
 

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.880
a lot like Android it looks very
different the interface has been

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:54.890
different the interface has been
 

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.210
different the interface has been
designed to look great on wearables in

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:57.220
designed to look great on wearables in
 

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.500
designed to look great on wearables in
you know outdoor and you know

00:27:59.500 --> 00:27:59.510
you know outdoor and you know
 

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.990
you know outdoor and you know
environments when you're walking around

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000
environments when you're walking around
 

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.540
environments when you're walking around
so to do this we provide a library

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:04.550
so to do this we provide a library
 

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.400
so to do this we provide a library
called the wearable support library to

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:06.410
called the wearable support library to
 

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.200
called the wearable support library to
help out with this so in your Gradle

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:08.210
help out with this so in your Gradle
 

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.000
help out with this so in your Gradle
file it's called Chrome Google Android

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.010
file it's called Chrome Google Android
 

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.220
file it's called Chrome Google Android
dot support column wearable and this is

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:12.230
dot support column wearable and this is
 

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.510
dot support column wearable and this is
what we call the wearable support

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520
what we call the wearable support
 

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.020
what we call the wearable support
library so this wearable support library

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:16.030
library so this wearable support library
 

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.030
library so this wearable support library
provides functionality that's specific

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:19.040
provides functionality that's specific
 

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.460
provides functionality that's specific
to Android wear devices but that doesn't

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:21.470
to Android wear devices but that doesn't
 

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.110
to Android wear devices but that doesn't
belong in the android framework itself

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120
belong in the android framework itself
 

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.800
belong in the android framework itself
so when we designed Android wear we

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:26.810
so when we designed Android wear we
 

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.200
so when we designed Android wear we
wanted to have a common experience

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.210
wanted to have a common experience
 

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.450
wanted to have a common experience
across the platform so that apps look

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:31.460
across the platform so that apps look
 

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.430
across the platform so that apps look
the same so we wanted system apps and

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440
the same so we wanted system apps and
 

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.560
the same so we wanted system apps and
apps written by developers like you have

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:35.570
apps written by developers like you have
 

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.780
apps written by developers like you have
a consistent look and feel and so this

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:37.790
a consistent look and feel and so this
 

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.240
a consistent look and feel and so this
library contains reusable UI elements

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:40.250
library contains reusable UI elements
 

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.800
library contains reusable UI elements
that you can use in your code to make

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:41.810
that you can use in your code to make
 

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.210
that you can use in your code to make
your life easier so you don't have to

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:43.220
your life easier so you don't have to
 

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:43.870
your life easier so you don't have to
reinvent the wheel

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880
reinvent the wheel
 

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.120
reinvent the wheel
so we use this library for our apps as

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.130
so we use this library for our apps as
 

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.210
so we use this library for our apps as
well and so if you've actually got any

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:49.220
well and so if you've actually got any
 

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.529
well and so if you've actually got any
years for things that are like you know

00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:50.539
years for things that are like you know
 

00:28:50.539 --> 00:28:52.270
years for things that are like you know
I really wish I had a widget to do blah

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:52.280
I really wish I had a widget to do blah
 

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.039
I really wish I had a widget to do blah
you know please come and tell me or one

00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:54.049
you know please come and tell me or one
 

00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:55.210
you know please come and tell me or one
of the other developer advocates because

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:55.220
of the other developer advocates because
 

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.500
of the other developer advocates because
we'd like to hear more feedback about

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:56.510
we'd like to hear more feedback about
 

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:00.460
we'd like to hear more feedback about
the kind of things people want so what

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:00.470
the kind of things people want so what
 

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.720
the kind of things people want so what
is the wearable support library and how

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:01.730
is the wearable support library and how
 

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.700
is the wearable support library and how
does it work it's different than the

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:03.710
does it work it's different than the
 

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.980
does it work it's different than the
Android support library so you might be

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:05.990
Android support library so you might be
 

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.909
Android support library so you might be
familiar with the Android support

00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919
familiar with the Android support
 

00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:09.909
familiar with the Android support
library that is used to sort of backport

00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919
library that is used to sort of backport
 

00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:13.090
library that is used to sort of backport
new Android features to old releases the

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:13.100
new Android features to old releases the
 

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.409
new Android features to old releases the
wearable support library is different

00:29:14.409 --> 00:29:14.419
wearable support library is different
 

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.880
wearable support library is different
it's designed as a general support

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:15.890
it's designed as a general support
 

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.409
it's designed as a general support
library that these are things that might

00:29:17.409 --> 00:29:17.419
library that these are things that might
 

00:29:17.419 --> 00:29:19.149
library that these are things that might
never make it into the framework but

00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159
never make it into the framework but
 

00:29:19.159 --> 00:29:20.710
never make it into the framework but
they're useful for designing wearable

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720
they're useful for designing wearable
 

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.590
they're useful for designing wearable
apps the next thing is that it's

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600
apps the next thing is that it's
 

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.720
apps the next thing is that it's
compiled statically into your app so if

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:25.730
compiled statically into your app so if
 

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:26.980
compiled statically into your app so if
you do use the wearable support library

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:26.990
you do use the wearable support library
 

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.710
you do use the wearable support library
the code is going to be in your apk it's

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.720
the code is going to be in your apk it's
 

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.899
the code is going to be in your apk it's
not part of the system itself so your

00:29:31.899 --> 00:29:31.909
not part of the system itself so your
 

00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:33.700
not part of the system itself so your
apk is going to get a little larger when

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:33.710
apk is going to get a little larger when
 

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.710
apk is going to get a little larger when
you use it now you can strip out the

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720
you use it now you can strip out the
 

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.090
you use it now you can strip out the
parts you don't need with resource

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:37.100
parts you don't need with resource
 

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.220
parts you don't need with resource
minification and ProGuard but just be

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:39.230
minification and ProGuard but just be
 

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.360
minification and ProGuard but just be
aware that that has to be done so it it

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:43.370
aware that that has to be done so it it
 

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.100
aware that that has to be done so it it
doesn't have a huge impact on you okay

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:45.110
doesn't have a huge impact on you okay
 

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.720
doesn't have a huge impact on you okay
the actual library itself is quite small

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:46.730
the actual library itself is quite small
 

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.060
the actual library itself is quite small
so it won't cause too much blood in your

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:49.070
so it won't cause too much blood in your
 

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.649
so it won't cause too much blood in your
apk but it's something to be aware of if

00:29:50.649 --> 00:29:50.659
apk but it's something to be aware of if
 

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:52.299
apk but it's something to be aware of if
you're working with it it's also

00:29:52.299 --> 00:29:52.309
you're working with it it's also
 

00:29:52.309 --> 00:29:55.090
you're working with it it's also
released at different cycles that are

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:55.100
released at different cycles that are
 

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.560
released at different cycles that are
independent of the android framework so

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:56.570
independent of the android framework so
 

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:57.700
independent of the android framework so
the android framework is like

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:57.710
the android framework is like
 

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.649
the android framework is like
marshmallow lollipop KitKat things like

00:29:59.649 --> 00:29:59.659
marshmallow lollipop KitKat things like
 

00:29:59.659 --> 00:30:01.570
marshmallow lollipop KitKat things like
that the wearable support library is

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:01.580
that the wearable support library is
 

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.010
that the wearable support library is
independent of that it typically is

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:03.020
independent of that it typically is
 

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.020
independent of that it typically is
released whenever a new Android wear

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:05.030
released whenever a new Android wear
 

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.840
released whenever a new Android wear
release comes out so it's not changes to

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:07.850
release comes out so it's not changes to
 

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.090
release comes out so it's not changes to
the frame changes to the wearable

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:10.100
the frame changes to the wearable
 

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.100
the frame changes to the wearable
support library are not dependent on you

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.110
support library are not dependent on you
 

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.740
support library are not dependent on you
API is coming out so that's nice so we

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:14.750
API is coming out so that's nice so we
 

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.630
API is coming out so that's nice so we
can add new features and we can fix bugs

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640
can add new features and we can fix bugs
 

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.649
can add new features and we can fix bugs
very quickly and this library though

00:30:20.649 --> 00:30:20.659
very quickly and this library though
 

00:30:20.659 --> 00:30:22.120
very quickly and this library though
because it is a new library that

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:22.130
because it is a new library that
 

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.279
because it is a new library that
statically linked in the API actually

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:24.289
statically linked in the API actually
 

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:25.630
statically linked in the API actually
could change a little bit between

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640
could change a little bit between
 

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.340
could change a little bit between
versions so there's a possibility that

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:27.350
versions so there's a possibility that
 

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.260
versions so there's a possibility that
if you bump to a different version you

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:29.270
if you bump to a different version you
 

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.399
if you bump to a different version you
might have to tweak your code a little

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:30.409
might have to tweak your code a little
 

00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:31.659
might have to tweak your code a little
bit but you can always use the old

00:30:31.659 --> 00:30:31.669
bit but you can always use the old
 

00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:33.820
bit but you can always use the old
version if that's what you want so you

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:33.830
version if that's what you want so you
 

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.960
version if that's what you want so you
need to be aware of the fact that the

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:34.970
need to be aware of the fact that the
 

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.490
need to be aware of the fact that the
API could change and it might break

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:36.500
API could change and it might break
 

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.020
API could change and it might break
backwards compatibility so it's not like

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.030
backwards compatibility so it's not like
 

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.190
backwards compatibility so it's not like
the android framework in that we

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200
the android framework in that we
 

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.360

important that you understand the
 

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.920
important that you understand the
implications of plus versus a version

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:17.930
implications of plus versus a version
 

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.990
implications of plus versus a version
number and this is a common thing you

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000
number and this is a common thing you
 

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.700
number and this is a common thing you
need to understand when you're writing

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:21.710
need to understand when you're writing
 

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.000
need to understand when you're writing
any kind of Android app and finally the

always-on mode we have a special library
 

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.680
always-on mode we have a special library
that helps out you'll need to include

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:32.690
that helps out you'll need to include
 

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.180
that helps out you'll need to include
that line I won't go into too much

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:34.190
that line I won't go into too much
 

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:35.800
that line I won't go into too much
detail on that but that's also important

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:35.810
detail on that but that's also important
 

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:40.780
detail on that but that's also important
as well so when we introduced Android

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:40.790
as well so when we introduced Android
 

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.540
as well so when we introduced Android
wear one of the big differences was that

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:43.550
wear one of the big differences was that
 

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.960
wear one of the big differences was that
it had a round screen so up until then

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:46.970
it had a round screen so up until then
 

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.550
it had a round screen so up until then
every computer and everything we've ever

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:48.560
every computer and everything we've ever
 

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.140
every computer and everything we've ever
had has been square or rectangular

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:50.150
had has been square or rectangular
 

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.510
had has been square or rectangular
displays so the introduction of a round

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:52.520
displays so the introduction of a round
 

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.090
displays so the introduction of a round
display is really beautiful as you can

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:55.100
display is really beautiful as you can
 

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.980
display is really beautiful as you can
see from these watches here but it

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:56.990
see from these watches here but it
 

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.600
see from these watches here but it
imposes challenges for developers

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:58.610
imposes challenges for developers
 

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.160
imposes challenges for developers
because people haven't thought about

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.170
because people haven't thought about
 

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.590
because people haven't thought about
round screens before so widgets were

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.600
round screens before so widgets were
 

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.060
round screens before so widgets were
using like textview and things like that

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.070
using like textview and things like that
 

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.160
using like textview and things like that
they don't understand round screens so

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:06.170
they don't understand round screens so
 

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.470
they don't understand round screens so
we need to help developers understand

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480
we need to help developers understand
 

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.150
we need to help developers understand
how to do with round screens and then

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:10.160
how to do with round screens and then
 

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.680
how to do with round screens and then
what we can do about it so if you look

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:11.690
what we can do about it so if you look
 

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.870
what we can do about it so if you look
on the left you've got the moto 360 that

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880
on the left you've got the moto 360 that
 

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.019
on the left you've got the moto 360 that
actually has an insert at the bottom or

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:16.029
actually has an insert at the bottom or
 

00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:17.940
actually has an insert at the bottom or
people call a chin or a flat tire which

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:17.950
people call a chin or a flat tire which
 

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.099
people call a chin or a flat tire which
is 30 pixels in size you've then got the

00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:20.109
is 30 pixels in size you've then got the
 

00:33:20.109 --> 00:33:21.930
is 30 pixels in size you've then got the
next watch which is a square screen even

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:21.940
next watch which is a square screen even
 

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.759
next watch which is a square screen even
though it looks rounded the next one is

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:23.769
though it looks rounded the next one is
 

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:25.379
though it looks rounded the next one is
a round screen with no inset and then

00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:25.389
a round screen with no inset and then
 

00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:27.359
a round screen with no inset and then
finally the last one is a rectangular

00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:27.369
finally the last one is a rectangular
 

00:33:27.369 --> 00:33:30.690
finally the last one is a rectangular
screen as well so we need to write

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:30.700
screen as well so we need to write
 

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.190
screen as well so we need to write
software that works on all of these

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200
software that works on all of these
 

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.219
software that works on all of these
screens so if we were to create a

00:33:35.219 --> 00:33:35.229
screens so if we were to create a
 

00:33:35.229 --> 00:33:37.109
screens so if we were to create a
textview and put a large amount of text

00:33:37.109 --> 00:33:37.119
textview and put a large amount of text
 

00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:39.029
textview and put a large amount of text
on the screen what would happen on the

00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039
on the screen what would happen on the
 

00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:40.680
on the screen what would happen on the
far right you can see we've got a

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:40.690
far right you can see we've got a
 

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.349
far right you can see we've got a
regular rectangular screen the text fits

00:33:43.349 --> 00:33:43.359
regular rectangular screen the text fits
 

00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:45.839
regular rectangular screen the text fits
nicely however on the round screen you

00:33:45.839 --> 00:33:45.849
nicely however on the round screen you
 

00:33:45.849 --> 00:33:47.879
nicely however on the round screen you
can see the top bottom right left

00:33:47.879 --> 00:33:47.889
can see the top bottom right left
 

00:33:47.889 --> 00:33:50.009
can see the top bottom right left
everything is all chopped off so you

00:33:50.009 --> 00:33:50.019
everything is all chopped off so you
 

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:53.459
everything is all chopped off so you
can't read all of the text so it would

00:33:53.459 --> 00:33:53.469
can't read all of the text so it would
 

00:33:53.469 --> 00:33:55.259
can't read all of the text so it would
be a really bad idea to throw a pile of

00:33:55.259 --> 00:33:55.269
be a really bad idea to throw a pile of
 

00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:57.209
be a really bad idea to throw a pile of
text on the screen and not do anything

00:33:57.209 --> 00:33:57.219
text on the screen and not do anything
 

00:33:57.219 --> 00:33:58.589
text on the screen and not do anything
about it because all of your round

00:33:58.589 --> 00:33:58.599
about it because all of your round
 

00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:00.299
about it because all of your round
customers are gonna have a bad time and

00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:00.309
customers are gonna have a bad time and
 

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:02.070
customers are gonna have a bad time and
there are a lot of Android wear round

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080
there are a lot of Android wear round
 

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.109
there are a lot of Android wear round
devices out there so if you only design

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:04.119
devices out there so if you only design

like people are not gonna like your app
so what can we do about this so wearable

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:10.899
so what can we do about this so wearable
 

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:12.450
so what can we do about this so wearable
support library provides three different

stub we're going to go through each of

00:34:18.029 --> 00:34:18.039
stub we're going to go through each of
 

00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:21.089
stub we're going to go through each of
them to show how to use it so the first

00:34:21.089 --> 00:34:21.099
them to show how to use it so the first

one boxing set layout what it does is it

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:24.250
one boxing set layout what it does is it
 

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.769
one boxing set layout what it does is it
adds padding around the edges of your

00:34:25.769 --> 00:34:25.779
adds padding around the edges of your
 

00:34:25.779 --> 00:34:28.589
adds padding around the edges of your
text view to prevent the text from

00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599
text view to prevent the text from
 

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:31.200
text view to prevent the text from
touching the edges of the screen so you

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:31.210
touching the edges of the screen so you
 

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.359
touching the edges of the screen so you
can see on the left the box inset layout

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:33.369
can see on the left the box inset layout
 

00:34:33.369 --> 00:34:36.450
can see on the left the box inset layout
has added padding all around it so that

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:36.460
has added padding all around it so that
 

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.909
has added padding all around it so that
the text never touches the round edge of

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919
the text never touches the round edge of
 

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:41.669
the text never touches the round edge of
the display so we can read the text it

00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679
the display so we can read the text it
 

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:45.480
the display so we can read the text it
looks nice and that's quite cool so how

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:45.490
looks nice and that's quite cool so how
 

00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:46.889
looks nice and that's quite cool so how
do we go about implementing this and

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:46.899
do we go about implementing this and
 

00:34:46.899 --> 00:34:48.659
do we go about implementing this and
finally actually before we do that if

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:48.669
finally actually before we do that if
 

00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:50.399
finally actually before we do that if
you look on the square screen it's

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:50.409
you look on the square screen it's
 

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:52.440
you look on the square screen it's
exactly the same as before so we're

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:52.450
exactly the same as before so we're
 

00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:54.029
exactly the same as before so we're
using all of the space on the square

00:34:54.029 --> 00:34:54.039
using all of the space on the square
 

00:34:54.039 --> 00:34:55.680
using all of the space on the square
screen but on the round screen we're

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:55.690
screen but on the round screen we're
 

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.569
screen but on the round screen we're
making it fit so how do we go about

00:34:57.569 --> 00:34:57.579
making it fit so how do we go about
 

00:34:57.579 --> 00:34:59.640
making it fit so how do we go about
doing this what we do is in our layout

00:34:59.640 --> 00:34:59.650
doing this what we do is in our layout
 

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:08.960
doing this what we do is in our layout
XML file we have at the very top

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:08.970
 

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:11.850
and there it is anyway if you look at

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:11.860
and there it is anyway if you look at
 

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.810
and there it is anyway if you look at
the top there is box inset layout can

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:15.820
the top there is box inset layout can
 

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:26.010
the top there is box inset layout can
people see that buco sir no matter if

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:26.020
people see that buco sir no matter if
 

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.600
people see that buco sir no matter if
you look at the top there we've got at

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:27.610
you look at the top there we've got at
 

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:29.160
you look at the top there we've got at
the top level of layout hierarchy we

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:29.170
the top level of layout hierarchy we
 

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.100
the top level of layout hierarchy we
have a box inset layout the box inset

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:32.110
have a box inset layout the box inset
 

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.380
have a box inset layout the box inset
layout contains the text view and then

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:34.390
layout contains the text view and then
 

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.540
layout contains the text view and then
inside the text view we've defined an

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:36.550
inside the text view we've defined an
 

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.400
inside the text view we've defined an
attribute app layout underscore box

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:38.410
attribute app layout underscore box
 

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.220
attribute app layout underscore box
equals all now what that says is we're

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:41.230
equals all now what that says is we're
 

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.140
equals all now what that says is we're
living inside a box and settle out and I

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:43.150
living inside a box and settle out and I
 

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.870
living inside a box and settle out and I
want to be boxed on all four sides to do

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880
want to be boxed on all four sides to do
 

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.890
want to be boxed on all four sides to do
the implementation and if you actually

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:49.900
the implementation and if you actually
 

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.740
the implementation and if you actually
forget to put that in it won't be boxed

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:52.750
forget to put that in it won't be boxed
 

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.150
forget to put that in it won't be boxed
so it's very important that you actually

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160
so it's very important that you actually
 

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.340
so it's very important that you actually
remember to put it inside a box and set

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:56.350
remember to put it inside a box and set
 

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.680
remember to put it inside a box and set
layout and also to set the attribute app

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:58.690
layout and also to set the attribute app
 

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:01.560
layout and also to set the attribute app
layout box equals all now you can also

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:01.570
layout box equals all now you can also
 

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.810
layout box equals all now you can also
you don't have to box around everything

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:03.820
you don't have to box around everything
 

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.250
you don't have to box around everything
you can actually box just the left and

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:05.260
you can actually box just the left and
 

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.440
you can actually box just the left and
right so for example here you can see

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:07.450
right so for example here you can see
 

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.240
right so for example here you can see
the text is boxed only on left and right

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.250
the text is boxed only on left and right
 

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.000
the text is boxed only on left and right
and it's allowed to flow completely to

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.010
and it's allowed to flow completely to
 

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:13.470
and it's allowed to flow completely to
the top and bottom parts of the screen

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.480
the top and bottom parts of the screen
 

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.930
the top and bottom parts of the screen
and the implementation for this is we

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:15.940
and the implementation for this is we
 

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.610
and the implementation for this is we
simply replace the word all with left

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:17.620
simply replace the word all with left
 

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.090
simply replace the word all with left
and right and you can also do top and

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:21.100
and right and you can also do top and
 

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.340
and right and you can also do top and
bottom as well same here you can see the

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:23.350
bottom as well same here you can see the
 

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.770
bottom as well same here you can see the
effect on the round screen typically you

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:25.780
effect on the round screen typically you
 

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.990
effect on the round screen typically you
don't want to always do a complete all

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000
don't want to always do a complete all
 

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.940
don't want to always do a complete all
boxing what you might want to do is have

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:29.950
boxing what you might want to do is have
 

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.470
boxing what you might want to do is have
it box just on the left in the right and

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480
it box just on the left in the right and
 

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.390
it box just on the left in the right and
then have it scrollable because the

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400
then have it scrollable because the
 

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.640
then have it scrollable because the
middle part of the screen is still quite

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:35.650
middle part of the screen is still quite
 

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:37.590
middle part of the screen is still quite
usable but you don't want to box it all

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:37.600
usable but you don't want to box it all
 

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.090
usable but you don't want to box it all
completely otherwise you waste a lot of

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:39.100
completely otherwise you waste a lot of
 

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.700
completely otherwise you waste a lot of
screen real estate so you don't want to

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:40.710
screen real estate so you don't want to
 

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.780
screen real estate so you don't want to
squeeze it too much otherwise you won't

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:42.790
squeeze it too much otherwise you won't
 

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.060
squeeze it too much otherwise you won't
better read much text at all and so

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:45.070
better read much text at all and so
 

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.210
better read much text at all and so
here's how we do the top and bottom now

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:48.220
here's how we do the top and bottom now
 

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.780
here's how we do the top and bottom now
finally one thing you'll notice here is

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:51.790
finally one thing you'll notice here is
 

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.640
finally one thing you'll notice here is
that when you put a text view inside a

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:53.650
that when you put a text view inside a
 

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.620
that when you put a text view inside a
box and set layout the green background

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:55.630
box and set layout the green background
 

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.530
box and set layout the green background
extends all the way to the edges now you

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:58.540
extends all the way to the edges now you
 

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:00.630
extends all the way to the edges now you
might want it so the way the way it

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640
might want it so the way the way it
 

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.210
might want it so the way the way it
works is that the margins of the text

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:03.220
works is that the margins of the text
 

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.980
works is that the margins of the text
view are adjusted but not the entire

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:04.990
view are adjusted but not the entire
 

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.930
view are adjusted but not the entire
view itself so if you actually want to

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:06.940
view itself so if you actually want to
 

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.450
view itself so if you actually want to
force the view to fit completely and

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:09.460
force the view to fit completely and
 

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.220
force the view to fit completely and
have a black background or whatever the

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:11.230
have a black background or whatever the
 

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:13.260
have a black background or whatever the
default is you can actually put the

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:13.270
default is you can actually put the
 

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.000
default is you can actually put the
whole lot inside of a frame layout

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.010
whole lot inside of a frame layout
 

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.070
whole lot inside of a frame layout
container and then put the framework

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:17.080
container and then put the framework
 

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.480
container and then put the framework
container inside the box inset layout

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:18.490
container inside the box inset layout
 

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:21.750
container inside the box inset layout
and so that's one of the things you can

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760
and so that's one of the things you can
 

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.590
and so that's one of the things you can
do with it if you

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:22.600
do with it if you
 

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.480
do with it if you
the black water instead you might wanna

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.490
the black water instead you might wanna
 

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.800
the black water instead you might wanna
have other things appearing in those

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:25.810
have other things appearing in those
 

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.540
have other things appearing in those
corners and this will allow you to do

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:27.550
corners and this will allow you to do
 

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:31.710
corners and this will allow you to do
that so while boxing set layout is easy

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720
that so while boxing set layout is easy
 

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.330
that so while boxing set layout is easy
to use you simply just add it to your

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:33.340
to use you simply just add it to your
 

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.310
to use you simply just add it to your
layout hierarchy and it boxes everything

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:35.320
layout hierarchy and it boxes everything
 

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.260
layout hierarchy and it boxes everything
for you pretty much automatically it's

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:37.270
for you pretty much automatically it's
 

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:38.820
for you pretty much automatically it's
not very efficient as we pointed out

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:38.830
not very efficient as we pointed out
 

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.470
not very efficient as we pointed out
earlier so there must be better ways of

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480
earlier so there must be better ways of
 

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.620
earlier so there must be better ways of
dealing with this so in one of the

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:43.630
dealing with this so in one of the
 

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.940
dealing with this so in one of the
recent wearable support libraries we

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:44.950
recent wearable support libraries we
 

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:46.200
recent wearable support libraries we
added something called wearable frame

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.210
added something called wearable frame
 

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.270
added something called wearable frame
layout and what this does is it allows

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280
layout and what this does is it allows
 

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.760
layout and what this does is it allows
you to specify padding and attributes

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:50.770
you to specify padding and attributes
 

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.500
you to specify padding and attributes
for things like centering or alignment

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:52.510
for things like centering or alignment
 

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.720
for things like centering or alignment
but you can specify different attributes

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:54.730
but you can specify different attributes
 

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.340
but you can specify different attributes
depending on if it's a round or a square

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:56.350
depending on if it's a round or a square
 

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:59.280
depending on if it's a round or a square
device so you can see here I've got on

00:37:59.280 --> 00:37:59.290
device so you can see here I've got on
 

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.950
device so you can see here I've got on
the round display I've got the green box

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960
the round display I've got the green box
 

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.710
the round display I've got the green box
is centered I wanted 25 DP margins and

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720
is centered I wanted 25 DP margins and
 

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.690
is centered I wanted 25 DP margins and
then on square I want it to be left

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:06.700
then on square I want it to be left
 

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.520
then on square I want it to be left
aligned with 5 DP margins and you can

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:08.530
aligned with 5 DP margins and you can
 

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.920
aligned with 5 DP margins and you can
see that they look very different on the

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:10.930
see that they look very different on the
 

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.650
see that they look very different on the
two on the round versus square but the

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:13.660
two on the round versus square but the
 

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.690
two on the round versus square but the
implementation is quite easy so if you

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:15.700
implementation is quite easy so if you
 

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.700
implementation is quite easy so if you
look here in the wearable frame layout

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:17.710
look here in the wearable frame layout
 

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.740
look here in the wearable frame layout
you can see we have loud underscore

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:19.750
you can see we have loud underscore
 

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.830
you can see we have loud underscore
gravity round is centered but layout

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:22.840
gravity round is centered but layout
 

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.480
gravity round is centered but layout
underscore gravity the default version

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:24.490
underscore gravity the default version
 

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.790
underscore gravity the default version
is going to be the left align whatever

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800
is going to be the left align whatever
 

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.680
is going to be the left align whatever
the default is and you can see every

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:28.690
the default is and you can see every
 

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.720
the default is and you can see every
time we've thrown around keyword into

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:30.730
time we've thrown around keyword into
 

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.060
time we've thrown around keyword into
the attribute wearable frame layout

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:33.070
the attribute wearable frame layout
 

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.580
the attribute wearable frame layout
looks at round or not round to work out

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:35.590
looks at round or not round to work out
 

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.510
looks at round or not round to work out
what it's going to do for your

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520
what it's going to do for your
 

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.580
what it's going to do for your
particular device so everything we just

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:38.590
particular device so everything we just
 

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.780
particular device so everything we just
showed in that previous example is

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:39.790
showed in that previous example is
 

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:42.860
showed in that previous example is
encoded here so the nice thing is that

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:42.870
encoded here so the nice thing is that
 

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.870
encoded here so the nice thing is that
you can have one single XML file that

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880
you can have one single XML file that
 

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.600
you can have one single XML file that
does layouts for round and square you

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:48.610
does layouts for round and square you
 

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.700
does layouts for round and square you
can maintain them together and it helps

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:50.710
can maintain them together and it helps
 

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:53.190
can maintain them together and it helps
sort of to simplify the process of one

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200
sort of to simplify the process of one
 

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.350
sort of to simplify the process of one
problem that people commonly do is they

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:55.360
problem that people commonly do is they
 

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.090
problem that people commonly do is they
define around in a square out and they

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:57.100
define around in a square out and they
 

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.560
define around in a square out and they
change the scale out and they forget to

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:58.570
change the scale out and they forget to
 

00:38:58.570 --> 00:38:59.910
change the scale out and they forget to
update the round layout and they've got

00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920
update the round layout and they've got
 

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.550
update the round layout and they've got
bugs and on round so it's this helps you

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560
bugs and on round so it's this helps you
 

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.970
bugs and on round so it's this helps you
to avoid that problem so finally we have

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:05.980
to avoid that problem so finally we have
 

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.650
to avoid that problem so finally we have
what's called watch view stub which is a

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:07.660
what's called watch view stub which is a
 

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.870
what's called watch view stub which is a
class that allows you to inflate to

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880
class that allows you to inflate to
 

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.180
class that allows you to inflate to
separate layouts that depend on with the

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:12.190
separate layouts that depend on with the
 

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.460
separate layouts that depend on with the
on round and square so you can see in

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:14.470
on round and square so you can see in
 

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:15.780
on round and square so you can see in
this case here the layouts are

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:15.790
this case here the layouts are
 

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:16.980
this case here the layouts are
completely different one of them has a

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:16.990
completely different one of them has a
 

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:18.480
completely different one of them has a
gradient the other one has a circle

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:18.490
gradient the other one has a circle
 

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.130
gradient the other one has a circle
they're totally nothing to do with each

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:20.140
they're totally nothing to do with each
 

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.430
they're totally nothing to do with each
other

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440
other
 

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.290
other
and the watch viewstub inflates the

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:22.300
and the watch viewstub inflates the
 

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.760
and the watch viewstub inflates the
correct layout depending on which one

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:23.770
correct layout depending on which one
 

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.100
correct layout depending on which one
you want so if you look here the

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:26.110
you want so if you look here the
 

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:28.320
you want so if you look here the
implementation is what you stub to

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:28.330
implementation is what you stub to
 

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.300
implementation is what you stub to
layout definitions and those layouts are

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.310
layout definitions and those layouts are
 

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.220
layout definitions and those layouts are
defined in separate files so the nice

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:32.230
defined in separate files so the nice
 

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.720
defined in separate files so the nice
thing here is that you get full control

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:33.730
thing here is that you get full control
 

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.850
thing here is that you get full control
over everything there's no need to worry

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:35.860
over everything there's no need to worry
 

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.420
over everything there's no need to worry
about

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:36.430
about
 

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.360
about
to express both layouts in one file but

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:38.370
to express both layouts in one file but
 

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.940
to express both layouts in one file but
the con of it all is that you have to

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:41.950
the con of it all is that you have to
 

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.620
the con of it all is that you have to
have two files and you must remember to

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:43.630
have two files and you must remember to
 

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.810
have two files and you must remember to
update both of them and test on both

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:45.820
update both of them and test on both
 

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.520
update both of them and test on both
round and square whenever you make it

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:47.530
round and square whenever you make it
 

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:48.960
round and square whenever you make it
change because if you get that wrong

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:48.970
change because if you get that wrong
 

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.110
change because if you get that wrong
then you'll have a problem so those are

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:52.120
then you'll have a problem so those are
 

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.520
then you'll have a problem so those are
sort of the pros and cons of the three

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:53.530
sort of the pros and cons of the three
 

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.350
sort of the pros and cons of the three
different ways you can use depending on

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:55.360
different ways you can use depending on
 

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.060
different ways you can use depending on
what your app looks like and which one

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:57.070
what your app looks like and which one
 

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.840
what your app looks like and which one
you choose will very much depend on the

00:39:59.840 --> 00:39:59.850
you choose will very much depend on the
 

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:04.530
you choose will very much depend on the
app that you're writing so that's a

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:04.540
app that you're writing so that's a
 

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.970
app that you're writing so that's a
quick little rundown of what's available

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:05.980
quick little rundown of what's available
 

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.010
quick little rundown of what's available
to support round versus square so what

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:08.020
to support round versus square so what
 

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.000
to support round versus square so what
else is in the wearable support library

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:09.010
else is in the wearable support library
 

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.010
else is in the wearable support library
so here's a list of all of the different

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:11.020
so here's a list of all of the different
 

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.270
so here's a list of all of the different
classes that are available in there as

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280
classes that are available in there as
 

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.950
classes that are available in there as
of now and I'm quickly a walk through

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960
of now and I'm quickly a walk through
 

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.240
of now and I'm quickly a walk through
them to show you a few things that are

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:15.250
them to show you a few things that are
 

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.410
them to show you a few things that are
available in case you weren't aware of

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:16.420
available in case you weren't aware of
 

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.780
available in case you weren't aware of
it so the first thing we have is that a

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:18.790
it so the first thing we have is that a
 

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.460
it so the first thing we have is that a
lot of Android wear apps have the

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:20.470
lot of Android wear apps have the
 

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.950
lot of Android wear apps have the

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.590
shows that it's about to do it so the
nice thing about this is if the user

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:34.600
nice thing about this is if the user
 

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.390
nice thing about this is if the user
does nothing the message is sent but if

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400
does nothing the message is sent but if
 

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.800
does nothing the message is sent but if
the user realizes the message is

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:37.810
the user realizes the message is
 

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.900
the user realizes the message is
incorrect they can cancel it so it's

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:39.910
incorrect they can cancel it so it's
 

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:41.880
incorrect they can cancel it so it's
actually a nice way of saying instead of

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:41.890
actually a nice way of saying instead of
 

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:43.080
actually a nice way of saying instead of
saying are you sure you want to send

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:43.090
saying are you sure you want to send
 

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:45.150
saying are you sure you want to send
this it's I'm gonna send this unless you

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160
this it's I'm gonna send this unless you
 

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.860
this it's I'm gonna send this unless you
tell me not to so just delayed

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:46.870
tell me not to so just delayed
 

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.200
tell me not to so just delayed
confirmation view helps with our making

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:49.210
confirmation view helps with our making
 

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:53.070
confirmation view helps with our making
that easier so it uses the so called

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:53.080
that easier so it uses the so called
 

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.630
that easier so it uses the so called
image view for the implementation of the

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640
image view for the implementation of the
 

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.240
image view for the implementation of the
circle and that provides the set

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:57.250
circle and that provides the set
 

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.040
circle and that provides the set

00:46:42.729 --> 00:46:44.219
launched easily the user can use their
finger to launch your app but they can

00:46:44.219 --> 00:46:44.229
finger to launch your app but they can
 

00:46:44.229 --> 00:46:46.739
finger to launch your app but they can
also speak it as well and then finally

00:46:46.739 --> 00:46:46.749
also speak it as well and then finally
 

00:46:46.749 --> 00:46:48.749
also speak it as well and then finally
we have the speech recognizer that we

00:46:48.749 --> 00:46:48.759
we have the speech recognizer that we
 

00:46:48.759 --> 00:46:51.630
we have the speech recognizer that we
showed earlier and that was the remote

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:51.640
showed earlier and that was the remote
 

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.749
showed earlier and that was the remote
input intent you can use that as well so

00:46:54.749 --> 00:46:54.759
input intent you can use that as well so
 

00:46:54.759 --> 00:46:55.859
input intent you can use that as well so
those are sort of the main ways you

00:46:55.859 --> 00:46:55.869
those are sort of the main ways you
 

00:46:55.869 --> 00:46:57.209
those are sort of the main ways you
interact with an Android wear device

00:46:57.209 --> 00:46:57.219
interact with an Android wear device
 

00:46:57.219 --> 00:46:58.859
interact with an Android wear device
it's not just about touching on the

00:46:58.859 --> 00:46:58.869
it's not just about touching on the
 

00:46:58.869 --> 00:47:01.579
it's not just about touching on the
screen it's about speech recognition and

00:47:01.579 --> 00:47:01.589
screen it's about speech recognition and
 

00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:04.319
screen it's about speech recognition and
not thinking about your apps in terms of

00:47:04.319 --> 00:47:04.329
not thinking about your apps in terms of
 

00:47:04.329 --> 00:47:06.089
not thinking about your apps in terms of
apps for thinking about them in terms of

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:06.099
apps for thinking about them in terms of
 

00:47:06.099 --> 00:47:08.279
apps for thinking about them in terms of
tasks that they solve users want to take

00:47:08.279 --> 00:47:08.289
tasks that they solve users want to take
 

00:47:08.289 --> 00:47:10.049
tasks that they solve users want to take
notes they don't want to launch a

00:47:10.049 --> 00:47:10.059
notes they don't want to launch a
 

00:47:10.059 --> 00:47:11.969
notes they don't want to launch a
note-taking app and there's a difference

00:47:11.969 --> 00:47:11.979
note-taking app and there's a difference
 

00:47:11.979 --> 00:47:14.279
note-taking app and there's a difference
in how you understand that these are

00:47:14.279 --> 00:47:14.289
in how you understand that these are
 

00:47:14.289 --> 00:47:16.199
in how you understand that these are
actually a list of the actions that are

00:47:16.199 --> 00:47:16.209
actually a list of the actions that are
 

00:47:16.209 --> 00:47:17.429
actually a list of the actions that are
currently in Android West because

00:47:17.429 --> 00:47:17.439
currently in Android West because
 

00:47:17.439 --> 00:47:18.359
currently in Android West because
there's a whole bunch of different

00:47:18.359 --> 00:47:18.369
there's a whole bunch of different
 

00:47:18.369 --> 00:47:20.039
there's a whole bunch of different
things that you can do here and those

00:47:20.039 --> 00:47:20.049
things that you can do here and those
 

00:47:20.049 --> 00:47:23.069
things that you can do here and those
can change over time so there you have

00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:23.079
can change over time so there you have
 

00:47:23.079 --> 00:47:25.849
can change over time so there you have
it so this is a summary of the ways that

00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859
it so this is a summary of the ways that
 

00:47:25.859 --> 00:47:28.319
it so this is a summary of the ways that
the different things you can use to go

00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:28.329
the different things you can use to go
 

00:47:28.329 --> 00:47:30.269
the different things you can use to go
about creating Android wear apps and the

00:47:30.269 --> 00:47:30.279
about creating Android wear apps and the
 

00:47:30.279 --> 00:47:32.130
about creating Android wear apps and the
different things you can do so we

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:32.140
different things you can do so we
 

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.719
different things you can do so we
actually have a code lab that's starting

00:47:33.719 --> 00:47:33.729
actually have a code lab that's starting
 

00:47:33.729 --> 00:47:36.299
actually have a code lab that's starting
at 12:45 I believe where the code lab is

00:47:36.299 --> 00:47:36.309
at 12:45 I believe where the code lab is
 

00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:37.620
at 12:45 I believe where the code lab is
all about creating your own watch face

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:37.630
all about creating your own watch face
 

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.390
all about creating your own watch face
for Android wear so you can show up we

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400
for Android wear so you can show up we
 

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.160
for Android wear so you can show up we
have a starting sample you can drag your

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:41.170
have a starting sample you can drag your
 

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:42.779
have a starting sample you can drag your
own image in and you can create a watch

00:47:42.779 --> 00:47:42.789
own image in and you can create a watch
 

00:47:42.789 --> 00:47:44.309
own image in and you can create a watch
face for the custom picture of your dog

00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319
face for the custom picture of your dog
 

00:47:44.319 --> 00:47:46.319
face for the custom picture of your dog
or a cat or whatever and it's a really

00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:46.329
or a cat or whatever and it's a really
 

00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:47.579
or a cat or whatever and it's a really
cool way of just sort of seeing how

00:47:47.579 --> 00:47:47.589
cool way of just sort of seeing how
 

00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:48.900
cool way of just sort of seeing how
quickly you can get start with Android

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:48.910
quickly you can get start with Android
 

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.489
quickly you can get start with Android
wear on an emulator and if you don't

00:47:50.489 --> 00:47:50.499
wear on an emulator and if you don't
 

00:47:50.499 --> 00:47:51.569
wear on an emulator and if you don't
have one you definitely need to go out

00:47:51.569 --> 00:47:51.579
have one you definitely need to go out
 

00:47:51.579 --> 00:47:53.789
have one you definitely need to go out
and get one they're really cool devices

00:47:53.789 --> 00:47:53.799
and get one they're really cool devices
 

00:47:53.799 --> 00:47:56.249
and get one they're really cool devices
and lots of apps on the Play Store now

00:47:56.249 --> 00:47:56.259
and lots of apps on the Play Store now
 

00:47:56.259 --> 00:47:57.870
and lots of apps on the Play Store now
support them and there's a lot of

00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880
support them and there's a lot of
 

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.999
support them and there's a lot of
functionality that is sort of

00:47:59.999 --> 00:48:00.009
functionality that is sort of
 

00:48:00.009 --> 00:48:01.949
functionality that is sort of
interesting for developers and it's a

00:48:01.949 --> 00:48:01.959
interesting for developers and it's a
 

00:48:01.959 --> 00:48:03.509
interesting for developers and it's a
great way of differentiating your app

00:48:03.509 --> 00:48:03.519
great way of differentiating your app
 

00:48:03.519 --> 00:48:05.160
great way of differentiating your app
because there's a lot of apps out there

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:05.170
because there's a lot of apps out there
 

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:06.870
because there's a lot of apps out there
but if you have a really great answer or

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880
but if you have a really great answer or
 

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.729
but if you have a really great answer or
implementation that might be the thing

00:48:08.729 --> 00:48:08.739
implementation that might be the thing
 

00:48:08.739 --> 00:48:10.109
implementation that might be the thing
that makes your out popular amongst

00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:10.119
that makes your out popular amongst
 

00:48:10.119 --> 00:48:11.759
that makes your out popular amongst
people and helps you to get a bit of a

00:48:11.759 --> 00:48:11.769
people and helps you to get a bit of a
 

00:48:11.769 --> 00:48:14.729
people and helps you to get a bit of a
foothold with more customers so if you

where we sort of talk about more of the

00:48:25.559 --> 00:48:25.569
where we sort of talk about more of the
 

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:27.000
where we sort of talk about more of the
design methodology and how to

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.010
design methodology and how to
 

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.460
design methodology and how to
really beautiful apps you know Google

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:29.470
really beautiful apps you know Google
 

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.110
really beautiful apps you know Google
really cares about design right now and

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:31.120
really cares about design right now and
 

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.630
really cares about design right now and
so it's really important that you make

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640
so it's really important that you make
 

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.160
so it's really important that you make
nice apps that look really good don't

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:35.170
nice apps that look really good don't
 

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:37.800
nice apps that look really good don't
just take old apps and sort of squeeze

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:37.810
just take old apps and sort of squeeze
 

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.450
just take old apps and sort of squeeze
them onto the wearable display you

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:39.460
them onto the wearable display you
 

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.190
them onto the wearable display you
really think about the user and do a

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200
really think about the user and do a
 

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.830
really think about the user and do a
really nice job about it so I post a

things that I do and I said I talked
 

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.160
things that I do and I said I talked
about Android wear a lot but we also

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:02.170
about Android wear a lot but we also
 

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.380
about Android wear a lot but we also
talked about Android auto and ubiquitous

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:04.390
talked about Android auto and ubiquitous
 

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:06.570
talked about Android auto and ubiquitous
computing and also I will put my

thank you so I have question is when
 

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:38.670
thank you so I have question is when
when we do Action Button on day where

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680
when we do Action Button on day where
 

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.220
when we do Action Button on day where
yep like we swive and then you push

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:41.230
yep like we swive and then you push
 

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:44.670
yep like we swive and then you push
button on a grid view with a send the

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680
button on a grid view with a send the
 

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.970
button on a grid view with a send the
data the signal to the wearable alone or

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:47.980
data the signal to the wearable alone or
 

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.780
data the signal to the wearable alone or
or it will send the data will to the

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:51.790
or it will send the data will to the
 

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:54.360
or it will send the data will to the
mobile or it will be able to do both and

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:54.370
mobile or it will be able to do both and
 

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:56.640
mobile or it will be able to do both and
how so the question was is that when you

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:56.650
how so the question was is that when you
 

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.950
how so the question was is that when you
press like an action label or a button

00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960
press like an action label or a button
 

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.420
press like an action label or a button
or something like that will the press

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:02.430
or something like that will the press
 

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:05.010
or something like that will the press
which is will the press get sent to the

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:05.020
which is will the press get sent to the
 

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.900
which is will the press get sent to the
phone as well as the wearable and the

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:06.910
phone as well as the wearable and the
 

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.510
phone as well as the wearable and the
answer is no so if the wearable created

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520
answer is no so if the wearable created
 

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.620
answer is no so if the wearable created
these buttons and widgets the the call

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:13.630
these buttons and widgets the the call
 

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.090
these buttons and widgets the the call
backs are whatever only sent to the

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:15.100
backs are whatever only sent to the
 

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.040
backs are whatever only sent to the
wearable itself if you want the wearable

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:17.050
wearable itself if you want the wearable
 

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:18.600
wearable itself if you want the wearable
to send something to the phone you need

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:18.610
to send something to the phone you need
 

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:20.250
to send something to the phone you need
to send a message or a data item or

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:20.260
to send a message or a data item or
 

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.500
to send a message or a data item or
something like that now in the case of

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:22.510
something like that now in the case of
 

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:24.210
something like that now in the case of
notifications if you create a

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:24.220
notifications if you create a
 

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.430
notifications if you create a
notification on the phone the

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:26.440
notification on the phone the
 

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.050
notification on the phone the
notification appears on the wearable if

00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:28.060
notification appears on the wearable if
 

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.390
notification appears on the wearable if
you click one of the actions that will

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400
you click one of the actions that will
 

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.820
you click one of the actions that will
get sent back to the phone so that's

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:32.830
get sent back to the phone so that's
 

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:34.170
get sent back to the phone so that's
only done in the case of a notification

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:34.180
only done in the case of a notification
 

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.510
only done in the case of a notification
and it's only done in the case of if the

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520
and it's only done in the case of if the
 

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.370
and it's only done in the case of if the
notification is created on the phone

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:38.380
notification is created on the phone
 

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.440
notification is created on the phone
it's actually possible to create No

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:40.450
it's actually possible to create No
 

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:42.870
it's actually possible to create No
vacations on the wearable those are not

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880
vacations on the wearable those are not
 

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.980
vacations on the wearable those are not
sent back to the phone so yeah typically

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:45.990
sent back to the phone so yeah typically
 

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:48.440
sent back to the phone so yeah typically
the wearable never sends anything back

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:48.450
the wearable never sends anything back
 

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.790
the wearable never sends anything back
except for a notification credit on the

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800
except for a notification credit on the
 

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.490
except for a notification credit on the
phone and each their anyway we make it

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:53.500
phone and each their anyway we make it
 

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.190
phone and each their anyway we make it
to send back or it's just like you have

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200
to send back or it's just like you have
 

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.930
to send back or it's just like you have
to write that mechanism yourself so if

00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:57.940
to write that mechanism yourself so if
 

00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.339
to write that mechanism yourself so if
you want to send something back you do a

00:50:59.339 --> 00:50:59.349
you want to send something back you do a
 

00:50:59.349 --> 00:51:01.319
you want to send something back you do a
data item or a message or a channel and

00:51:01.319 --> 00:51:01.329
data item or a message or a channel and
 

00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:02.690
data item or a message or a channel and
then you can send it back that way

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700
then you can send it back that way
 

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:07.260
then you can send it back that way
next question one question when we use

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:07.270
next question one question when we use
 

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:10.560
next question one question when we use
the message API or the data API for

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:10.570
the message API or the data API for
 

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:14.160
the message API or the data API for
devices that support Wi-Fi they connect

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:14.170
devices that support Wi-Fi they connect
 

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.650
devices that support Wi-Fi they connect
through the cloud right is there any way

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:16.660
through the cloud right is there any way
 

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.680
through the cloud right is there any way
to prevent that behavior like if we only

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:19.690
to prevent that behavior like if we only
 

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:23.550
to prevent that behavior like if we only
want to send messages or data items only

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:23.560
want to send messages or data items only
 

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.700
want to send messages or data items only
if they are connected through bluetooth

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:25.710
if they are connected through bluetooth
 

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:29.880
if they are connected through bluetooth
to avoid sending data to the cloud like

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:29.890
to avoid sending data to the cloud like
 

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:31.740
to avoid sending data to the cloud like
I mean for a big company it's important

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:31.750
I mean for a big company it's important
 

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.290
I mean for a big company it's important
to have your data like secure right and

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:34.300
to have your data like secure right and
 

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.980
to have your data like secure right and
we don't want to send data to so I mean

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:37.990
we don't want to send data to so I mean
 

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.950
we don't want to send data to so I mean
there's a in the node API there is a

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960
there's a in the node API there is a
 

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.560
there's a in the node API there is a
cope there's something you can there's a

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:43.570
cope there's something you can there's a
 

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:44.880
cope there's something you can there's a
method I come over the name of it but it

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:44.890
method I come over the name of it but it
 

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:46.770
method I come over the name of it but it
basically is is local or something it's

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:46.780
basically is is local or something it's
 

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.690
basically is is local or something it's
like given so you can ask for a list of

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:48.700
like given so you can ask for a list of
 

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:51.180
like given so you can ask for a list of
devices and then you can for each device

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:51.190
devices and then you can for each device
 

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:53.370
devices and then you can for each device
you can say is it local or not and that

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:53.380
you can say is it local or not and that
 

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.200
you can say is it local or not and that
then would tell you if it's connected

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:55.210
then would tell you if it's connected
 

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:57.240
then would tell you if it's connected
via a local pairing or if it's still

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:57.250
via a local pairing or if it's still
 

00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:58.920
via a local pairing or if it's still
available but it's connected via the

00:51:58.920 --> 00:51:58.930
available but it's connected via the
 

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:00.930
available but it's connected via the
cloud somehow so that could be a way

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:00.940
cloud somehow so that could be a way
 

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.430
cloud somehow so that could be a way
that you could avoid sending it through

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440
that you could avoid sending it through
 

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:06.569
that you could avoid sending it through
the cloud like that but I mean I guess

00:52:06.569 --> 00:52:06.579
the cloud like that but I mean I guess
 

00:52:06.579 --> 00:52:08.220
the cloud like that but I mean I guess
there's a possibility that it could

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:08.230
there's a possibility that it could
 

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.349
there's a possibility that it could
switch from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi mode and

00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359
switch from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi mode and
 

00:52:10.359 --> 00:52:12.240
switch from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi mode and
you could send the message just as

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:12.250
you could send the message just as
 

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:14.490
you could send the message just as
making the transition so there's no way

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:14.500
making the transition so there's no way
 

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.230
making the transition so there's no way
to mark a message as do not ever send

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240
to mark a message as do not ever send
 

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.870
to mark a message as do not ever send
this to the cloud the same time though

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880
this to the cloud the same time though
 

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.550
this to the cloud the same time though
messages in the cloud are not stored

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:20.560
messages in the cloud are not stored
 

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.920
messages in the cloud are not stored
they're just sent virus somewhere about

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:22.930
they're just sent virus somewhere about
 

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:25.380
they're just sent virus somewhere about
the date API because they'd be I

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:25.390
the date API because they'd be I
 

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:28.109
the date API because they'd be I
normally you push thing into the network

00:52:28.109 --> 00:52:28.119
normally you push thing into the network
 

00:52:28.119 --> 00:52:30.390
normally you push thing into the network
yeah yeah and then it gets sync across

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400
yeah yeah and then it gets sync across
 

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.700
yeah yeah and then it gets sync across
all the clients yeah but because the

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:32.710
all the clients yeah but because the
 

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:35.700
all the clients yeah but because the
cloud node is part of that network there

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:35.710
cloud node is part of that network there
 

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:38.250
cloud node is part of that network there
is no way to prevent that data to

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:38.260
is no way to prevent that data to
 

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:40.559
is no way to prevent that data to
actually go to the cloud but you see the

00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:40.569
actually go to the cloud but you see the
 

00:52:40.569 --> 00:52:43.079
actually go to the cloud but you see the
one that syncing behavior but only if

00:52:43.079 --> 00:52:43.089
one that syncing behavior but only if
 

00:52:43.089 --> 00:52:44.970
one that syncing behavior but only if
they are connected yeah the case of data

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:44.980
they are connected yeah the case of data
 

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.040
they are connected yeah the case of data
items the thing is when you credit out

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:47.050
items the thing is when you credit out
 

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:48.599
items the thing is when you credit out
items synchronized all devices

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:48.609
items synchronized all devices
 

00:52:48.609 --> 00:52:49.950
items synchronized all devices
automatically I don't think there's a

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960
automatically I don't think there's a
 

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.210
automatically I don't think there's a
way to prevent that from happening so

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:51.220
way to prevent that from happening so
 

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.559
way to prevent that from happening so
yeah

00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:52.569
yeah
 

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:54.059
yeah
if it was really important to you I

00:52:54.059 --> 00:52:54.069
if it was really important to you I
 

00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:57.689
if it was really important to you I
guess you could encrypt it I know you'd

00:52:57.689 --> 00:52:57.699
guess you could encrypt it I know you'd
 

00:52:57.699 --> 00:52:58.829
guess you could encrypt it I know you'd
have to do something about that yourself

00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839
have to do something about that yourself
 

00:52:58.839 --> 00:53:01.019
have to do something about that yourself
there's no nothing to support that yeah

00:53:01.019 --> 00:53:01.029
there's no nothing to support that yeah
 

00:53:01.029 --> 00:53:02.249
there's no nothing to support that yeah
any other questions yeah

00:53:02.249 --> 00:53:02.259
any other questions yeah
 

00:53:02.259 --> 00:53:09.089
any other questions yeah
Jonah grab the mic yeah so I had an LG

00:53:09.089 --> 00:53:09.099
Jonah grab the mic yeah so I had an LG
 

00:53:09.099 --> 00:53:11.999
Jonah grab the mic yeah so I had an LG
urbane watch so that has a website so I

00:53:11.999 --> 00:53:12.009
urbane watch so that has a website so I
 

00:53:12.009 --> 00:53:14.069
urbane watch so that has a website so I
have an LG urbane wash so that has like

00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079
have an LG urbane wash so that has like
 

00:53:14.079 --> 00:53:16.829
have an LG urbane wash so that has like
a standalone why find that watch so

00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839
a standalone why find that watch so
 

00:53:16.839 --> 00:53:18.989
a standalone why find that watch so
whenever I make a network request when

00:53:18.989 --> 00:53:18.999
whenever I make a network request when
 

00:53:18.999 --> 00:53:20.549
whenever I make a network request when
it's not connected to my phone where

00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559
it's not connected to my phone where
 

00:53:20.559 --> 00:53:23.309
it's not connected to my phone where
Bluetooth it works fine but when it is

00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:23.319
Bluetooth it works fine but when it is
 

00:53:23.319 --> 00:53:25.380
Bluetooth it works fine but when it is
connected to my phone via bluetooth so

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:25.390
connected to my phone via bluetooth so
 

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:28.109
connected to my phone via bluetooth so
Wi-Fi is automatic disabled so basically

00:53:28.109 --> 00:53:28.119
Wi-Fi is automatic disabled so basically
 

00:53:28.119 --> 00:53:29.729
Wi-Fi is automatic disabled so basically
I cannot make a network call if it's

00:53:29.729 --> 00:53:29.739
I cannot make a network call if it's
 

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:31.469
I cannot make a network call if it's
connected to bluetooth while Wi-Fi in

00:53:31.469 --> 00:53:31.479
connected to bluetooth while Wi-Fi in
 

00:53:31.479 --> 00:53:32.669
connected to bluetooth while Wi-Fi in
the world mean you cannot make a call

00:53:32.669 --> 00:53:32.679
the world mean you cannot make a call
 

00:53:32.679 --> 00:53:35.039
the world mean you cannot make a call
well like network call the network whole

00:53:35.039 --> 00:53:35.049
well like network call the network whole
 

00:53:35.049 --> 00:53:36.329
well like network call the network whole
like why are Wi-Fi

00:53:36.329 --> 00:53:36.339
like why are Wi-Fi
 

00:53:36.339 --> 00:53:38.880
like why are Wi-Fi
oh yeah okay so the thing is why find

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:38.890
oh yeah okay so the thing is why find
 

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:41.459
oh yeah okay so the thing is why find
like that or like what for you yeah so

00:53:41.459 --> 00:53:41.469
like that or like what for you yeah so
 

00:53:41.469 --> 00:53:43.439
like that or like what for you yeah so
the Wi-Fi feature is it uses more power

00:53:43.439 --> 00:53:43.449
the Wi-Fi feature is it uses more power
 

00:53:43.449 --> 00:53:46.229
the Wi-Fi feature is it uses more power
than Bluetooth so we want to keep Wi-Fi

00:53:46.229 --> 00:53:46.239
than Bluetooth so we want to keep Wi-Fi
 

00:53:46.239 --> 00:53:48.299
than Bluetooth so we want to keep Wi-Fi
off when possible so if everything is

00:53:48.299 --> 00:53:48.309
off when possible so if everything is
 

00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:49.679
off when possible so if everything is
working over Bluetooth we will send

00:53:49.679 --> 00:53:49.689
working over Bluetooth we will send
 

00:53:49.689 --> 00:53:51.689
working over Bluetooth we will send
things over Bluetooth now I think what

00:53:51.689 --> 00:53:51.699
things over Bluetooth now I think what
 

00:53:51.699 --> 00:53:52.890
things over Bluetooth now I think what
you're asking is is you've got an app

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:52.900
you're asking is is you've got an app
 

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:53.729
you're asking is is you've got an app
that's running on your watch that's

00:53:53.729 --> 00:53:53.739
that's running on your watch that's
 

00:53:53.739 --> 00:53:55.979
that's running on your watch that's
trying to make HTTP requests

00:53:55.979 --> 00:53:55.989
trying to make HTTP requests
 

00:53:55.989 --> 00:53:58.979
trying to make HTTP requests
yeah so you're not supposed to do that

00:53:58.979 --> 00:53:58.989
yeah so you're not supposed to do that
 

00:53:58.989 --> 00:54:02.729
yeah so you're not supposed to do that
so if you're if you're if you want to do

00:54:02.729 --> 00:54:02.739
so if you're if you're if you want to do
 

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:04.799
so if you're if you're if you want to do
Network requests from the watch mm-hmm

00:54:04.799 --> 00:54:04.809
Network requests from the watch mm-hmm
 

00:54:04.809 --> 00:54:06.630
Network requests from the watch mm-hmm
you're relying on behavior that's not

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640
you're relying on behavior that's not
 

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.149
you're relying on behavior that's not
really supposed to be used so what are

00:54:09.149 --> 00:54:09.159
really supposed to be used so what are
 

00:54:09.159 --> 00:54:10.140
really supposed to be used so what are
you kind of what are you trying to

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:10.150
you kind of what are you trying to
 

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:12.149
you kind of what are you trying to
request I was trying to demo from

00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:12.159
request I was trying to demo from
 

00:54:12.159 --> 00:54:13.919
request I was trying to demo from
feature actually I mean I was just

00:54:13.919 --> 00:54:13.929
feature actually I mean I was just
 

00:54:13.929 --> 00:54:16.679
feature actually I mean I was just
trying to verify yeah it kind of works

00:54:16.679 --> 00:54:16.689
trying to verify yeah it kind of works
 

00:54:16.689 --> 00:54:18.209
trying to verify yeah it kind of works
the problem is you can't keep the Wi-Fi

00:54:18.209 --> 00:54:18.219
the problem is you can't keep the Wi-Fi
 

00:54:18.219 --> 00:54:19.739
the problem is you can't keep the Wi-Fi
feature on you don't get to control that

00:54:19.739 --> 00:54:19.749
feature on you don't get to control that
 

00:54:19.749 --> 00:54:21.419
feature on you don't get to control that
so if Bluetooth is available it'll

00:54:21.419 --> 00:54:21.429
so if Bluetooth is available it'll
 

00:54:21.429 --> 00:54:23.279
so if Bluetooth is available it'll
switch to bluetooth okay so the correct

00:54:23.279 --> 00:54:23.289
switch to bluetooth okay so the correct
 

00:54:23.289 --> 00:54:24.479
switch to bluetooth okay so the correct
way to deal with what you're trying to

00:54:24.479 --> 00:54:24.489
way to deal with what you're trying to
 

00:54:24.489 --> 00:54:26.309
way to deal with what you're trying to
do is if you really wanted to make an

00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319
do is if you really wanted to make an
 

00:54:26.319 --> 00:54:28.199
do is if you really wanted to make an
arbitrary HTTP request so if you want to

00:54:28.199 --> 00:54:28.209
arbitrary HTTP request so if you want to
 

00:54:28.209 --> 00:54:29.789
arbitrary HTTP request so if you want to
check the weather mm-hmm you send a

00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799
check the weather mm-hmm you send a
 

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:32.009
check the weather mm-hmm you send a
message to the phone the phone gets the

00:54:32.009 --> 00:54:32.019
message to the phone the phone gets the
 

00:54:32.019 --> 00:54:33.719
message to the phone the phone gets the
weather okay and then you parse all the

00:54:33.719 --> 00:54:33.729
weather okay and then you parse all the
 

00:54:33.729 --> 00:54:35.579
weather okay and then you parse all the
HTML you extract out the temperature

00:54:35.579 --> 00:54:35.589
HTML you extract out the temperature
 

00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:38.339
HTML you extract out the temperature
information so all the network operation

00:54:38.339 --> 00:54:38.349
information so all the network operation
 

00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:40.109
information so all the network operation
should be done within the phone app yeah

00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119
should be done within the phone app yeah
 

00:54:40.119 --> 00:54:41.579
should be done within the phone app yeah
and the data should be passed to either

00:54:41.579 --> 00:54:41.589
and the data should be passed to either
 

00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:44.370
and the data should be passed to either
the data API or message yeah another

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:44.380
the data API or message yeah another
 

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.079
the data API or message yeah another
work now if you really wanted to get

00:54:46.079 --> 00:54:46.089
work now if you really wanted to get
 

00:54:46.089 --> 00:54:49.859
work now if you really wanted to get
dirty so that the dirty solution is you

00:54:49.859 --> 00:54:49.869
dirty so that the dirty solution is you
 

00:54:49.869 --> 00:54:51.929
dirty so that the dirty solution is you
send a data item to the phone that says

00:54:51.929 --> 00:54:51.939
send a data item to the phone that says
 

00:54:51.939 --> 00:54:54.779
send a data item to the phone that says
HTTP colon slash slash weather.com blah

00:54:54.779 --> 00:54:54.789
HTTP colon slash slash weather.com blah
 

00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:56.969
HTTP colon slash slash weather.com blah
blah blah and then the reply is the

00:54:56.969 --> 00:54:56.979
blah blah and then the reply is the
 

00:54:56.979 --> 00:54:59.339
blah blah and then the reply is the
entire HTTP response as a string and

00:54:59.339 --> 00:54:59.349
entire HTTP response as a string and
 

00:54:59.349 --> 00:55:01.409
entire HTTP response as a string and
then the wearable could do all of it so

00:55:01.409 --> 00:55:01.419
then the wearable could do all of it so
 

00:55:01.419 --> 00:55:03.479
then the wearable could do all of it so
you could write yourself a really cheap

00:55:03.479 --> 00:55:03.489
you could write yourself a really cheap
 

00:55:03.489 --> 00:55:05.160
you could write yourself a really cheap
e little proxy over data

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:05.170
e little proxy over data
 

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:06.930
e little proxy over data
items that go back and forth we could

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:06.940
items that go back and forth we could
 

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.579
items that go back and forth we could
use the channel API but you're really

00:55:08.579 --> 00:55:08.589
use the channel API but you're really
 

00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:09.839
use the channel API but you're really
not supposed to be doing that it's gonna

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:09.849
not supposed to be doing that it's gonna
 

00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:11.640
not supposed to be doing that it's gonna
you're gonna be doing it wrong and

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:11.650
you're gonna be doing it wrong and
 

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:12.960
you're gonna be doing it wrong and
you're gonna be wasting a lot of power

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:12.970
you're gonna be wasting a lot of power
 

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:16.440
you're gonna be wasting a lot of power
right that's the solution if you really

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:16.450
right that's the solution if you really
 

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:18.569
right that's the solution if you really
wanted to be lazy about it but the best

00:55:18.569 --> 00:55:18.579
wanted to be lazy about it but the best
 

00:55:18.579 --> 00:55:20.400
wanted to be lazy about it but the best
solution is get the phone to do the work

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:20.410
solution is get the phone to do the work
 

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.829
solution is get the phone to do the work
mm-hmm and strip the data down into its

00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:22.839
mm-hmm and strip the data down into its
 

00:55:22.839 --> 00:55:24.299
mm-hmm and strip the data down into its
simplest form and then send it back to

00:55:24.299 --> 00:55:24.309
simplest form and then send it back to
 

00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:27.660
simplest form and then send it back to
the wearable okay okay I think around a

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:27.670
the wearable okay okay I think around a
 

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:30.059
the wearable okay okay I think around a
time so we do have a code lab remember

00:55:30.059 --> 00:55:30.069
time so we do have a code lab remember
 

00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:31.740
time so we do have a code lab remember
at 12:45 and actually my colleague

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:31.750
at 12:45 and actually my colleague
 

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:34.289
at 12:45 and actually my colleague
Michael Quan he is giving a talk at 12 I

00:55:34.289 --> 00:55:34.299
Michael Quan he is giving a talk at 12 I
 

00:55:34.299 --> 00:55:36.390
Michael Quan he is giving a talk at 12 I
think now he's giving a talk he's

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400
think now he's giving a talk he's
 

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.920
think now he's giving a talk he's
actually one of the engineers on Android

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:37.930
actually one of the engineers on Android
 

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:39.720
actually one of the engineers on Android
wear who did a lot of work on power

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:39.730
wear who did a lot of work on power
 

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:41.400
wear who did a lot of work on power
optimization and looking for bugs and

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:41.410
optimization and looking for bugs and
 

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:42.930
optimization and looking for bugs and
he's a fantastic engineer so you

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:42.940
he's a fantastic engineer so you
