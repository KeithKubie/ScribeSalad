00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.160
In the last couple of videos,
we've gone over the idea that

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.230
the Federal Reserve manages the
money supply by setting a

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.660
target interest rate.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.950
And there might have been the
obvious question circling in

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.900
your brain-- why don't they just
manage the money supply

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.620
by instead of setting a target
interest rate, why don't they

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.340
set a target money supply?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:27.070
They could say we have a target
M0 of-- I don't know--

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.540
$900 billion and they just-- if
it's at $800 billion now,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.030
they just print that much-- $100
billion dollars more of

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.250
base money or Federal Reserve
deposits or Federal Reserve

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.455
notes and then the M0 will get
to $900 billion and then

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:41.760
you'll have the multiplier
effect and more lending will

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.370
take place and then you
will increase the M1.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.920
So similarly, they could
have a target M1.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.960
They could say we want the M1,
which is the M0 plus checking

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.070
deposit accounts-- so
essentially, anything that can

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.160
be used for money.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.310
So actual cash, reserve
deposits, or checking accounts

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.320
can be used for money because
you can write

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.370
checks against them.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.890
So they can say, we want that
target to be-- I don't know--

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.930
$2 trillion.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.210
They can say, we're
targeting the M2.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.240
M2 is the M1 plus savings
accounts and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.050
money market accounts.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.060
So they could say,
we're targeting

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.010
that to be $8 trillion.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.770
And just so you know,
I actually

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.860
looked up these numbers.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.570
As of at least '05, '06, these
numbers weren't that far off.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.980
The M0 was more like $800
billion, but just

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.600
so you get an idea.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.050
These, are real numbers.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.410
The obvious question is,
why don't they do that?

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.890
Why don't they just grow
the money supply?

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.180
Maybe one thing they could do,
they could say, our goal is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.070
for M2 to always be--
50% of GDP, right?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.920
They could say, let's make
it always 50% of GDP.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.020
So as the economy grows, we just
have to make sure that if

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.360
it falls below 50% of GDP, that
we just have to print a

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.360
little bit more money, then
it'll have a multiplier effect

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.300
and we'll just keep
measuring it.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.540
If it goes a little bit above,
we'll do some open market

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.780
operations and sell our
treasuries and take reserves

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.310
out of the banking system.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.150
So that's a completely
legitimate way of thinking

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.350
about it-- and actually, there
are some people who do

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.360
advocate it this way.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.040
And there is no clear answer to
why they're doing this, but

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.210
I've thought about a little bit
and there's two reasons

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.550
that I can think of why this
might make more sense--

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.120
although there's a part of me--
and maybe in a future

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.320
video, I'll make an argument
for why actually doing

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.970
something like managing the
money supply to 50% of GDP

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.530
might actually make a little
bit more sense.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.760
But anyway.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.090
The first reason is kind of one
out of convenience-- that

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.920
the short term interest rate
with which banks lend to each

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.170
other is just easier to measure
than any of these

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.350
money supply things.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.500
If I'm Ben Bernanke and I want
to know what banks are lending

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.780
to each other at, I could just
sample the market at that

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.480
moment in time.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.120
I could say, I'm a bank.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.320
What are you willing
to lend to me at?

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.630
They'll say, 5.2%.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.080
They're like, oh, that's a
little bit above our target.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.550
We have to buy more
treasuries.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.720
So you can get a very real
time notion of where the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.880
market is minute by minute.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.090
You don't have to wait for some
surveys to get completed

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.150
or anything like that.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.350
While if you were targeting
actual money supply you would

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.040
have to tabulate these fairly
quickly if you wanted real

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.450
time information and that would
just be more of a mess.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.500
To actually calculate the M2,
you'd have to survey the banks

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.880
and maybe you could do it with
some IT systems, but you're

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.060
not going to get that real time
information-- or at least

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.650
it would be harder to.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.220
The other reason-- and this is
a little bit more abstract,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.220
but I think it'll make
sense to you.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.520
Let's say it's the
planting season.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.290
I've never been a farmer, but I
think the planting season is

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.570
sometime in the spring.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.320
And let's say there's a couple
of farm projects where farmers

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.110
need to borrow money
to buy seeds.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.270
One of them returns a-- the
farmer will proceed if he can

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.960
get lending at 20% or lower
interest rates.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.430
So if someone's willing to lend
him money at 21% interest

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.000
rate, he'll be like, no,
that's way too much.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
But if he can get money at
19%, he's like, OK, I'll

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.030
borrow the money and I'll buy
the seeds because it will

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.420
create so much value that I'll
easily be able to pay back

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.450
that interest.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.670
Say there's another farmer
with an 18% project.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.170
So if he gets 18% or lower
interest rates, he'll proceed

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.610
with his project.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.380
Let's say there's another farmer
with a-- let's say it's

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.270
a 12%-- project.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.880
If he gets funding at 11%, he'll
move forward and he'll

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.740
buy the seeds and he'll
plant them.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.650
Let's say there's a
couple of other

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.980
projects in this universe.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.370
Let's say there's
a factory guy.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.710
He's got a really good idea, a
new technology he wants to

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.000
invest in and he's going to
move forward building the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.050
factory if he can get-- I don't
know-- 19% funding.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.260
And let's say there's another
factory guy who

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.360
would get 3% funding.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.730
So he's not too confident
about his project.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.680
He thinks this project only
makes sense to move forward if

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.650
he can get 3% or
better funding.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.290
So when I say better,
less than 3%.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.630
My phone is ringing,
but I'll ignore it

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.470
because I'm on a roll.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.170
And there's another guy who's
really marginal, really shady.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.650
He's got a really
shady project.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.790
He himself is not too
confident in it.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.140
He will only proceed with this
project if he essentially gets

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.300
money for free.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.585
So this is the state of affairs
in in the spring or

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:21.140
during the planting season.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.740
So all of these would be
potential consumers of money.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.280
And let's say that this
is the money supply.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.590
Let's say the money supply is
fixed at that moment in time.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.550
So let's say-- I'll draw the
money supply circles so

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.390
there's three circles
of money, right?

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.420
So essentially the money is
going to be lent to the people

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.590
willing to pay the highest
interest rate.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.590
So in this case-- for the sake
of simplicity, we're assuming

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.320
all these are kind of the same
amount of money, just not to

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.910
make things too complicated.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.260
So in a capitalist system,
the three best projects

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.560
would get the money.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.490
And so it'll be this one, this
one, and this one, right?

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.380
These three guys will
get the money.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.520
And essentially they're going
to pay the highest interest

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.790
rate that the worst among
them is willing to pay.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.330
So this money is going to go
to these three guys at

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:24.080
essentially 17.9%, right?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.780
I'm making a lot of simplifying
assumptions, but I

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.710
really just want you to get
the underlying idea.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.170
And these projects, these three
products are not going

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.380
to get done.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.830
And you might say, well, it's
good that society didn't

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.650
allocate money to this guy and
this guy because these were

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.350
shady projects to begin with,
but it's kind of unfortunate.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.460
This was a 12% yield project
that if somehow the capital

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.350
was there, we would've gotten a
12% return on society, which

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.600
is-- in the big picture of
things, a really good project,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.510
but there just wasn't
enough capital at

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.290
that moment in time.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.250
There wasn't enough money at
that moment in time to support

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.260
this project.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.270
Fair enough.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.170
But let's say the money supply
stays constant-- or at least

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.150
in the medium term over the
course of a year because

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.000
that's what the Fed
is targeting.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.500
So as we get away from the
planting season, these

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.750
projects disappear.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.550
They're no longer there because
the planting season

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.650
isn't there anymore.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.500
And let's say this guy got done,
but let's say there's

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.480
another project just
like it that's 19%.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.796
And all of a sudden, since the
planting season's done, none

00:07:23.796 --> 00:07:26.370
of the farmers want money
anymore, but if you're keeping

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.760
the money supply constant,
now which projects are

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.170
going to get done?

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.580
Well, this good project here is
going to get done, but so

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.870
are these two kind of
crappy projects.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.630
And they're going to be lent
at a much lower rate.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.400
The average rate that it gets
lent to is going to be 1% or

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.380
2% or something really low.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.790
So you have a situation here
where the money supply did

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.050
not-- it wasn't elastic with
the demand and the negative

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.380
side effect to society in this
situation is, when people

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.040
needed money, we were passing
on good projects that really

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.330
should have been done
because these

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.970
were really safe projects.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.910
And then later, when the timing
is bad and we keep the

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.230
money supply constant, bad
projects will get funded

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.590
because there's just so much
money to go around and none of

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.980
these people need to use it
that these really crappy

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.460
projects that might even be
negative-- remember, these are

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.190
what the investor thinks they're
going to get, but

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.440
maybe there's a lot of risk
and these end up-- if the

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.910
investor thinks they're going to
get a 1% return, maybe they

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:19.580
made a mistake.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.880
Maybe they'll get a -5% return,
in which case we're

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.610
going to be destroying wealth.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.610
So this is the problem where
over a medium period of time,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.600
if you hold the money supply
constant, you'll be passing up

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.200
on good projects when there's
a lot of demand for them.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.250
And then you'll be investing in
bad projects when there's

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.960
not much demand for projects.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.710
On the other hand, if you
had-- let's do the same

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.670
scenario over again.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.100
I think I made that a little
messy Let's say you have a

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.570
couple farmers again.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.530
Let me draw a line here.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:59.120
So you have that 20%, 18%, 12%,
and then you have the

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.780
19%, 3%, and 1%.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.080
Now, if you were managing the
money supply to an interest

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.530
rate-- and remember, the
interest rate-- the federal

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.870
funds rate, is the rate
that banks lend

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.460
to each other, right?

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.230
But as we saw, when you inject
reserves into the banking

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.370
system, it lowers the rate that
reserves are lent to each

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.560
other, but also increases the
lending capacity of banks.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.460
So it increases the
money supply.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.430
And so when you increase the
money supply overall the

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.570
lending capacity, you're also
lowering the rate at which

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.430
banks lend to projects, right?

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.650
You're increasing the
amount of money.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.850
Maybe the projects haven't
changed that much.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.330
So more money chasing the same
number of projects-- the cost

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.450
of lending is going
to go down, right?

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.220
So let's say the Fed manages
the interest rate in such a

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.530
way that the Fed target rate
was 5%, but let's say that

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.340
turns into bank lending to
real projects at-- I

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.590
don't know-- 8%.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.100
So in this case, we're not
fixing the money supply.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.140
We're just adjusting the money
supply in such a way that the

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.650
interest rate is fixed.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.670
So now during the planting
season, which products are

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.830
going to get funded?

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.750
This one, this one, this
one, and this one.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.720
These guys are not going
to get funded.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.480
And then once the planting
season is over, we're still

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.550
keeping the interest
rate the same.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.510
Maybe we'll contract the money
supply in order to keep

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.360
interest rate-- and of course,
this isn't what

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.920
they manage it to.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.550
They manage it to the inter-bank
lending, but it's

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.170
all related.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.810
I just want to give you a sense
of why it makes more

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.660
sense to manage to
an interest rate.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.090
So once the planting season
is over and some of these

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.540
projects aren't really available
as projects-- these

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.540
were all the planting projects--
in this situation

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.830
when we had a constant money
supply, we would lend to these

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.790
crappy projects, but now that
we keep the interest rates

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.850
constant or relatively fixed,
still only the good project is

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.160
going to get funded and we
don't have to worry about

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.320
banks just because they're
chasing yield and they're so

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.400
flush with cash that they're
chasing bad projects.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.720
So that's the underlying
rationale, at least from my

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.930
point of view, why it makes
sense to manage to an interest

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.800
rate as opposed to
a money supply.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.650
It allows the money supply to
expand and contract naturally

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.370
in real time according to
market demands for cash.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.190
And by setting the interest
rates, you're essentially

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.000
setting the threshold over which
you're willing to let

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.510
projects only that meet that
threshold get funded-- and not

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.870
products below it that might
somehow waste money.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.820
Anyway, we'll discuss this a lot
more in a lot of different

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.330
videos and hit it from different
angles, but I just

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.580
wanted to answer those
questions, just so you know

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.560
this wasn't some convoluted
crazy thing that they're

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.930
doing, although it is a
little bit convoluted.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.410
It's just not that crazy.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.720
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
