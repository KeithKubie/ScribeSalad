00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I've left the most interesting and challenging part of this

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
for you to finish, as a quiz--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and that's how to compute the newrank,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
based on the values of the previous iteration,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which are now stored in the variable ranks.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We want to compute the newrank, based on

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
all the pages that link to this one.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And if you think about the graph structure and how to go through

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the nodes in the graph, I think you can figure out how to do this.
