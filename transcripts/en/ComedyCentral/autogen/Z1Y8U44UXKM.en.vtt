Drake and Meek Mill are beefing.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.008
Well actually, Drake beefed
the fuck out of Meek Mill,

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.777 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the phrase
"Meeking" was born.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.011
You know what that means?

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.913 align:start size:88% position:13%
"Meeking" is when a
person gets upset at you

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.114
for not tweeting them,

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:17.217 align:start size:84% position:16%
liking their
Facebook or IG photo,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.384
sharing their post,

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.553
texting them back,
or calling them back.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.789 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
It really means just being
petty on social media.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.924 line:0%
Now these people, they tend
to go on a rant about you,

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.960 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
start spilling your
business all over the place,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
and making stuff up.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.262
The word "meeking" was born,

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:30.229
and the hip hop beat

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.764
between Toronto rapper Drake

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.299
and Philly rapper Meek Mill.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.767
Oh, Meek Mill.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.035 align:start size:97% position:3%
That's the dude who's dating
Nicki Minaj right now.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.236
So their beef started

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:38.805
with Meek Mill took
offense to Drake

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.607
not tweeting his followers to
buy Meek Mill's latest album.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.442
In response, an upset Meek Mill,

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.411
then began making allegations

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.913 align:start size:84% position:16%
and generally talking
shit about Drake,

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:50.049 align:start size:94% position:6%
until Drake had to release
two separate diss songs

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.917
that pretty much ended
that young man's career,

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:52.918
at least for the time being.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:53.886
None of this would have happened

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:55.721
if Meek Mill wasn't meeking!

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.257
It's you're fault, Meek!

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.091
Now you're over here getting
bodied by a singing nigga.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.794 align:start size:94% position:6%
The social media pettiness
has to stop, people.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:03.729
Let people be busy, let
people live their life.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:04.663
But if you don't
watch Swagasaurus,

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:05.765
I'm gonna be really pissed off.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:06.666
I'm sorry, look at me.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.667
I'm meeking, I'm meeking.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.600
My bad.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.437
Come back if you want, please.
