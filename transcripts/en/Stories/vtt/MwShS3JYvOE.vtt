00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.650
DANIEL WILSON:
Three billion people

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.550
rely on wood, charcoal,
or other kinds of biomass

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.880
to cook their food.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.521
And that kills three to four
million people every year.

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.270
INTERVIEWER: And this
is just because they

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.150
are inhaling all of that smoke?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.890
DANIEL WILSON: It's as if you
were barbecuing, but right

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.806
there in your kitchen.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.570
INTERVIEWER: Danny Wilson
is a development engineer

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.330
who's trying to tackle the
global health crisis that's

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.300
linked to cooking on
traditional cook stoves.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.280
Almost half the
planet's population

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.067
has no choice but to use these
inefficient burners every day,

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.650
even though they're
putting themselves

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.480
and their families at risk.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.030
When I traveled to rural
Tanzania last year,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.940
I met Wanadi, who told
me how using a cookstove

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.484
affects her and
her grandchildren.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:51.650
WANADI: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.250
INTERVIEWER: Does that create a
lot of smoke inside the house?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.585
WANADI: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.410
INTERVIEWER: Sometimes you
cry because of the smoke?

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.567
WANADI: [NON-ENGLISH]

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:10.650
INTERVIEWER: What Wanadi
and her family experience

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.750
are the effects caused
by particulates,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.690
fine particles composed
of toxic compounds.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.180
These particles are found
in high concentrations

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.210
in smoke generated from
traditional cookstoves,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.310
and if inhaled on
a regular basis,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.760
they can cause a whole spectrum
of illnesses, including stroke,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.220
lung cancer, and heart disease.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.395
As Wanadi was cooking, you
could hear her coughing,

00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:34.290
and her grandchildren
coughing around her.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.009
And as she explained,
she has no other choice

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.550
but to cook this
way, even though she

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.180
knows that it can cause harmful
long term health issues.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.480
What's incredible is that smoke
inhalation kills more people

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
worldwide than HIV
and malaria combined.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.760
To combat this
global health crisis,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.100
Danny and his team at the
Lawrence Berkeley National

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.280
Laboratory have been working
on improving cookstove designs.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.100
DANIEL WILSON: The cook stoves
are designed to really satisfy

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.080
two important needs for people.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.389
One is to reduce
the amount of fuel

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.090
that people have to
burn to cook their food.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.330
And then the second objective
is to reduce the amount of smoke

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.040
that people are exposed to.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.140
INTERVIEWER: The team
based their initial designs

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.600
on the needs of
internally-displaced people

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.100
in Darfur, Sudan.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.070
Here, wood is in scarce
supply, meaning women

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.456
often have to walk for hours
in search of sources of fuel.

00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:31.830
DANIEL WILSON: When your life
centers around a seven-hour

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.340
walk to go get wood
and bring it back home,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.950
it's very hard to make
space for education,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.230
or business, entrepreneurship,
time and energy invested

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.550
in kids, et cetera.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.270
So this problem is not
only a health crisis,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.580
it's also economic crisis.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.550
And I think of it as
a crisis of drudgery.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.350
INTERVIEWER: The team came up
with the Berkeley Darfur stove,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.610
an inexpensive, high efficiency
wood burning stove that

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.460
reduces fuel use by 50%.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.440
Around 40,000 of
these stoves have

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.050
been distributed in
Sudan and Ethiopia,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.320
and Danny and his colleagues are
constantly testing, updating,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.690
and improving the design,
thanks to the input

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.140
of the women who use it, and the
data that Danny collects using

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.970
a specially-designed sensor.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.270
DANIEL WILSON: Sensors give us
real-time, high quality data

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.670
about how the decisions
I'm making as a designer

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.730
are impacting the
adoption of those products

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.019
out there in the field.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.060
INTERVIEWER: The challenge
for Danny and the team

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.030
now is to adapt and refine
their cookstove design,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.920
not only for the
people in Darfur,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.830
but for the other three billion
people around the world.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.946
That might seem daunting, but
for Danny, it's motivation.

00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:42.570
DANIEL WILSON: The
problem is so large,

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.150
it has a very large
potential impact.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.220
I can see how the decisions
that I'm making as a designer

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.810
are influencing people's lives.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.110
And it just gives me
energy and excitement

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.679
just to keep on going.

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:59.220
INTERVIEWER: Danny
isn't the only one

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.800
trying to solve global health
problems at the University

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.120
of California Berkeley.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.000
Watch this episode to see
how researchers can transform

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.640
a cell phone into a
portable microscope that

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.450
can diagnose parasitic diseases
like malaria in just 30

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.464
seconds.

00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:15.380
We want to take a moment
to thank our partner,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.370
the Blum Center for
Developing Economies

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.130
at the University of California
Berkeley, an innovation

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.334
and research hub that's tackling
issues in global poverty.

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:25.500
Make sure to check out some
of their incredible work

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.609
