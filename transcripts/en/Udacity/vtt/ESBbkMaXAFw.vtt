00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.250
In addition to signature based
approaches, a misused detection system

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.193
can also use a more sophisticated
Rule-Based Approach.

00:00:08.193 --> 00:00:14.070
A Rule-Based Approach uses rules
to represent known intrusions.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.920
These rules,
typically match multiple signatures or

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.490
patterns in the activity data.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.720
These rules are not only
specific to the known intrusions,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.190
they can also be specific to
the target of protected network.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.547
Because the same intrusion may leave
different evidence in a different

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:36.900
network depending on
the network set ups.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.850
SNORT is a widely known example

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.610
of a Rule-Based Network
Intrusion Detection System.
