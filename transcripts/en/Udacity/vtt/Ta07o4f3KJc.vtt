00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.585
The answer is it depends. It really depends on the type of organization. There

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:08.546
are many different types of businesses and organizations, and therefore,

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:12.821
different types of incentives may work differently in each setting. Also, the

00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:18.200
value of extrinsic motivation, which isn't listed here can change across time.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.165
For example, younger people may be more motivated by a high paying hourly job,

00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:25.886
whereas those who are older may prefer a job with a good benefit plan over a

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:32.286
higher salary. So, our intrinsic motivations are not fixed per say. Now, if you

00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:35.904
find this information interesting, you might pursue a career in industrial and

00:00:35.904 --> 00:00:40.036
organizational psychology. In addition to worker productivity, I/O

00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:45.392
psychologists also study behavioral-based safety in the workplace. Now, let's

00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:46.309
go back to Susan.
