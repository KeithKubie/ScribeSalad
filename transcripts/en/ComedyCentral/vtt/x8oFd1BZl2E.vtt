And you might not be
a real judge,

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.877 align:start position:0%
but based on your robe
and your pigmentation,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.045 size:88% position:44%
I would swear that you were.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.880 size:72% position:64%
I've got all the tools,
right?

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.148 size:84% position:42%
Yes, you got all the tools.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.617 size:88% position:56%
I'm [bleep] robed and white.
I'm ready to go.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.419 size:84% position:42%
You look like a guy that
gave me seven years before.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.753 align:start size:28% position:72% line:92%
No!

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.753 align:start size:91% position:9%
Yes, you do.

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:24.457 align:end position:100%
Oh, I apologize for that
on behalf of all of us.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.592 size:63% position:69%
What'd you get
seven years for?

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.929 size:78% position:39%
Oh, I was a stick-up kid.

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.230 align:start position:0%
I was a stick-up kid.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.366 size:63% position:31%
Just a young,
misguided individual

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.902 size:84% position:42%
who really needed a chance
coming up in the inner city

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.771 size:75% position:38%
lacking a father figure.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.740 size:63% position:69%
I've seen that movie
a bunch of times.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.341 align:start size:78% position:22%
[Bleep]

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:44.177 size:69% position:66%
Why doesn't that movie
fix the problem?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.813
They keep making it, and yet
the situation keeps occurring.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.748 align:start size:88% position:13%
I don't know.
I don't know.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:50.450 align:start size:59% position:41%
You know what I was
thinking in there?

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:53.419 align:end position:100%
I was thinking they should
bring back corded phones.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.955 align:start size:75% position:25%
'Cause then these things
won't -- these incidents

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:57.323 size:59% position:70%
will stop happening
with the people

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:58.758 align:start size:53% position:47%
getting phones
thrown at them.

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.893 align:end position:100%
'Cause if the phone's
got a cord on it, you know,

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.396 size:63% position:69%
it'll just snap back
right away.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.232 size:88% position:44%
You know what? That actually
can work a few ways because,

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.234 size:78% position:39%
like, in the event
that you throw your phone

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.303 size:84% position:42%
to hit somebody in the head
and then, you know,

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.571
you can't retrieve your phone,

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.005 size:63% position:31%
it's nice to be able
to retrieve --

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:13.873 align:start size:69% position:31%
You get it back again.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:14.841 size:75% position:38%
You get your phone back.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:15.708 align:start size:38% position:63%
Yeah.

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:16.943 size:88% position:44%
Kind of like a bungee phone.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.411 size:66% position:33%
But you got to be
kinda like a ninja.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:19.946
You got to be a master at it,
'cause if you throw it wrong,

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.515 align:start position:0%
it come back and pop you
right in the mouth or something.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.550
So, you know,
sometimes karma might happen.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:25.952 align:start size:50% position:50%
That would be
embarrassing.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.121 size:72% position:36%
But karma may need
to intervene sometimes.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.724 size:81% position:41%
Hey, Judge,
tell the receptionist lady

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:33.259 size:72% position:36%
don't grind the weed up
that small no more

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:34.961 size:81% position:41%
when they know I'm coming.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.496 align:start size:72% position:28%
That got too ground up?

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.564
It got too ground up, 'cause
you know I smoke them blunts,

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.333 size:81% position:41%
you got to have
some chunky buds in there.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.734 size:66% position:33%
But I understand
you like the balls.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.202 align:end position:100%
Oh, you like to have some
chunky buds in there.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:44.137 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah, I do.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.439 size:59% position:70%
All right.
Chunky style.

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:48.040 size:66% position:33%
Chunky.
It really "shunky."

00:01:48.073 --> 00:01:49.275 align:start position:0%
It got to say "shunky."

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.644 size:59% position:70%
You like "shunks"
in your Reese's

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.846 size:63% position:69%
and things like that
and your Snickers?

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.115 align:end position:100%
I guess Snickers always
has "shunks" in it.

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:57.650 align:start position:0%
I don't want no "shunks"
in my Reese's, those.

00:01:57.683 --> 00:01:59.385 align:start position:0%
It's supposed to be smooth,
creamy peanut butter.

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:00.486 align:start size:38% position:63%
Okay.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.288 size:63% position:69%
Where do you like
your "shunks," then?

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:03.623 align:start size:56% position:44%
Just in a blunt?

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
I like my "shunky" buds
and "shunky" bank accounts.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:09.696 align:start size:56% position:44%
[ Laughs ] Okay.
