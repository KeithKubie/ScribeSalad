STEVE BAZYL: Hi everyone, and
thank you for joining us for

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.730
another Google Drive GDL.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.659
Today, we are going to talk
about one of the apps in the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:33.910
Chrome Web Store for Drive.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.100
This is a Draw.io.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.580
It's a nice collaborative
drawing map

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.510
using Google Drive.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.010
And today to talk about this and
give us a demo and talk a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.980
little bit of how it was
implemented, we have a special

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.070
guest with us today, which is
David Benson from Draw.io.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.610
Want to say hi, David?

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.110
DAVID BENSON: Hi there.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.580
STEVE BAZYL: So I want to
thank you for joining us

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.710
today, taking time.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.800
I know it's pretty late for
you over in the UK.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.280
But thank you very much for the
time, and thank you for

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.630
building Draw.io.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.140
There's some things about the
app that I think are going to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.540
be really interesting for this
audience, particularly that

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.350
it's an open source app, and
people can use it as a great

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.090
learning example.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.970
But I was hoping that you could
start us off with just

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.660
an overview of the app and maybe
show us a demo of the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.900
Drive integration and some of
the features that you think

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.810
are kind of the cooler parts.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.660
DAVID BENSON: Sure.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.500
OK.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.352
Is my screen live?

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:33.740
STEVE BAZYL: Yes, it is.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.930
DAVID BENSON: Cool.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.790
So this is Draw.io.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.210
The really easy way to introduce
it is it looks a bit

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.840
like Visio, another web app.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.890
The sort of diagrams you can
draw, things like flow charts,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.060
UML diagrams, networking
diagrams, electrical diagrams.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.040
There's lots of different
types of org

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.660
charts, and so on.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.460
So it's probably quite familiar
to somebody who's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.755
uses OmniGraffle or Visio.

00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:11.200
They're various online tools
as well like [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.580
charts, and so on, [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.280
thing.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.730
The difference between us and
some of the more commercial

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.230
tools is that this isn't
a commercial venture.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.010
There's a very public source
to the whole product.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.320
Commercially what we do is we
sell the underlying library.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.400
This is very much more
of a technology

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.030
demonstration library.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.800
Now, up here you can see what
I'm doing is a bit of

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.256
jgraph.com.

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:43.720
And what that means is I'm
integrated with Drive.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.970
When users first come to the
site they'll see a button here

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.840
which is integrated
with Google Drive.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.206
And prior to having the Drive
integration, when you did Save

00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:53.915
As, all we did is echo to
the local file system.

00:02:53.915 --> 00:02:58.080
When you did Load, we'd open
from the local file system.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.870
We [INAUDIBLE] then to things
like Google App Engine and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.090
particularly Drive.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.000
It gave us the chance to build
a useful application.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.670
Whereas before, to be honest,
we didn't really have the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.880
resources to take a library and
a basic example to do the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.340
user management, the storage
management, the scalability.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.630
We still have to tap
the resources.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.380
So when you log in with Drive,
you're not actually going to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.250
see that because the pop-up is
come up and ask you which

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.570
account I want to log in as.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.060
We'll actually come back
to that pop-up.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.510
It's one of the issues
that we haven't--

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.240
now when I say Save, after I
save this drawing one, for

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.670
example, that will actually
go into my--

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.960
let me switch my drawings
over to here.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.955
And that is the drawing one.

00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:55.450
I can save it as something a
bit more meaningful if you

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.130
want just to prove that
we are online.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.490
STEVE BAZYL: I believe you.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.330
DAVID BENSON: And then those
people familiar with Drive

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.337
know that there are restrictions
you have, for

00:04:09.337 --> 00:04:11.250
example, if you integrate with
the Chrome Web Store.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.750
No, it's not the Chrome Web
Store, it's the Drive SDK that

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.779
enables you to open directly
from Drive back into the

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.040
application.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.630
So what we originally
did with Draw.io--

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.450
it used to be called Diagram,
if anyone is confused--

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.053
is when Drive first came back
out in April, we took the edit

00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:40.170
example, and we integrated
that in with our backend.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.710
Now, that worked fine.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.050
There are various nuances
with Drive integration.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.230
And a lot of these are listed on
the best practices page on

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.635
the Drive docs.

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:54.500
And they're worth taking notice
of because we missed

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.950
out things like multiple account
management, taking

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.720
account of where users wanted
to open their files, which

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.620
folder for example.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.560
And the users came straight
back because they really

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.150
expected these to be in because,
of course, with a

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.530
local operating system, when
you open something, create

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.255
something in a folder, you
expect it to be created in

00:05:12.255 --> 00:05:15.080
that folder rather than
in the [? root. ?]

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.790
So we made a few improvements
to the Java backend.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.270
And we had a discussion,
actually, on Stack Overflow

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.570
because we were really
interested in a JavaScript

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.390
client rather than having to
go through our server.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.450
And fairly rapidly a working
JavaScript client came out.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.750
And as soon as we could, we
tried to integrate it.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.330
We found it very interesting,
the whole idea of going

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.980
directly from the JS
client to Drive.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.100
There's a number of advantages
both for us as developers and

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.430
both the users.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.260
I mean, things like privacy,
for example.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.185
Now our data doesn't
go [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:58.620
tool because before with the
Java version, everything was

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.850
going via our servers
and proxy.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.070
And this makes privacy
much simpler.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.230
It makes security
much simpler.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.750
We never see the user's data.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.690
We can't loose the
user's data.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.930
It's much simpler in that we
don't even have to have

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.020
sessions enabled
on our backend.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.270
And compared to the Java
applications, it's a hell of a

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.810
lot better [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.770
that we have to upload every
time we upload the app.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.890
So we made the decision a few
weeks back to actually go to

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.540
deployment with the JavaScript
version.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.390
It looks pretty much exactly the
same as the Java version,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.290
because, of course, all that's
changed is the Drive

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.110
integration.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.790
That's the point at which
we switched over

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.390
to the Draw.io domain.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.990
Previously, we were diagram.ly,
mainly because .io

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.960
suffix is a lot cooler
than .ly.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.450
Now, in terms of the
authorization, when you use a

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.115
server you've got to think
of server flow.

00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:01.770
And when you use a JS client,
you've got client flow.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.570
One tip for anyone who wants
to switch over, I would

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.000
suggest is if you have the
server flow in place, leave

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.760
the server functionality in
place in case the user's in

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.420
the middle of editing.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.662
Because if they're in the middle
of editing and they see

00:07:17.662 --> 00:07:21.200
all the backend functionality
exactly as it was before, they

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.690
can carry on editing.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.120
And if the JavaScript client
doesn't update, they can still

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.310
come to the site after you've
deployed and it

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.910
will work as before.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.210
So we actually managed to hot
deploy the app using the

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.550
JavaScript client library
without having to force a

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.820
refresh or without having
to have maintenance.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.050
So, I mean, that was kind
of coincidental.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.020
We didn't plan it that way.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.170
But if you are planning to
switch over from server flow

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.980
to client flow, it is better to
do it all in one go rather

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.130
than, for example, [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.900
keep the authorization on the
server, because you do get

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.150
that advantage.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.530
One downside of doing it is--

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.280
it's all very well that the
user gets privacy and

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.820
security and so on.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.720
And one thing we didn't realize
until after the event,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.370
is, of course, we lost
a lot of logging.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.220
When there was a problem
on the server--

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.910
most server side implementations
have some

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.630
degree of logging.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.475
Of course, when there's an
authorization failure, the

00:08:22.475 --> 00:08:25.360
user would email in saying
that they have a problem

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.640
authorizing, we realized
that we had no

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.390
logs to look at anymore.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.240
So it's worth considering
there are various

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.280
implementations for fairly
simply sending logging data up

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.409
to the server and storing it.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.280
You've got to be aware of
privacy again with that.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.750
If you're claiming that you're
ultra private with their data,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.254
and yet you're shifting stuff up
to the server, you have to

00:08:50.254 --> 00:08:51.700
be really careful.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.650
On a slightly related note as
well, in terms of the scopes

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:02.170
for Drive, users are really
quite savvy about the level of

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.610
permissions that you ask for.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.595
I don't know if I can
show you here.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.298
I think I'll have to
uninstall the app.

00:09:12.298 --> 00:09:17.350
But, I mean, when it asks to
install your app, it will say

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.295
do you want me to be able to
open and save files from all

00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:22.260
of your Drive or just
the application?

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.560
Do you want to be able to do
this when the user is offline,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.800
and so on and so forth.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.490
When you switch from server to
client, the scope that causes

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.970
the permission that when you
want to be able to edit your

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.880
stuff when you're offline, that
disappears, because, of

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.480
course, if you're client only,
you have to be online to make

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.840
those changes.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.980
I think there's a slight
misunderstanding about that

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.950
permission.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.120
I don't think that's saying that
they're waiting for you

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.870
to go away and do something
really weird with your data.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.060
But users just--

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.640
I think there's a comment
somewhere in the Drive docs,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.320
the less permissions
it asks for, the

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.870
more people will install.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.920
And that's definitely
our experience.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.390
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, those
are great bits of tips.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.730
One thing before you continue,
where can developers find the

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.890
source for this?

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:18.660
DAVID BENSON: They you can find
the source on GitHub.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.790
It's under organization,
JGraph.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.640
It's github.com/jgraph,
and then you see all

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.670
our projects, Draw.io.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.190
There's lots of Draw.io.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:34.270
mxGraph is the underlying
diagram library, and it's a

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.320
combination of the two that
actually makes what you see.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.123
We do have some build scripts
too to use in closure to put

00:10:43.123 --> 00:10:44.875
all the JavaScript together
just to make

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:46.020
them load a bit faster.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.965
There are instructions.

00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:50.692
There's actually quite a long
video on our G+ stream

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:51.570
on how to do it.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.540
It's about a 25-minute video,
which explains the chronology

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.470
how to [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:06.170
And on this subject, actually,
on GitHub there's a piece of

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.090
functionality that enables you
to statically deploy what you

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.890
have in your master branch.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.830
I think it's gh-pages.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.800
This is the gh-pages deployed
as a static app.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.240
Now, of course, it is
the app itself.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:29.952
And because it's using the JS
library [INAUDIBLE], I can log

00:11:29.952 --> 00:11:34.200
in because their server's
require to use the JS.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.810
And I will be able to then
save that back to my--

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.380
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.190
call this GitHub.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.830
And that will appear,
I really hope.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.410
So that's an example using
a completely static site.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.270
There's no server, nothing
behind it.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.620
And actually I've got
a really geeky idea.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.490
I'll suggest that later on.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.605
STEVE BAZYL: I was going to
say, you could even try

00:12:02.605 --> 00:12:05.180
hosting this within Drive
itself, with [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.880
DAVID BENSON: Well,
I have done that.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.140
So what I did is I put all
the code onto Drive.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.500
I made default to public.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.490
And you start getting into kind
of metric situations.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.380
So we have this feature
where you can

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.980
say move from templates.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.020
And, OK, I haven't
got the password.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.410
But a bunch of templates come
out and they're based on

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.770
actual XML of our diagrams.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.500
So what I could do is load
the diagram from my Drive

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.390
instance, change it, and then
the templates that appear into

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.046
the static deployment,
they're changed.

00:12:38.046 --> 00:12:41.820
And, of course, what I'd love
for someone to do is to create

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.890
a source control app using the
JS client that's built into

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.030
every deployment with the
data it comes with.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.726
I mean, that would be great.

00:12:49.726 --> 00:12:52.300
I'd pay money to see that.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.150
STEVE BAZYL: That would actually
be pretty cool.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.970
So in the sources is there
anything in particular a

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.240
developer should be looking at,
in particular related to

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.280
Drive and authentication?

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.910
DAVID BENSON: Sure.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:15.040
In the unhelpfully known
war/js/diagramly, there is a

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.795
helpfully known file called
GoogleDrive.js.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.865
Probably could do with
a few more comments.

00:13:22.865 --> 00:13:27.430
I will give you warning,
it's the [? v1 ?].

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.040
It does the job.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.690
It works as intended.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.930
I think for first refractory--
if anyone's wondering, it's

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:35.840
Apache license.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.200
We'll put an Apache license
at the top.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.290
I think for the first
refractory, what we're going

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:45.920
to do is have a more formal
state machine, because a lot

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.790
of the errors that come back,
you have to think very

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.680
carefully about what you're
going to do and what state

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.260
you're in when they come back,
and so on and so forth.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:01.190
When you add multiple account
management into the mix, it

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.450
becomes really, really
quite complex.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.830
And you have to consider, for
example, if you've got a 401

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.450
authorized, it might be, one,
that your session has expired.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.610
It might be, two, that you've
logged out, back

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.930
in as another user.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.370
So if you're assuming that your
session has expired, if

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.050
you try to be clever and try
to log back in, and you've

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:25.300
actually gone as a different
user, you've got it wrong.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:30.760
So what we're going to do is
follow a bit more of the state

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.350
design pattern, finite station,

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.560
whatever people call it.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.120
And we're going to draw
a pretty diagram

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.140
using Draw.io, of course.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.680
But we need to implement
[? curly ?] arrows.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.870
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.630
for that.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.640
And we're going to formalize
it a bit more

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.235
so it's a bit clearer.

00:14:47.235 --> 00:14:50.680
And then if people have got
problems, if developers--

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.895
because any developer is welcome
to take the code and

00:14:52.895 --> 00:14:54.700
use it if it's useful.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.670
We may even put it on to a
separate GitHub project,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:02.120
because I doubt people
particularly want to take the

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.700
whole thing in order
to use it.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.290
So we'll probably have a
refractory and say there will

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.440
be explicit [INAUDIBLE]
states.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.790
We'll give them names.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.880
We'll draw out where
the transitions go.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.120
I think that will help people
to deploy themselves.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120
And it will help them to report

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.160
bugs to us more clearly.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.080
And help get it right in our
head to be able to sort out

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.190
the few cases where
we have problems.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.130
I mean, in terms of where we
do have problems, as I

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.460
mentioned, you can't actually
see when I sign out and back

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.010
in again, I get a
little pop-up.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.106
One known issue is the fact
you have to click on the

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:43.160
pop-up twice in order to
get it to authenticate.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.800
I believe that's being
looked at.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:52.030
Another issue is because of
client side, when the token

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.800
expires, when the authorization
token expires--

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.580
that happens after
about an hour.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.805
So let's say you do a save and
your token has expired, you

00:16:02.805 --> 00:16:03.960
will get a 401.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.130
It's unauthorized.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.470
Now, when you get the response
back, you're no longer in the

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.880
user event because you're
in the call back of the

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.950
authorization.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.870
Because you're not in the call
back of the authorization, if

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:21.000
you try and authorize, it will
fire a pop-up and that will be

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.340
blocked if, like most browsers,
you block pop-ups.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.820
So a similar case, actually,
with the file picker--

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.440
so I think this is written
about in the Drive

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.330
documentation.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.720
And it's well worth doing
because like everyone, we're

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.130
far too lazy to do
that on our own.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.150
And what we do is when we hit
the file, we pop another

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.390
really bad dialogue and
we say how do you want

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.070
to open this file.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.480
Open and the diagram opens,
[INAUDIBLE] drawing.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.130
And the reason we're doing this
is because we want the

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:59.190
event that's fired when we click
OK to be able to open

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.220
that in a new tab.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.182
Because if you take it straight
from the call back of

00:17:02.182 --> 00:17:05.589
the picker, it will fire a
pop-up that will be blocked.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.230
Now, we scratched our heads.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.470
Is it better to have a pop-up
that's blocked and try to tell

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.829
people to allow it or not?

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:15.630
We're not really sure.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.079
We're not really user
experience experts.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:24.825
And we generally post on our
G+ desperately trying to

00:17:24.825 --> 00:17:27.800
persuade people to tell us
their thoughts on that.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.040
I mean, this is a bit
of a first run.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.030
So I think we are going to
polish various things.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.620
For example, when the session
expires and you would attempt

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.190
to save, and then you have
this problem that

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.820
authorization can't happen,
it will go to pop-up.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.990
Of course, what we thought about
after that is when we

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.260
get the token, we know the
duration for which

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.380
the token is valid.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.110
So what we could do is set off
a timer and then say after

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.930
that timer is expired, if
somebody clicks save, do an

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.960
authorization first because
we know it's expired.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.300
Then we'll have the
authorization to save a work

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.450
and we won't have some silly
dialogue to avoid the pop-up.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.900
STEVE BAZYL: One thing you can
try is-- and I haven't looked

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.330
at all the source to see if
you're already doing this.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.140
But the JavaScript
client has--

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.350
one of the options you can
include is what they call

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:19.650
immediate mode, which is very
useful for cases where you're

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.430
expecting the user to have
previously authorized.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.355
And rather than use a pop-up
it will use, basically, a

00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:28.350
hidden iframe with
[? cross ray ?]

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.960
messaging to check to see if the
user is authorized, and if

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.960
so, update the token.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:39.270
And that should work OK even
if you're not within a user

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.786
initiated event.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.184
DAVID BENSON: OK.

00:18:42.184 --> 00:18:44.050
I think we might have
looked at that.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.210
But I think there were problems
with the multiple

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:46.900
account management.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.970
STEVE BAZYL: There may be.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.130
I think I've seen your Stack
Overflow thread about some

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:56.320
issues with hinting at the user
ID for which one to use.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.420
And, yeah, something we'll
look at for sure.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.700
DAVID BENSON: I mean, is it
usable in production is

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.390
something you might ask.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:08.220
I think it pretty much is
because we probably need to

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.060
spend a couple more weeks.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.590
We could iron out some
of the issues.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.970
And a lot of our users are
feeding back to us about

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:16.620
various issues.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.225
So I think with a bit of
ingenuity the sort of last 10%

00:19:21.225 --> 00:19:24.340
of issues could be polished
out to the point that you

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.680
don't particularly notice.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.280
I mean, one slight issue is, as
far as we can tell, in the

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:39.360
Internet Explorer line, the
library uses XDR, and that

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.480
requires the protocol to be
identical on the end point as

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.470
whatever it is that sends
it, i.e., SSL.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:51.260
So we couldn't get that to
work outside of SSL.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.450
So on HTTP you can get
everything to work except IE9.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.850
So we have to put an
SSL certificate on

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.940
it to have IE9 working.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.140
And apologies to our
Firefox users.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.751
We put the wrong certificate on
and you get a big warning

00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:07.450
on a pop-up.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.840
But we are going to fix
that, obviously.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.452
STEVE BAZYL: David, when you're
not showing the app, if

00:20:11.452 --> 00:20:13.460
you want to talk directly to
viewers, it'd be cool if you

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.690
stopped sharing your
screen so we can--

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.180
DAVID BENSON: Oh, yep.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:16.670
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.920
STEVE BAZYL: That's it.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.940
So this has all been really
great information.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.900
So do you have any wish list for
things that you'd like to

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:34.140
see from Drive or from our SDK
or just Google in general to

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.980
make this better?

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.230
We already know about some
issues around multi-log on

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.210
with the JS client.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.880
But I'm curious what your
impressions are

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.180
of the Drive SDK.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.505
What can we be doing better to
help developers like yourself?

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.270
DAVID BENSON: For us to have
actually gone into deployment

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:57.020
with it, we're pretty
happy with it.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:02.991
There's minor nuances like the
double click on the pop-up for

00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:07.750
multiple accounts, but other
than that, I don't think

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.520
anything else is
insurmountable.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.640
Multiple accounts does make it a
lot more complex, as I said.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.160
But that's kind of
unavoidable.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.217
And anyone thinking about
avoiding multiple accounts, I

00:21:19.217 --> 00:21:24.320
wouldn't because a lot of users
now have the business

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.720
Google account and
they're private.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.750
And there's not but about five
business apps on business

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.660
accounts and the private one.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.836
And users came back very quickly
complaining about lack

00:21:36.836 --> 00:21:37.750
of multiple accounts.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.610
So there's nothing
particularly I

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.400
would complain about.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.460
In fact, I was very, very
happy when the JS client

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.190
library came out because I've
never really liked,

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.454
architecturally, this idea
of always having to

00:21:49.454 --> 00:21:51.774
proxy via the server.

00:21:51.774 --> 00:21:57.010
I think the idea of going via
the client is much better,

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.180
whether or not users understand
the advantages of

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.840
privacy and security,
probably most don't.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.590
But, I mean, it also
gives a lot of good

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.720
possibilities for flow mode.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.600
And one thing we're going
to do is have a look at

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.170
application cache and
the local storage.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.580
Because the thing with Drive is
I've noticed that Drive has

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:21.180
a better run time than most
cloud computing platforms,

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.450
because it's probably
a lot simpler.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.170
Because the more simple it
is, generally the longer

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:25.910
it stands up to--

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.072
STEVE BAZYL: I'm not sure
I would say simple.

00:22:28.072 --> 00:22:31.400
But we appreciate
the compliment.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.050
DAVID BENSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:32.915
It looks simple.

00:22:32.915 --> 00:22:36.726
Well, I mean, the server we
have, for example-- the thing

00:22:36.726 --> 00:22:39.977
is with the server is quite
often it's a user error which

00:22:39.977 --> 00:22:41.440
brings the server down.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.170
We've had more outages because
we have deployed something

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.975
corrupted or whatever, rather
than the actual

00:22:45.975 --> 00:22:47.400
server going down.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.830
Now, if you're deploying fairly
much static content,

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.860
and you're using the
application cache--

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.940
so even if our server goes
offline, somebody could come

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.890
on with the application cache.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.780
They could read and
write to Drive.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.910
It's much better continuity
for the user.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:07.140
That combined with say local
storage, if you went out of

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.560
range on the device.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.850
And we do work on tablets
as well with Draw.io.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:15.820
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, I was
actually just going to ask

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:21.160
about mobile and whether or
not you've looked into a

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:28.020
mobile version that's either
optimized HTML5 or native.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.130
DAVID BENSON: What we did is
we changed a few of the

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.860
handlers we call them.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.055
We made them a lot bigger.

00:23:35.055 --> 00:23:36.430
We moved them around.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.860
It's not a massive change.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.080
It looks quite similar.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.230
It could probably do with
a bit of a change.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.280
I mean, if you look at
it on a four-inch

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.280
phone, it's pretty unusable.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.840
But I'm not sure how you could
really make that usable

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.590
without a huge change.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.570
But we don't actually
use Canvas.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.510
A lot of people assume
we use Canvas.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:59.470
We actually use SVG with VML
on the Internet Explorer,

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.710
because we started writing
an XGraph [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.050
back in 2005.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:07.040
And I don't think Chrome was
around then and I think it was

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.240
Internet Explorer 6 and so on.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.012
So it's not that we're really
retro, it's just when we

00:24:12.012 --> 00:24:13.262
started it.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.330
STEVE BAZYL: This has been
fantastic, and just great

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:20.560
information for developers.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.240
I obviously encourage everyone
to check it out.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.020
And I also just want
to thank you.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.230
We just started our Google+
Community for Drive

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.330
Developers, and you've been
very active there already

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.980
providing some really useful
tips to other developers.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:40.010
I really do appreciate that very
much, and along with the

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.560
time that you've taken today.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.730
Before we wrap up, I don't know
if there's anything else

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:50.120
you wanted to share with
developers or tips, or if

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.840
there's anything that developers
should know about

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.360
working with Drive that you
could sum up quickly?

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.896
DAVID BENSON: I would say that
the JavaScript support for the

00:25:00.896 --> 00:25:02.420
client library could
actually be more

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.215
important than Drive itself.

00:25:05.215 --> 00:25:07.515
I mean, I've said I've felt for
a long time this is really

00:25:07.515 --> 00:25:09.570
the way to go with web
applications, and I don't

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.810
really see any cloud storage
providers providing something

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:16.570
equivalent in terms of
simplicity and the advantages

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.910
to both users and developers.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.250
I'm very interested to see
the way this goes.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.140
And it's developing fast.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.530
We considered supporting other
platforms, but as long as

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.245
Drive, particularly the JS
client, develops this fast, I

00:25:34.245 --> 00:25:36.760
don't think we'll bother,
because I think this is

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.845
actually, technically, quite a
long way ahead of alternatives

00:25:40.845 --> 00:25:42.396
at the moment.

00:25:42.396 --> 00:25:42.780
STEVE BAZYL: Cool.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.110
Well, thank you very much.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.610
I think we will wrap up there.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.610
Again, thank you very much for
your time and for building

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.860
Draw.io, and your willingness
to share that

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.450
with the broader community.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.660
That's all for today, and I
don't know if we have our

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.930
topic for Thursday, but stay
tuned on Google Developers

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.560
Live or the Google+ Community
for Drive Developers, and

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.010
we'll keep everyone up
to date as to what

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.870
Thursday's topic will be.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.120
Thank you.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:37.433
