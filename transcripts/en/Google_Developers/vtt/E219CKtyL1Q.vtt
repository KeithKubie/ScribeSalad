NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Good morning.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.850
I'm Natalie.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.940
I would like to invite
up some of my new friends

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.110
and some old friends
to the stage.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.710
Will our panelists
please come on up?

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.658
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.900
I've got to take my phone and
Chapstick and everything else

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.358
that you shove in
your pockets out.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.110
All right, so like
I said, I'm Natalie.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.250
My core role here at
Google is as our Women

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.910
in Technology Advocate.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.130
Little bit about myself is Megan
Smith is a friend and mentor,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.420
and back in 2013, I was working
on Women Techmakers Makers

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.760
is a 20% Project with my friend
Stephanie Liu, who's here.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.550
And basically I
was going to I/O,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.430
and Women Techmakers
would really only

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.030
happen the night
before Google I/O.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.830
It was a way for us to
galvanize and create community

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.249
prior to our big
technical conference.

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:08.040
Basically, I was like,
man, this can really

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.000
happen more than once a year.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.630
And so I thought how can
we make this something that

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.489
scales around the world
and happens all the time?

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:18.530
So I went to Megan, and
I was like, Megan, I want

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.280
this to be my full-time job.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.220
And so she went to
Hiroshi, she went Sundar,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.170
and those gentlemen said,
yes, we will absolutely

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.780
make this her full-time job.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.050
So I'm lucky enough that I got
to take my passion project,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.390
my 20%, into a full-time job.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.017
And so now at Google
I create a program

00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:40.850
that helps to provide
visibility, community,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.600
and resources for
women around the world.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.830
And I'm incredibly
thankful for my job.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.390
And I'm sure these other women
also have incredible jobs

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.880
that they want to tell
you a little bit about.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.338
So we're going to
go down the line.

00:01:50.338 --> 00:01:53.340
I'm going to have our awesome
panelists say their name

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.230
and a little bit
about themselves,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.832
and also what
they're solving for.

00:01:57.832 --> 00:01:59.130
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: So, hi.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.250
I'm Kimberly, and I'm a
Mechanical Engineer here

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.240
at Google.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.730
I work on the
self-driving car project,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.220
and I am Solving for
X, of course, but apart

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.010
from that I'm really passionate
about the work we're doing

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.180
with the self-driving car.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.670
I really feel like
it's going to change

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.280
our world for the better.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.340
For me personally, I have
two aging grandmothers

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.870
that really can't
drive at night anymore,

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.840
and I really believe
that the self-driving car

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.130
is going to give
them back mobility

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.974
and independence that they
are losing as they age.

00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:33.140
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.830
NAHID ALAM: Hi, how you doing?

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.120
I'm Nahid, I'm a
founder at Lighthouse.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.855
We make voice control solutions
for your daily devices,

00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:46.570
home devices.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.850
So my background is in
hardware and electronics,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.940
and I love building
tangible, physical things,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.590
so my goal is to basically make
an everyday object work for you

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.280
so that you don't spend
time in daily chores.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.640
KATE STIRR: Hi, my
name is Kate Stirr,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.170
and I'm an Artist and
Prototyper at The Exploratorium.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.340
I work in both
hardware prototyping

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.470
and educational
prototyping, so that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.530
means I do a lot of
educational design

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.230
and working on
designing experiences

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.940
as well as actually building
and making things with my hands.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.740
What I would really
like to solve for

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.450
is creating a
global culture that

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.760
supports building
confidence in young women

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.960
so that they can choose
whether they want

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.190
to be artists or scientists
or some combination thereof,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.850
and they feel like that is
something that is open to them

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.000
to decide for themselves.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.540
GABRIELLA LEVINE: My
name is Gabriella Levine.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.560
I'm a Hardware Engineer
at Google X. I'm

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.560
on a team called
Rapid Evaluation,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.290
and our goal is to prototype
new possible Moonshot

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.580
Solutions for Google X.
And the type of work I do

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.720
is hardware prototyping
a lot with electronics

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.410
and fabrication, and
my passion is in robots

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.820
that fly, that walk, that swim.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.890
And I've found a lot
of sort of importance

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.370
through communities that I've
learned with, both online

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.450
and in person and shared
collaboration makerspaces,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.590
so what I want to solve for
is developing tools that could

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.280
give people access
for empowerment

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.330
to build things that more
efficiently create automation

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.300
and environmental
cleanup, but also

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.158
considering design
and experience.

00:04:41.158 --> 00:04:42.782
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
No big deal, right?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.920
So a really cool side
note, Gabriella was also

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.960
one of the I/O
speakers that we had

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.450
this past for Women Techmakers,
and there's a great video

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.420
online about her talk.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.210
I really recommend
you check it out.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.750
So we're saying some words
that maybe not everyone

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.300
is familiar with.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.580
Can I hear a little
bit from one or two

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.070
of you, what is prototyping?

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.028
Like, we've said that a
couple different times.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.930
KATE STIRR: I can answer
that, because I used it

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.430
in two different contexts.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.040
I think for me,
prototyping is really

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.180
kind of a mindset of try
it, change it, try it again

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.320
where you're working
through ideas quickly

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.350
but leaving room for reflection
in between so that you can sort

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.640
of-- like, the name of
Gabriella's team at Google

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.390
is Rapid Evaluation, and I think
that's a big part of the ethos

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.140
of prototyping is being
able to quickly decide

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.670
what's working,
what's not working,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.955
and then to iterate on
that and try the next step.

00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:45.996
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:05:45.996 --> 00:05:47.010
That sounds right.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.697
So when you're prototyping,
what are the materials

00:05:50.697 --> 00:05:51.530
you're working with?

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.140
So when I think of prototyping,
I do paper prototyping a lot.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.160
Or we call them
low-res materials.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.950
That's a fancy name for
construction paper and pipe

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.905
cleaners.

00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:04.242
So I use a lot of low-res
materials when I prototype.

00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:05.950
What kind of materials
are you using with

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.620
to solve for the projects
that you're working on?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.495
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Really
all kinds of things.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.310
I know working on
the self-driving car,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.610
a lot of my prototypes are about
things users would work with.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.004
And so one of my
first prototypes

00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:21.420
that I made when
I was on the team

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.170
was it was a cardboard box that
I know made a layout of buttons

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.540
on and sat with a user and I
was like, how's this layout?

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.740
And then change it a bit.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.730
So it can be things as simple
as that or things as robust

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:39.710
as 3D printed materials or clay
or any sort of thing like that.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.410
NAHID ALAM: So for
me, prototyping

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.550
is-- because of my
background at Intel,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.110
I first jumped into
a microprocessor.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.820
So my initial stuff
were basically

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.550
Arduinos and a bunch of
sensors, things like that.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.290
And over time, it kind
of moved to like, OK,

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.500
you have a crazy wiring
Arduino or Raspberry

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.800
Pi or any other computer
things you have in front.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.510
Now, how do you cover it?

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.470
So then you move to 3D
printing or the laser cutter.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.922
Things like that
I use regularly.

00:07:15.922 --> 00:07:18.130
GABRIELLA LEVINE: I guess
for me my ideal prototyping

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.080
is similar to yours where it's
Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, wires,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.350
sensors, but often what I find
might be quicker than just

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.310
jumping to do the tools I love
to use is actually to say--

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.780
and this is more of
sometimes specific

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.810
to a certain application--
to say, well, could I use,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.070
I don't know, paper or pipe
cleaners or low-res materials

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.980
to get a first pass to see if a
product that I'm thinking about

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.420
might even be valuable.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.130
So do something that might
involve other people and actors

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.740
and paper, if that could
be done in 15 minutes,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.460
and then hopefully jump
to the tools I love,

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.570
which is hot glue
and electronics.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.212
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah, I
feel like I'm a hot glue pro.

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:02.170
I used to go to the
Children's Discovery Museum

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.100
a lot in San Jose
when I was younger,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.650
and my mom would
volunteer there.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.070
And so I feel like that was the
beginning of my expert level

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.357
glue gunning that I
am now really good at.

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:17.520
We're talking about
rapid innovation,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.780
and I guess we're
suggesting that prototyping

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.780
leads to rapid innovation.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.780
What is your favorite
project that you've ever

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.347
worked on where you had
a prototype that really

00:08:26.347 --> 00:08:28.930
landed and worked out and lead
to something really incredible?

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.960
NAHID ALAM: I guess I would
talk about my current project,

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.322
really, but other
than that, when

00:08:38.322 --> 00:08:42.630
I was pretty early in
prototyping and building

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.290
electronics-- tangible,
physical products outside

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.490
of my current
work-- at that time,

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.440
I was involved
with a STEM group.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.180
They were teaching
high school girls

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.770
have to build projects
with tools that

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.470
were available at that time.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.500
So one of my favorite
projects, the goal

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.760
was to teach girls, high
school girls in a wash-up

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.330
how to build a robot.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.387
So I was in a team which
they were basically like, OK,

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.220
on the wash-up day,
they will do this thing.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.560
So we first try it.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.510
What will the steps be?

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.760
What are the things they need?

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.750
What are the
components they need?

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.230
How do they need to wire it?

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.960
What are the codes
they need write?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.020
So that was to build a
robot car, so I worked

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.380
with a couple of other people.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.960
So that was a very
interesting project.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.140
GABRIELLA LEVINE: I guess I also
question does rapid prototyping

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.570
lead to rapid innovation
at larger scale, because I

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.485
sometimes can do things
very fast to prototype

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:47.450
and get a first model
out, but often I

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.610
get stuck trying to scale.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.670
And that's something that
I wonder how could we

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.060
bring the prototyping to scale.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:10:01.110
So to talk about one project,
I started prototyping a snake

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.060
robot, just because
I was excited

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.150
about snakes and organic
motion through sort

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.800
of linear array of servo motors.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.600
Then I realized, OK,
if I keep prototyping

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.730
this, what if I share my designs
and see if other people start

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.270
to use this for, I don't
know, for sharing back

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.704
new code algorithms
or other things

00:10:22.704 --> 00:10:23.870
that other people are doing.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.510
So that's one way.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.320
I think using the internet
to share designs and see

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.250
what people all over the world
might build and share back

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.560
with you might be one
way to actually lead

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.400
this quick cycle of prototyping
to get to a potentially

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.780
scaled innovation.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.820
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So at some point

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.010
I want you to talk a little
bit more about the robot.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.360
Gabriella has a really excellent
story about as some things

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.740
that didn't always go well.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.570
And maybe that leads
into my next question,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.550
because it begs the question.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.860
We have low-res materials and we
have these incredible projects

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:07.212
that we work on, but things
don't always go well, right?

00:11:07.212 --> 00:11:08.670
Like I said, I'm
a glue gun master,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.586
but that doesn't mean
that I don't burn myself

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:11.789
from time to time.

00:11:11.789 --> 00:11:13.330
Thankfully I haven't
lost any fingers

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.040
in the projects I've worked on.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.240
I'll say that one project that
I'm especially proud of-- it's

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.780
not necessarily my
day-to-day role,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.680
but it's the only
time that I can

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.950
claim that I'm a rocket
scientist-- was I built

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.270
a four-story hand rolled
aluminum rocket ship

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.150
that you might have seen on the
Embarcadero in San Francisco.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.720
And that is built with my art
collective called Five Ton

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.330
Crane.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.410
And we built it to engage
people in citizen science.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.080
And that went really well.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.900
But there is definitely
some things that went wrong.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.520
Can you guys share a little
bit about something that failed

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.652
and that didn't work?

00:11:47.652 --> 00:11:49.110
KIMBERLY SHERIFF:
Yeah, definitely.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.250
I feel like 70% of the
things I make fail,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.060
and that 30% is really
where the money is.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.410
Part of being an innovator
or a prototyper or a maker

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:11.130
is really having a thick skin,
because what we do, design,

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.410
make, test, repeat, but
that test part is, I think,

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.800
often the most critical part
because you can design things,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.674
you can make it, but if you're
not sharing it with users

00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.090
and getting their
feedback, you're

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.550
not going to be able to
improve your designs.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.890
And so I think often
there's a pride aspect there

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.340
where you get really
into this design,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.040
and you've worked really,
really hard on it,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.310
but you give it to a user
and they're like, actually,

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.906
I don't like this at all.

00:12:39.906 --> 00:12:42.880
And you're like, well,
that's unfortunate.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.910
But as a prototyper,
you have to be

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.470
able to take that and
take that design you just

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.990
worked for hours and
hours and hours on

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.840
and just throw it away and start
with something that is going

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.010
to be better for the user.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.040
And really I think
checking your pride

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.790
and then accepting
that it's going

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.520
to take several
iterations to get

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.060
to something that's great
is really, really important.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.079
And to expect
failure and to know

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:14.620
that when your prototype fails,
that doesn't mean you failed.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.610
It means that you have
learned something, hopefully,

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.029
from that iteration.

00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:20.070
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.950
That's a huge point.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.290
And it's not a
Valley cliche, right?

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.384
Like, fail fast, fail
often, fail early.

00:13:28.384 --> 00:13:29.800
There are definitely
projects I've

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.730
worked on for Women Techmakers
where I was so excited,

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.990
we were working so
hard on these projects,

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.480
and they just
didn't really land.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.480
They just didn't
really work, and it's

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.040
like a little piece of my
heart fell on the floor.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.900
But you know what?

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.434
It's cool.

00:13:43.434 --> 00:13:44.850
We're going to try
something else.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.870
I learned something from
that, and you move on.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.720
So like I said, it's not
really a Valley cliche.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.347
It's something that I think
a lot of us want to live by

00:13:56.347 --> 00:13:57.930
and we try to live
by and we encourage

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.800
everyone else to fail.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.950
It's a good thing to fill.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.553
Any other good fail stories?

00:14:03.553 --> 00:14:05.460
KATE STIRR: At the
Tinkering Studio where

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.450
I work at The Exploratorium,
one of the things

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.390
that we try to build
into our activity design

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:16.560
is opportunities to fail in a
way that kind of builds you up.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.180
And so lately what we've
been doing in the space

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.600
is making Rube Goldberg
machines or chain reactions,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.490
and so visitors of any age
will come into the space

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.400
and they'll create a series
of things that happened

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.910
one thing after another.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.740
Maybe a block falls and then
a ball rolls down a ramp

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.080
and hits a lever that causes
a pulley to fall off the table

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.220
and move a car.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.070
And so there's all of these
moments along the way where

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.600
something could go wrong.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.640
As kids are working
on these projects,

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.840
they become very invested
in making it succeed,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.090
but almost 100% of
the time there's

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.125
one elephant--
element-- elephant?

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:58.666
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: That'd be
the best Rube Goldberg machine.

00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:02.380
If there's an elephant as a
part of it, it'd be amazing.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.490
KATE STIRR: We have
a squirrel, actually.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.620
Anyway, it's a crazy place.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.010
But there is usually one element
that's not going to work,

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:16.495
and so that is this experience
of try it, change it, try

00:15:16.495 --> 00:15:19.150
it again prototyping
over and over again,

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.440
within this very safe context.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.160
It doesn't really matter whether
your chain reaction works

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:30.180
or not, it's the experience of
having that iterative process

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.760
that builds confidence
and says, well, I

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.280
got this one section to work.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.600
And if I had, like,
five more hours,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.790
I could probably get
the rest to work.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.670
But I think that
knowing your limitations

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.590
and figuring out what is
possible within the context

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.360
that I'm in right now
and evaluating yourself

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.780
on that stage rather than
zooming out and evaluating

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:58.200
yourself in kind of a context
the isn't right for what you're

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.980
actually trying to
accomplish in the moment

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.230
is something that I really
have experienced in my own life

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.690
and that I'm trying to promote
in visitors and learners

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.520
at The Exploratorium.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.360
NAHID ALAM: I guess
one thing I'll say

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.610
is maybe like, really,
disaster doesn't

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.120
have any condoms, right?

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:24.970
So if something doesn't work,
you know that it doesn't work.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.570
So it's kind of
like you're crossing

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.610
out one of the unknown unknowns
so that you can try out

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.610
other parts.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.545
So one of my personal
stories that I

00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:36.960
will share is not really
related to prototyping,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.410
but when I was
about six years old,

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:46.760
I looked at a
sewing needle and I

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.830
was looking at an electric
socket, and I really thought,

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.610
these two will fit really well.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.810
And I put that there.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.030
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Now,
you learned something.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.530
Right?

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.249
That's important.

00:17:00.249 --> 00:17:02.165
KATE STIRR: That doesn't
sound like a failure.

00:17:02.165 --> 00:17:03.748
That sounds like a
science experiment.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.774
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah, it's
actually a really beautiful

00:17:09.774 --> 00:17:11.440
thing that-- I brought
up my mom already

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.869
a couple of times-- I
remember one time in a science

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:17.450
experiment I was supposed to
be building a rhinoceros out

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.810
of Styrofoam and papier mache.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.849
And my mom thought
that, well, you know,

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:23.829
I needed to take it to
school the next day--

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.329
and I wonder if she
remembers this--

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.400
but she stuck it in the
oven because she thought

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.510
that would make it dry faster.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.840
And it turned into just a sad
mess, and we had to rebuild it.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.350
It was a really nice
thought, and hey, mom.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.430
So you mentioned,
Kate, a little bit

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.560
about being hard on yourself.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.650
I find that that's something
that a lot of us as makers,

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.910
as creators, as innovators,
we're hard on ourselves.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.569
Like, I think maybe even people
around us are hard on us,

00:17:56.569 --> 00:17:58.860
and I think it's because not
that we're perfectionists,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.890
but we just want to
do an incredible job.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:06.160
And so I want to ask the panel
when you're hard on yourself,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.975
and you realize that that might
be a barrier to you excelling

00:18:08.975 --> 00:18:12.000
and going forward, how
do you counteract that?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.970
Or do you have people in
your lives or a mantra

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.580
or a method that helps
you take off that baggage,

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.230
take off that stuff,
and just keep going?

00:18:25.466 --> 00:18:26.840
KATE STIRR: Well,
Gabriella and I

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.300
were actually kind of talking
about this before we came up

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.090
on stage and just thinking
about when you're not

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:39.929
confident in yourself, how
do you find that confidence?

00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:41.220
Does it come from someone else?

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.053
I guess I'm kind of
restating your question,

00:18:43.053 --> 00:18:46.260
but that's something I think
about for myself a lot.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.910
And so for me, one
thing that helps

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:53.750
is to try to challenge
myself in a different context

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.450
and to kind of go through
the things in my life

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:00.580
that I am doing really
well or that I've taken

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.050
on these other challenges.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.260
Like, maybe it's
running a marathon

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:10.010
or climbing a challenging
route at the climbing gym

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:14.180
or making a fantastic
gourmet meal or something,

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.200
and ticking off those successes
and then reminding myself

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.170
that I'm a much bigger person
and fuller person than what

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.920
I'm doing in my job.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.490
And so even if a
prototype or some hardware

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.410
is not mechanically working
the way that I want it to,

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.430
I think having those
other successes

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.380
in other parts of
my life remind me

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.910
of that I have
this sticking power

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:41.020
and can really push through
and accomplish things,

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.222
even when they're challenging.

00:19:43.222 --> 00:19:44.180
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Yeah.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.990
So I've been at Google now
for a little over a year,

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.820
and when I joined the team,
I was straight out of college

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:56.360
and I walked in my
first day, found out

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.152
we were making a car, which I
didn't know previous to that--

00:19:59.152 --> 00:20:00.610
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Little project.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.280
KIMBERLY SHERIFF:
Just a small thing.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.560
And walked in and
was meeting the team,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.270
and I was the only female
mechanical engineer

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.460
and still am on the
self-driving car team.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.040
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
We'll fix that.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.300
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Yeah.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.240
We're working on it.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.260
And that was incredibly
intimidating.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:20.080
I was in a room with all
of these really, really

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.600
impressive engineers.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.190
People who have just
really amazing backgrounds.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.340
Like, did you mean to hire me?

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.869
Are you sure?

00:20:32.869 --> 00:20:35.035
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: That's
a common thing at Google,

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:35.270
actually.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.315
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Yeah.

00:20:35.315 --> 00:20:35.790
No, it is.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.320
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: People will
get their badge and be like,

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.380
are you sure?

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.665
My name's really on the list?

00:20:39.665 --> 00:20:39.970
It happens.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:40.510
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Yeah.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.440
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
But you belong here.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.398
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Yeah.

00:20:42.398 --> 00:20:46.460
No, and [? Ani ?] was talking
about how she felt miserable

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.597
and really unqualified in a new
team for the first six months,

00:20:50.597 --> 00:20:52.680
and I feel like I had a
really similar experience.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.250
And the way I really gained
confidence was, similar to what

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.430
Kate was saying, was just
challenging yourself and really

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.040
getting more and more
experience has really

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.250
helped me build
confidence and helped

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:10.380
me to get feedback from my
peers that I'm doing a good job.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.730
And that has
definitely improved,

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.990
but I definitely think
in the beginning,

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:20.020
my confidence was an
issue, and I'm really

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.600
happy that it's improved since.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.840
But I was very timid to
take on those challenges

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.872
in the beginning.

00:21:25.872 --> 00:21:27.600
Luckily that's not
the case anymore.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.641
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:21:28.641 --> 00:21:31.450
So a good friend of mine,
Elena, she's a Googler.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.470
I wish she was here for
you all to meet her.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.489
We're going to be sharing her
story on the Women Techmakers

00:21:37.489 --> 00:21:39.280
YouTube channel in the
next couple of days,

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.890
and I'll Tweet it out to
you guys so you see it.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.650
One of the coolest
things about her talk

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.800
is she actually
has a Gmail filter,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.790
and so any time anyone
sends or anything

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.520
like a thank you or great
job on that project,

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.560
she has an Awesome folder.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.010
And so every day, if
she's having a hard day,

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.630
she goes to that filter and
she just sees all the praise.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.730
Because when you're having a
hard day, when your shit is not

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.630
going right, your project
is not working out,

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.280
she has a whole
set of emails that

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.666
reminds her how great she is.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.290
And I actually have
a gratitude journal

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.670
that I write in all the time.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.820
And when I'm having a rough day,
I go back over the past year

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.180
and I just laugh.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.930
That one time when I saw
like a humpback whale spy hop

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.130
and I got to touch its nose.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.370
Little things in
life that remind you

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.130
that you are not your work.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.300
Your work is
something that you do.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.666
I'm thankful that I get to
bring my passion into my work,

00:22:36.666 --> 00:22:38.040
but I can check
out if I need to.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.810
And I think that's a
really important part

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.877
of managing-- I
don't want to bring

00:22:41.877 --> 00:22:43.460
in too much of the
work/life balance--

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.500
but managing some of that
stress that can pop up

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.650
in the work environment.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.560
So we have a few
more minutes before I

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.950
want to take some
question and answers.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.380
A theme that I've seen pop
up in some conversations

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.360
today is around
mentorship and people

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.380
that brought you into wanting
to be a prototyper or a maker.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.920
Can you share the
people that inspired you

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.409
so in that the room can also
be inspired by those people?

00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:13.200
NAHID ALAM: Surely.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:22.190
The overall maker community,
they were really welcoming,

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.620
so that was really
the inspiration.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.340
Like when I got started
with prototyping,

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.340
that was one thing.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:36.360
And then when I was at
Intel, I had a mentor

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.970
who was a VIP at
Intel Labs, so he

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.640
was a great inspiration in
giving me all the tools he

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.610
has in his home.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.870
Like, hey, you take
it and do stuff.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.985
So that was great
[INAUDIBLE] time.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.532
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
We're all like nodding.

00:23:58.532 --> 00:23:59.490
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Yeah.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:08.410
So for me, I feel like
my-- when you join Google,

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:13.140
you get assigned a mentor--
but for me, my real mentors

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.160
came from the people
I was sitting around

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.120
and the people I started
working on projects with.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.050
I came in and a
lot of people were

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.800
really overwhelmed
with the work they had,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.840
and so I took on some
of those projects.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.070
And those people became
really natural mentors for me.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:34.060
One of the people I really
look up to the most in my team

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.672
is Jaime Waydo, and she-- if you
don't know anything about Jaime

00:24:38.672 --> 00:24:39.880
Waydo, you should Google her.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.480
She's an incredibly
impressive woman.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.970
She worked on the Mars
Rover, and now she

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:48.290
is the Systems Lead for the
self-driving car project.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.710
And she's just such a
bubbly and powerful woman

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:56.470
that I luckily get to work
a few feet from and get

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.740
inspired by every day.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:03.870
So I'm incredibly fortunate
to have her in my work group.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.560
GABRIELLA LEVINE: For me it's
been more of a community,

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.070
like you said, than
one particular person.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.360
There are a few
people I can mention.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.400
For example, one man,
his name is Tom Igoe,

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.160
he's one of the
founders of Arduino

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.790
and he was a professor
of mine and just super

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.160
supportive and nonjudgmental
of my stupid and crazy ideas

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.530
and my mistakes
and failures when

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.780
I came to him with
really silly things that

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.410
failed because I didn't
take something into account.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.910
But was, yeah, supportive both
technically and conceptually.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:40.960
But I found more of a
community of sort of mentors

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.040
through online forums
of makers and designers,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:50.576
including Adafruit, she was
on one of the videos that

00:25:50.576 --> 00:25:51.200
played earlier.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.500
And Limor Fried runs
an open source hardware

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.560
company called Adafruit.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.630
SparkFun I often
post on the forum.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.190
And many people respond
back to questions,

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.460
somebody who's an avid
electrical engineer by trade

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.550
for many years,
responds to a question

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.460
not in a way that makes me
feel like stupid for asking it,

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.960
but helpful and uplifting
even if my question might

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.090
be something that
has a trivial answer.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:25.020
Instructables is a website
that I post projects onto,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.040
and then people start
talking through the forum.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.820
But I can also
find answers there.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.540
So it's been online communities
where various people sometimes

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.890
keep responding, and I
find particular mentors

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.000
through that, but it's
this whole community

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.390
and ecosystem that has led
me to find people in general

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.950
to use as mentors.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.190
KATE STIRR: My mentor experience
that really stands out

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.660
for me was when I was in
college, I was an art major

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.240
and I had been doing
a lot of drawing,

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.820
2D work, very traditional,
classical art work.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.840
But it was getting towards the
end of my college experience,

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.470
and I had to do a thesis
project and I thought, oh, you

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.420
know what, I think I've got a
handle on this drawing stuff.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.680
I'm going to do ceramics.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.940
And I'm going to
learn everything there

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.190
is to learn about ceramics.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:21.430
And so then I was kind of
doing that for about a year.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.120
And then I was
like, what I really

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.420
want to do is build a boat.

00:27:26.394 --> 00:27:28.060
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Like a ceramic boat?

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.059
KATE STIRR: Well, I did
make some ceramic boats,

00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:36.050
but I really wanted to make a
full-sized cedar strip canoe.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.850
And I had never used wood tools.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.640
I had never done any
woodworking except

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.440
to make canvases
using a chop saw.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.170
And so the mentor that
really kind of gave me wings

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.540
was the sculpture
professor at Lewis &amp; Clark,

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.070
where I went to
school in Portland.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.950
And he kind of gave me
keys to the wood shop,

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.930
and he showed me how
to use all the tools

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.080
and made sure that I
was in a safe space.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.220
Told me to have somebody there
so if I cut my finger off,

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.270
somebody could respond.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:12.140
But it was just that
level of trust in saying,

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.390
it's OK that you haven't
done this before.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:18.156
It's OK that you only have
two months to build this boat.

00:28:18.156 --> 00:28:19.940
Go for it.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.530
And that trust is
something that every day I

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:28.410
try to pass on and kind
of hold people up and say,

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.910
that's OK that you've
never done this before.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.964
Every time you
try something new,

00:28:32.964 --> 00:28:34.380
you're doing
something you haven't

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.970
done before and kind of jumping
off a cliff a little bit.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.240
And being able to have
someone there that's saying,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.370
I'll spot you.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.730
It's OK, can be a
really great way

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:50.240
to step back and provide
mentorship without actually

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.340
handing someone-- not doing
it for them, but saying,

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.220
here's the tools to
go do it yourself.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.750
And I trust you,
and I support you.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.810
So I have always
valued that experience.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.999
It continues to inform me.

00:29:04.999 --> 00:29:06.040
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.790
You some of my
favorite words, which

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.490
are "trust"-- and one
of my personal mottoes

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.009
is that trust is the
only real currency.

00:29:13.009 --> 00:29:15.300
And so I think it's one of
the most valuable things you

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.000
can have with someone is trust.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.100
Also safety.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.000
I think creating safe
environments for people

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.900
to experiment, to innovate,
is also a really cool.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.660
And then sometimes when people
ask me, oh, what is your job?

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.960
And I could tell them
the long or short of it,

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.230
I like to say that I like to
provide access and give access.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:40.020
I also like to say I like to
fuel fires, fire starters.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.690
I think that all the women in
this room and around the world

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:43.950
are fire starters.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.380
So if you need
fuel, come ask me.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.480
And so I think that as we
wind down closer to Q&amp;A,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.780
everyone in this room is a
maker, a creator in some way.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:30:01.190
And do you have an entry point
or a gateway into making?

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.350
So everyone leaves this room and
everyone can go make something,

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.640
but how do they
incorporate prototyping

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.309
or this idea of rapid
innovation into their work?

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:12.850
KIMBERLY SHERIFF:
I think a lot of it

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:17.270
is just knowing the tools that
are available, because there's

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:24.160
so many resources online
or tools you might already

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.070
have that you don't think
of as prototyping materials.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.950
Things like that Amazon
box that just arrived,

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.210
that's now prototyping material.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:41.189
And really, to be a maker,
all you have to do is make,

00:30:41.189 --> 00:30:43.730
and so I think that's something
that everybody can do if they

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:48.360
have it in their mind to do it.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.500
NAHID ALAM: I guess if you
want to get started, just

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.230
get started.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.336
That's the first thing.

00:30:58.336 --> 00:31:01.800
Even five to ten years
back, if somebody

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.170
wanted to make something
physical and tangible,

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:07.930
things were kind of secret and
only some special cult group

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.870
knows about how to make things.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.900
But those barriers
to entry are kind of

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.920
lowering and lowering nowadays.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.510
So you can find a
lot of resources,

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.630
as Gabriella mentioned.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:22.290
SparkFun, Adafruit, and I'm sure
a lot of others are out there.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.720
You can find them.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.040
Make Magazine is one of them.

00:31:28.231 --> 00:31:29.980
GABRIELLA LEVINE: I
forgot what I was just

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.370
about to jump in with.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:39.000
I guess I learned a lot
about not how to-- I guess

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.940
one really important thing
that I learned was how to learn

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.700
or how to Google
for the right thing

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.880
or how to use YouTube
to learn anything.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.190
So I feel like that was a
really valuable thing knowing

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.430
that most of the information
for making anything,

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:56.830
like from an automation robot
to improved manufacturing,

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.654
it's out there on the internet.

00:31:59.654 --> 00:32:01.070
Things just need
to be integrated,

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.970
but anyone could do it.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.780
It takes a little
patience, but that's

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.690
for something of that scale.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.344
I have this particular
anxiety-- especially when I'm

00:32:12.344 --> 00:32:13.760
in that position
where I'm saying,

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.870
oh, I feel a little
down on myself-- OK,

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.980
I better just build something
and stop thinking and just do.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.200
That's been helpful for me
in order to just get started,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.170
just sort of start somewhere.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.330
Take a piece of paper and
fold it into something

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.840
or write down the idea.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.780
Yeah, basically just get
over that initial barrier.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:35.440
And then the barrier to entry
for making physical things

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.860
or even doing code prototypes,
it's getting lower and lower.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.470
You can send away for 3D printed
parts at places like Shapeways.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.650
So things are a lot
easier to both find

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.970
people online to tell
you how to get started,

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:55.060
but also just to YouTube how
to do something pretty simple.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:59.017
I use YouTube for that, and
I've learned so much from that.

00:32:59.017 --> 00:33:00.850
KATE STIRR: I really
resonate with that idea

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.950
of thinking through your hands.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.470
And by just starting to
manipulate a material,

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.780
you're getting some other
juices flowing that might not

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.910
have already been going.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:16.180
And also, one thing for me
that keeps me moving forward

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:20.190
is learning new
tools and picking

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:24.410
a tool or a particular
actual mechanical thing,

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.470
for example different kinds
of 3D printers or CNC software

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.490
and setting up tools
in different ways,

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:36.710
maybe using a lathe or a
manual mill or something

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:40.680
or even just carving something,
I think choosing one tool

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.440
and saying, I'm going to master
this tool or I'm going to,

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.680
not master it, but just learn
the vocabulary, it opens up.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.430
It's kind of like
speaking a new language,

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:52.150
then you can participate in
this broader conversation

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:56.310
because you have other
elements of vocabulary or tools

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:59.065
that you can use
to move forward.

00:33:59.065 --> 00:34:00.690
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
I really like that.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:05.320
And on the YouTube tip,
so a couple of days

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.159
ago, the YouTube team launched
a campaign called Dear Me.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:11.970
Has anyone in this room
seen the Dear Me video yet?

00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:12.469
Nice.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:17.750
One, two, three, great, four.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:21.081
So by the end of this day,
I would love for all of you

00:34:21.081 --> 00:34:23.350
to consider to create
a Dear Me video.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:26.540
And a Dear Me video--
it's the hashtag dearme--

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.110
and it's the idea of what would
you tell your younger self.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.980
And knowing that
many young women,

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.210
especially when I was
rebellious and angry

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.420
and had body issues when
I was 12, 13-- I mean,

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.166
I still kind of have body
issues-- you're not always

00:34:44.166 --> 00:34:46.290
the most confident in
yourself when you're younger,

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.620
and you're awesome.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.679
You're totally cool
just as you are.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:52.659
And so these Dear
Me videos are videos

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.969
that we encourage
everyone around the world

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:57.550
to share a message
to your younger self.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.500
And Susan Wojcicki,
who's the CEO of YouTube,

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.690
just launched hers on the
Women Techmakers channel.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:08.030
Pavni Diwanji, I was working
on hers with her yesterday.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.050
And so I encourage
everyone to think

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.870
of submitting a Dear Me video.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:16.510
But to that point, what would
you tell your younger self?

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:20.120
The 13-year-old you?

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:24.730
To stay on the path or diverge
or what would you share?

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.630
GABRIELLA LEVINE: Well, I
guess I didn't say on path.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.100
So I'd say kudos for that.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.180
But also--

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.462
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: What
was the original path?

00:35:34.462 --> 00:35:35.920
It's OK if you
don't want to share.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.336
GABRIELLA LEVINE:
Classical piano,

00:35:37.336 --> 00:35:41.550
cancer research in a biomedical
lab, and then crazy from there.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.800
It was sort of eventually just
the bio and then lab work,

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.080
medical school, and at that
point, that didn't happen.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.610
So I say that's a good
thing to follow through

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:58.880
with being OK with-- well, I do
remember being quite confused

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.144
for a while saying, I'm not
finding passion in the work

00:36:03.144 --> 00:36:04.560
that I know how
to do technically.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.730
I want to do some creative but
also technical, what do I do?

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:15.540
And I'd say, at that
point, relax a little

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.820
and try a few things out.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.170
And I guess one thing
that I would say

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.440
is don't only do things rapidly.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:26.320
Maybe slow down and be a little
more introspective sometimes.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.880
And that's particular to me.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:32.080
But I guess do a
balance of not being

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.400
fearful to stray off path,
because so many of us,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.300
for example, at Google, come
from crazy backgrounds that

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.350
are winding and end up doing
something that you could

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.190
start developing later in life.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:48.460
So let's say you're
30 or 20, 30 and want

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.530
to become an
electrical engineer.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:51.750
It's not impossible.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.430
So many things aren't impossible
to take nontraditional routes

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.720
to get to a place of expertise.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.690
So don't be scared
to just try and fail.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.072
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yep.

00:37:03.072 --> 00:37:04.780
KATE STIRR: I would
tell my younger self,

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.510
and I try to tell
myself on a daily basis,

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.650
that it's OK to ask for help.

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:15.590
I think that as a woman
coming into a field

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:20.430
of mechanical prototyping
and hardware prototyping,

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.610
there is a lot of
stuff in my head

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:26.180
about I have to be able
to do this all on my own.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.154
I have to just focus and
not ask anyone for help.

00:37:29.154 --> 00:37:30.820
I'm going to just go
YouTube that thing,

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.150
and I'm not going to communicate
with the people sitting

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.850
right next to me and
show that vulnerability

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:38.280
and say I don't know.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.500
Can you show me.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.370
And I think that ultimately
I need to remind myself

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.820
that it's OK to not know
everything all the time,

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.450
and that the way that I'm going
to move forward as a learner

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:53.510
is by using the
resources around me.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.520
Sometimes that's YouTube,
but a lot of the time,

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.360
I love having a person-to-person
interaction of someone

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.967
showing me how to
use a new tool,

00:37:59.967 --> 00:38:02.550
and then I can go ahead and turn
around and teach someone else

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.690
how to use that tool and
reinforce my own skills.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.970
So asking for help
and knowing that I

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:14.100
don't have to be the holder
of all the information all

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.230
at once.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.250
Part of my goal for myself
is to be a lifelong learner

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.982
and to constantly be
adding to my skill base,

00:38:21.982 --> 00:38:24.190
and the only way that I'm
going to be able to do that

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:29.147
is to reach out and ask
other people around me.

00:38:29.147 --> 00:38:31.230
NAHID ALAM: I think what
I would say to my younger

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:34.090
self is be more fearless.

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:38.390
My experience is kind of the
reverse of what Gabriella said.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:41.870
There were a lot of times when
I was not sure what to do,

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:45.200
and I basically sat
down like "The Thinker".

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.820
I would do nothing.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:51.610
So I think I should have
done more at the time

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.495
and been more fearless
and not thinking too much

00:38:55.495 --> 00:38:56.920
of what's going to happen next.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.144
So just do it kind of mentality.

00:38:59.144 --> 00:39:00.560
KIMBERLY SHERIFF:
I think for me I

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.450
would really love to tell
13-year-old Kimberly what

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:04.460
an engineer is.

00:39:06.111 --> 00:39:07.860
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
That's a good thought.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.818
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Yeah.

00:39:08.818 --> 00:39:13.460
I definitely had no idea
what that meant until maybe

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.330
my freshman year of college.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:23.510
And I feel like
you go to a doctor,

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.860
you know what a doctor does.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.180
You have teachers,
you know what they do.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.880
You've seen television shows
with politicians or lawyers

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.800
or things like that.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.840
So you know what all of
these professions are,

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.334
and so 13-year-old
Kimberly was going

00:39:35.334 --> 00:39:37.000
to be the President
of the United States

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.930
and had zero interest in math.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.860
And I feel like if I
had known at that time

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:51.420
what an engineer does and that
you make things for people,

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.670
I would have probably pursued
that much sooner than I did.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.920
And I feel like this
maker culture that we're

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.610
trying to encourage and
develop is a really great thing

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.820
for education,
because it's a way

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:11.170
to explain to young kids who
might not have access or role

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:14.520
models that are engineers
or technical people what

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.995
it is to be an engineer
or developer or designer

00:40:16.995 --> 00:40:17.950
kind of thing.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:19.700
GABRIELLA LEVINE: I
agree with that, also.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.408
Because I remember
having the opportunity

00:40:21.408 --> 00:40:24.990
to take a computer science
class or health class,

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.030
and for some reason,
I chose health class.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.280
It didn't resonate, so
I started programming

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.610
at a much later age.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:36.932
And I wish I had more skills,
but I didn't know what it was.

00:40:36.932 --> 00:40:39.015
So, yeah, if somebody put
a little tool in my hand

00:40:39.015 --> 00:40:41.550
and said, go play with this.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:46.750
Or go program on one
particular language,

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:50.800
my mind might have been
blown 15 years ago.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.850
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: When I think
of my path, it's super winding.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.690
I'm mean, college jobs are
college jobs in some ways.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:01.600
I worked in a deli, I
worked at Starbucks,

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.680
I've helped teach English
to younger children who

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.120
didn't know English, I've
worked in community management

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.300
for a really long
time, I used to throw

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.810
illegal underground raves.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.500
And I ended up here.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.289
My background is in
building communities.

00:41:21.289 --> 00:41:22.830
I've done that for
the past 10 years.

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:25.600
And so I always
knew that I wanted

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.760
to do something for women,
and actually, young people.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.100
And so I got to the
technology industry,

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.940
and I was like, why technology?

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.330
I thought the only way I
could solve for the world was

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.360
to work for a nonprofit.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.930
That's what I thought.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:43.780
And so when I landed
here, and I started

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.020
to see just how things
started to come together,

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.470
it was like the windy path
started to make sense.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:52.590
But I didn't set
out thinking that.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:55.580
I wanted to be a high school
history teacher so bad.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.500
That was my job.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.672
I was set.

00:41:57.672 --> 00:41:59.130
And then finally,
when it came down

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:02.300
to getting the certification,
my dad and I agreed.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.340
Because he was like,
you have too much energy

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.260
to just stay put.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.770
So go out and explore the world.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.320
And I'm so glad my dad and
I talked about doing that,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.390
because it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:15.860
So thank you to our panelists.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.270
I want to be able to open
the floor to Q&amp;A. We've

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.340
talked about a lot.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.270
We've talked about what
prototyping is, what innovation

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.940
is, what tools we use, what
tools we encourage you to use

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:30.550
to incorporate into your work
as a developer or as a designer,

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.300
as an entrepreneur.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.670
And I'm sure you have questions,
and we love passing the mic.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.970
So we're going to have
some mic runners that

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:42.000
are going to be running around
the room with some mics.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.760
So if you raise your hand,
we'll happily answer questions

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.480
for the next 15 minutes or so.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.390
Mic runners, mic
runners, where they at?

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:51.470
Nice.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:54.880
They'll just kind
of pick at random.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.940
I'm a Software
Engineer at Cisco.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.730
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Welcome.

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:02.880
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about prototyping.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.310
So when you design or when
you prototype something,

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:09.930
it's a new product of technology
which doesn't have any existing

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.890
customer base.

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:15.240
What are things to keep in
mind or take into consideration

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.590
to make sure that your product
gets a customer buy-in?

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:25.210
NAHID ALAM: So I think
the first question to ask

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:30.580
is, is it solving any problem?

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.410
Not just because I'm an
engineer and I can make things,

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.210
so I make things.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:38.560
So the first question is,
is it solving any problem?

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.250
Maybe you're solving a problem
for a working, professional

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:50.370
woman, go talk to them.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.430
Hey, I'm thinking of this.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.420
Talk to your friends.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.878
Talk to a few more people,
maybe five, ten people, and say,

00:43:55.878 --> 00:43:57.235
hey, I'm thinking of this.

00:43:57.235 --> 00:43:59.350
Would you buy this?

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:03.720
So that kind of gives you
sort of an early validation.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.524
And then maybe you can do
prototyping and show them.

00:44:07.524 --> 00:44:09.190
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So knowing the user.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.460
NAHID ALAM: Yeah.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.168
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
It's really important

00:44:11.168 --> 00:44:12.250
before you get started.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:12.470
GABRIELLA LEVINE: Yeah.

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:13.960
And there are
various ways to say--

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.126
I mean, there could be a
different reason why you're

00:44:16.126 --> 00:44:19.850
prototyping a product or a
tool, and it could, oh, I just

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.520
have inspiration to build this.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.240
OK, that's OK.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.540
But what if you are
trying to say, well, where

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.890
might it fit in in the world?

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.350
Then you could
say, OK, what does

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.850
it look like when it gets
to the customer's hand,

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.550
and then sort of
step back from there.

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.270
Or do initial research.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:36.352
Talking to people
is such a great way

00:44:36.352 --> 00:44:38.560
of knowing your user that
way, and then saying, well,

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.144
maybe this product or this thing
that I was going to prototype

00:44:42.144 --> 00:44:43.810
could be prototyped
totally differently.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.065
And then be open to drop that.

00:44:46.065 --> 00:44:49.640
It's sort of a
solution-based approach.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.464
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: One of
my favorite things, IDEO,

00:44:52.464 --> 00:44:53.880
they're great,
they have something

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.720
called-- they used to call it
the Human-Centered Design Kit.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.600
I think they just call
it the Design Kit now.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.850
I'd recommend checking it out.

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:03.210
It's a way for you to approach
solving a problem from a user's

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.390
perspective.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.960
And also I think
being able to observe

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.330
the world in a way
as a problem solver

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.491
and to develop really
interesting solutions

00:45:12.491 --> 00:45:12.990
from that.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:19.440
So Design Kit from IDEO is
a cool free online resource.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.720
Anybody else?

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.387
Thank you.

00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:23.720
AUDIENCE: I also work for Cisco.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.110
I'm a systems engineer
working on automation.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:28.860
Kate, I loved that you
mentioned climbing,

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.600
because I think it's a
great activity for engineers

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.820
and women.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.850
But my question is I'm
wondering if each of you

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:38.817
could speak to your
strengths as a woman that

00:45:38.817 --> 00:45:39.900
make you good at your job.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:45.560
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: I
guess I can start.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:50.040
I think one of my
biggest strengths

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.790
and what makes me really
good at the team I'm on

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:57.370
is my ability to
iterate so quickly.

00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:02.200
So the work I do
is very fast-paced.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.260
We're trying to get these
self-driving cars to users

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.100
as quickly as possible,
and so a lot of that

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.290
is trying to figure out
what's best for the user.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:18.000
And so I work a lot with
user experience teams

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.240
and make a design, they test it.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.520
Make a design, they test it.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.390
Make a design, they test it.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:24.230
And I could do three
of these things in one

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.240
week and get them all made
and prototyped and ready.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:31.950
And so I think for me, that's
probably my biggest strength.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:37.070
But to counter that, I think
sometimes one of my biggest

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.920
weaknesses is, because
we're moving so quickly,

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.400
and speaking to
Gabriella's point,

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.590
is sometimes I think I can
move a little too quickly

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.050
and miss some of the
details that if I had spent

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:51.810
just a little more
time in this iteration,

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:53.830
we might not have needed
two more kind of thing.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.850
So there's a balance there.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.620
NAHID ALAM: I think
my biggest strength

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:05.930
is I love to make
physical, tangible things.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:12.690
And even though it's much
harder to build and deliver

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:14.820
those products in
the market, I love it

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.710
so much that I'm ready
to go through that pain.

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:20.660
I think that's my
biggest strength.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.260
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: For me I think
one of my biggest strengths

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:32.450
is being aware of and gauging
the temperature of other folks

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:38.040
on the team and synthesizing
where everyone's at.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:42.380
Trying to kind of gauge what's
happening with each member

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:46.000
in solving a particular
problem and how can I

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.332
help them communicate
that to each other

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:52.930
and how can I share out
with the broader group what

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:54.180
our team is thinking.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.990
And I think that, for me, I
really get a lot of energy

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:01.280
from having diverse
opinions and trying

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:05.540
to reconcile those
opinions in a way that

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.920
moves the whole team forward.

00:48:10.155 --> 00:48:11.530
GABRIELLA LEVINE:
You said what's

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:14.869
your strength as a woman.

00:48:14.869 --> 00:48:16.910
I was trying to think is
that different than just

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:18.684
strength in general?

00:48:18.684 --> 00:48:19.600
I'm not sure if it is.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.260
Maybe it is.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:28.680
One thing that I think is
a strength is that I hear,

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:33.720
statistically, women
are less apt to not

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.150
be afraid of trying something
that they don't know.

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:37.950
Or if somebody says,
could you do this?

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:39.320
Be like, yes, I could do this.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.570
I have no idea how to do this.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.220
But I'll figure it out,
and figure out also

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.400
how to delegate the things
I don't know to other people

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.600
and manage that aspect
while also learning

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:53.320
a lot of new tools and figuring
out a quick way to do that.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:53.820
Yeah.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:59.410
Learn to do something
myself or delegate it out.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:00.839
Yeah, I guess that's one.

00:49:00.839 --> 00:49:01.380
I don't know.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.210
I think I've worked
in a lot of jobs

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:06.960
with mostly men, some of
them have had physical labor.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:12.300
Being physically strong has
made me feel like, OK, I'm

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.820
going to impress them by being
able to do as many pull-ups

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:15.320
as them.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.194
But that, I think, is not
particular to this job.

00:49:18.194 --> 00:49:20.110
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: What
Gabriella is also not

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:22.880
sharing with you is she's
an emergency firefighter,

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.100
so that's why she's
doing pull-ups

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.300
in the forest fighting fires.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.570
That's what she's
done in a past life.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:33.090
GABRIELLA LEVINE: But sometimes
I sneak it into the lab

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:37.380
just so people know also
that it's not like women

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.340
are different and weak.

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:46.560
Don't be hindered
by expectations.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.410
So that I guess
is something that

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:54.591
like I hope makes people's
stereotypes blown.

00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:56.340
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So there's some teams.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.240
So Women Techmakers
is not just me.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.490
I don't create this
in a silo, there

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.270
are hundreds of people
around the company that make

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.437
Women Techmakers what it is.

00:50:04.437 --> 00:50:05.894
They're the people
that are wearing

00:50:05.894 --> 00:50:07.700
the green shirts and
the blue shirts today,

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.220
and I'm not speaking directly
to all of them right now,

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:15.390
but some of the women that
contribute 20% of their time

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:20.845
to working on Women Techmakers,
I'll see their contributions.

00:50:20.845 --> 00:50:22.470
And this is a lesson
for some of them--

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:23.886
and you might know
who I'm talking

00:50:23.886 --> 00:50:27.890
to you-- some of my
contributors will

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.940
share some very simple
sentence of what

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.380
they did to their managers.

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.284
Like, I launched a program.

00:50:34.284 --> 00:50:36.200
But I'm like, wait, I'll
look at their update,

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.310
and I'm like, you launched it
to a hundred people in a week.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:41.850
And you killed it.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:45.110
And what I find is that not
only my contributors to Women

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.680
Techmakers, but
women in general,

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.660
don't sell themselves enough.

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:50.350
You have so many strengths.

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:52.650
You do such incredible
work, and for some reason

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:54.950
that gets lost at
the opportunity

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.090
to report out about
what you're doing.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:01.980
And an old time Googler
told me that reporting out

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.810
about your work inside
the company, and even

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:07.520
inside and outside the
company, is 50% of your job.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.570
Sharing out about you.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:11.860
And so I really encourage
you, yes, they're strengths,

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.640
now communicate
them in your jobs.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.130
Communicate them online.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:19.160
Write blog posts about
how bad ass you are.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.946
That's important.

00:51:20.946 --> 00:51:21.945
Anyways, more questions.

00:51:24.409 --> 00:51:24.950
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:27.560
So I'm [INAUDIBLE],
also from Cisco.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.560
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Wow.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.170
This is a Cisco dominated room.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.780
This is great.

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.900
AUDIENCE: So we talked
a lot about prototyping

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.410
and you also discussed how
70% of the time it may fail.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:40.600
So when you decide
to start or do

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.505
a prototype for your
project, be it your work

00:51:43.505 --> 00:51:47.060
or your personal project,
what are the key factors

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.110
that you should consider
before starting it in order

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.260
to go in the right direction?

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.070
You never know,
it may still fail,

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:58.880
but then that will help
you prevent failure

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.100
in some way in the future.

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.890
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: So I think
the really important things

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:07.960
to know going in
are who is my user,

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:13.900
if there is a user, what's
the purpose of this thing.

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:19.010
If you really understand the
requirements of your project

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.990
or of your thing, it'll help
you a lot in the design.

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.490
And if you don't
know those things,

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:28.500
perhaps it's a user
interface type thing,

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.250
and you don't know
the requirements yet,

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:34.590
it's often best to get a really,
really quick prototype out.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:37.510
It doesn't need to be pretty,
but a really, really quick one

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:40.320
that you can then get
into users' hands.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:43.560
And then from that
feedback, make more

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:47.612
of a detailed real-life model.

00:52:47.612 --> 00:52:48.320
NAHID ALAM: Yeah.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:53.440
I think, as Kim mentioned,
that if you really

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.905
know what the function of the
prototype you are going to make

00:52:57.905 --> 00:53:00.190
is, then it becomes easier.

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:04.350
And then if you are obviously
doing something physical,

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:07.924
then there are some components
and sensors and things

00:53:07.924 --> 00:53:09.090
like that that are involved.

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:12.210
So as soon as you know
what you are going to make,

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:17.580
if you just order them online,
it will reach you in five days.

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:24.359
So you can do yourself a favor
by ordering early, I guess.

00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:25.400
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Cool.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.570
Any more questions
from Cisco people?

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.845
No, I'm just kidding.

00:53:28.845 --> 00:53:30.300
From anyone?

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:30.930
I love it.

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:32.320
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:33.310
Excuse me.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:33.550
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: I
don't know where you are.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:34.080
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Oh, over here.

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.020
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Oh, OK.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:35.880
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
We've got to add more

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.847
light to this side of the room.

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:38.680
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.660
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.642
My question is
about how you ensure

00:53:43.642 --> 00:53:46.200
that your customer,
the people, the public,

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.760
the trust your product.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.820
Especially I've
always been interested

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:55.370
in self-driving
autonomous vehicles--

00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:59.190
I would love to be
part of it in any way--

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:02.500
how do you know that your
grandmother will trust

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.870
your product to be driven in?

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:07.690
Because they have to trust
it with their life, right?

00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:11.210
Or how that kayak that
Kate built-- obviously

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:13.410
you can test it
yourself, and a kayak

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:17.690
is less dangerous, because you
probably can get out safely.

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:21.647
How do you do safety
trusting in your prototype?

00:54:21.647 --> 00:54:23.980
KIMBERLY SHERIFF: Well, first,
for the self-driving car,

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.850
safety has been a
huge priority for us.

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:30.590
And we're really going
above and beyond standards

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:37.830
to make sure this vehicle
will be safe for the public.

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:42.920
Everything is redundant,
and we've put a lot of time

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.460
into testing this for safety.

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:52.679
And so I think that in itself
will build public trust for it.

00:54:52.679 --> 00:54:54.220
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.950
GABRIELLA LEVINE: Yeah.

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:59.810
So you could have safety
built-in and redundant,

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:01.810
but people not feel safe
just because they don't

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:02.934
know about it and trust it.

00:55:02.934 --> 00:55:06.090
So I think that's
often a question where

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:09.579
you bring some sort of
user experience design

00:55:09.579 --> 00:55:10.370
and talk to people.

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:13.710
What makes you feel trust
about being in a car that

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.690
might drive itself?

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:19.310
Sometimes I could consider
asking a question like that

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:21.060
and having a brainstorm
session about what

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:25.910
might be ways to impose trust
on people in a vehicle that

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:28.820
might not be typical.

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.570
Do they want to feel like
they have control to take over

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.340
or not and just try
things out on people.

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.630
So that's something that
I'm dealing with a lot

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:38.940
when thinking of a
new crazy product that

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.860
might be cool to make.

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.660
Thinking of will that even
fly, because will people

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.040
be OK trying something?

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:49.390
If so, how do you make
something be comfortable

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:51.340
for the public, and
thinking about, again,

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.069
knowing your user.

00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:55.110
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I
would say some common tools

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:58.440
when we're trying to think of
those that Gabriella touched on

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.340
is a how might we statement.

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.750
So it's a part of that
understanding the user design

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.020
and doing research.

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.560
So I would encourage
you to go back

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:09.150
to your team, if you're building
something for the public,

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:10.650
and sit down with
your team and just

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:13.790
be like, how might we
create trust in our product?

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:18.660
Because then you're not starting
from a statement or an opinion.

00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.380
You're just opening
it up to the room.

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:22.400
How might we solve
for something,

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:25.540
and that allows everyone's
voice to just come out and get

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:26.510
creative.

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:28.839
Also, a really cool
tool when you're

00:56:28.839 --> 00:56:31.380
trying to do this constructive
brainstorming of how you might

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.680
create trust or how you
might create security

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.970
is learning to say
"yes, and" to people.

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:37.350
This is an improv technique.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:38.808
For the theater
people in the room,

00:56:38.808 --> 00:56:40.280
you know what I'm talking about.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:45.270
I think we skip to saying no and
sharing an opinion too quickly

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:48.410
and shooting down
ideas-- we as humans.

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:50.426
So the more that we
can say "yes, and",

00:56:50.426 --> 00:56:52.550
you're going to create a
radically more interesting

00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:56.250
experience and solution if
you can add to people's ideas

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.410
instead of shooting them down.

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:00.269
Any other questions?

00:57:00.269 --> 00:57:01.060
Middle of the room.

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.440
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm Tanya.

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.320
And thanks to Google
and Women in Technology

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.930
for having us over here.

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:08.050
Talking about
making and creating,

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:09.940
I can totally relate
to it, because I

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.642
work at a startup in San
Francisco named Brit + Co,

00:57:12.642 --> 00:57:14.100
I'm not sure if
you've heard of it.

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:14.540
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:14.780
Of course.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.690
AUDIENCE: So our tag
line is Live Creatively.

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:18.960
So it's like an
online community where

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:23.160
you can reach other people,
have women homemakers totally

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.650
create things.

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:27.670
So my question to
you would be that we

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.460
have so many ideas in our
minds and so many things to do.

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:34.000
You have a 9:00 to 5:00 job,
you want to work out in the gym,

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.620
you want to go home and
create something, cook food.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.640
So how do you go
about time management?

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.495
How do you set your priorities?

00:57:41.495 --> 00:57:43.499
GABRIELLA LEVINE: It's hard.

00:57:43.499 --> 00:57:45.540
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: There's
so many things to do.

00:57:48.929 --> 00:57:51.095
GABRIELLA LEVINE: Kate and
I were talking about this

00:57:51.095 --> 00:57:51.636
this morning.

00:57:51.636 --> 00:57:54.200
Sometimes some
things come up where

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.530
you're doing a
particular project that

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:58.500
makes everything else go away.

00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.310
Is that OK?

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:01.000
For some people,
it might not be.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.310
But one thing for me, when
we're talking about making

00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:13.710
and how does everybody make
something become a DIY,

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:15.840
something that's
helped me is to say,

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.380
OK, I know I can't do this
five days a week after work

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.410
for ten hours or five hours.

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:23.080
What if I just
start really simply.

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.070
I'm going to block
out two hours of time,

00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:30.500
do something really simple, like
learn some tool or something

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.180
that I've always
wanted to do, like fix

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.970
the drain in my bathtub, instead
of calling someone, let me try

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.960
and do this myself
because it might

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.720
feel good to actually do it.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.540
Look online, how do you fix
the drain in the bathtub.

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:44.220
And just to do something
that's small barriers

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.700
to entry, small goals.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.110
And then for me, it
incites this passion

00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:53.220
that allows me to build
that more into my schedule.

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.350
So it's just starting off
with small increments,

00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:58.800
and then, if you
like that, it's been

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:02.610
more easy for me to say, no, I
can't go get a drink tonight.

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:06.845
I have this excitement to finish
this robot snake prototype.

00:59:06.845 --> 00:59:08.220
KIMBERLY SHERIFF:
For me, I think

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.720
what helps is making a
date with someone else

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:12.950
to work on something.

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:16.490
And maybe we're going to work
on our own things side-by-side.

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:19.300
Some friends have
started a Work Wednesday

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:22.960
where they have a
gallery space and machine

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:25.150
shop in a warehouse in Oakland.

00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:27.540
And so every couple
Wednesdays, we'll

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.620
all get together and work
together in the same space,

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.180
but on our own projects.

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.110
And I love that
they started this,

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:37.700
because it holds me accountable
to come make something

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:42.700
and to schedule that art making
that I might not prioritize

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.120
above doing my job and
getting my work done

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.740
and having a relationship
and making good food

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:51.480
and getting exercise
and all of those things.

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:53.920
You have to block it
off and hold yourself

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.985
accountable to someone else.

00:59:56.985 --> 00:59:59.360
It helps me to not just
be accountable to myself,

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.250
but to be accountable
to other people

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:05.170
are to ask for help
on a project where

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:07.620
I need to learn a new
skill from someone else.

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.520
So I'm going to set a
date with them where

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.936
they're going to come over,
I'm going to cook them dinner,

01:00:11.936 --> 01:00:15.160
and then they're going to help
me with the Arduino project.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.770
That's how I make art.

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:20.840
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So we
have just a few seconds left,

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.610
and I actually want to use
those few last seconds to give

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.660
a huge round of applause
for our awesome panelists.
