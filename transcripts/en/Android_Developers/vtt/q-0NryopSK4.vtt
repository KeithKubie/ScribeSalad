SARAH THOMSON: So I'm
going to be starting you

00:00:02.476 --> 00:00:06.730
off here with some of the
latest and greatest tools

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.510
that we have.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.399
So I'm going to take you
on a bit of a journey here.

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:15.940
Bear with me.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.730
This is going to be
fast and furious,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.292
and I'm going to be throwing
a lot of information at you.

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:26.250
And a lot of it's going
to be quite high-level.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.810
The idea here is to kind
of get this on your radar

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.620
if you've not heard
of these tools yet.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.340
Some of them maybe
you're already using.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.590
And we'll be talking a little
bit about best practices

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.710
as well.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.465
But essentially, envision
this being a buffet.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:45.890
I'm going to set up a variety
of dishes and tasty treats.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.400
Some of it you might like;
some of it you might not like.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.650
And it's completely up
to you as to what you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.920
think will benefit
you and your team

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.270
to make the best game
you possibly can.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.560
So here, you'll see we're going
to be talking about pre-launch,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.520
launch window, and post-launch.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.230
So first, we'll dive
into pre-launch.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.370
And this is where I'm going to
be spending quite a bit of time

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.200
because, really,
here's where you

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.920
are going to be forging in the
fire to create your best game.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.750
This is where you're going
to be doing a lot of testing.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.850
You're going to be iterating a
lot, making a lot of mistakes,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.270
learning from it.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.300
So here's the
opening mantra that I

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.810
wanted to throw at you, which
is test earlier, test wider,

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.290
test better.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.120
So maybe the first and the
third feel comfortable for you

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.890
as a small team.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.010
Maybe the middle
one not so much.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.460
So this is something that we've
been advocating for for teams

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.910
of all kinds of sizes because
we've built a lot of tools

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.050
that allow you to do this.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.530
And there's a benefit to test
wider, which, hopefully, means

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.660
you're doing a lot
of problem-solving

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.310
and eliminating those unforeseen
issues that pop up once you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.889
have launched, and, perhaps,
you didn't test as widely

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.530
as you thought you did.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.260
So first let us start
with internal testing.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.030
This is a really great
way and a great tool

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.960
to use for your team.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.810
This is team testing.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.420
This allows you to
launch a new build

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.930
within seconds versus hours.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.580
Very fast iteration, you're
getting different builds

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.084
out several times
a day, if needed,

00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:41.000
if you're doing quick
fixes, and you're really

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.050
addressing that
foundational stuff early on.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.680
Next, we move to closed testing.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.500
This is where you
broaden out a little bit

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.840
to maybe your highest engaged
users, those who are really

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.600
excited about your game, maybe
friends and family as well.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.840
And here's where you can
start getting a sense of what

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.520
your gamers are telling you.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.940
This is very
foundational feedback

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.180
that you're getting initially
from a very small set

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.100
of your user base.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.770
This is also known
as closed beta.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.950
So here we have our friends
at Butterscotch Shenanigans

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.980
talking about their experience.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.920
And essentially, this
has been crucial for them

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.130
in targeting those
bugs and those

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.100
crashes so that they're
launching a product

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.140
that they feel confident about.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.610
They feel good about it.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.730
And the tool really
facilitates that for them.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.640
What this also
does for you is it

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.610
allows you to start
getting a little bit more

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.110
of that wider testing in there,
a wider variety of users.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.130
So you're getting a
spectrum of feedback.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.770
Closed testing also is
great because it gives you

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.320
a chance to not have any
kind of ratings effects.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.030
So if you're
wanting to take big,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.600
bold moves around
feature testing--

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.830
one of your team members
has a crazy idea,

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.360
and you want to
throw it out there

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.420
into the wild within
this particular audience,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.790
this is a great
place to do that.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.370
So who's heard of early access?

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.880
Has anyone been part of the
Early Access program on Play?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.020
Great.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.040
OK.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.070
So this is our official program.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.580
This is a program that you
actually have to apply for.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.590
And this is open beta
that is officialized

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.810
as a program on Play.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.889
And the difference
between open beta,

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.680
which I'll be speaking
to right after this,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.600
which anyone can do, you
don't have to apply for--

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.350
is that this gives you an
opportunity to actually

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.600
be featured on the store.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.450
And the next slide will
also talk about what

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.530
that collection looks like.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.960
So when you actually apply for
this, and if you get accepted,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.870
you are then merchandised on
the store as an unreleased game.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.800
So this is a great way to
get visibility and start

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.340
funneling users for free
into your game-- really

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.660
great for indies.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.510
I know a lot of indies
just don't have UA budget,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.100
or it's very
minimal, or you have

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.550
to be very strategic
about where you use that.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.610
And this is an opportunity
to give you that leg up

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.100
and get that visibility.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.650
The important caveat around this
program is that your APK cannot

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.700
have been in production at
all in any country if you want

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.950
to actually be a
part of Early Access.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.540
So they're always
experimenting to see

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.025
how they can get as many gamers
into your game as possible.

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:46.400
But at the end of
the day, you're

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.220
getting really great
visibility around that.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.630
And so here's our Iron Horse,
who we have with us today,

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.740
who was talking about how
instrumental this has been

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.180
to launching their games,
especially, in that beta phase

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.170
and getting users
into their games early

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.110
and how incredibly useful
that's been for them.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.120
And Mike will
actually be speaking

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.460
on a panel a little
bit later today.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.250
And I'm sure this topic
will come up as well.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.080
And feel free to ask him
questions about that.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.430
And so this is open beta.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.380
So let's say you spend
some time in Early Access.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.420
You got some really
great visibility.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.750
You're not quite ready
to fully launch yet.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.930
This is an opportunity
to then move over

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.740
into that next
phase of open beta.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.770
And again, this is where you
can have a lot of freedom

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.330
to still be doing testing to
get a sense of what's working

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.610
and what isn't and not have
any consequences of ratings.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.440
So the thing about
Google Play is

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.080
that, if you have a rating
at this stage in the game,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.410
it does stick with your
overall average rating.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.310
So it's really
important to iterate

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.340
as much as you can before full
launch when the ratings really

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.650
do start mattering.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.180
And this gives
you an opportunity

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.450
to make those mistakes and not
have those consequences show up

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.440
on your user rating.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.640
OK.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.710
So to sum it all
up, here are all

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.670
of those phases I mentioned.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.050
You start off very fast, very
iterative with your own team,

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.792
working out the fundamentals.

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:29.500
Then you can broaden
it out a little bit,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.610
closed testing with a very
small group of your user base,

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.250
get some really good
detailed feedback.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.490
Then you can move into
Early Access if you wish.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.620
Start getting some
visibility around your game

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.870
in that unreleased phase.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.450
And then, lastly,
you can transition

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.260
into open beta or open
testing and really

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.210
broaden it out as
wide as you can

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.830
before you go into full launch.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.280
So one little thought
starter that I'd

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.210
like to plant in your mind
is continuously evaluate

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.040
your process.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.420
Teams of all sizes--

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.640
this is not just
an indie thing--

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.180
we've seen large teams
get stuck in ruts

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.630
around how they develop games.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.130
And I think it's really
easy to get into a pattern

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.100
and get into a habit, and
it becomes solidified.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.490
As we all know, mobile is
still moving stupid fast.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.930
There's a lot of change.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.770
There's a lot of
volatility in this market.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.610
And Android, Google is always
launching new tools for you.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.586
So always look at how you can
optimize your own process.

00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:37.919
Because, at the end of the
day, this is your opportunity

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.720
to make the best game you can.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.740
And I want you to be
successful and Play

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.411
wants you to be successful.

00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:46.910
OK.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.470
So now we're in launch window.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.370
So here are a couple of things
I'll be touching on quickly

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.010
that will give you some thought
starters and things to check

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.150
out maybe, I'd say, one or
two months before your launch.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:09.700
So maybe we can make you 100%
confident, maybe not 100%,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.340
maybe way more confident than
you have been in the past.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.450
I remember what that
was like to launch games

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.040
and how nerve-wracking that
was and watching user ratings

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.930
and watching the stats
from the Play Console

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.330
or from the backend of whatever
platform you've launched on.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.440
So hopefully, we can
minimize those stress points.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.800
Here we are-- device catalog
and pre-registration.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.560
Does anyone use
the device catalog?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.896
Raise your hands.

00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:43.820
A couple.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.550
Oh, great.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.440
This is an opportunity
for you all.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.161
This is exciting.

00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:47.660
OK.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:53.630
So one of the great
things about Android

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.450
is that you can
reach a lot of users.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.830
We have a huge variety
of devices out there.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.630
The reach is incredible.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.420
Now, we all know the
downside of that.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.280
Fragmentation can be
a bit of a nightmare,

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.550
especially, when you
are very small team.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.320
It's very intimidating,
and it's quite unruly.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.660
So I encourage you all to
check out the device catalog

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.210
because what this is
is knowledge for you.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.720
And knowledge is power.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.110
And essentially, what
the device catalog is is,

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.221
within the Play Console--

00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:31.720
this is something
each and every one

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.360
of you can access from
your own Play Console--

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.270
is you can see a
list of thousands

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.610
of devices, Android devices,
with a ton of really great

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.570
granular detail.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.960
And I'll show you an example
of what that screen looks like.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.860
And this is here because
we want to really reduce

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.560
those pain points of the
fragmentation of the ecosystem.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.160
But also, too, I would
challenge you all

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.570
to try to support as
many devices as you can.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:06.010
One thing that I hear that is
fairly common across indies

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:11.380
is that there's this
really great desire

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.310
to want to get your game into
as many players hands, which

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.560
I think is a really
beautiful thing to achieve.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.505
And I would hate to see you
limited by that, by devices.

00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:24.880
And of course, that's going
to depend on the game, right?

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.620
There's certain
games that you just

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.320
can't run on certain devices.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.820
So start wide.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.880
Start as broad as you
can, which will feel very

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.490
scary and counterintuitive.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.060
But really, what you're able to
do then is, once you launch--

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.680
or once you have your game
running on as many devices

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:50.620
as you can, you can then go into
the Detail pages, right here.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:57.130
And you can see things like
RAM, screen size, density--

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.620
all sorts of really
great details

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.710
around the specs
of those devices.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:07.600
And icing on top of that
is you can see, actually,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.540
how your game is
doing from a sales

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.020
perspective on those devices.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.570
And it's interesting to hear
how many developers that

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.770
are using the device catalog are
very surprised by how there's

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.130
some segment or
grouping of devices

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.040
that they just weren't
aware of or had no idea

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.120
that their game was
performing quite well

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.870
and that there was an
opportunity for them

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.450
to optimize and make
that experience better.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.980
So this is your
chance to, not only

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.470
serve as many gamers
as you possibly can

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.350
in the rich ecosystem
that is Android,

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.200
but also gives you
the power to provide

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.200
a consistent and fun
experience no matter

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.460
which device they're on.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.160
So just to recap a
little bit about that.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.650
Try to support as many
devices as you can.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:59.910
Use that knowledge.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.490
Empower yourself with
everything the device catalog

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.130
is giving you.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.050
And then really laser
cut out those devices

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.770
that that information it's
telling you is not working.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.660
And try to do it temporarily.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.880
Some you may not ever
be able to support.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.340
But there may be
some that you just

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.970
had written off that you could
revisit and address later on.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.860
So again, you're
broadening your user base.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:31.280
Next, pre-registration--
pre-registration an opportunity

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.920
for you to build hype.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.500
This is you getting a page up
on the store that allows gamers

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.530
to A, know that your game
is coming before you're even

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.580
launched, gives them a little
bit of information about what

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.890
your game is about, and allows
them to click on the sign

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.660
up now button.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.970
And they will then
get a notification

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.620
when your game launches.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.940
It's a great way to see
and anticipate interest

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.060
so that you can have an
understanding of how--

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.770
if you are in tandem, in
closed beta or open beta--

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.810
it gives you an
opportunity to understand

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.250
how to maybe manage your UA
or your community-building

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.970
efforts.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.490
This is a very
useful tool that way.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.870
Then here are some
best practices

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.510
that we recommend in
terms of time frame.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.910
So anywhere from
three to eight weeks--

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.030
I actually think the sweet
spot is about a month.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.630
And give yourself a
chance to plan for this.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.780
So pre-registration-- I'm going
to be speaking a little bit

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.790
more on this in a second.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.840
This is actually not
available to everyone yet.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.340
And I have a caveat for
that just for everyone

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.417
here in the room today.

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:47.750
But this is something you do
actually have to apply for,

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.860
much like early access.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.700
It's a program.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.400
It's a very specific
program that you

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.490
have to submit a request for.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.210
So as I just alluded
to and teased on,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.190
you will be receiving
some information

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.870
after this event via
email about those of you

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.200
who have not been part of
the Early Access program

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:14.750
around this.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.370
You will actually be able to
apply for pre-registration

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.700
before we fully launch it
by the end of the year.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.380
So keep your eye out for that.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.500
This is a really cool
tool and opportunity

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.420
for you to be a
part of something

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.790
before we launch it to
the community at large.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.290
OK.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.930
Now let's head into post-launch.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.090
So we'll be talking about
a couple things here.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.890
We're going to be talking
about an insights page, which

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.550
is actually quite new as
a feature and very useful

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.230
as well as Play Instant.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.210
And then I'll touch
very lightly on vitals.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.160
This is actually something Ben
is going to talk a little bit

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.150
more about later.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:58.830
OK.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:01.450
So where are your
players coming from?

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.910
This is a question
that we would--

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.550
or a feature that we would
get requested on the regular

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.270
by developers big
and small, which is,

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.920
can you please
give us visibility

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.760
into how people are
finding us on the store?

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.480
Here you go.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.930
This is how you
can check that out.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.990
This breaks it down in
terms of search terms,

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.150
gives you a sense
of how people are

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.980
finding their way to your
game on the Play Store--

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.242
very useful tool.

00:16:31.242 --> 00:16:32.700
Here's one of our
developers saying

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.910
that it's just been an
incredible insight for them

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.950
and has really allowed
them to figure out

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:42.330
how to optimize their
description pages

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.750
and how to leverage
search words as best

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.120
as possible to the
advantage of gamers

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.360
being able to find their
game on the Play Store.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.460
So then how can you actually
get more users into your game?

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.410
We have Play Instant.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.330
This is a piece of technology
that we've optimized for games,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.369
specifically, just recently.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.460
And this gives
gamers an opportunity

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.400
to play a small
segment of your game

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.599
without downloading anything.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.810
Ostensibly, what it does is it
puts a try now button on there

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.660
once you've
implemented that API.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:26.329
And this is a really great way
to break down that friction.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.310
Especially if you
make paid games--

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.980
highly recommend this.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.220
Here's some information around
what kind of conversion rates

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.640
we're seeing around user
acquisition for indie games,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.820
specifically.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.820
This is early days.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.140
We just have game developers
starting to implement

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.610
this in the past few months.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:53.110
So we're seeing anywhere
from 8% to 20% UA uplift.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.400
And here's a bunch of ways that
you can actually funnel people

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.900
into your instant game.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.420
So we have it
implemented into ads.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.700
We have deep links.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.070
There's a place on the
store, a collection that's

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.780
dedicated to this--

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.020
a lot of really great ways
to leverage this-- highly

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.250
recommend it.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:17.810
Here's some more information
for you around instant games.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.640
Give you guys a
chance take a picture.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.160
All right.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.470
Vitals-- Vitals is something
that will give you a snapshot

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.630
into the health of your game--

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.220
crash rates, wake
locks, things like that.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.550
We want to be able to give
you that very quick picture

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.510
into how your game is performing
and how users are experiencing

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:47.450
your game and where you
can actually troubleshoot.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:52.340
So Subway Surfers, who's
wildly popular game on Play,

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.110
they have been using it.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.470
And just recently, they were
able to address a crash that

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.830
was coming out of nowhere and
allowed them to fix that really

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.090
quickly--

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.550
definitely take a look at that.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.050
OK.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.440
Whoo.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.930
So there's the buffet for you.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.570
That's everything we
quickly went through.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.860
So some final thoughts--

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.076
I know that was a lot.

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:16.950
I know that was kind of
information overload.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:21.162
But I would invite you
to really pick and choose

00:19:21.162 --> 00:19:22.620
what's going to
work for your team.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.490
Not everything will
apply, and that's OK.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.510
It's really your choice into
what you would like to use.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.190
But don't be afraid of change.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.740
And don't be afraid
to try something new.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.550
I know that the Console can be
quite overwhelming because we

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.410
have so many great tools.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.200
And it's a lot.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.700
Give it a try.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.280
And here are some
more resources for you

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.810
for that really quick high
touch that I just gave you.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.840
Here's where you can do a
deep dive into those features.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.850
There's a lot to learn.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.040
There's a bunch that
I didn't even mention.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.730
So here are your resources.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.740
And here's where
you can get updates.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.870
Thanks, everyone.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.920
Appreciate that.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.970
