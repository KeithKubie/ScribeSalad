just trying to figure out the best way

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790
just trying to figure out the best way
 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.850

two trees we want to show maybe a nice

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
two trees we want to show maybe a nice
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.109

which we've seen a lot on life below
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950
which we've seen a lot on life below
zero a lot of tree cuttings so it's kind

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
zero a lot of tree cuttings so it's kind
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.569
zero a lot of tree cuttings so it's kind
of unique to try to figure out maybe

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579
of unique to try to figure out maybe
 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.130

just how to do it a little different

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
just how to do it a little different
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.109
just how to do it a little different
each time the idea of the time-lapse is

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
each time the idea of the time-lapse is
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.779
each time the idea of the time-lapse is
not to interrupt the flow it's a great

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789
not to interrupt the flow it's a great
 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.819

zero we're always trying to think of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
zero we're always trying to think of
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.980
zero we're always trying to think of
just something different at some point

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
just something different at some point
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.300
just something different at some point
I'll put the drone up and we'll cut the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
I'll put the drone up and we'll cut the
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520
I'll put the drone up and we'll cut the
trees we'll put a GoPro on the saw we'll

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
trees we'll put a GoPro on the saw we'll
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440
trees we'll put a GoPro on the saw we'll
do all that so this is just a different

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
do all that so this is just a different
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.230
do all that so this is just a different
way to just capture a different look to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
way to just capture a different look to
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.660

it we're working outside all the time

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
it we're working outside all the time
 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.459
it we're working outside all the time
and we covered a lot but variety is

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469
and we covered a lot but variety is
 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.529

important you kind of give it make it

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539
important you kind of give it make it
 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.849
important you kind of give it make it
more dynamic you know you can see

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859
more dynamic you know you can see
 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:45.499

but the more we can do with different

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
but the more we can do with different
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.459
but the more we can do with different
angles different camera placement it's

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469
angles different camera placement it's
 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.590
angles different camera placement it's
getting creative and doing our best to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
getting creative and doing our best to
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.539
getting creative and doing our best to
make it look different each episode so

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
make it look different each episode so
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.370
make it look different each episode so

those branches maybe

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670
those branches maybe
 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.130
those branches maybe

so we'll get like a little reveal with

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730
so we'll get like a little reveal with
 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.610
