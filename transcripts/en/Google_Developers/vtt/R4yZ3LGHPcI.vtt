AARON WHEELER: My name
is Aaron Wheeler.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.700
I'm a UX prototyper at Google.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.350
At the end of 2011, I

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.210
participated in the Dart hackathon.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.130
I thought it should be easy to
transfer my knowledge of

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.920
JavaScript to Dart, so I
started taking notes.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.650
And my notes grew into a
spreadsheet, and then the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.750
spreadsheet grew in my
hackathon entry.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.390
I built a website in Dart that
ingests a Google spreadsheet

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.280
JSON feed and pretty prints
the results in an easy to

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.420
browse website.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.450
Over the holidays, the idea
caught on with my friends

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.720
Marcin and Seth, who had
continued to contribute to the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.910
spreadsheet, and thus
the website.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.010
The momentum continued to grow,
the site received a

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.025
visual refresh, and the
comparisons were blessed by

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:32.905
the Dart team.

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:34.470
I'm excited that Dart
Synonym is really to

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.490
be shared with everyone.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.740
I hope you find it useful.
