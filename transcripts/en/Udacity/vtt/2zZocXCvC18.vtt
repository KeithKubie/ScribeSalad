00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's actually just draw the environments to make it a little easier.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's our global environment. x is 11, y is 22.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here's our new environment. It points up here. x is 33, z is 44.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A little abbreviated, but you get the idea.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So if I look up x in the new environment, the answer is right here: 33.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If I look up y in the global environment, the answer is similarly right there: 22.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now I'm going to update x in the new environment, and our procedure is,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
do we have a binding for x in the new environment?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We do, so we update that one.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now when I go to look up x in the new environment, there's an answer right here: 55.

00:00:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
When I go to look up x in the global environment, there's an answer right here: 11.
