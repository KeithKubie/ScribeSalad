00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.540
Let's explore the repercussions
of this

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.590
equation some more.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.810
So what was the equation?

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.300
It was that the force of a
magnetic field on a moving

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.220
charged particle is equal to the
charge-- that's not what I

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.860
wanted to do-- is equal to the
charge of the particle-- and

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.200
that's just a scalar quantity--
times the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.520
velocity-- the cross product
of the velocity of the

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.620
particle-- with the
magnetic field.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.550
Now, isn't the velocity vector
just the same thing as the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.000
distance vector divided
by time?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.370
So the velocity vector is equal
to-- let's call the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.280
distance that the electron
travels, l.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.620
Distance divided by time.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.180
So we could rewrite that, that
the force vector is equal to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.780
the charge times-- and I'm doing
this on purpose-- 1 over

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.600
time, right?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.720
Times the distance vector
taken-- you take the cross

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.530
product with the
magnetic field.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.730
All I did is I rewrote velocity
as per time times

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.140
distance, or distance
per time.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.950
And this is a scalar quantity,
at least for our purposes,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.890
time only has a magnitude.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.660
Maybe we could call
it change in time.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.850
But it doesn't have
a direction.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.470
We're not going at
an angle in time.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.120
So we could take the scalar
quantity out.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.110
It doesn't affect this
vector cross product.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.440
So what we get left with is,
force is equal to charge per

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.250
time times-- and this is just a
regular times, because this

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.010
is just a number, it's not a
vector-- times the cross

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.420
product of the distance vector
and the magnetic field.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.840
And what is charge per time?

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.350
Coulombs per second?

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.770
Well, that's just current.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.790
So we get that force is equal to
current times the distance

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.199
that the current is flowing
along, taken-- and you take

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.930
the cross product of that
with the magnetic field.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.160
And sometimes this is written as
a capital L because it's a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.940
vector and all that, but we
started with a lower case l,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.660
so we'll stay with
the lower case l.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.750
So let's see if we can apply
this formula, which is really

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.580
the same thing as this.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.800
We just took the division by
time and took it out of

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.380
velocity so we get distance.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.660
And we took it and we divided
the coulombs, or we took the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.070
charge divided by that.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.470
So we took charge divided by
time, or charge per unit of

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.770
time, you get current.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.000
So this is really just another
way of writing this.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.710
It's not even a new formula.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.100
You could almost prove
it to yourself if

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.510
you ever forget it.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.420
But let's see if we can use this
to figure out the effect

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.330
that a magnetic field has on
a current carrying wire.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.520
So let me-- actually, I probably
want to put this up

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.550
at the top, just so that I have
space to draw a current

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.355
carrying wire.

00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:05.640
So let me rewrite it in green.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.220
So you're familiar with the
formula in all colors.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.680
So now our new derivation is
that the force of a magnetic

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.280
field on a current carrying wire
is equal to the current

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.770
in the wire-- and that's just a
scalar quantity, although it

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.760
could be positive or negative
depending on the direction.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.400
Well, current is always a
positive number, but if this

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.650
current is going in the opposite
direction as our

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.040
distance vector, then it
might be negative.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.810
But I wouldn't worry
about that for now.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.530
Let's just assume this is a
current in the direction of

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.080
the distance vector.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.210
So it's a scalar quantity
current times our distance

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.200
vector l, or maybe the length
of the conductor.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.650
You take the cross product
of l with the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.980
magnetic field vector.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.360
So let's see if we
can apply that.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.430
Let's say that we have a wire.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.070
Actually, let's do the magnetic
field first. I've

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.130
been doing a lot of magnetic
fields that

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.490
pop out of the screen.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.810
Let's do a magnetic field that
goes into the screen.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.310
And those are even
easier to draw.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.080
They're just x's.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.550
Now, why is it an x?

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.750
Because you're looking at the
rear end of an arrow.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.720
That's why it's an x.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.740
And that's why a circle with a
dot means a field or a vector

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.420
coming out of the window.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.750
Because if an arrow was shot at
you, all you would see is

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.350
the tip of the arrow
with maybe a little

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.140
circle around it.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.160
But anyway, this shows us a
vector going into the screen.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.430
So this is our magnetic field.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.970
That is B.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.620
I don't know, let's
assign some value.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:49.200
Let's say that the magnitude
of B is equal to 1 tesla.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.140
And let's say I have a
wire going through

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.300
that magnetic field.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.400
Let's say the wire is going
along or it's in the plane of

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.800
your computer monitor.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:15.280
Let me just draw a wire going
through the magnetic field.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.210
And my question to you-- let
me tell you a little bit of

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.620
information about this wire.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.050
Let's say the wire is
carrying a current.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.670
So I is going in
that direction.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.410
And it is carrying a current
of-- I'm just making up

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.330
numbers-- 5 amperes, or
5 coulombs per second.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.060
My question to you is, what is
the net force of this magnetic

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.550
field on a section
of this wire?

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.370
And let's make this section of
the wire, I don't know, let's

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.190
say it's a 2 meter
section of wire.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.720
So obviously the more wire you
have, the more charged moving

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.390
particles you'll have. So the
larger a section you have, the

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.960
more of a force you'll have on
that longer piece of wire.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.540
So we have to pick our length.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.610
So we want to know, what is
the force of the magnetic

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.970
field on this section of wire?

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.590
From here to here.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.910
So let's just go to
this formula.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.200
The force is equal
to the current.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.760
So that's 5 amperes.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.320
And remember, just from what we
learned about electricity,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.390
the current is the direction
that notional positive charges

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.090
would travel in, and
suits us fine.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.830
Because when we did the first
equation, we cared about the

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.360
direction a positive
charge would go in.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.770
And if it was an electron or a
negative charge, we would put

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.630
a negative sign there.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.570
So that works fine.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.850
But if you ever have to
visualize things as they maybe

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.260
are in reality, but when you
talk about electrons it's hard

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.130
to say that they really are
reality, because they're

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.310
almost more an idea
than an object.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.760
But it's always good to remember
that when the current

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.170
is flowing in this direction,
that would be true.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.820
Because if they were positive
charges moving, but we know

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.150
it's a negative charge moving
in the opposite direction.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.960
Or you can think of it
as, maybe, holes.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.490
Well, I don't want
to get into that.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.130
But anyway, the current-- you
could visualize it if you like

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.770
as positive charges going
in this direction.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.650
So the current is going
this direction.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.170
So you could view this
distance vector

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.490
that we care about.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.670
Its magnitude is 2 meters.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.990
Because that's the length
of wire in question.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.700
And its direction is the
direction of the current.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.110
So let me-- this is l.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.990
Sometimes I get a little carried
away on tangents.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.280
So that is l.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.100
It's 2 meters in
that direction.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.660
I is 5 amperes.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.050
And we already figured
out that the

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.910
magnetic field is 1 tesla.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.950
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:52.180
So the force is going to be
equal to-- we're using all SI

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.110
units, so we don't have to
convert anything-- 5 amperes

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:02.840
times 2 meters in
that direction.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.030
I won't specify right now,
let's just say that's a

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.540
magnitude of l.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.530
Actually, let me write it.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:18.220
Well, 2 meters times the
magnetic field, 1 tesla.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.350
And so when you take a cross
product of something, this is

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.290
just a reminder.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.050
l cross B.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:29.130
That's equal to the magnitude of
l times the magnitude of B

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:35.700
times the sine of the angle
between them times some unit

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.299
directional vector that
we figure out with

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.480
the right hand rule.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.870
So we already did
the magnitude of

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:41.580
the distance vector.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.460
That was 2 meters.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.590
We did the magnitude of
the magnetic field.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.910
And what's the sine of the
angle between them?

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.970
Well, if the magnetic field is
going into the screen, if it's

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.690
going straight into the screen,
you could imagine a

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.550
bunch of arrows shooting
into the screen.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.930
Those are the vectors.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:02.990
While our distance vector, or
this l is in the screen, they

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.980
actually are perpendicular,
in 3 dimensions.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.580
So this angle is 90 degrees.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.400
So this actually
just becomes 1.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.280
So in terms of the magnitude,
we're done.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.250
The l cross B magnitude
is 2 times 1 tesla.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.030
And then we multiply that
times the current.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.360
And then we actually have the
magnitude of the force.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.900
The magnitude of this force is
going to be equal to 5 amperes

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.570
times 2 meters times 1 tesla.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.090
Which is equal to 10 newtons.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.980
And then the only question left
is, what is the direction

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.400
of the force that the magnetic
field is exerting?

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.360
And this is where we break
out the right hand rule.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.220
And it's no different.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:44.980
You could just imagine one of
the positive particles moving

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.950
in that direction, and just
use the right hand rule.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.450
So let's take our hand out.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.670
And if we-- let me
draw a hand.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.840
A right hand.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.400
So this is my right hand.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.500
If I have my thumb sticking
out like that.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.550
So the l is going to
be my index finger.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.910
The first thing in the
cross product.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.610
And then the B is the
magnetic field.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.980
That's going into the screen.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.210
So you can't see it.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.710
All you can take my word for it
is that my middle finger is

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.390
pointed downwards into the
screen and then my other

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.700
fingers are just doing
something else.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.100
And there you have it.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.760
Your thumb is actually the
direction of the force.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:31.150
Your index finger is the
direction of-- we'll say l for

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.180
these purposes.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.430
And then the magnetic field is
going into it, so you can't

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.250
see my middle finger but it's
pointing downwards.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.780
I could draw a little x there,
to show it's going downwards.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.100
And then the force is what
my thumb is doing.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.400
So the force on this wire, or
at least on that section of

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.630
wire, is going to be
perpendicular to the direction

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.830
of the current.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.290
And that direction is going
to be a 10 newton force.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.790
Anyway, I've run out of time.
