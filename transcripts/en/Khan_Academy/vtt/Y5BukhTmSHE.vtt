00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.870
We're on problem 60.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.060
Given the equation y is equal
to x to the n where x is

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.920
greater than 0 and n is
less than 0, which

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.340
statement is valid?

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.860
So let's see, x is greater than
0 and n is less than 0.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.420
So the exponent is negative,
but the base is positive.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.860
So I'll just tell
you right now.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.510
Your gut reaction might be to
say, oh, if I have a negative

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.070
exponent, maybe I somehow
end up with a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.600
negative number somehow.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.140
But you have to remember, a
negative exponent, it just

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.930
tells you that it's really
just the inverse of the

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.760
positive exponent.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.320
So this is equal to 1 over
x to the minus n.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.000
And if n is less than
0, then minus n is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.080
greater than 0, right?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.510
So you could say this is the
same thing as 1 over x to some

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.490
other letter m, where m is minus
m, but then m would be

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.540
greater than 0, right?

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.720
So no matter how negative this
exponent is, especially if

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.890
this base is positive, you're
going to end up with a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.580
positive number.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.769
You're going to end up with very
small fractions if this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.370
gets large enough.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.550
It could be 1 over x to the
hundredth power or something.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.350
So it could be a very
small number.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.980
It can approach zero.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.410
But it will always be
a positive number.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.250
So y is always going to
be greater than 0.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.050
Choice A.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.820
Problem 61.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.420
If x is a real number, which
best describes the value of x

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.290
for which the inequality
the square root of x

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.520
greater than 0 is true?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.640
So I'm assuming we're dealing
with the real numbers, and if

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.470
I get an imaginary number here,
it's actually just even

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.210
hard to compare it in terms
of magnitude to 0.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.610
So they're actually just asking
us what the domain is.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.540
What x's can we put in here and
get an answer where we can

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.220
make some type of sense
out of the statement?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.230
So obviously, I could put
a positive x here.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.010
x could be greater than 0.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.330
Any x greater than 0 will
have a square root.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.280
And all of their square roots
will be greater than 0.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.490
I mean, you could square both
sides of that equation and you

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.390
get x is greater than 0.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.280
You could put x is equal to 0
there, but then the inequality

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.450
wouldn't be true, right?

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.280
Because the square root
of 0 is equal to 0.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.420
So if you put x is equal to 0
there, that would work, you

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.870
can take the square root of 0,
but it just won't make the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.770
inequality true.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.000
So x can't be equal to 0.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.870
So x can be greater than 0.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.860
It can't be greater than
or equal to 0.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.420
Not all values of x work.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.590
I can't put a negative
number in there.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.400
I mean, they say
no values of x.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.900
No, sure.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.720
We can put any positive number
there that works.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.060
So the answer is A.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.290
Next problem.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.100
Let me turn the page.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.210
Let me copy and paste.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.760
Which of the following
conclusions is true about the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.820
statement below: x squared is
equal to the square root of x.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.030
All right, so once again,
let's think

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.080
about it a little bit.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.360
x squared is equal to the
square root of x.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.790
I mean, it definitely works for
the number 1 and it works

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.300
for the number 0.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.170
If you square both sides of that
equation, you get x to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.110
the fourth is equal to x.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.760
x could be equal to 0, but if
you assume that x does not

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.820
equal 0, you could divide both
sides of this equation by x

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.220
and you get x to the third
is equal to 1.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.970
And the only number that
I know works for that

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.240
is the number 1.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.530
But anyway, the statement
is always true.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.730
No, it's not always true.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.130
I put a 2 there.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.980
Is 2 squared equal to the
square root of 2?

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.740
No, 4 does not equal the
square root of 2.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.940
So the statement is
not always true.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.415
The statement is true
when x is negative.

00:03:58.415 --> 00:03:59.700
No, x can't even be negative.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.150
You can't take the square root
of a negative number.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.400
You'd end up with imaginary
numbers and it

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.600
just gets very strange.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.220
The statement is true when
x is equal to 0.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.740
Sure.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.890
It could be 0.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.520
The statement is never true.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.930
No.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.040
Clearly, it's true when x is
equal to 0 or x is equal to 1.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.070
So the answer is C.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.190
I didn't even have to do this
stuff on the side right here.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.440
But, hopefully, it
was instructive.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.210
Next problem.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.520
I copied it now I
have pasted it.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.620
All right.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.450
Let me try with the
larger pen.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.140
Abelardo wants to create several
different 7-character

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.060
screen names.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.990
He wants to use arrangements of
the first three letters of

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.280
his first name, ABE-- that's
why they made his name

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.180
Abelardo-- followed by
arrangements of the 4 digits

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.860
in 1984, the year
of his birth.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.180
How many different screen
names can he

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.370
create in this way?

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.950
All right, so he's got 7.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.510
So think about it.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.260
Let's just think about
each slot.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.830
So slot number 1-- that
pen's too fat.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.280
Slot number 1, slot number 1,
spot number 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.700
So slot number 1, how many
different choices

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.600
can he put in there?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.270
He can put in an A,
a B or an E there.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.440
So he has three different
choices for slot number 1 I'll

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.400
do that in a different color.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.350
He has three different choices
for slot number 1.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.600
Once he picks slot number 1, how
many choices does he have

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.730
left for slot number 2?

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.190
Well, he has two letters left
out of the A, B and E, right?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.410
So he has only two
options left.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.880
And once he gets to slot number
3, he has to just pick

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.190
whatever leftover letter
is there in A, B and E.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.310
So he only has one option.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.700
But then when he gets to fourth
digit, now he's trying

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.270
to pick from 1984.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.680
For the fourth digit, once he
has four options, he can pick

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.180
the 1, the 9, the 8 or the 4.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.080
He has four options.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.190
Then on the fifth digit, he
would have picked one of the

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.530
four, so he has three
of them left.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.760
By the sixth digit, he only
has two of them left.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.540
By the seventh digit, he's
forced to pick whatever's

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.530
leftover, what he hasn't
picked yet.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.850
He has one digit left.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.330
So the combinations, you just
multiply all of them.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.180
3 times 2 is 6 times 1 is 6.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.870
6 times 4 is 24.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.380
24 times 3 is 72.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.130
72 times 2 is 144
times 1 is 144.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.010
So there's 144 different
screen names he can

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.510
create in this way.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.760
Next problem.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:45.884
64.

00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:47.550
I've copied it.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.860
And now I'm pasting it.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.580
A train is made up of a
locomotive, seven different

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.520
cars and a caboose.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.780
If the locomotive must be first
and the caboose must be

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.520
last, how many different ways
can the train be ordered?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.350
So we don't even have
to worry about the

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.870
locomotive and the caboose.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.940
They're always going to be
in the same position.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.690
The locomotive's first, caboose
is last. So we just

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.170
have to worry about the seven
different cars, the order that

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.990
they're in.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.360
It's really the same problem
as the last one.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.320
In some ways, it's a
little bit easier.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.010
So let's just say that's
the position.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.615
Position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:28.320
And let's say we just have to
decide which car we put in

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.090
each position, or how many
different options do we have.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.660
So let's say we are filling
the slots starting with

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.340
position 1.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.770
Well, we have seven cars
to choose from.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.885
The seven is different
from them.

00:07:39.885 --> 00:07:42.000
That's not including the
locomotive and the caboose, so

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.330
we have seven cars
to pick from.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.310
We've picked one of them.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.780
Then in slot 2, we have
six cars to pick from.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.440
Slot 3, we have five cars to
pick from because we've

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.590
already picked two.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.890
And in slot 4, four
cars to pick from,

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.700
three cars, two cars.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.690
And then in slot 7, we've
already picked six of the

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.120
cars, so whatever's leftover,
we have to pick.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.220
So let's see what
this number is.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.990
1 times 2 is 2.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.080
2 times 3 is 6.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.600
6 times 4 is 24.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.510
24 times 5 is 120.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:18.550
120 times 6 is 720.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.080
720 times 7-- I'm just going
to have to do a little bit

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.850
multiplication here on the
side-- 720 times 7.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.140
7 times 0 is 0.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.000
7 times 2 is 14.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.940
7 times 7 is 49 plus 1 is 50.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.740
5,040.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.850
So there's 5,040 different
ways that the

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.100
train can be ordered.

00:08:42.977 --> 00:08:43.770
Let's see.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.020
Next problem.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.000
Maybe I'll just clear
all of this.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.130
All right.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:09:02.730
Let me copy the-- all right.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.240
Teresa and Julia are among 10
students who have applied for

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.460
a trip to Washington, D.C.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.460
Two students from the group
will be selected at

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.660
random for the trip.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.920
What is the probability that
Teresa and Julia will be the

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.220
two students selected?

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.160
So let's think about this.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.310
There are 10 students who have
applied for the trip.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.980
Two students from the group
will be selected at

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.040
random for the trip.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.390
What is the probability Teresa
and Julia will be the two

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.020
students selected?

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.680
All right, so let's think about
student 1 selected and

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.880
student 2 selected.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.500
What's the probability that
Teresa is the first student?

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.210
So what's the probably that we
get Teresa and then we get

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.630
Julia, that Teresa is the first
student selected and

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.080
that Julia is the second
student selected?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.380
Well, the probability that
Teresa is the first-- well,

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.260
let me take a step back.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.530
There's two ways that what
they want to happen could

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.930
happen, that Teresa and
Julia will be the

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.700
two students selected.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.820
Either Teresa is the first
student selected and then

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.650
Julia is the second; or Julia is
the first student selected

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.490
and Teresa is the second.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.790
So if we figure out the
probability of this happening

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.440
and the probability of this
happening, then we can just

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.770
add those probabilities together
and then we have the

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.020
probability of either
of those happening.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.420
All right, so let's do that.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.616
The probability of Teresa
happening is-- let me do this

00:10:22.616 --> 00:10:24.170
in a different color.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.790
There's 10 students, so there's
a probability that we

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.270
pick Teresa first. And then
once we've picked Teresa

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.550
first, the probability that we
pick Julia next, well, now

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.580
there's 9 students
left, right?

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.400
Because you've already picked
Teresa, so there's a 1 in 9

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.390
chance you pick Julia.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.900
So that is equal to 1 in 90.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.980
So there's a 1 in 90 chance
of this happening.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.120
There's a 1 in 90 chance
of that happening.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.080
And then what's the chance
of this happening?

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.610
What's the chance of
that happening?

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.440
Well, it's the same thing.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:00.170
This is 1 in 10 and this
is 1 in 90, right?

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.690
And so you have a 1 in 90
chance of it happening.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.370
And so, what is the probability
of either of these

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.310
things happening?

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.360
Of this combination or
this combination?

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.020
Well, you just add them
together, and you get 2 out of

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:20.970
90, which is equal to 1 out
of 45, which is choice A.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.160
And I'm out of time.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.070
See you in the next video.
