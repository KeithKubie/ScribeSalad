00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.660
So this red curve is
the graph of f of x.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.910
And this blue curve is
the graph of g of x.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.275
And I want to try to express
g of x in terms of f of x.

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:12.280
And so let's see
how they're related.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.750
So we pick any x.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.320
And we could start right
here at the vertex of f of x.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.520
And we see that, at least
at that point, g of x

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.260
is exactly 1 higher than that.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.200
So g of 2-- I could
write this down-- g of 2

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.130
is equal to f of 2 plus 1.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.149
Let's see if that's
true for any x.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.690
So then we can just
sample over here.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.310
Let's see, f of 4
is right over here.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.360
g of 4 is one more than that.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.840
f of 6 is right here.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.451
g of 6 is 1 more than that.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.700
So it looks like if we pick
any point over here-- even

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.100
though there's a little bit
of an optical illusion--

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.725
it looks like they
get closer together.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:59.659
They do if you look
try to find the closest

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:00.700
distance between the two.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.199
But if you look at
vertical distance

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.750
you see that it
stays a constant 1.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.545
So we can actually
generalize this.

00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:11.100
This is true for
any x. g of x is

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.850
equal to f of x is
equal to f of x plus 1.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.160
Let's do a few more
examples of this.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.920
So right over here, here
is f of x in red again,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.060
and here is g of x.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.400
And so let's say we picked
x equals negative 4.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.340
This is f of negative 4.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.890
And we see g of negative
4 is 2 less than that.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.630
And we see whatever f of
x is, g of x-- no matter

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.270
what x we pick-- g of x
seems to be exactly 2 less.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.000
g of x is exactly 2 less.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.820
So in this case, very
similar to the other one,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.310
g of x is going to
be equal to f of x.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.730
But instead of
adding, we're going

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.110
to subtract 2 from f
of x. f of x minus 2.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.020
Let's do a few more examples.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.020
So here we have f
of x in red again.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.460
I'll label it.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.520
f of x.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.009
And here is g of x.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.550
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.750
Let's pick an
arbitrary point here.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.760
Let's say we have in red here,
this point right over there

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.120
is the value of f of negative 3.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.570
This is negative 3.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.095
This is the point
negative 3, f of 3.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.675
Now g hits that same value
when x is equal to negative 1.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.890
So let's think about this.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.925
g of negative 1 is equal
to f of negative 3.

00:02:57.857 --> 00:02:59.690
And we could do that
with a bunch of points.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:07.632
We could see that g of 0, which
is right there-- let me do it

00:03:07.632 --> 00:03:10.490
in a color you can
see-- g of 0 is

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.130
equivalent to f of negative 2.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.800
So let me write that down.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.990
g of 0 is equal to
f of negative 2.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.100
We could keep doing that.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.980
We could say g of 1,
which is right over here.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.980
This is 1.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.790
g of 1 is equal to
f of negative 1.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.710
g of 1 is equal to
f of negative 1.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.930
So I think you see
the pattern here.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:55.350
g of whatever is equal to the
function evaluated at 2 less

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.630
than whatever is here.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:04.095
So we could say that g of
x is equal to f of-- well

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:05.930
it's going to be 2 less than x.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.954
So f of x minus 2.

00:04:08.954 --> 00:04:10.120
So this is the relationship.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.830
g of x is equal
to f of x minus 2.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.600
And it's important
to realize here.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.250
When I get f of x minus 2 here--
and remember the function is

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.500
being evaluated, this is the
input. x minus 2 is the input.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.340
When I subtract the 2, this
is shifting the function

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.200
to the right, which is a
little bit counter-intuitive

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.540
unless you go through this
exercise right over here.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.550
So g of x is equal
to f of x minus 2.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.480
If it was f of x plus 2 we
would have actually shifted

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.779
f to the left.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.070
Now let's think about this one.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.350
This one seems kind of wacky.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.647
So first of all,
g of x, it almost

00:04:46.647 --> 00:04:48.230
looks like a mirror
image but it looks

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.970
like it's been flattened out.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.010
So let's think of it this way.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.390
Let's take the mirror
image of what g of x is.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.900
So I'm going to try my best to
take the mirror image of it.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.524
So let's see...

00:04:57.524 --> 00:04:59.470
It gets to about
2 there, then it

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.310
gets pretty close to
1 right over there.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.100
And then it gets about
right over there.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.750
So if I were to take
its mirror image,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.530
it looks something like this.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.500
Its mirror image if I were to
reflect it across the x-axis.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.815
It looks something like this.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.840
So this right over
here we would call--

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.900
so if this is g of x,
when we flip it that way,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.950
this is the negative g of x.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.400
When x equals 4, g of
x looks like it's about

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.660
negative 3 and 1/2.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.139
You take the negative of
that, you get positive.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.680
I guess it should
be closer to here--

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.771
You get positive
3 and 1/2 if you

00:05:45.771 --> 00:05:47.270
were to take the
exact mirror image.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.690
So that's negative g of x.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.160
But that still doesn't get us.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.030
It looks like we
actually have to triple

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.710
this value for any point.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.680
And you see it here.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.400
This gets to 2, but
we need to get to 6.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.220
This gets to 1, but
we need to get to 3.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.590
So it looks like this
red graph right over here

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.840
is 3 times this graph.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.260
So this is 3 times
negative g of x,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.860
which is equal to
negative 3 g of x.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.660
So here we have f of x is equal
to negative 3 times g of x.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.330
And if we wanted to solve for
g of x, right-- g of x in terms

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.940
of f of x-- we would
write, dividing both sides

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:35.980
by negative 3, g of x is
equal to negative 1/3 f of x.
