monitor the traffic build up in each

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
monitor the traffic build up in each
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.549
monitor the traffic build up in each
direction in real-time and then turn

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
direction in real-time and then turn
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.520
