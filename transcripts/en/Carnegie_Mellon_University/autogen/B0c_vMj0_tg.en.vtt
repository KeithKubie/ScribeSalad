cognition and I design brain computer
interfaces and I use these devices to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160
interfaces and I use these devices to
 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.520
interfaces and I use these devices to
study motor learning and and motor

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530
study motor learning and and motor
 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.750
study motor learning and and motor
control we don't understand how your

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760
control we don't understand how your
 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.790
control we don't understand how your
brain controls your limb if we did we

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800
brain controls your limb if we did we
 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.040
brain controls your limb if we did we
could essentially make an arm that

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050
could essentially make an arm that
 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.960
could essentially make an arm that
looked as much like a limb as possible

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970
looked as much like a limb as possible
 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.580
looked as much like a limb as possible
we could just recreate that mapping and

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590
we could just recreate that mapping and
 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.840
we could just recreate that mapping and
you'd be off and running but we don't

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850
you'd be off and running but we don't
 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.520
you'd be off and running but we don't
understand that because limb control is

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530
understand that because limb control is
 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.530
understand that because limb control is
very very complicated so because we

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540
very very complicated so because we
 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.970
very very complicated so because we
can't make something exact you have to

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980
can't make something exact you have to
 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.280
can't make something exact you have to
learn how to use this artificial system

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290
learn how to use this artificial system
 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.170
learn how to use this artificial system
that isn't reacting much like what

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180
that isn't reacting much like what
 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.299
that isn't reacting much like what
natural motor control would do and the

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309
natural motor control would do and the
 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.010
natural motor control would do and the
idea is that if we can understand this

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020
idea is that if we can understand this
 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.139
idea is that if we can understand this
learning process better we can make

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149
learning process better we can make
 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.930
learning process better we can make
devices that will work when we plug them

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940
devices that will work when we plug them
 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.729
devices that will work when we plug them
in that we can get out to patients in

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739
in that we can get out to patients in
 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.940
in that we can get out to patients in
the real world and and and help them

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950
the real world and and and help them
 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.959
the real world and and and help them
bring a motor function I design brain

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969
bring a motor function I design brain
 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.299
bring a motor function I design brain
computer interfaces and I use them to

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309
computer interfaces and I use them to
 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.130
computer interfaces and I use them to
study motor control and motor learning

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140
study motor control and motor learning
 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.310
study motor control and motor learning
so a brain-computer interface takes

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320
so a brain-computer interface takes
 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.050
so a brain-computer interface takes
signals recorded signals from the brain

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060
signals recorded signals from the brain
 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.840
signals recorded signals from the brain
and the ones I use are directly from

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850
and the ones I use are directly from
 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.810
and the ones I use are directly from
neurons in primary motor cortex which is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820
neurons in primary motor cortex which is
 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.070
neurons in primary motor cortex which is
the part of the brain that controls

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080
the part of the brain that controls
 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.429
the part of the brain that controls
movement and we take these recorded

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439
movement and we take these recorded
 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.649
movement and we take these recorded
signals from the brain and we use them

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659
signals from the brain and we use them
 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.810
signals from the brain and we use them
to directly control some device like a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820
to directly control some device like a
 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.270
to directly control some device like a
cursor on computer screen or robotic arm

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280
cursor on computer screen or robotic arm
 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.380
cursor on computer screen or robotic arm
and the idea is that somebody who's lost

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390
and the idea is that somebody who's lost
 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.609
and the idea is that somebody who's lost
the ability to move if somebody was

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619
the ability to move if somebody was
 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.950
the ability to move if somebody was
paralyzed because of spinal cord injury

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960
paralyzed because of spinal cord injury
 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.870
paralyzed because of spinal cord injury
or brain stem stroke for whatever reason

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880
or brain stem stroke for whatever reason
 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.840
or brain stem stroke for whatever reason
but still has all of that motor control

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850
but still has all of that motor control
 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.570
but still has all of that motor control
ability locked into their head we can

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580
ability locked into their head we can
 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.990
ability locked into their head we can
take these devices we can tap out the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
take these devices we can tap out the
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.520
take these devices we can tap out the
intention to move and then we can move a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530
intention to move and then we can move a
 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.859
intention to move and then we can move a
device for them so I've created this in

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869
device for them so I've created this in
 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.990
device for them so I've created this in
some senses arbitrary mapping between

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000
some senses arbitrary mapping between
 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.710
some senses arbitrary mapping between
neural activity and cursor movement and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
neural activity and cursor movement and
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.010
neural activity and cursor movement and
the brain is very good at figuring out

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
the brain is very good at figuring out
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.170
the brain is very good at figuring out
from the from the small movements that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180
from the from the small movements that
 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.789
from the from the small movements that
the cursor makes how to refine that

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799
the cursor makes how to refine that
 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.530
the cursor makes how to refine that
process and how to make the cursor do

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540
process and how to make the cursor do
 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.420
process and how to make the cursor do
what you want it to do and that's the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430
what you want it to do and that's the
 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.100
what you want it to do and that's the
process I study we're trying to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110
process I study we're trying to
 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.600
process I study we're trying to
understand that learning process we're

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610
understand that learning process we're
 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.220
understand that learning process we're
trying to understand how to design a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230
trying to understand how to design a
 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.589
trying to understand how to design a
brain-computer interface that is more

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599
brain-computer interface that is more
 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.899
brain-computer interface that is more
learnable that is that you can learn

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909
learnable that is that you can learn
 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.550
learnable that is that you can learn
more quickly that you can learn

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560
more quickly that you can learn
 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.830
more quickly that you can learn
use more naturally that's that's the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840
use more naturally that's that's the
 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.300
use more naturally that's that's the

encourages collaboration and that the
 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.470
encourages collaboration and that the
kinds of things I do Unite's techniques

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
kinds of things I do Unite's techniques
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.300

one person could really be an expert in
 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.860
one person could really be an expert in
all of those various fields but we work

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870
all of those various fields but we work
 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.210
all of those various fields but we work
together so I work with people in

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
together so I work with people in
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.920
together so I work with people in
statistics I work with people in machine
