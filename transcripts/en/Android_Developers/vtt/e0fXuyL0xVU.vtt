TOR NOBYE: Hi, my name is Tor
Nobye, and I work on the Tools

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.410
Android team.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.820
Today I want to show you
the brand new IDE

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.660
that we have for Android.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.920
As you can see here, it
looks sort of dark.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.440
That's a optional dark theme
that a lot of us like a lot.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.300
And on the left here, you can
see the Project Explorer,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.770
which shows you the files
in your project.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.630
And then we have the Code
Editor in the center.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.470
And the Code Editor is really
the star of this IDE.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.190
It is a very, very intelligent
editor that can do really,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.640
really fast refactoring, code
completion, and so forth.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.700
And I want to show a few of
those Editor features in

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.560
detail today.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.160
All right, so here we're looking
at some pretty typical

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.470
Android code.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.410
But notice that we have some
hard coded strings here, or

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.360
what appear to be hard
coded strings.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.440
Turns out they're
actually not.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.870
This IDE can present these
strings as if they had been

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.720
hard coded.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.150
So you can see here--
as I hover, I can

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.220
see the real code.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.030
I can click on it and I can go
in and actually look at the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.760
real string.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.730
But the IDE gives me a much
simpler view of the code,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.310
which makes it a lot
easier to read.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.040
And we don't just do that for
strings-- if you look further

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.650
down here, you can see we are
manipulating some icons, and

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.640
over in the gutter on
the left you can see

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.180
the real icon itself.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.500
And we also help you with
completion here.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.510
So if I invoke code completion
or just do show doc with F1,

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.660
you can see we get this
completion dialogue which

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.920
shows me all the
assets as well.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.630
And that works not just
for icons, but

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.540
for strings as well.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.940
So if I, for example,
click on this one,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.740
you can see we have--

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.420
actually we only have two
translations for that string.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.840
And furthermore, this also
works on colors.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.290
So if I jump to, for example,
the color file, you can see

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.970
that we see all the colors
previewed in the gutter.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.970
Let's take a look at
the code again.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.210
One of the really nice things
about this new IDE is that it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940
does really deep
code analysis.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.310
So if I, for example, scroll
to the bottom here, you can

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.000
see that it has highlighted this
line and it's saying that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.350
this is a potential null
pointer exception.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.650
The reason it knows that is that
we have added adaptations

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.570
into the Android platform.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.150
So we know which methods can
return null, which methods

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.230
can't, and in fact we also
know-- for example, which

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.850
constants are allowed
for which APIs.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.780
So it is flagging this
[? cull ?] right up here to

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.320
set layout direction right.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.650
Which looks good, but you can
see it's telling me that the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.420
concept that we were expected
to pass in here is one of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.440
these named constants.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.380
And so we use this data not just
for code analysis, but

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.990
for code completion as well.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.270
So for example, context
getSystemService, you now-- if

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.530
I invoke code completion, you
can see it's offering all the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.810
valid strings, which
is something we

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.860
couldn't do in the past.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.830
You can invoke actions using
the Show Action dialogue.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.090
So I'm going to type Inspect
Code, and you can see Inspect

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.880
Code lets me run on the whole
project or individual files,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.150
and this is how you basically
run code inspections.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.210
And we've integrated Lint, so
you get all the Lint errors,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.900
but you also get a lot of code
analysis that IntelliJ already

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.510
comes with.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.380
And it's really great
at finding a lot of

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.250
bugs in your code.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.160
Let's talk about layout.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.300
So if I jump into a layout file,
like this one, you can

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.500
see that we now offer
you a preview on the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.910
right of the layout.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.260
And this preview stays in
sync with my edits.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.670
So if I, for example, click
on this text right here--

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.420
and I change the text.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.170
Let's see, what should
we change it to?

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.860
How about to reset?

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.410
You can see the preview
updates on the left.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.310
And the key thing about this
preview is, you get to work

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.890
with the code, but it keeps
the rendering on

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:34.850
the right in sync.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.190
And you can also click in the
editor or in the preview.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.420
And it syncs the selection
between the two.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.560
Let's go ahead and create
a new layout.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.050
So I'm going to create
a new blank layout.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.860
So when I'm typing new layout
tags, you can see that it

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.380
actually helps me complete
my layout on the right.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.060
So the error panel is saying,
hey, you have this widget but

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.790
you're missing [? a size, ?]

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.660
so we can just click on the
link to make it do that.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.160
If I make a typo, it detects
that and offers to fix it.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.340
And this is basically done for
a lot of typical errors that

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.420
you might have as you're
editing your layouts.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.870
Another feature we have is
multi-configuration editing.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.089
So if I jump back to my
stopwatch layout here, I can

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.720
turn on the ability to see this
layout across a number of

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.740
different layouts.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.040
When I do that, you can see we
actually get a preview here of

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.280
what the current layout that
I'm editing looks like.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.020
Here we have it on a tablet,
a large tablet.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.130
We have it all the way from a
3.7 inch phone up to a 4.7

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.710
inch Galaxy Nexus.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.765
It's showing a Nexus 4 on the
top left, and we have a seven

00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:38.890
inch tablet and a
10 inch tablet.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.650
So this makes it easy, as I'm
editing, to see if I'm making

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.900
any mistakes.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.230
And this isn't just
for screen sizes.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.410
We have many other aspects.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.490
So I can, for example, switch
to translations here.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.780
I can see this layout across a
number of different languages

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.960
and so forth.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.930
And again, as I'm editing, it
will generate previews of what

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.160
the edits look like.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.260
So I can make sure that I, for
example, don't cause the text

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.560
to crop on these different
languages.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.190
So that's layout preview.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.250
We have this not just
for XML editing.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.070
You obviously-- if you prefer,
you can do layout editing with

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.440
a full UI builder as well.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.050
This is something we're
still working on.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.810
But as you can see here we
have our UI builder, with

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.530
Property Sheet, Palette,
and so forth.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.990
And Layout Preview should
work here as well.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.880
And I can go ahead and make my
edits and as you can see the

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.980
previews will update.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.410
And the reason that this one
didn't is because this is

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.740
using a different layout.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.130
So we have a custom landscape
layout here.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.080
That's used when you have
a large tablet.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.430
So just one of the ways you can
make sure your app looks

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.702
good across all the way from
phones up to tablets, is to

00:05:56.702 --> 00:05:57.880
use dedicated layouts.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.040
And creating new layout in
this IDE is very easy.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.530
We basically have this Create
Other item in the layout

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.240
editor, which takes the current
layout, creates a copy

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.720
of it, and then you can
customize that for the

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.410
specific form factor
you have in mind.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.760
So there are a lot of
new features to

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.990
investigate in this IDE.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.470
This is just a preview build,
but please give it a try and

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.610
let us know what you think.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.860
Thanks for your time.
