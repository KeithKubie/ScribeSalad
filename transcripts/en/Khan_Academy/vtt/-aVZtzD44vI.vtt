00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.901
- [Instructor] So we have three different

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.817
possible production possibility curves

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:07.320
for rabbits and berries
here, which we've already

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.615
talked about in other
videos, but the reason why

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.336
I'm showing you three different curves

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:12.847
is because these three different curves

00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:15.292
clearly have different shapes,
and we wanna think about

00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:18.062
why you would have and
under what scenarios

00:00:18.062 --> 00:00:19.850
would you have these different shapes?

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.660
Here, our production
possibility curve, or our PPC,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.597
it looks like a straight line.

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:28.102
Here, it looks like it's
bowed out from the origin,

00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:30.486
it looks like it's popping
out in that direction.

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:33.484
And here, it looks like
it's bowed in to the origin,

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:35.861
it's popping in in this direction.

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:38.954
So the first thing I'm going
to do is ask you a question.

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:41.544
Which one describes the scenario where

00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:45.425
for every extra rabbit I catch,
every incremental rabbit,

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:48.472
I'm giving up more and
more in terms of berries?

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:50.072
Or another way of thinking about it is,

00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:53.294
as I catch more and more
rabbits, the opportunity cost

00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:56.377
in terms of berries is increasing.

00:00:56.377 --> 00:00:59.817
Which one of these curves describes that?

00:00:59.817 --> 00:01:01.145
Well some of you might have already seen

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:04.775
the video on KhanAcademy, on
increasing opportunity cost,

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:06.771
and you might recognize
that this curve here.

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.105
But let's just review it,
so there's a world where

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:11.979
I'm eating all berries,
and I can get, I can pick

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.661
300 berries a day, but
maybe I decide to go after

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:16.723
that first rabbit that
just likes to hang out

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:19.829
and play with my knives,
and so when I catch that,

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.138
it's very easy to catch,
so I don't give up a lot

00:01:22.138 --> 00:01:24.854
in terms of berries, especially
because I'm probably not,

00:01:24.854 --> 00:01:26.498
the berries I'm giving up are probably

00:01:26.498 --> 00:01:28.584
the ones that are hardest to pick.

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:32.183
And so let's say that first
rabbit, the opportunity cost,

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:34.917
I pick 20 less berries,
so notice, when I increase

00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:37.923
the rabbits by one, my
berries go down by 20,

00:01:37.923 --> 00:01:42.223
so my opportunity cost is 20
berries for that first rabbit.

00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:43.397
But let's say that second rabbit is

00:01:43.397 --> 00:01:46.463
a little bit harder to
catch, and I'm not giving up

00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:48.658
the quite so hard to pick berries,

00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:51.053
and so when I pick that next,
or when I hunt that next

00:01:51.053 --> 00:01:55.031
rabbit, I should say, then
I've given up 40 berries.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:57.649
So notice, my opportunity
cost has increased.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.570
For that first rabbit, my
opportunity cost was 20 berries.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.221
For that second rabbit, my
opportunity cost is 40 berries.

00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:07.860
And it keeps going, then third rabbit,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.772
I'm going to give up 60 berries.

00:02:10.772 --> 00:02:14.855
That fourth rabbit, I'm
gonna give up 80 berries,

00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:18.996
80 berries, and then last but not least,

00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:21.361
that fifth rabbit, which
is the most that I can hunt

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:24.261
in a day, I'm gonna give up 100 berries

00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:26.942
'cuz here, I'm going after
the really nimble rabbit,

00:02:26.942 --> 00:02:29.453
the really sly rabbit, and
I'm giving up literally

00:02:29.453 --> 00:02:31.492
the low-hanging fruit in terms of berries,

00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:34.344
the one, they might be on the ground,

00:02:34.344 --> 00:02:36.724
just ready for me to pick up, and so,

00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:38.989
the important realization from this video

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.242
is this bowed out shape right over here,

00:02:41.242 --> 00:02:44.552
this is describing an
increasing opportunity cost.

00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:47.223
Let me write that down, increasing,

00:02:47.223 --> 00:02:50.390
increasing, O.C. for opportunity cost.

00:02:51.263 --> 00:02:53.674
So with that out of
the way, which of these

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:57.092
would describe a decreasing
opportunity cost?

00:02:57.092 --> 00:02:58.799
Maybe you could imagine a scenario where

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.782
every incremental rabbit I catch,

00:03:00.782 --> 00:03:03.916
I get better and better
at catching rabbits.

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.491
Well you might guess that, well look,

00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:07.795
if this one is increasing
and I'm bowed out,

00:03:07.795 --> 00:03:11.599
then being bowed in would be
a decreasing opportunity cost.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.444
Decreasing opportunity
cost, and let's make sure

00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:17.674
that it makes sense, so we
could go back to the scenario

00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:19.998
where we're doing nothing
but picking berries,

00:03:19.998 --> 00:03:22.382
and let's say that first
rabbit, so we're gonna

00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:24.839
talk about a different scenario
now, that first rabbit,

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.992
I had to train myself to
be able to get rabbits,

00:03:27.992 --> 00:03:30.144
I have to buy the tools,
I have to stretch,

00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:34.810
it takes me a lot of effort
to get that first rabbit.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.966
And so, there, I give
up 100 berries, so my

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:41.184
opportunity cost for that
first rabbit was 100 berries.

00:03:41.184 --> 00:03:42.952
But then for that second rabbit,

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:46.175
my opportunity cost is 80 berries.

00:03:46.175 --> 00:03:48.095
Maybe now, I've kind of
gotten the hang of it.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:50.917
I've already bought my
rabbit catching shoes.

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:52.682
I've already invested in that.

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:57.055
I'm all stretched and
limber, maybe those rabbits

00:03:57.055 --> 00:04:00.017
like to hang out together,
and so that keeps on going.

00:04:00.017 --> 00:04:03.758
So that third rabbit, my
opportunity cost is 60 berries.

00:04:03.758 --> 00:04:06.398
I'm getting really good
at catching rabbits,

00:04:06.398 --> 00:04:09.569
so clearly, you see here, that
for each incremental rabbit

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.704
I get, my opportunity cost is decreasing,

00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:15.126
all the way to that fifth rabbit,

00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:18.459
maybe my opportunity cost is 20 berries.

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:21.074
To catch that next extra rabbit,

00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:23.231
I'm giving up those 20 berries.

00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:26.527
So very clearly, you see a
decreasing opportunity cost.

00:04:26.527 --> 00:04:29.275
And so, by deductive reasoning,
you might be able to say,

00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:31.443
"Well, okay, this straight
line must represent

00:04:31.443 --> 00:04:33.943
"a constant opportunity cost."

00:04:35.088 --> 00:04:37.259
And that is, indeed, what it shows.

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.328
For every rabbit, every rabbit you catch,

00:04:40.328 --> 00:04:44.526
you're giving up exactly,
you're giving up exactly

00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:47.448
60 berries, every time I catch a rabbit,

00:04:47.448 --> 00:04:50.410
I give up 60 berries,
so my opportunity cost

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.271
for rabbits, in terms of
berries, is just a constant 60.

00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:55.999
And so this is a scenario,
if you were imagining

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.365
in this fictional world we created, where

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:01.713
every rabbit is about as easy
to catch as any other one,

00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:04.055
and every berry is about
as easy to pick or find

00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:07.030
as any other one, and so, the trade off,

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.532
the amount of time I spent
for each incremental rabbit,

00:05:09.532 --> 00:05:11.759
I'm giving up a fixed amount of berries.

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.548
No matter how many rabbits I go for,

00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:18.631
and no matter how many
berries I am currently at,

00:05:20.002 --> 00:05:22.968
so that's a constant opportunity cost,

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:24.843
when you have a straight line.
