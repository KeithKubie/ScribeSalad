00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:14.644
We're holding hands,

00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:16.032
staring at the door.

00:00:16.374 --> 00:00:19.312
My siblings and I were waiting
for my mother to come back

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:20.798
from the hospital.

00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:24.529
She was there because my grandmother
had cancer surgery that day.

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:28.521
Finally, the doors opened,

00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:30.598
and she said,

00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:31.830
"She's gone.

00:00:31.854 --> 00:00:33.004
She's gone."

00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:36.310
She started sobbing and immediately said,

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.524
"We must make arrangements.

00:00:38.548 --> 00:00:44.193
Your grandmother's dying wish
was to be buried back home in Korea."

00:00:46.193 --> 00:00:50.002
I was barely 12 years old,
and when the shock wore off,

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:53.335
my mother's words were ringing in my ears.

00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:57.490
My grandmother wanted
to be buried back home.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.366
We had moved from Korea
to Argentina six years prior,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.981
without knowing any Spanish,
or how we were going to make a living.

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:13.282
And upon arrival, we were immigrants
who had lost everything,

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.807
so we had to work really hard
to rebuild our lives.

00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.455
So it hadn't occurred to me
that after all these years,

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.422
back home was still in Korea.

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:28.649
It made me ponder where I would want
to be buried someday,

00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:30.568
where home was for me,

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:33.159
and the answer was not obvious.

00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:35.502
And this really bothered me.

00:01:36.736 --> 00:01:42.155
So this episode launched
a lifelong quest for my identity.

00:01:43.174 --> 00:01:46.746
I was born in Korea -- the land of kimchi;

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.604
raised in Argentina,

00:01:48.628 --> 00:01:54.295
where I ate so much steak
that I'm probably 80 percent cow by now;

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.437
and I was educated in the US,

00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:58.783
where I became addicted to peanut butter.

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:00.386
(Laughter)

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.344
During my childhood,
I felt very much Argentinian,

00:02:04.368 --> 00:02:07.028
but my looks betrayed me at times.

00:02:07.052 --> 00:02:10.322
I remember on the first day
of middle school,

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:13.054
my Spanish literature teacher
came into the room.

00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:15.065
She scanned all of my classmates,

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.264
and she said,

00:02:16.288 --> 00:02:18.837
"You -- you have to get a tutor,

00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:21.720
otherwise, you won't pass this class."

00:02:21.744 --> 00:02:25.606
But by then I was fluent
in Spanish already,

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.642
so it felt as though I could be
either Korean or Argentinian,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.672
but not both.

00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:35.239
It felt like a zero-sum game,

00:02:35.263 --> 00:02:38.200
where I had to give up my old identity

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:41.784
to be able to gain or earn a new one.

00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:47.384
So when I was 18,
I decided to go to Korea,

00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:51.462
hoping that finally I could find
a place to call home.

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:53.483
But there people asked me,

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.903
"Why do you speak Korean
with a Spanish accent?"

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:57.951
(Laughter)

00:02:57.975 --> 00:03:01.470
And, "You must be Japanese
because of your big eyes

00:03:01.494 --> 00:03:03.504
and your foreign body language."

00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:08.924
And so it turns out that I was
too Korean to be Argentinian,

00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:11.078
but too Argentinian to be Korean.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.237
And this was a pivotal realization to me.

00:03:15.848 --> 00:03:20.597
I had failed to find that place
in the world to call home.

00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:26.141
But how many Japanese-looking Koreans
who speak with a Spanish accent --

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:29.164
or even more specific,
Argentinian accent --

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:30.845
do you think are out there?

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.254
Perhaps this could be an advantage.

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:36.879
It was easy for me to stand out,

00:03:36.903 --> 00:03:40.231
which couldn't hurt in a world
that was rapidly changing,

00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:43.302
where skills could become
obsolete overnight.

00:03:43.892 --> 00:03:50.066
So I stopped looking
for that 100 percent commonality

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.586
with the people that I met.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.047
Instead, I realized that oftentimes,
I was the only overlap

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:02.083
between groups of people that were
usually in conflict with each other.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.048
So with this realization in mind,

00:04:06.072 --> 00:04:10.265
I decided to embrace all
of the different versions of myself --

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:14.780
even allow myself
to reinvent myself at times.

00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:18.666
So for example, in high school,

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.700
I have to confess I was a mega-nerd.

00:04:20.724 --> 00:04:24.327
I had no sense of fashion --
thick glasses, simple hairstyle --

00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:25.696
you can get the idea.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.013
I think, actually, I only had friends
because I shared my homework.

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:31.187
That's the truth.

00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:33.659
But once at university,

00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:37.377
I was able to find
a new identity for myself,

00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:41.371
and the nerd became a popular girl.

00:04:42.036 --> 00:04:43.222
But it was MIT,

00:04:43.246 --> 00:04:45.901
so I don't know if I can take
too much credit for that.

00:04:45.925 --> 00:04:47.530
As they say over there,

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:49.881
"The odds are good,

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:52.382
but the goods are odd."

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.348
(Laughter)

00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:58.833
I switched majors so many times
that my advisors joked

00:04:58.857 --> 00:05:01.716
that I should get a degree
in "random studies."

00:05:02.164 --> 00:05:03.520
(Laughter)

00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:05.203
I told this to my kids.

00:05:05.227 --> 00:05:09.802
And then over the years, I have gained
a lot of different identities.

00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:14.402
I started as an inventor,
entrepreneur, social innovator.

00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:17.694
Then I became an investor,

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:18.940
a woman in tech,

00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:20.223
a teacher.

00:05:20.247 --> 00:05:23.193
And most recently, I became a mom,

00:05:23.217 --> 00:05:26.623
or as my toddler says repeatedly,

00:05:26.647 --> 00:05:29.649
"Mom!" day and night.

00:05:30.978 --> 00:05:35.715
Even my accent was so confused --

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:38.191
its origin was so obscure,

00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:41.165
that my friends called it, "Rebecanese."

00:05:41.492 --> 00:05:42.665
(Laughter)

00:05:43.236 --> 00:05:46.162
But reinventing yourself can be very hard.

00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:49.367
You can face a lot of resistance at times.

00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:52.906
When I was nearly done with my PhD,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.420
I got bitten by that entrepreneurial bug.

00:05:55.444 --> 00:05:57.170
I was in Silicon Valley,

00:05:57.194 --> 00:06:02.531
and so writing a thesis in the basement
didn't seem as interesting

00:06:02.555 --> 00:06:04.428
as starting my own company.

00:06:04.452 --> 00:06:07.626
So I went to my very
traditional Korean parents,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.086
who are here today,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.761
with the task of letting them know

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:13.728
that I was going to drop out
from my PhD program.

00:06:14.227 --> 00:06:18.969
You see, my siblings and I are the first
generation to go to university,

00:06:18.993 --> 00:06:22.423
so for a family of immigrants,
this was kind of a big deal.

00:06:22.447 --> 00:06:25.315
You can imagine how
this conversation was going to go.

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:30.004
But fortunately, I had
a secret weapon with me,

00:06:30.028 --> 00:06:36.902
which was a chart that had
the average income of all of the graduates

00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:39.184
from Stanford PhD programs,

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:42.707
and then the average income
of all the dropouts

00:06:42.731 --> 00:06:44.497
from Stanford graduate programs.

00:06:44.521 --> 00:06:45.682
(Laughter)

00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:48.204
I must tell you -- this chart
was definitely skewed

00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:49.759
by the founders of Google.

00:06:49.783 --> 00:06:50.806
(Laughter)

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.918
But my mom looked at the chart,

00:06:52.942 --> 00:06:54.183
and she said,

00:06:54.207 --> 00:06:57.503
"Oh, for you -- follow your passion."

00:06:57.527 --> 00:06:59.461
(Laughter)

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:00.692
Hi, Mom.

00:07:02.132 --> 00:07:08.656
Now, today my identity quest
is no longer to find my tribe.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.144
It's more about allowing myself

00:07:11.168 --> 00:07:15.281
to embrace all of the possible
permutations of myself

00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:20.537
and cultivating diversity within me

00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:22.795
and not just around me.

00:07:23.563 --> 00:07:27.382
My boys now are three years
and five months old today,

00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:30.872
and they were already born
with three nationalities

00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:32.391
and four languages.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:37.536
I should mention now that my husband
is actually from Denmark --

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.389
just in case I don't have enough
culture shocks in my life,

00:07:40.413 --> 00:07:42.429
I decided to marry a Danish guy.

00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:45.429
In fact, I think my kids
will be the first Vikings

00:07:45.453 --> 00:07:48.961
who will have a hard time
growing a beard when they become older.

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:50.293
(Laughter)

00:07:50.317 --> 00:07:51.913
Yeah, we'll have to work on that.

00:07:51.937 --> 00:07:58.299
But I really hope that they will find
that their multiplicity

00:07:58.323 --> 00:08:01.729
is going to open and create a lot of doors
for them in their lives,

00:08:01.753 --> 00:08:05.719
and that they can use this as a way
to find commonality

00:08:05.743 --> 00:08:10.356
in a world that's
increasingly global today.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.491
I hope that instead of feeling
anxious and worried

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:16.595
that they don't fit in that one box

00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:20.345
or that their identity will become
irrelevant someday,

00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:23.134
that they can feel free to experiment

00:08:23.158 --> 00:08:28.583
and to take control of their personal
narrative and identity.

00:08:29.371 --> 00:08:32.492
I also hope that they will use
their unique combination

00:08:32.516 --> 00:08:37.825
of values and languages
and cultures and skills

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:39.499
to help create a world

00:08:39.523 --> 00:08:45.300
where identities are no longer used
to alienate what looks different,

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:49.032
but rather, to bring together people.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.390
And most importantly, I really hope
that they find tremendous joy

00:08:53.414 --> 00:08:57.568
in going through these
uncharted territories,

00:08:57.592 --> 00:08:59.349
because I know I have.

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:04.201
Now, as for my grandmother,

00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:08.523
her last wish was also
her last lesson to me.

00:09:09.088 --> 00:09:13.685
It turns out that it was never
about going back to Korea

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:15.358
and being buried there.

00:09:15.382 --> 00:09:19.051
It was about resting next to her son,

00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:22.776
who had died long before
she moved to Argentina.

00:09:23.714 --> 00:09:27.589
What mattered to her was not the ocean

00:09:27.613 --> 00:09:30.997
that divided her past and new world;

00:09:32.098 --> 00:09:37.527
it was about finding common ground.

00:09:37.897 --> 00:09:39.056
Thank you.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.640
(Applause)
