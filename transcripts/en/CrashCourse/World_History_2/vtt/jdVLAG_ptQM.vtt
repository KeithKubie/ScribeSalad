00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.960
Hi I'm John Green; this is Crash Course World History,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.340
and today, we're going to talk -- for the absolute last time, I promise -- about war.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.660
Well, it's not the last time we're going to talk about war because we're gonna talk about the 20th century later,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.500
pretty much defined by war,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.440
but it's the last time we're going to talk about war in an abstract way.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.800
[John from the past] Mr. Green! Mr. Green! And then we can get to the battles?

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.880
Because this has been pretty ... esoteric.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.480
[Present John Green] Oh, me from the past,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.960
I remember when I spent 30 minutes with an SAT prep book

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.920
and emerged with the word "esoteric" in my vocabulary.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.993
But fair enough, me from the past. It is a little bit esoteric.

00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:30.633
You know what else is esoteric?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.560
Human existence.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.920
Anyway, in the last episode we examined why individuals might want to go to war,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.440
and the unspoken assumption in all of that was that war is, you know, on the whole, bad.

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:43.456
But is that actually true?

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:48.360
I mean, obviously, war is tremendously destructive and it can be very bad for the lives of individual humans,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.200
but is it possible that violence and war have had a positive effect on human development?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.400
Or at least, some positive effect?

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.720
[Intro]

00:01:02.473 --> 00:01:04.473
[Intro]

00:01:04.473 --> 00:01:05.993
So, as we've discussed previously,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.400
wars are usually some type of competition for resources.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.200
But war can also lead to cooperation.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.280
Like, the earliest examples of wars were probably raids, right?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.040
And one of the best defenses against a raid is to gather people together in a group.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.040
You know, you circle the wagons,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.040
you put everybody inside the fort, et cetera.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.160
And some archaeologists maintain that human settlements, especially cities,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.320
started BEFORE agriculture,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.600
and, if that's true, the likeliest explanation is defense.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.440
And then there's the fact that agriculture itself has some defensive value,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.320
especially when you compare it to, like, herding, because herds are a very inviting target for raids.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.320
Y'know, you can round up all of the cows and make off with them because they can run,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.880
but it's hard to, like, rustle 20 tons of wheat.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.480
Plus, agriculture usually requires larger concentrations of people,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.260
which has a defensive value, and, as far as armies go,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.140
agriculture provides the resource surpluses that sustain larger groups of warriors.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.074
So we've often said on Crash Course World History that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.280
agriculture and the cities that came with it were like the beginning of civilization,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.080
but, in fact, maybe war was the beginning of agriculture.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.400
And then there's the argument that war can be the basis of political leadership.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.120
Like, in the ancient world - as in Game of Thrones -

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.880
successful war leaders build up a retinue

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.680
of fighters, and in order to keep them happy, the war leaders need to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.040
supply a constant flow of booty -- not that kind of booty --

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.920
I mean looting, like the spoils of war.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.120
Anyway, this sets up a need for continuous war,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.639
because, as your general, the only way I have of paying you

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.159
is in booty.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.720
And we can only get booty if we continue to war.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.280
The people who were best at gathering loot became chiefs, and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.640
then through conquest, chiefdoms grew into kingdoms.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.440
The examples of this process are too numerous to count, and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.640
many weren't recorded, but the rise of the Zulus in Africa

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.440
provides a really interesting modern analogy.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.400
The people who would become the Zulu nation were originally Nguni-speaking

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.120
agriculturalists and herders organized into numerous small chiefdoms,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.520
until the early 1800s.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.700
One of their chiefs, Dingiswayo, was able to extend his control over the others by

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.100
his military strength.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.040
And then he would often cement his control over these chiefdoms

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.400
by replacing their chiefs with someone loyal to him,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.720
sometimes through a politically expedient marriage, again like Game of Thrones.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.240
Dingiswayo was killed in 1817, and eventually replaced by

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.400
his military commander Shaka,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.520
whose clan name, Zulu, was given to the kingdom.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.400
Shaka's military success allowed him to build up a state,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.800
that eventually controlled quite a lot of territory,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.120
but he was unable to transition it into a nation-state.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.280
So, we've seen a bit of the way that war can change the way that humans organize themselves,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.440
and that war, or, at least, the threat of attack, also may have played

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.920
a role in the development of the city states.

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:52.933
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:57.013
Cities began as settlements, which, because they were stationary, were targets for raids.

00:03:57.013 --> 00:03:59.920
And so to deter raiders, cities built walls.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.600
But those efforts required coordination, or else coercion, and resources

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.440
which states are good at.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.400
Like, Greek city-states built walls to defend against constant threats,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.560
mostly from other Greek city-states.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.554
Egypt, on the other hand, never developed walled cities because they were

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.554
relatively free from powerful enemies, other than,

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:18.554
like, the Assyrians and the Sea People.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.560
And Egypt had fewer internal struggles thanks to the unity provided by the Nile River.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.480
So war shaped city-states both physically and politically,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.080
but city-states also shaped war, because

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.480
they changed the way that wars were fought.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.840
Concentrated urban populations were the basis of civil militias,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.680
made up of soldiers who were also citizens.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.520
That meant that they were both effective fighting forces and political catalysts.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.640
They built civic pride and diminished the power of wealthy warrior elites,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.720
who couldn't defeat these new, larger armies.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.880
The best example of this citizen-militia is probably the Roman legion,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.720
which became so successful at fighting and empire-building

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.754
that we forget that Rome actually started out as a city-state.

00:04:57.754 --> 00:04:58.834
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.080
Although I believe Rome actually got its start when it was founded by two boys

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.540
raised by a wolf.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.660
But, speaking of Rome, lets talk for a minute about empires.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.800
Now, it goes without saying that empires are fairly reliant upon military power.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.800
I guess you could also use the dark side of the force,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.800
but even Darth Vader needed stormtroopers.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.200
But the very nature of an empire is, like, one group of people ruling

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.640
over many groups of people, and

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.280
to do that, you generally do need some military power,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.600
whether you're the Persians, or the Romans, or even the Mongols.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.800
No, they're not an exception this time, Stan.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.160
But imperial success can backfire when

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.400
rich empires decide that it's easier or cheaper to have

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.040
mercenaries do the fighting for them.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.600
And because they aren't citizen-soldiers, they aren't loyal to the state.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.460
Mercenaries are in it for the loot.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.160
And so when you rely upon mercenaries, you need constant war,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.720
which can stretch you thin, and also those mercenaries aren't loyal to you,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.180
and this can be a real problem,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.300
as the Romans discovered, but also many others.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.680
So empires have a ceaseless urge to get bigger, but the bigger they get the more

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.040
vulnerable they get to both internal problems, like peasant

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.000
revolts, and external threats, like barbarians.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.680
And this may be why we don't see that many empires any more.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.913
They're expensive and unstable.

00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:10.273
Putin's behind me, isn't he.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.920
Putin!

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.960
Stop building an empire!

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.200
So, ultimately in the pre-modern world, wars probably unmade as many states and empires as they made.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.400
As Ibn Khaldun put it:

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.280
"Royal authority is a noble and enjoyable position,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.360
it comprises all the good things of the world, the pleasures of the body,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.720
and the joys of the soul.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.280
Therefore, there is, as a rule, great competition for it.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.360
It is rarely handed over voluntarily, but may be taken away.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.880
Thus, discord ensues. It leads to war and fighting."

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.360
In short, war and the state developed simultaneously,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.920
and they probably had a reciprocal relationship.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.840
And states are good ... ish. I mean, if you're not in the position of being, like, pro-hunter-gatherer,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.040
I think that you have to be pro-state.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.480
And I'm kind of pro-hunter-gatherer, but

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.040
I love pizza and the internet, and they can't have either.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.520
But anyway, if wars create power and wealth for states,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.953
why don't we see that many big empire-building wars anymore?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.960
I mean, except for you.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.160
Well, one answer actually has to do with wealth.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.960
So, warfare changed a lot in the early modern era

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.840
-- after about 1500 CE -- with the large-scale introduction of gunpowder weapons.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.436
This has often been called a military revolution because cannon made

00:07:22.436 --> 00:07:23.836
cities very vulnerable.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.640
Although, in the end, cities proved pretty resourceful in developing fortification techniques

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.960
to deal with cannons and, you know, we have cities today

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.440
despite like, really excellent cannons.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.000
But anyway, if you've ever watched an episode of Pawn Stars,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.440
you'll know that cannons are very expensive.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.600
So the age of gunpowder weapons probably led to states getting more power

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.880
over their subjects, because in order to pay for all of this

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.280
military technology, they had to modernize their bureaucracies,

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.120
especially their tax collection systems.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.840
So the most successful states were those that could marshal their resources

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.600
to pay for guns and forts and ships and

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.360
most importantly, troops, which remain the largest military expenditure.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.680
So now we're beginning to see one of the reasons why Europe would dominate

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.680
much of the rest of the world after 1500,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.840
and would REALLY dominate after 1850.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.240
Europe was raking in money from trade, and especially from colonies,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.080
which allowed investment in technology and industry that

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.080
reinforced its military advantages.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.600
Essentially, there was a lot of wealth to extract from the colonies;

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.320
Europe had the cannons to do so; extracting that wealth gave them ever-better cannons.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.720
And that, my friends, is why here at Crash Course History we

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.720
focus more on trade and resources than battles and war.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.440
So this rising cost of armies and navies meant that,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.920
increasingly, wealth was power.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.800
One of the biggest differences between the pre-modern and modern eras

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.720
was that in the former, a state could accumulate wealth through

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.880
conquest, while in the latter, trade is the better and safer bet.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.520
Especially exploitative, unfair, and unilateral trade with colonies.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.560
And then, as trade-reliant states began to eclipse those more reliant on conquest,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.280
a funny thing happened. The rich states that had built their wealth on military might

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.360
began to shy away from expensive wars.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.000
And this was particularly true of the states considered liberal democracies.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.040
Although to be fair, liberal democracies are also pretty into war.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.400
But at least compared to empires and other kinds of states,

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.160
they seem to be less likely to go to war, he said controversially,

00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:20.773
causing a big explosion in the comments.

00:09:20.773 --> 00:09:25.000
Why? Well the most common answer is that democracies are answerable to constituents

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.200
who are unlikely to go to war, because, y'know, dying is bad.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.880
But Athens was like the purest democracy of all time and also remarkably bellicose.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.720
Rome had a fair amount of citizen participation, and look how peaceful they were.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.400
And then there's the argument that wars became more expensive.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.920
Oh, it's time for the open letter! But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.760
Ohh, it's an open letter to military spending.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.840
Dear military spending, you kind of get a bad rap.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.320
Or too good of a rap, depending on your perspective.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.040
Here's the thing, military spending: you're one of those people who, like,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.800
acts like they've changed so much, and they're, like, totally different from

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.440
what they were last year, but you're really the same.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.160
It's true that modern armies cost much more than pre-modern ones, but

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.320
modern economies are also much bigger. In fact,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.800
as a percentage of state budgets, military spending has remained relatively stable

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.640
at between 3% and 5% of GDP,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.840
even at the height of the Cold War in the 1950s. You're cool and all, military spending, but

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.680
you're not the reason we have fewer wars. Best wishes, John Green.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.480
So I'd argue that it's not the costs of going to war that has made peace so attractive,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.560
it's the benefits of not going to war.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.880
Now, the not killing and not dying benefits of peace are obvious, but

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.400
good trade relations with other nations also leads to more stuff for

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.120
everybody, essentially. This is true for cheap T-shirts and sneakers, but it's also true

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.520
for like medicine and food. Now that peace is more economically beneficial than

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.553
war is not exactly a shocking revelation, nor is it particularly new, as

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.560
John Stewart Mill pointed out.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.640
"... Commerce first taught nations to see with good will the wealth and prosperity of

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.680
one another. Before, the patriot, unless sufficiently advanced in culture to feel the world

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.760
his country, wished all countries weak, poor, and ill-governed but his own:

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.640
He now sees in their wealth and progress a direct source of wealth and progress

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:24.600
to his own country. It is commerce which is rapidly rendering war obsolete."

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.720
Now, you may have noticed that that actually hasn't happened.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.640
And I'm not going to argue that everything has been peaceful and open-world trade since

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.600
the end of the Napoleonic Wars or that capitalist countries seeing war as

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.920
bad for business and have given up on it, but

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.600
compared to earlier times, wars between major powers are much less frequent,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.240
a fact that tends to be obscured by the massiveness of the two

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.920
Great Wars of the 20th century.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.960
So, I apologize that this isn't straightforward military history, because I also

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.280
enjoy a good glorious battle. But here at Crash Course we want to provide a

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.840
framework for thinking about war generally, and we want to examine what it says

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.400
about us as individuals, and as social orders, both good and bad.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.920
War may be part of why we have agriculture, and cities, and states,

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.760
but even centuries ago, John Stewart Mill noticed that it seemed to be outliving

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.480
its welcome. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.959
