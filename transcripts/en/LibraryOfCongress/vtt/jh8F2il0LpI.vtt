00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.390
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Good
morning, everyone,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.390
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.630
It's good to see so
many people here today.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.100
Our program today is a continuation

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.960
of our Congressional
conversation series

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.400 position:56%
in which the library invites current
and former members of Congress

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.900
to discuss their careers
in public service.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.010
It's a real honor and
privilege for me

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.170
to welcome Representative
Jackie Speier today

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.670
and to welcome her to the Library.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.570
Representative Speier has
had a distinguished career

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.660
in public service, from her
time as a Congressional staffer,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.780
as a state legislator, and her
current role as member of Congress.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.740
She represents the 14th District
of California in the House.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.670
Everyone knows where that is --

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.300
San Francisco area,
absolutely beautiful.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.410
She is the ranking member on the
House Armed Services Subcommittee

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.560
on Oversight and Investigations
and also serves

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.090
on the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.180
Among the issues that she has
focused on: Ending sexual assault

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.830
in the military; gender pay equity;
consumer protection; cybersecurity;

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.510
and student loan affordability.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.610
Representative Speier has
a fascinating personal

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
and professional story
to share with us.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.600
She's overcome adversity
numerous times in her life

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.100
and channeled those
experiences into an impressive

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.710
and distinguished career
in government service.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.920
Our conversation today will
be led by Colleen Shogan,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.500
the Deputy Director of our National

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.350
and International Outreach
Service Unit here at the Library.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.990
Colleen is a political
scientist by training

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.420
and a self-described
lover of Congress.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.800
I also want to commend to
you this wonderful book,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.010
which Represent Speier co-authored.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.660
I think you'll all
appreciate this title:

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.960
<i>This is Not the Life I Ordered</i>.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.520
This is a great book to
keep right at your desk

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.720
when you're having
those bad moments.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.360
I've already consulted
it several times.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.510
So it's my pleasure to
welcome Representative Speier.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.430
[ Applause ]

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.730
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Terrific.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.350
Good morning and welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.580
I think we're going to have a great
conversation here this morning.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.750
At the conclusion of our
conversation back and forth,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.050
Representative Speier is happy to
take questions from the audience.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.740
But I'm going to kick us off.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.430
So you were interested in politics
at a young age, but you didn't grow

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.180
up in a particularly
political family.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.550
For your confirmation you
chose the name Jacqueline

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.500
because of Jackie Kennedy.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.270
So can you tell us at a younger
age what got you interested

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.000
in politics and public service?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.560
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: I came
from a very blue collar family --

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.810 position:56%
first in my family to go to college.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.800
Not politically active,
as you pointed out.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.020
I guess I was 10, 11, 12 years
old during the Camelot Era

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.950
of the Kennedy Administration.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.190
And I think everyone in the country
was uplifted by this young couple

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:55.140 position:56%
who had taken Washington by storm
and the sense of hope and aspiration

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.610
that was, I think, so
vividly there and palpable.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.590
And so I guess that's
what first drew me in.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.450
And then I did take the name
Jacqueline at the confirmation.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.380
I hated the name Karen because
my mother would always yell Karen

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.230
and it would just drive me nuts.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.000
So I took Jacqueline
as a confirmation name.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.180
And then I when from a
public elementary school

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.730
to a Catholic girl's
high school by choice,

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.330
which was another interesting
point in my life.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.790
And so I was meeting a
whole new group of students.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.970
And so I just decided that I
was going to take my nickname

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.350
at that point and make it Jackie.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.130
That's how that involved.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.950
In terms of politics I think I
just remember reading the local

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.080
newspapers and I was drawn to
this local mayor, who was young --

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.250
Leo Ryan, mayor of
South San Francisco --

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.120
who then ran for the state
assembly and got elected.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.540
And there's a plan for all us.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.100
And we don't always know the plan.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.630
But I'm 16 years of age; my parents
get a solicitation in the mail

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.010
for Assemblyman Ryan's reelection.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.760
I take it, fill it out, say I have
no money but I would volunteer.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.890
And then Saturday morning my
job was to vacuum the house.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.110
And so I'm vacuuming the
house and the phone rings.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.440
The vacuum cleaner's still going.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.910
I hear this voice on
the other end saying,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.000
"Would you come to be interviewed?"

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.270
And it was Leo Ryan.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.700
And he was having a campaign
meeting at his home in Millbrea.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.670
And I went up and was interviewed.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.600
And they were actually
interviewing young women

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.120
to be what they called
that year Ryan Girls.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.200
And there's a picture of me
in my office as a Ryan Girl.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.560
And it was at the height
of the Beatles.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.240
So we all had boots, black
tights, little miniskirts,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.470
a little kind of British hat on.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.430
And we went around the
communities just campaigning

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.120
for then Assemblyman Leo Ryan.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.980
And that's how it all started.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: And you continued
to work for Leo Ryan when you went

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.150 position:56%
to UC Davis and as you were going
to law school as well in California.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.580
Can you tell us a little
bit about Leo Ryan?

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.720
He had a unique view of his
job as a representative.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.570
He became your political mentor.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.220
So can you talk to us a little
bit about what Leo Ryan was like?

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.510
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: So he was --

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.470
I always said he ate
bureaucrats for lunch.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:44.850
He had this inquisitive sense
of wanting to know more.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.280
And he was, you know, a teacher by
profession, so he taught history

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.250
and government and English.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.820
And he, you know, told me that
I didn't know how to write

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.990
when he read my paper in college.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.530
And it was actually a critical
analysis of his operation.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.250
And I had gotten an A-minus on it.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.610
He crossed the A-minus out and put
C-minus and said I didn't know how

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.730
to write and he was
going to teach me.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.120
But he also had this sense
of being experiential.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.690
Because he had a healthy
sense of skepticism,

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.250
he wanted to do things himself.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.580
So after the riots in Los
Angeles, he went down there

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.190
and taught school there for a week.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.140
He wanted to look at the criminal
justice system in California,

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:39.920
so he put himself in Folsom
Prison for a week to evaluate that

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.370
and actually wrote a play
based on his experience there

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.740
that never got published.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:53.030
But so he had by his very core this
sense of wanting to see firsthand.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.880
There was nothing like being
there as opposed to listening

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.250
to some advisor tell you
about a particular issue.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.530
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: When you were
working for Congressman Ryan

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.380
as a senior legal counsel
after you had graduated,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.800
after you had earned
your law degree,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:16.500
in 1978 Congressman Ryan decided
that he would lead a delegation

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.950
to Guyana to visit the
Peoples Temple commune

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.360
that Jim Jones had
assembled in Guyana.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.430
And you were a senior part of his
Congressional staff at that time.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.850
Can you tell us about the
decision that Congressman Ryan made

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.610
to actually lead this delegation?

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.630
Why did he decide to go to
visit Jonestown and knowing

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.080
that it was a dangerous --
could be a dangerous trip?

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.380
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier:
Well, first of all,

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.700
I don't think he thought
it was dangerous.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.590
He presumed that he had
a Congressional shield,

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.660 position:56%
that that would somehow protect him.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.560 position:56%
Mind you, there were no military
escorts that joined us on that trip.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.890
He had had a friend whose son had
been involved in the Peoples Temple

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.940
who was mysteriously
killed at a railroad tracks.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.550
We had a number of
constituents in the San Mateo part

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.560
of the district whose young
adult kids got involved

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.200
in the Peoples Temple.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.290
It was a huge church
in San Francisco.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:20.540 position:56%
Jim Jones was very politically
active and connected and served both

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.140
on the human rights commission
and then on the housing authority.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.980
So had it wired there.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:32.740
There was a group of family
members that came about concerned

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.400
about loved ones in Jonestown.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.970
There was a couple who had
been part of the Peoples Temple

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.540
who had their son who
was still in Jonestown

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.140
that they wanted to get out.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.170
And so this all kind
of came together.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.570
We have lots of meetings.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.350
There was a member of the
Peoples Temple who had fled

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.730
through the embassy in
Georgetown, Guyana and come back

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.350
to San Francisco that we
interviewed who talked about all

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.090
of these horrendous activities
going on -- the sexual assault,

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.880
the physical assault, the gun
running, the mind control.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.980 position:56%
So it was on that basis -- he was
chairing a subcommittee on oversight

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.770
of American citizens abroad -- that
he decided that he was going to do

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.780
like he did before, and that
was to go see firsthand.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.350
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So you traveled
to Guyana, and you did get to go

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.320
to Jonestown to see the
Peoples Temple commune.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.580
You were there for a number
of days and there was unrest.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.350
And there was even an
assassination attempt

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.730
on Congressman Ryan's
life while you were there.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.420
And it was decided there
was some people maybe wanted

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.350
to leave Jonestown,
there was defectors.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.010
And it was decided that you
would vacate, that you would head

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.720
to the airstrip and
there would be planes

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.610
that would be there
to transport you.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.170
And when you were there, there
was an ambush from people

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.530
from the Peoples Temple,
actually, and they shot

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.280
and killed Congressman Ryan
along with four other people

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.830
and severely wounded
you in the process.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.140
Since it was such a remote
airstrip, you actually stayed there

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.590
for 22 hours without medical
attention or really any help.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.810
So can you take us back
to that day and talk to us

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.920
about what you were
thinking when that happened

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.570
and how this affected
your future career path

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.770
and your future career
in public service?

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.350
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: So just
to take you back a little bit,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.140
we were in the commune
for about 20, 24 hours,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.440
maybe a little bit less than that.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.440
We got there, we had a tour.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.700
We started meeting
with family members.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:52.690
There was really a script that
they were basically all reading

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.990
in their minds.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.380 position:56%
And it was, you know, pretty
obvious that there was mind control.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.930
One of the reporters who was on
the trip, Don Harris from NBC,

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.510
was walking around the perimeter
of the pavilion smoking a cigarette

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.110
and two people slipped him notes.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.480
That's the first indication we
had that people wanted to leave.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.790
So we were there overnight.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.040
The next morning I retrieved
them and their belongings,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.760
and then word spread and more
and more people wanted to leave.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.060
And then it became clear

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.210
that we didn't have
enough room in the plane.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.710
So we were going to
do the first air lift

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.070
and I was going to leave with them.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.200 position:56%
And Congressman Ryan was going to
stay behind with probably another 40

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.420
or 50 people that wanted to leave.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.900
There was then the
knifing attempt on him.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.810
The truck was about to leave.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.700
We stopped, he got into the
truck, we went to the airstrip.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.770
Unbeknownst to us, there was a
tractor-trailer following behind us

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.930
with seven gunmen on it.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.540
I'm coaxing a little Guyanese
child out of the airplane

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.770 position:56%
because he had scampered up into it.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.610
And we didn't have
enough seats as it was.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.840
So I was trying to coax him
out so I could put people

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.360
on the plane -- on the two planes.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.400
And all of a sudden
this noise broke out.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.060
And at first, I had no
understanding of what it was.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.080
People ran into the bush.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.750
Congressman Ryan ran
under the plane.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.870
And so I followed suit and
hid underneath a wheel.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.670
They came and they had ID'd
who they wanted to kill.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.980
And so they shot us
at point-blank range.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.330
Congressman Ryan was shot 45 times.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
And you could be helpful to me

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.050
because I always say I think he's
the only Congressman in the history

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.530
of this country who's been
assassinated in the line of duty.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.380
But I've never been able
to absolutely confirm it.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.950
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: That's,
I think, true, actually.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.810
Because I remember when I worked
at CRS this was an inquiry

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.110
that we had, that we worked on.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.410
So I actually remember that.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.710
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: Okay.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.010
All right.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:46.680
And I was lying there, playing
dead and was shot five times.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.510
The whole right side of
my body was blown up.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.910
And I looked down and there was
a bone shooting out of my arm

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.660
and my leg was totally blown up.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.740
And so what happens in a
moment like that is that you --

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.320
you know, you're in
shock, of course.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.010
But it was almost like
my mind was telling me

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.880 position:56%
that half my body was good and half
my body wasn't, and I was just going

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:17.100
to ignore the half of my body
that, you know, wasn't relevant.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.880
I was lying there and
literally what do you do

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.180
when you think you're dying?

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.480
I mean, I thought,
"My God, this is it.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.990
I'm 28 years old.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.290
This is it.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.590
I'm not going to live to be 85.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.980
I'm not going to get
married and have 2.5 kids

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.830
and live happily ever after.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.130
This is it."

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.050
So I was raised as a
good Catholic girl.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:41.370
And the first thing I did
was say the act of contrition

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.730
and literally waited for
the lights to go out.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:49.260 position:56%
And when they didn't, my grandmother
who is in her mid 80's kind

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.560
of flashed in front of me.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.040
And she was this powerful
matriarch in my family.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.150
And I said, "I'm not
going to have her live

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.560
through my funeral
if I can avoid it."

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.860
So I kind of dragged my body
to the cargo hold of the plane

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.420
because the engines
were still running.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.250
And one of the reporters actually
from the <i>Washington Post</i> came

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.460
up behind me and said,
"Hurry up, Jackie."

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.170
I can't. So he shoves
me into the cargo hold.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.340 position:56%
And the plane wasn't going anywhere.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.320
There were bullet holes through
the engine and one of the wheels.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.870
And eventually they took
me out of the plane,

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.320
put me on the side of the airstrip.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.650
Unfortunately, it was
on an ant hill.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.830
But you don't sweat the small
stuff when you're dying.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:40.600
So one of the reporters had a tape
recorder nearby, and I asked him

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.980
if I could leave a
message for my parents.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:50.030
And so I tape recorded a message to
my parents and kind of a last will.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.500
And then was on that airstrip for
22 hours without medical attention.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.670
There was a tent nearby,
so they put me in the tent.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:03.440
And through the night the producer
for the NBC affiliate would come

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:09.290
over to the tent because they were
now at a bar in Matthew's Ridge.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.260
He would bring a bottle of rum --

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.450
Guyanese rum -- for
me to take swigs of.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.290
And it was very potent,
Guyanese rum.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.070
So that's how I got
through the night.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:27.050
But it was those moments
that I decided if I survived,

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.810
I would never take a
never day for granted,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.270
and that I would live every
day as fully as possible,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.060
and that I would commit
my life to public service.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.380
And so that was kind of one
of those defining moments.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.850
And it really provided
me an extraordinary gift

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.180
because at a very young
age I learned

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.540
that there were no tomorrows --
no tomorrows were guaranteed --

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.260
and how precious every moment was.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:58.750
And once you've almost died,
you're not afraid nearly as much

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:04.100
to do things that others
might see as a little risky.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.650
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: As you
recovered, you decided to run

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.380
for Congressman Ryan's seat.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.570
And you didn't win the primary,
but you quickly pivoted after that

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:19.230
and ran for a local supervisor's
election and you did win that seat.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.180
And you went on to have a very
distinguished career in local

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.990
and state politics serving in
the California legislature,

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.270
both in the assembly
and also in the Senate.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.450
Can you talk to us about your
time in local and state politics?

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.770 position:56%
What lessons did you learn in state
and local politics that prepared you

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.480
to be a member of Congress?

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.560
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: I think the
lessons I learned really stemmed

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.180
from Congressman Ryan.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.810
I mean, just not being
afraid to go after something.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.000
And I remember one of
the first issues I dealt

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.490
with was a local utility had
a transformer that spewed

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.090
out PCB's in someone's backyard.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.900
And they said, "Oh, no,
this is not a problem."

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.200
And I took them on.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.560
It was Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.400
It's no small utility, right?

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.480
Ironically, I'd have another
experience with them more recently.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.680
And so, you know, I learned
early on that you can go

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.010
up against very powerful
interests and succeed.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:22.120
So it was, you know, a lesson
that has held me in good stead.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.390
And you know, I like slaying
dragons or at least trying to.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.600
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: In 2007 --
we are the Library of Congress,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.580
so we like to talk about books.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.560
So in 2007 you published this book,

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.310
<i>This is Not the Life I
Ordered</i> with three other women.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.780
Can you tell us the story of this
book, why did you write this book

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.210
and how did you come to write
it with three of your friends?

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.220
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: So this
book was five years in the making.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.110
A group of friends and I would
get together once a month

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.690
to help each other,
to support each other.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.650
We'd all gone through
traumatic experiences.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:01.000
I had lost my husband in
an automobile accident

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.700
when I was pregnant with
our second child 14 years

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.000
after Guyana happened.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.560
And I'd always thought everyone
gets their fair share of grief,

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.220
but then that happened and it
was incredibly devastating.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.580
So we would get together
and have lunch.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.540
And the rationale for getting
together every month was

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.210
that we were going to write a book.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.450
We never put pen to paper
for the first four years

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.360
and then eventually
did and wrote the book.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:32.030
And it became a -- and we told
stories, not just our own but those

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.100
of other women who had gone
through very difficult times.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.570
And it became kind of a how-to
book of how do you get through it?

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.710
What are the tips?

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.220
You know, creating a
gratitude journal was one

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.270
of the tips that we suggested.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.580
And the first day it may be
only that your dog didn't pee

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.650
in the carpet, but, you know, the
next day it may be something else.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:20:00.260
And we also suggested that what
we had created was really key

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.020
to our being able to survive.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.190
And that was what we
called kitchen table.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.630
So getting a group
of people together

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.110
as a kitchen table
that would support you.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.630
And that's the only reason it
exists, is just to be together.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.260
And I've noticed in my life that I
have a number of groups like that.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:23.300
I have -- we created a married
widows club after I lost my husband

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.050
and then a friend lost her husband.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.030
And she's actually one of
the co-authors of the book.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.900
And so over the years
there's been about 14 of us.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.800
No one wants to join
this particular club.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.300
But it has been a great
source of support.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.450 position:56%
And then I have my yoga girlfriends.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.460
And for the longest time
we actually did yoga,

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.480
and now we just kind of
go on trips together.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.950
[ Laughter ]

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.250
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: In 2008 you ran

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.740
for Congress again;
this time you won.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.640
You represent the home district
where it all started from

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.610
and the same district that
Congressman Ryan once represented.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.990
You're a member of
the minority party

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.390
in the House of Representatives.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.690
You're a Democrat.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:06.150
Tell us about what motivates
your service to Congress.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.880 position:56%
You're the member of a minority
party in a majoritarian institution.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.840
The House runs by --
typically by majority rules.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.920
So what motivates your
service when serving

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.450
in an institution that's not
incredibly popular these days?

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.750
But you love it.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.790
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: Yes,
I'm part of the 10% or 11%

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.250
that John McCain talks about.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:32.260 position:56%
So the backdrop here is that I spent
18 years in the state legislature

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.630
in California and had
300 bills signed into law

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.410
by mostly Republican governors.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.350
So I come here wide eyed and
bushy tailed thinking I'm going

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:45.400 position:56%
to take all I've learned in the
state legislature and apply it here,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.540
except there's a lot
of differences, right?

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.000
You introduce a bill and you
can dust it off every two

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.980
or three years, but it's not
necessarily ever going to be heard.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.480
That wasn't the case in California.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.620
Every bill got heard.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.580
Seniority here is as important
as being in the majority,

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.410
that you really have
to wait your turn.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:13.550
And it is a very hierarchical
environment.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:17.000
And since I've been here,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.020
we have been in the
minority most of the time.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.980
The first two years I
was in the majority,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.080
didn't know how lucky I had it.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:31.430
So I would say that I'm an
optimist and I have the belief

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.070
that we will be in
the majority again

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.410
and that we will be
able to do good work.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.150
And I think my job now
being in the minority is

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.030
to say the emperor has no clothes
when the emperor has no clothes,

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:48.830
to be that voice that
calls our colleagues

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.940
out when they're not speaking on
behalf of the American people.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.310
I brought some slides to show you.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.840
Maybe this is a good
time to do that?

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.140
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.130
Well, I'd like to talk
about your approach to some

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.850
of your House floor speeches,
which is a bit unusual these days.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.750 position:56%
A lot of times members come to the
House floor, they use talking points

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.770
that are provided to
them by your party.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.500
But you have a different approach
when you talk on the House floor;

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.920
you draw from personal experience,
you're not afraid necessarily

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.560
to call out perceived
double standards practiced

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.860
by some of your colleagues.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.010
So tell us a little
bit about your style.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.870
Is this sort of spontaneous when
you go on the floor and you decide

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.950
to make these types of speeches?

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.240
And how has your frank rhetoric
-- has it had an impact?

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.480
Have you seen an effect
by your approach?

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.380
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: I
so first realized the power

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.120
of the floor one night
when we were debating.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.660
The Republicans had just
taken over in the House.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.480
And the very first bill
they introduced was H.R. 1,

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.430
which was to defund Planned
Parenthood to the tune

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.280
of $400 million or $500 million.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.820
And we were sitting on the floor.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.570
It was late in the evening.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:05.200
And I was going to get up
and speak on the hypocrisy

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.260
of somehow defunding
Planned Parenthood

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:13.380
because one clerk misspoke at
a Planned Parenthood office

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.330
and somehow that was
reason to defund it.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:22.680
Meanwhile, Halliburton had
bribed foreign countries

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:28.300 position:56%
and was still getting billion-dollar
contracts from the US government.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.830
So that's what I was
going to talk about.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.040
The member right before me on the
Republican side started reading

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.100
from a book about second
term abortions.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.820
And he talked about
the sawing off of legs.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.570
And I thought, "Oh my God.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.220
How can he be talking like this?"

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:52.090
So I kind of threw away my script
so to speak and ended up talking

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.480
about a second term abortion I had.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.780
And I remember finishing
and trembling.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:07.970
And then John Lewis came up to
me and he had tears in his eyes.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:12.000 position:56%
And he said, "Jackie that's the
most powerful speech I've ever heard

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.300
on the floor."

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.560
Well, coming from John Lewis,
you can imagine how I felt.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:21.020
He said, "It reminded me of
when my aunt was living with us.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.410
And one day she walked down the
stairs in a blood-stained gown.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:31.260
My mother took her to the hospital
and she never came home again."

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.870
And then, of course,
it took off virally.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:39.030
And I realized for the first
time the power of the floor.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.170
And as I got into the issue of
sexual assault in the military,

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:49.320 position:56%
I started telling stories of men and
women who were sexually assaulted

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.900
in the military whose lives
had been totally destroyed.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.870
So that's how it first evolved.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:26:03.040
And then I recognized that, you
know, you can bore people to death

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.720 position:56%
with what you say on the House floor
or you can try and have an impact.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.390
So these are some of the slides
we're going to show you now.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.860
I do want to say at the
outset I can't begin

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.920
to tell you how important
your service is to all

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.540
of us as members of Congress.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:25.110
I've had many of you come in over
the years to brief me on issues,

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:29.480
and what you do on our
behalf is really priceless.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.930
So I'm sure you are here
because you believe in Congress

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.900
and love Congress and are doing
it for all the right reasons.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.320
And I just want to give
you a shout out for being

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.190
so very good at what you do.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.070
Okay. So let's start.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:53.680
This is -- is this a
chamber of Congress

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.630
or is this a doctor's office?

00:26:55.630 --> 00:27:02.420
And I actually wore a white
doctor's coat onto the House floor

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.250
to make that particular speech.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:05.550
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
And these were props

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.850
that you have in your [inaudible].

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.150
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: Yes.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.450
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
These were next to you?

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.750
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: Right.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.600
I'm big on doing posters.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:20.100 position:56%
This was done -- I was very outraged
when Ray Rice and Ray McDonald --

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:26.380
both big football players
-- were not, you know,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.530
taken out of the games
once it was disclosed

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.450
that they had committed
domestic violence.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.330
And so this was an effort to try

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.900
and get some public
engagement on that issue.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:45.940
And the point was, you
know, put them on the bench.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.790
Whenever someone is charged
with sexual harassment

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:53.120
or domestic violence, I mean,
they basically are sidelined.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.900 position:56%
You know, they either fire typically
or if you're a police officer

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.870
and there's undue force
used in a crime,

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.970
potentially you're put
on administrative leave.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.570
And that's what I was just
suggesting with that one.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:15.290
This was a floor speech because
the Republicans had decided

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:20.010
to sue President Obama because
of the Affordable Care Act.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.640
So my point was there
was no standing.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.220
It's taxpayer money being wasted.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.800
It was useless, it was a political
stunt, it was inconsistent,

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.210
it was a distraction,
and it was also stupid.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.660
This one I actually haven't
done on the House floor yet.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.330
But I was pretty outraged when
Burger King decided it was going

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:48.000
to invert and join with
Tim Horton in Canada.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.930
So I actually had an amendment

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.660
to the National Defense
Authorization Act so require

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.810
that any company that
inverts could not continue

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.960
to have a government contract.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.300
Burger King has 187
installations at military bases

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.930
across not just the United
States but all over the world.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.320
And, you know, they get free
space, free electricity.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.450
I don't think they pay
for the employees there.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.440
It's just, you know,
a great boondoggle.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.040
And here they are, they're
renouncing for all intents

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.860
and purposes their US citizenship
so to speak and inverting.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:33.170
So this is a Whopper.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:37.470 position:56%
And you probably can't see it there,
but it shows the amount of money

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:44.400
that the -- I think it's
something like $356 million

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.720
in subsidized services that
taxpayers pay because they pay

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.930
such low wages, their
offshore profits,

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.870
avoiding paying US capital
gains -- $82 million --

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.310
and avoiding paying foreign
earnings tax, $275 million.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:04.140
So the total is $1.6 billion.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:11.660
Now, ironically that amendment
was in the NDAA last year on box.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.700
So it wasn't going to be taken up
until one of the members pulled it

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.140
and said, "Well, wait a minute.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.690
This is legal."

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:23.340
And so it got taken out and
we ended up not putting it in.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.610
So they're continuing to
run their Burger Kings

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.940
on military installations.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.680 position:56%
This was another one from last year.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.400
They decided they were
going after the sage grouse

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.860
and the lesser prairie chicken

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.710
and take them off the
endangered species list.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:45.780
And it has no basis in the
National Defense Authorization Act.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.050
So we decided that we'd mock it
a little bit on the House floor.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:55.120
And so there's an RPG on
that lesser prairie chicken,

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.310 position:56%
and we're commenting on the
national security threat that it is.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:04.980
I've got very talented
staff members [inaudible].

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.240
And this we've started doing.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.720
I was particularly incensed.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.640
I mean, I'm a victim
of gun violence.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:19.770
I know what it's like to
survive and, you know,

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.430
overcome the trauma
associated with it.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:27.280 position:56%
That doesn't begin to deal with
those who die and the family members

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.470
who are left to somehow put
their lives back together again.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.010
And so these moments of silence
on the House floor had just got

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.540
to the point where I
couldn't take it anymore.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.340
And I actually walked out.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.000
And the <i>LA Times</i>
reporter happened to see me.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.640
And I said, "You know,
this is hypocritical.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.170
You have a moment of silence
and then you're silent."

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:55.660
And it's only these high
celebrity almost shootings

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.420
that we do a moment of silence.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:04.680
So I've started to go onto the
House floor every month and talk

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:09.110
about each and every person who's
been murdered in a mass shooting.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.990
Now, a mass shoot is
four or more people

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.120
that have been injured or killed.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:19.840
And these are the pictures
of those who were victims

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.350
of mass shootings in April.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.290
And you can't necessarily
tell it because some

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.680
of them are individual pictures,
but the number of families

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.910
that get gunned down
is extraordinary.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.820
There was a great piece in
the <i>New York Times</i> on Monday

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.470
that you probably saw that kind
of talks about all of those

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.570
who never get a moment of
silence on the House floor.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.200
But what's the point?

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.750
What is the point?

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:53.430 position:56%
And so that's what we've been doing.

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.380
And we've now posted a
wall outside my office.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.320
If you looked at the number
of people who died since 1970

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.590
from gun violence and compared
it to the Vietnam Memorial,

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:09.200
it would be two and
a half miles long.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.550
It would have 400,000 names on it.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:19.320
And there were, I think, 41
mass shootings in April --

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:24.490
more than there are
days of the month.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.020
We had a lot of fun with this.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.420
We did a whole series
on the price is wrong.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.630
And it was about spare
parts in the military budget

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:37.300
and how much money is wasted
in the spare parts budget.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.920
We have a DLA -- it's a
defense logistics agency --

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.780
it's like the big Home
Depot that they're supposed

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.100
to get their spare parts from.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.070
But then they end up buying
them from contractors.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:57.000
And so an elbow, a plastic HVC
elbow that would cost a dollar

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.730
at Home Depot we paid $80 for.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.770
So this is one of those efforts
where we did the price is wrong.

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:08.090
How much does this really cost
and how much did we pay for it?

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:14.730
This one, you may wonder why I have
a vodka bottle on the House floor.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:20.520
I was walking into the Speaker's
Lobby with this bottle of vodka,

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:26.750
a steak that had been
cooked, and a phony jar

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.640
of caviar on a silver plate.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.960
And the parliamentarian came
up to me and said, "Ms. Speier,

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.350
we can't have demonstrations
on the floor."

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.430
I said, "How is this
a demonstration?"

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:42.460
Or an exhibition -- he
used some term of art.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.640 position:56%
And he says, "It's the silver tray."

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.550
I said okay.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:50.820
So I took the items
on the House floor.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.180
And you're going to probably
wonder what I was doing here.

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:57.320 position:56%
Well, I was offended because we were

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:02.650
about to cut the food
stamp budget by 50%.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:08.900
But just that month a number of
my colleagues had taken trips --

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:15.890 position:56%
codels -- around the world and were
dining in Russia on vodka and caviar

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.720
and in Argentina on steaks.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:24.270
And I thought that on the one
hand, you know, it's okay for them

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:28.680
to be -- have their food
stamp program, but we're going

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.900
to take food away from the
poorest in our country.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.230
So this one, I don't know if
it's going to be able to play,

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:36.970
but this got to be kind of funny.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:44.200
And there was a piece that was
a parody that was done on it.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.520
Thank you, [inaudible]
California 14 we have

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.600
about 4,000 families
who are on food stamps.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:57.350
But some of my colleagues have
thousands and thousands more.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.840
Yet they somehow feel
like crusaders,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.380
like heroes when they
vote to cut food stamps.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.690
Some of these same members
travel to foreign countries

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:11.400
under the guise of
official business.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.960
They dine at lavish restaurants,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:21.910
eating steak, vodka,
and even caviar.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.830
They receive money to do this.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:29.410
That's right, they don't pay
out-of-pocket for these meals.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.900
Let me give you a few examples.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:40.690
One member was given $127.41 a day
for food on his trip to Argentina.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.980
He probably had a fair
amount of steak.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:48.990
Another member was
given $3,588 for food

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:52.560
and lodging during a
six-day trip to Russia.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.870
He probably drank a
fair amount of vodka

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:58.080
and probably even had some caviar.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:03.720
That particular member has
21,000 food stamp recipients

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.020
in his district.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:11.400
One of those people who is on
food stamps could live a year

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.600
on what this Congressman spent
on food and lodging for six days.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:21.720
Another 20 members made a
trip to Dublin, Ireland.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:27.830
They got $166 a day for food.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.360
These members didn't pay a dime.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.930 position:56%
They received $50, $100, almost $200

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:37.150
for a single meal only
for themselves.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:41.080
Yet for them the idea of helping
fellow Americans spend less

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:46.160
than $5 a day makes
their skin crawl.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.590
The families of veterans,
of farmers, of the disabled,

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:53.680
of the working poor are
not visible to them --

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.150
not even when they are
their own constituents.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.420
Last week a man named Ron
Shaich wrote in an article

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.000
on his LinkedIn page
about food stamps.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.790
Ron is the founder, chairman,
and CEO of Panera Bread.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:12.140
In this article Ron admitted that
despite wanting to fight poverty

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.040
and hunger in America, he
really didn't know what it was

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.480
like to be truly hungry.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.640
And so this week Ron is
taking the SNAP challenge --

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.760
the millionaire food mogul
is living on $4.50 a day.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.320
I've taken the SNAP
challenge in the past,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.590
and I can tell you it is
a horrible experience.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:37.710
You think about food constantly.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.990
You are always hungry.

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:46.440
But those on food stamps
live on $4.50 every day --

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.240
not for one week -- for
long into their future.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.230
That is soul crushing.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.930
Historically food stamps have
been part of the farm bill.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.430
It's that same bill that
26 corporate farmers

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.400
who remain nameless
get $1 million each

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.900
in subsidizes meant
for real farmers.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.590
The taxpayers are giving $7 billion
per year to large agribusiness,

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:18.600
yet Republicans feel SNAP
programs cost us too much money.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.220
They want to cut it.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.840
Mr. Speaker, I can stand
here and say that my point is

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.540
about saving food stamps
from cuts -- that's true.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:33.640 position:56%
But my larger point is about us as a
country, as a society, as neighbors.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.550
I'm a member of the
least-productive Congress

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:39.140
in the history of this country.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.200
I'm ashamed of that.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.760
To be honest, if the federal
government shut down for a couple

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.790
of weeks as we keep hearing,
would [inaudible] even notice?

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:53.790
When a government of the people or
for the people becomes a government

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:58.720
in spite of the people, then
who are we really serving?

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.560
If we refuse to take care of
those who are the most vulnerable

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.750
at a tiny fraction of the costs
of, say, our defense budget,

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.720
don't we cease to be
true public servants?

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.730
Ron Shaich is putting
himself in the worn-out shoes

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.650
of 48 million fellow Americans.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.550
I'm ready to do the same again.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.220
I wonder how many of my
Republican colleagues would want

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:26.120
to cut food stamps if they
had taken the SNAP challenge?

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:32.100
After all, that means no more
steak, no more caviar or vodka.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.850
Based on these members'
eating habits,

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.510
I wonder if they could survive.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.810
I yield back.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:44.380
So there was just one last
one I wanted to show you.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.580
There it is.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.950
So this is another way that
you can make public policy.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:53.340
This is a bill I introduced,
never had a hearing,

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.680
never got voted on but became law.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.890
And that's how sometimes
we get things done,

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.990
by introducing the bill,
others recognize the importance

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:04.380
of doing something about it.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.570
This was a bill introduced to
tell the Treasury Department

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:11.420
to stop minting the dollar coins
because no one was using them

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:16.800
and we were spending $300
million a year to store them.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.180 position:56%
So I introduced the bill and three
months later the Treasury Department

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.660
decided that they were
going to stop minting them.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.120
Okay.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.420
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Perfect.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.560
Our last question today is
just a general question:

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:33.430
What's next for you, both
personally or professionally?

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.930
What can we expect
from you in the future?

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:40.360
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: So
my life has never been one

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.190
that you could plan or predict.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:47.200
I was 29 years from the
first time I ran for Congress

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.710
to the second time
I ran for Congress.

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:52.950
That's a record in this Congress.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.680
I never had any intentions
of coming back to Congress.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.550
Once I left, I was done.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.790
So I don't know what's next.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.800
We can't, I think,
plan out our lives

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.780
because there's always
something that will intervene.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.760
So I'm going to just
continue to make mischief.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.060
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Okay, terrific.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.510
We can now take some
questions from the audience.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:29.730
[ Inaudible ]

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.570
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: That's
a very good question --

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.990
does it help me kind
of respond to veterans?

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.290
Absolutely it does.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:41.010
I mean, I was on an airstrip under
fire for a couple of minutes,

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:49.020
and yet, our men and women who
serve are there day in, day out,

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:53.800
enduring the most incredible
atrocities.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.920
I spent the night -- and you can
see where Congressman Ryan has kind

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.220
of filtered through my life --

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.010
I spent the night at
a homeless shelter

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.830
in my district a couple years ago.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:10.650
And around 1:00 a.m. -- I'd
been talking to lots of people.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.160
And it was very edifying.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.580
Because the first people I met
were two people who were working.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.390
One was working at Safeway in the
bakery and the other was working

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:23.070
in the warehouse at Office Max.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:26.310
And working people living
in a homeless shelter.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.690
But about 1:00 a.m.
this one gentleman comes

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:33.930
up to me and tells me his story.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:41.390
He was a veteran, he got out, he
had a six-figure job at Oracle,

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:45.390
and then he hit a downward
spiral -- drugs and alcohol --

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:51.830
and was last at the rehab program
at Menlo Park in my district.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.660 position:56%
He looked me in the eye and he said,

00:43:54.660 --> 00:44:02.380
"You have no idea what my
country forced me to do in Iraq."

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.340
And we don't.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.640
We have no idea.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.550
So post-traumatic stress is real.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:14.030
For that nanosecond that I was
under fire, I had repercussions

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.940
of it for a very long time.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.980
Twenty-one gun salutes
would send me into orbit.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:23.100
Firecrackers going off
would make me twitch.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:30.520
So it is a very real result of war.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.530
And, you know, we now know that,
what, 30% or 40% of those returning

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:44.510
from war are suffering
from PTSD [inaudible].

00:44:44.510 --> 00:45:10.460
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.260
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: Well,
there's so many stories.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:16.880
I mean, and I experience
them all the time.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.650
You know, I'll be at the grocery
store and people will come up to me

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:27.040
and thank me because [inaudible]
after the Great Recession hit.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.700
What do you do when 10% of your
population is out of a job?

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:36.160
So we started posting these
job hunters boot camps

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:40.090
that were not just job fairs
with the opportunity to match

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:43.700
with an employer, but also
how do you retrain yourself?

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.810
If you're middle-aged,
you lost your job,

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:51.100
how do you avoid the
discrimination that's so obvious?

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.130
How do you use social media?

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.370
So I've had lots of people
that have come up to me

00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:00.050
and said, "I finally got a job."

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:05.020
And you could see that their lives
-- that they had been reborn.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:09.290
Or people with mortgages
were [inaudible].

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:17.560
I keep a helmet on the shelf in my
office that was signed by a number

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.270
of victims -- survivors -- of
sexual assault in the military.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:27.860
And that's just a constant reminder
that the work is really important

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:32.400
that we do and that sometimes it's
a huge boulder that we're pushing

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.440
up a hill and we never think
we're going to get it up.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.090
I mean, that's a great example with
sexual assault in the military.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.290
I mean, yes, it should be taken
out of the chain of command.

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:42.940 position:56%
That's what my legislation would do.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:46.370
But we have gotten a number
of significant improvements

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.900
to the Uniform Code of Military
Justice in the last five years

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.740
by some of the amendments
that we have gotten

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.880
into the law that's
improved the status of those

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.800
who are sexually assaulted.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.650
I continue to be concerned
about whistleblowers

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:04.290
and the retaliation
that they endure.

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:08.450 position:56%
And we're dealing with that kind of
issue in the intelligence committee.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:13.190
So those are all issues that I
feel very strongly about and intend

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.220
to be here to see them through.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.930
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: We have
one question over here.

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:19.520
Oh no, no, no.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:23.730
You over here and then over here.

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.280
&gt;&gt; Hi. I want to thank
you for your work

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.280
on sexual assault in the military.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.120
And I'm wondering if you
had done any studies --

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.350
and this is on behalf
on a cousin of mine --

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:35.180
on the link between sexual
assault in the military

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.830
and our epidemic of
military suicides?

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:42.760
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: I
have not done any studies,

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:47.710
but I know that there
is some link to that.

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.960
Because you can just see the
downward spiral that takes place.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.900
What I was astonished by as
I got to meet more and more

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:02.320
of these survivors is
particularly the women were legacy.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.180 position:56%
I mean, their fathers and
grandfathers and uncles had all been

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:10.190
in the military and this
was a family commitment.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:14.390
And because it's an all volunteer
military now, these are people

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:17.300
who join because they want
to make a career of it.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.940
And because they're sexually
assaulted and they report it,

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:24.930
they basically lose their jobs.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:28.170
They're labeled with
personality disorder.

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:36.310
Imagine a DD214 that you then
take to a future employer

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:38.180
and it says you have a
personality disorder.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:40.760 position:56%
I mean, that's what they were doing.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:44.150
So you could see how their
lives could easily unravel

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:53.620 position:56%
and that suicide would be, you know,
their alternative to continuing

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.510
to live in a state
that was unacceptable.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:03.510
But I have not actually done any
kind of study on that [inaudible].

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:16.590
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:16.590 --> 00:49:19.690
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier: Well,
my schedule is not typical.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.470
I don't know what typical is.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:28.960
You know, the very first campaign I
ran for after I lost for Congress,

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.700
I was running for the board
of supervisors and I was told

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:35.340
"Make this call, you're going
to get a $250 contribution."

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.660
And I hemmed and hawed
and then I made the call

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.560
and I got $100 contribution.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:44.100
So I've never been good at this.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.750
So I'm not the type that
will get on the phone

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:50.870
and just raise money
for the most part.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:53.390
I will do an event in my district.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:55.980
And people will come to the event.

00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:00.670
But I would say in terms
of doing events back here,

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:05.160
maybe four hours a month?

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.720
Not what I would say is typical.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.920
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Other questions?

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.620
Yes, right here [inaudible].

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:17.920
&gt;&gt; Last question.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.510
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Last question, okay.

[ Inaudible ]

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.500
&gt;&gt; Rep. Jackie Speier:
That's a very good question.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:24.200 position:56%
When we were about to make the trip,

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.400
the State Department kept
telling us, "You know,

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:32.040
we can't force Jim
Jones to meet with you.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.630
You have to get an
invitation on your own.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:36.970
We have visited the commune.

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:38.980
They seem very happy.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:44.020
Everyone seems to be
glad to be there."

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.760
Meanwhile, you know, we've already
had some defectors who have come

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.730
through the councilor office.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:55.930
We had a briefing in the
embassy in Georgetown a day

00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:58.850
or two before we actually
went to Jonestown.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:01.720
And they provided us
with a slide show.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.200
Now mind you, the slide
show had a picture

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:09.810
of our two councilor officers
with Jim Jones arm in arm.

00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:12.980
What kind of message
was that sending?

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:24.170 position:56%
So I was pretty critical of State in
terms of their lack of recognition

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:27.850
that they had a responsibility
to follow up on so many

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:31.370
of these inquiries that had been
made about people being held there

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:37.010
against their will, Social Security
checks being improperly handled.

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:43.920
And I believe that the political
trumped the councilor function

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.220
in that regard.

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.820
And bauxite was a very
important component.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:52.580
We were importing a lot of
bauxite from Guyana at the time.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:57.230
And I think those interests trumped
the interests of Americans citizen

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.710
that were being held
there against their will.

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:03.220

join me in thanking --

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.590

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:08.890
I should have had known.

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:10.650

to leave you with you've got a sense

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:24.520
of how my life has meandered,
and I didn't touch on the loss

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:28.780
of my husband when I was
pregnant with our second child.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:33.510
But it was another traumatic
experience in my life.

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:35.310
But I've learned something
that's very important.

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:37.320
And the quotation I want
to share with you is one

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:41.750
that I hope you will keep in mind.
