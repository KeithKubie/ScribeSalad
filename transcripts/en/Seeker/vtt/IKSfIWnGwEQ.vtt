00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.360
The holidays are a time to be kind to one
another. To show each other generosity, even

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.400
if we get nothing in return. That’s why
I think the season’s mascot should be the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.790
vampire bat. You heard me.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.279
Hey festive friends, Julian here for DNews.
Bats get a bad rap for pretty much no reason.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.519
Some of them eat fruit, a lot of them eat
insects, but three species out of 1300 suck

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.640
blood and suddenly they’re associated with
Count Dracula forever. It’s just three!

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.820
Three species! [[count laugh]]

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.210
So I’m here today to try and convince you
that bats should be a symbol of the holiday

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.750
season. And because I like making my life
difficult, I’m going to nominate the vampire

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.750
bat.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.870
First off I am going to temper the freaky
factor of vampire bats by saying that them

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.989
sucking blood isn’t even that bad. Ok it’s
still pretty freaky but hear me out. First

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.360
off, they don’t drink enough blood to harm
their… let’s call them blood donors. Usually

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.250
cows and horses, and almost never humans…
almost. They land on the ground near them,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.290
gallop over in a not at all horrifying way,
and bite with their little sharp teeth. Incidentally

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.610
the common vampire bat is the only species
of bat in the world that can run. Then they

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.369
just kick back and lap up blood with their
tongues for the next half hour. The blood

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.240
doesn’t clot because the bat’s saliva
has an anticoagulant called desmoteplase (desmo-tea-plaze),

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.619
also known as draculin. Seriously. And yeah,
the bites may get infected but c’mon, it’s

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.909
not like vampire bats know about antiseptics.
Cut them some slack.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.090
Alright I’m not doing a great job of defending
the bat’s honor but consider this: vampire

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.079
bats are actually really generous to each
other. You see, if a vampire bat goes two

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.000
days without feeding, it’ll starve. They’re
just tiny little mammals after all. They need

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.240
to be able to fly so they can’t have any
fat stores weighing them down. And if you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.631
would just spare a little blood they’d be
fine, but no, you had to be selfish. Like

00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:48.649
you need ALL your blood. But female vampire
bats are better people than you. If a friend

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.680
is going hungry, the bat will vomit blood
into its mouth. Isn’t that sweet?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.180
It’s an example of a “you scratch my upside
down back, I scratch yours” philosophy,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.560
or reciprocal altruism and was first reported
by University of Maryland biologist Gerald

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.920
Wilkinson in 1984. Female bats actually keep
track of who has helped them out in the past,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.629
and when they’re asked to donate food to
their friends, they’ll do it without any

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.200
fuss. If they’re also on an empty stomach
that night, they’ll make up for it later

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.250
by being extra giving. And if they’ve damaged
a relationship in the past with selfishness,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.739
they’ll work to repair it.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.900
Vampire bats embody the spirit of the holidays.
They’re giving. They’re warm to each other,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.080
in a literal sense when they huddle together
in groups. And bats love dark places and are

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.040
known to get into chimneys that aren’t sealed
up, so with a little nudging of the mythology

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.959
vampire bats can be a holiday symbol from
halloween through Christmas!

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.360
You wouldn’t even have to put cookies out
on the fireplace, the bats could just snack

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360
on you!

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.470
And they usually number about a hundred but
can have groups as big as a thousand. Imagine

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.190
a thousand tiny flying Santas coming down
your chimney Christmas morning and sucking

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.190
your blood!

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.340
Alright I’m going to come clean, I know
this wasn’t a very convincing argument to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.349
make vampire bats the embodiment of the season,
but my halloween decorations are still up

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.069
and at this point I’m just too embarrassed
to take them down, so just go with it?

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.069
Please?

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.069
For me?

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.340
If it makes you feel any better you’ll probably
never even see a vampire bat. Unless you live

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.860
in Central and South America. In which case
have you ever encountered vampire bats?

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.700
You should send me a pic on twitter, @JHug00,
that’s be really cool!

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.620
If I’ve freaked you out about bats a little
bit let me make it up to you. Check out this

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.650
video of how luna moths make bats look like
chumps!

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.489
Ok so who’s on board the vampire bat train?

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.489
Anyone?

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.659
Do you have a better idea for a holiday symbol?

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.409
