one thing we don't talk about is that

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309
one thing we don't talk about is that
 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.590
one thing we don't talk about is that
it's sort of hard to talk about this our

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:10.600
it's sort of hard to talk about this our
 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.780
it's sort of hard to talk about this our
minds have these kinds of backdoors

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790
minds have these kinds of backdoors
 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.970
minds have these kinds of backdoors
there's just there's kind of if you're a

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980
there's just there's kind of if you're a
 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.920
there's just there's kind of if you're a
human if you wake up and you open your

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930
human if you wake up and you open your
 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.110
human if you wake up and you open your
eyes there is a certain set of

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120
eyes there is a certain set of
 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.300
eyes there is a certain set of
dimensions to your experience that can

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310
dimensions to your experience that can
 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.670
dimensions to your experience that can
be manipulated when I was a kid I was a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680
be manipulated when I was a kid I was a
 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.439
be manipulated when I was a kid I was a
magician and you learn all about these

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449
magician and you learn all about these
 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.000
magician and you learn all about these
limits you know that short-term memory

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010
limits you know that short-term memory
 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.040
limits you know that short-term memory
is about this long and there's different

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050
is about this long and there's different
 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.200
is about this long and there's different
reaction times and if you ask people

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210
reaction times and if you ask people
 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.180
reaction times and if you ask people
certain questions in certain ways you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190
certain questions in certain ways you
 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.850
certain questions in certain ways you
can control the answer and this is just

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860
can control the answer and this is just
 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.430
can control the answer and this is just
the structure of being human to be human

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440
the structure of being human to be human
 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.979
the structure of being human to be human
means that you are persuadable in every

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989
means that you are persuadable in every
 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.450
means that you are persuadable in every
single moment I mean the thing about

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460
single moment I mean the thing about
 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.940
single moment I mean the thing about
magic as an example is that magic works

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950
magic as an example is that magic works
 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.549
magic as an example is that magic works
on everybody sleight of hand right it

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559
on everybody sleight of hand right it
 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.900
on everybody sleight of hand right it
doesn't matter what language you speak

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910
doesn't matter what language you speak
 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.400
doesn't matter what language you speak
it doesn't matter how intelligent you

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410
it doesn't matter how intelligent you
 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.319
it doesn't matter how intelligent you
are it's not about what someone knows

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329
are it's not about what someone knows
 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.930
are it's not about what someone knows
it's about how your mind actually works

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940
it's about how your mind actually works
 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.410
it's about how your mind actually works
so knowing this it turns out that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420
so knowing this it turns out that
 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.420
so knowing this it turns out that
there's this whole playbook of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430
there's this whole playbook of
 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.580
there's this whole playbook of
persuasive techniques that actually I

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590
persuasive techniques that actually I
 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.139
persuasive techniques that actually I
learned when I was at the Stanford

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149
learned when I was at the Stanford
 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.600
learned when I was at the Stanford
persuasive technology lab and that most

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610
persuasive technology lab and that most
 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.280
persuasive technology lab and that most
people in Silicon Valley in the tech

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290
people in Silicon Valley in the tech
 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.950
people in Silicon Valley in the tech
industry learned as ways of getting your

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960
industry learned as ways of getting your
 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.609
industry learned as ways of getting your
attention so one example is we are all

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619
attention so one example is we are all
 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.580
attention so one example is we are all
vulnerable to social approval we really

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590
vulnerable to social approval we really
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.399
vulnerable to social approval we really
care what other people think of us so

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409
care what other people think of us so
 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.560
care what other people think of us so
for example you know when you upload a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570
for example you know when you upload a
 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.630
for example you know when you upload a
new photo a new profile photo of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640
new photo a new profile photo of
 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.870
new photo a new profile photo of
yourself on Facebook that's a moment

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880
yourself on Facebook that's a moment
 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.179
yourself on Facebook that's a moment
where our mind is very vulnerable to

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189
where our mind is very vulnerable to
 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.070
where our mind is very vulnerable to
knowing what other people think of my

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080
knowing what other people think of my
 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.530
knowing what other people think of my
new profile photo and so when we get new

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540
new profile photo and so when we get new
 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.899
new profile photo and so when we get new
likes on our profile photo Facebook

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909
likes on our profile photo Facebook
 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.030
likes on our profile photo Facebook
knowing this could actually message me

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040
knowing this could actually message me
 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.460
knowing this could actually message me
and say oh you have new likes on your

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470
and say oh you have new likes on your
 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.010
and say oh you have new likes on your
profile photo and we it knows it will be

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020
profile photo and we it knows it will be
 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.260
profile photo and we it knows it will be
vulnerable to that moment because we all

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270
vulnerable to that moment because we all
 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.600
vulnerable to that moment because we all
really care about when we're tagged in a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610
really care about when we're tagged in a
 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.069
really care about when we're tagged in a
photo or when we have a new profile

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079
photo or when we have a new profile
 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.440
photo or when we have a new profile
photo and the thing is that they control

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450
photo and the thing is that they control
 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.880
photo and the thing is that they control
the dial the technology companies

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890
the dial the technology companies
 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.580
the dial the technology companies
control the dial for when and how long

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590
control the dial for when and how long
 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.499
control the dial for when and how long
your profile photo shows up on other

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509
your profile photo shows up on other
 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.639
your profile photo shows up on other
people's newsfeeds

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649
people's newsfeeds
 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.830
people's newsfeeds
so they can orchestrate it so that other

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840
so they can orchestrate it so that other
 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.830
so they can orchestrate it so that other
people more often end up liking your

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840
people more often end up liking your
 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.780
people more often end up liking your
profile photo over a delayed period of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790
profile photo over a delayed period of
 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.349
profile photo over a delayed period of
time for example so that you end up

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:09.359
time for example so that you end up
 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.640
time for example so that you end up
having to more frequently come back and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
having to more frequently come back and
 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.519
having to more frequently come back and
see what the new likes are right and the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:14.529
see what the new likes are right and the
 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:15.750
see what the new likes are right and the
problem is that they don't do

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760
problem is that they don't do
 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.430
problem is that they don't do
because they're evil they do it because

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440
because they're evil they do it because
 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.140
because they're evil they do it because
again they're in this race for our

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150
again they're in this race for our
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.630
again they're in this race for our
attention and we should also ask is that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
attention and we should also ask is that
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.160
attention and we should also ask is that
necessarily such a bad thing

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170
necessarily such a bad thing
 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.170
necessarily such a bad thing
if they're orchestrating it so that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180
if they're orchestrating it so that
 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.160
if they're orchestrating it so that
other people like my my photo I mean I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170
other people like my my photo I mean I
 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.320
other people like my my photo I mean I
might feel good to me but so we have to

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330
might feel good to me but so we have to
 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.970
might feel good to me but so we have to
have a new conversation about as these

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980
have a new conversation about as these
 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.559
have a new conversation about as these
technology companies use these

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569
technology companies use these
 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.539
technology companies use these
techniques these vulnerabilities in our

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549
techniques these vulnerabilities in our
 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.660
techniques these vulnerabilities in our
minds when is that actually aligned and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670
minds when is that actually aligned and
 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.250
minds when is that actually aligned and
good for us when is that ethical when is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260
good for us when is that ethical when is
 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.610
good for us when is that ethical when is
that honest when is that fair and when

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620
that honest when is that fair and when
 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.619
that honest when is that fair and when
is that dishonest and unfair because

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629
is that dishonest and unfair because
 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.270
is that dishonest and unfair because
they're actually manipulating our minds

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280
they're actually manipulating our minds
 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.280
they're actually manipulating our minds
in a way that doesn't add up to our

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290
in a way that doesn't add up to our
 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.789
in a way that doesn't add up to our
spending our time well on the screen

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799
spending our time well on the screen
 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.039
spending our time well on the screen
well so another vulnerability in our

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049
well so another vulnerability in our
 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.410
well so another vulnerability in our
mind is something called a variable

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420
mind is something called a variable
 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.380
mind is something called a variable
schedule reward and that's like a slot

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390
schedule reward and that's like a slot
 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.390
schedule reward and that's like a slot
machine in Las Vegas it turns out that

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400
machine in Las Vegas it turns out that
 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.099
machine in Las Vegas it turns out that
slot machines make more money in the

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109
slot machines make more money in the
 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.039
slot machines make more money in the
United States then baseball movies and

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049
United States then baseball movies and
 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.990
United States then baseball movies and
theme parks combined people become

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000
theme parks combined people become
 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.059
theme parks combined people become
addicted to slot machines I think it's 2

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069
addicted to slot machines I think it's 2
 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.640
addicted to slot machines I think it's 2
to 3 times faster than any other kind of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650
to 3 times faster than any other kind of
 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.759
to 3 times faster than any other kind of
gambling in a casino so it's insane and

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769
gambling in a casino so it's insane and
 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.009
gambling in a casino so it's insane and
why is that because it's very simple you

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019
why is that because it's very simple you
 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.710
why is that because it's very simple you
just pull a lever and sometimes you get

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720
just pull a lever and sometimes you get
 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.920
just pull a lever and sometimes you get
a reward you know and sometimes you

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930
a reward you know and sometimes you
 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.009
a reward you know and sometimes you
don't and the more random it is and the

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019
don't and the more random it is and the
 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.379
don't and the more random it is and the
more variable it is the more addictive

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389
more variable it is the more addictive
 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.690
