00:00:00.014 --> 00:00:05.050
When a service worker is registered,
it's limited to the scope provided

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.160
meaning that it will only handle
requests within its scope.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.590
If we register a service
worker at /folder/sw.js,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.740
the service worker would
only see fetch event for

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.930
pages who's URL starts
with folder/something.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.430
You'll notice in this case,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.540
the service worker is registered
at the root of the domain.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.930
This means, the service worker
scope will be the entire origin.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.760
In other words,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.170
the service worker will receive fetch
event for everything on this domain.
