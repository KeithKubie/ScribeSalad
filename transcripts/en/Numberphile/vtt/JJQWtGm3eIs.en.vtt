[TAPPING]

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.870
[COUGHING]

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.390
-So a man walks into a bar.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.540
He asks for 10 times more drinks
than everyone else.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.660
The barman says, now, that
is an order of magnitude.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.980
MATT PARKER: Actually quite a
good joke, because order of

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.550
magnitude is how big
a number is.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.120
The speed of light is 3 times 10
to the 8 meters per second,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.450
and that's the order
of magnitude.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.960
It's 3 with eight
0's after it.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.800
And something like a kilometer
is 10 to the 3 meters.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.020
So light in one second goes
five orders of magnitude

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.480
further than a kilometer.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.520
And so when he says, I want 10
times as many drinks, he's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.210
actually ordering one order of
magnitude more than anyone

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.880
else, which is, of course,
an order of magnitude.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.840
-So an infinite number of

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.690
mathematicians walk into a bar.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050
The first one, he
orders a pint.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.090
The second one, half
a pint, then a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.030
quarter, then an eighth.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.370
Eventually, the barman hands
over two pints and says, you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.490
mathematicians.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.410
You just don't know
your limits.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.610
MATT PARKER: OK, so if you start
with 1, and then you add

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.450
1/2, and then you add 1/4, and
then you add 1/8, and each

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.190
time you're getting smaller
and smaller, what we're

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.705
actually doing is we're
summing all

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.200
the 1/2 to the n's--

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.100
some n.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.650
And we start with n equals 0,
and we go all the way up to a

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.430
correctly drawn infinity sign.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.950
And if you carry this on
infinitely, its limit equals

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.880
2, which is why the barman
gave them two pints.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.150
And he said, you don't
know your limits.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.500
Because that's the limit.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.095
-So why is 6 afraid of 7?

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.370
Because 7 ate 9!

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.150
MATT PARKER: Not strictly
a math joke, but OK.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.200
The thing here is that numbers
appear in order.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.170
They go 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.610
Why is 6 scared of 7?

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.320
Well, when you say 7, 8, 9, the
word "eight" in English

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.620
sounds a bit like the
word "ate." So it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.730
sounds like 7 ate 9.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.310
So eight is, in this
case, a word.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.520
And 7 then eats--

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.210
I don't know.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.470
I mean, I personally would say
that 7 is a 6 offender, but

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.580
I'm not the one doing the
jokes here, am I?

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.660
-How do you make seven even?

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.270
Remove the S!

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.240
MATT PARKER: I was promised
number jokes, but I guess

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.770
another English one is fine.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.810
So the number 7--

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.920
if you write it out in this
language called English, which

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.970
you may have heard of, you spell
it "seven." And then if

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.070
you remove the S, you're left
with the English word "even."

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.890
No actual math's involved.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.160
-Two cats are standing
on a roof.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.760
Which one falls off first?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.010
The one with the smaller mu.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.580
MATT PARKER: OK, bear
with me here.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.290
I'm going to represent
the roof like this.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.190
The front door and chimney
are optional.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.870
And then I'm going
to approximate

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.390
the cat as a rectangle.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.180
Gravity is forcing the
cat directly down.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.500
But of course, it can't go
straight down because it's on

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.990
a sloped roof.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.100
And so you're going to split
this into a normal vector,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.310
which comes off this way,
and then the vector

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.320
going down the roof.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.520
What stops it from falling
off the roof is friction.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.430
And friction will be a force
coming back this way.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.780
And friction is proportional to
how hard the box is being

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.110
pressed down into the roof.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.860
And so we have the coefficient
of friction, which is the

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.600
Greek letter mu, times whatever
that normal force is.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.160
And so the bigger the
coefficient of friction, the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.680
less likely it is to fall off.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.380
And if there were two boxes,
the one with the smaller

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.670
coefficient of friction
would fall off first.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.310
And that is the Greek letter
mu, which, if we're talking

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.270
about cats, the cats make
the sound meow.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.360
-What did the number 0
say to the number 8?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.170
Nice belt.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.170
MATT PARKER: OK, I guess so.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.589
So 0 looks a bit like this.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:23.900
And if you imagine putting
a belt around 0 and then

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.500
tightening it, it would
squeeze the middle

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.520
of 0 in like that.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.250
And if you tighten it enough,
it would pinch off and

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.240
would form an 8.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.400
And so an 8 is a bit like
a 0 wearing a belt.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.503
Why it is a nice belt,
I'm not sure.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.280
with a mountain climber?

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.120
Nothing.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.540
You can't cross a vector
and a scalar.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.630
MATT PARKER: Ok, there's
a lot going on here.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.680
We'll start with what
we mean by cross.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.330
And it's a way of
saying multiply.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.190
When you multiply numbers
together, it's easy.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.010
There's one thing you do.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.240
You multiply one by the other.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.100
When you multiply vectors, it
gets a bit more complicated.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.590
So let's say I've got one
vector u, which has ux

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.390
component, uy component,
and uz component,

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.790
because it's in 3D.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.726
And then I've got another vector
I'm going to call v. So

00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:20.740
I've got vx component, vy
component, vz component.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.180
And then I want to multiply
these two vectors.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.670
And there's more than
one way to do that.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.890
You can dot multiply, which
gives you a scalar, which is

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.200
just a normal number,
out as an answer.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.490
Or you can cross multiply--

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.940
using our traditional cross
multiply symbol--

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.180
which gives you out
another vector.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.390
Now, cross multiplying is a
little bit complicated.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.720
OK, let's do the first one.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:52.620
So it's uy normal multiply vz
minus uz normal multiply vy.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.440
Then the next component--
and you keep going.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.950
And you get three new components
out this way.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.350
The trouble is, you can only
cross multiply vectors.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.210
You can't do the same thing
for normal numbers, or

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.700
scalars, as we call them.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.070
And someone who climbs the
mountain is scaling it.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.940
So I guess you could
call him a scaler.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.530
And a mosquito--

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.330
we're going right outside maths
here-- a mosquito can

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.620
transmit diseases, which in
biology, you would call a

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.260
vector as a way of transmitting
diseases.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.230
And so you can't do a cross
multiplication between a

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.620
vector and a scaler.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.270
