00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.000
&gt;&gt; Curtis Sandberg: Morning.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.450
Morning. Welcome.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.160
It's great, okay.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.670
Welcome. I'm Dr. Curtis
Sandberg and I get

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.200
to have a couple
of minutes here.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.910
I'm the Director of the David
M. Rubenstein National Center

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.210
for White House History

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.000
at the White House Historical
Association and I'm also --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.370
I have this very long job title.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.780
I'm also Senior Vice President

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.770
for Educational Resources
at the Association.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.580
So it's History, it's
the Digital Library,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.210
it's sort of all of our
content-driven material.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.020
We're really delighted
-- we've been --

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.440
this has been, as you
can imagine, you know,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.740
we've been working
on this forever,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.430
so we're really delighted to
welcome you all to the summit.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.960
It's, as you know, a
unique gathering of you

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.690
and you were presidential
leaders, site directors,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.540
library directors, educational
specialists, area experts.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.570
It's a really amazing gathering
and I think we're going

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.340
to have fun in the
next few days.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.350
So we look forward to
connecting with you.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.860
You know, we began talking,
some of us, in the lobby

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.400
at the Willard, but
we'll keep that going.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.180
The idea of this is to create
a hub that you meet each other,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.730
which you're doing, and you meet
us, and that we keep doing this

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.580
in the future, and it becomes
a gathering that, you know,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.850
it has real teeth and it emerges

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.720
into something that's
[inaudible] for all of us.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.060
Now our group envision,
and we -- in planning this,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.740
several excursions
for attendees,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.990
and so we're starting.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.290
We're here.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.820
And we have our friends at the
Library, a number of our friends

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.190
at the Library have been
absolutely instrumental

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.770
in creating this event, and
the Librarian of Congress,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.250
Dr. Carla Hayden, we talked
with her months and months ago,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.260
and she was very
keen about this.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.500
We have Dr. Jane McAuliffe
who is the -- there we go.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.800
Thank you.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.100
So much better.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.400
Okay, thanks.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.660
And Dr. McAuliffe is
the Director of National

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.120
and International
Outreach at the Library.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.910
And Jason Yasner --

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.660
Jason, you're back there
someplace or another?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.960
There we go.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.330
That's Jason Yasner
who has a new job.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.080
Jason has been very instrumental
as well as the Deputy Director

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.220
of the National Library
Service for the Blind

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.860
and Physically Handicapped.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.900
And Kimberly McCullough,
who a number of you met,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.620
who is Library Special
Events Coordinator.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.180
There are some treats
in store for us.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.350
We have Cheryl Fox here
who's the Resident Curator

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.940
in the Library's Manuscript
Division, and she'll take us

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.610
around and give us the
insider's view of the Library.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.230
So I'll close and welcome
you again to the Summit.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.130
And it's not doing that awful
noise anymore which is great.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.930
We're with you and being
excited about seeing new

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.180
and exciting things and being
part of the behind-the-scenes,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.690
so I think, Jane, are you up?

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.510
So welcome Dr. Jane
McAuliffe please.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:01.630
[ Applause ]

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.320
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe:
Well, good morning.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.340
As Curtis said, I
am Jane McAuliffe.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.930
I'm Director of National and
International Outreach here

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.390
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.840
That means I manage many

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.360
of the public-facing
activities of the Library.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.750
And among my most pleasant
responsibilities is welcoming

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.660
distinguished guests like you
to the Library of Congress.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.340
How many of you have
been here before,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.710
have been to the Library
of Congress before?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.600
Oh, good. Great.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.770
Well, whether it's a
first or a return trip,

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.890
I really do hope this morning
will be an exciting experience

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.820
for you.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.420
As you likely know, we have a
newish Librarian of Congress.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.410
Dr. Carla Hayden is just

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.850
about to begin her
third year in that role.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.470
And as Librarian, Dr. Hayden has
pledged to connect the Library

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.270
of Congress to people
across America.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.380
We're doing this by enhancing
the visitor experience for those

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.140
of you who are actually able to
come to us here on Capital Hill,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.600
but also by enriching
digital, digital connectivity

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.500
across the country
and across the world.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.690
I know that you have gathered
from all over the United States.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.950
So I hope that we can find
ways to stay connected with you

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.450
and to help you in the important
work that you are doing.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.550
So I mentioned I'm
head of National

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.850
and International Outreach.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.380
But another hat I wear is as
the Librarian's Representative

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.120
to the White House Historical
Association Board of Directors.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.850
So I've had a chance to witness
close hand the wonderful work

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.710
that people like Stewart
McLaurin, the President

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.290
of the White House
Historical Association,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.220
who's with us this morning,
and Curtis Sandberg,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.530
whom you heard introduce
our session this morning.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.580
And I have enjoyed seeing
collaborations develop

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.300
between the Association and the
Library of Congress in areas

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.060
as diverse as digital
resources, book promotion,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.390
and merchandise development.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.900
It's really a terrific team,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.980
and I know they have
devoted every effort

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.990
to making this Presidential
Site Summit the best ever.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.220
As I reviewed the final
program for this summit

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.520
over the weekend, I could
do nothing but marvel at all

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.100
that lies in store
for you this week.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.230
But, of course, the very
best event is this kickoff

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.100
introduction to America's
Library.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.990
So let's get started on
that and welcome Cheryl Fox,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.550
the Library of Congress
Archive Specialist

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.590
in our Manuscript
Division to the podium.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.510
Thanks for being here.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:56.120
[ Applause ]

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.420
&gt;&gt; Cheryl Fox: Good morning.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.720
I'm Cheryl Fox.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.120
I am a curator within
the Manuscript Division.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.300
There are lots and lots
and lots of collections

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.280
in the Manuscript Division,
and I'm here to tell you

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.500
about just one small
portion of them

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.250
which is called the LC Archives
which is the collective records

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.190
of the Library of Congress.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.700
And I'm so happy to have
an opportunity to talk

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.090
to you this morning and talk
about the Library of Congress

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.300
and the White House's
shared history,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.920
some of the collaborations
that we had in the past, and,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.250
of course, looking forward
to many more in the future.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.060
So the close ties between the
White House and the Library

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.930
of Congress started before
this city was occupied

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.550
as the Federal City because
they had to make arrangements

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.110
to move here and, of course,
there were not resources

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.830
like Philadelphia's
Library Company

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.000
in the Federal City
at that time.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.200
And so President Adams provided,
in an act of 1800, for $5000

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.760
and a suitable apartment
within the Capitol

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.820
for the Library of Congress.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.880
And there was a compromise
that had to be forged

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.450
to reach that consensus.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.700
And the other part of
it is that they decided

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.200
that the President would
be in charge of nominating

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.620
or appointing, I should say,
the Librarian of Congress.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.480
And so it remains.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.250
And so this unique close
connection between the Library

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.860
and the White House was
established at that point.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.710
So we all are aware that
Pierre L'Enfant's plan provided

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:38.500
for the Capitol and the
White House to be connected

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.510
by Pennsylvania Avenue, as
you see here, but separate,

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.860
to indicate their
separate status as branches

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.780
of the Federal Government
and, of course, we also know

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.890
that the Capitol in this time
period housed the Library

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.760
of Congress as well
as the Supreme Court.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.680
So the U.S. Capitol, such as
it was back in the early days,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.800
was just part of the wing,
part of one wing was there.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.490
And the first two Librarians

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.330
of Congress were
simultaneously clerks

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.560
of the House of Representatives.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.780
So they didn't really see it as
a full-time job at that point,

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.730
to be Librarian of Congress.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.580
And, as you know, the
White House was similarly

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.680
in the process of being built.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.410
But by the time they reached
the point of development

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.340
of the Capitol where
both wings were built,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.770
along came the American
Revolution Part II, so to speak,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.750
when the British burned the
Capitol and the White House.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.250
The Library of Congress
collection was

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.420
completely destroyed.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:57.300
Some things were managed to be
evacuated from the White House.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.730
But, anyway, the
buildings were gone.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.430
This was bad news.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.140
But then, also, oddly enough,
very good news for the Library

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.800
of Congress because Thomas
Jefferson was available

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.310
to offer his private library for
sale to the Library of Congress.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.270
And -- well, it's
Congress, I should say.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:21.700
And this became the center,
the hear, of the Library

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.920
of Congress collection which
it remains to this day.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.400
And it permanently changed the
Library of Congress as an entity

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.950
because it went from being
simply a reference collection

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.900
for the use of Congress
to a real library.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.110
In fact, an outstanding
library that had materials

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.120
in many different languages.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:46.830
It had bibles and religious
tracts in addition to law books.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.890
It had history as well as
music and architecture.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:57.760
And the very simple but
wonderful arrangement by memory,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.040
reason, and imagination allowed
the Library, or even, in fact,

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.640
suggested to the Library to
develop in all directions,

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.170
not just simply, you
know, for Congress,

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.710
but for a comprehensive,
universal collection.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.980
There was another fire, however.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.560
And this one even really worse
than the first one to my mind

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.020
because it destroyed two-thirds

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.050
of President Jefferson's
Library.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.100
This is a piece from
the newspaper

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.790
which was telegraphed --
reports from telegraphs

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.420
from the Capitol City that
the Library had burned

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.900
and that President Fillmore,
the Mayor, Speaker of the House,

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.440
and numerous members in
offices of Congress were early

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.160
on the ground rendering
all the aid in their power.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.260
So this is an example
of one very direct way

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.480
that the White House helped
the Library was by trying

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.220
to save the collection.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.760
Most of it was destroyed,
however.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.330
And President Fillmore,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:07.840
in addition to helping us fight
the fire, approved $5000 to --

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.930
for clean-up, $10,000
to replace the books,

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.770
and then an annual appropriation

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.900
to repair the deficiencies
caused

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.010
by the destruction
of the Library.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.670
So the happy result was that
the Library got its own space

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.180
within the Capitol,
much larger space.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.090
This illustration is called --

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.550
I called it The Iron Room
because it was, in fact,

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.860
the largest iron room, a room
made of iron, in the world.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.560
And, of course, it was the --

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.190
the Architect was
Thomas E. Walter.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:47.000
It was 91 feet in length,
34 feet wide, 38 feet high.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.740
And a visitor to the Library,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.440
British Scientist
Sir Charles Lyle,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.820
wrote that it was the most
beautiful room in the world.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.370
Maybe he was just trying
to say something friendly.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.680
I'm not sure.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.340
And in this time period, also,
there was still deliberation

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.550
over where the National
Library should be.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.720
Should it be with the
Smithsonian or should it be

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.840
with the Congressional Library?

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.840
And at that time the
matter was settled.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.470
And certainly it looks
the part, doesn't it?

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.020
And there are, as you see,
spectators and tourists

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.240
in addition to readers and
lots of things going on,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.420
cultural activities, that
would come to be associated

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.070
with the Library of Congress.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.800
And getting back to President
Fillmore just for one moment.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.220
I would be remiss if I did not
note that he as the President,

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.210
and First Lady Fillmore,
who are credited

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.040
with establishing the
first White House Library.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.780
It was not that Presidents prior

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.540
to that time didn't have
books in the White House.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.840
They certainly did.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.940
But this was an official
collection which, oddly enough,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.420
wound up coming back to
the Library of Congress

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.920
as a special collection.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.220
I'm not going to get
into all of that,

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.520
but there's a wonderful
book called,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.080
<i>The First White House
Library </i>, and Catherine, Cath,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.490
Catherine, I believe, Parisian
has written a wonderful,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.110
wonderful book listing
the books that were

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.590
in the Library and its history.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:19.180
So back to the bookish
presidents.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:25.360
Our founders were men of
means who had great libraries.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.850
Later presidents also were
very interested in reading.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:35.010
And some presidents like
Garfield wrote in 1873 --

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.070
he was working on a speech in
his home at Cleveland, Ohio,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.670
and he said, "Every
day I miss Spofford

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.950
and our great Library
of Congress."

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:55.020
Or, for example, when President
Roosevelt abruptly became

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.200
President of the United
States, he wrote to Mr. Putnam,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.200
"As I leave, to put it mildly,
a sedentary life for the moment,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.860
I would greatly like some books
that would suit my queer taste.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.340
I do not supposed
there are any --

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.710
I do not suppose there are any"
-- excuse me one second here --

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.010
"there are any histories

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.260
of any articles upon the
Early Mediterranean races.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.600
That man Lindsay, who wrote
about Prehistoric Greece,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.930
has not put out a
second volume, has he?

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.260
Has a second volume of
Oman's <i>Art of War </i>appeared?

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.880
If so, send me both or either.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.010
If not, then a good translation
of Meevor [assumed spelling]

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.600
and Mommsen," who were both
historians of Ancient Rome,

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.100
"or the best history
of Modern Mesopotamia.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.030
Is there a good history
of Poland," he wonders.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.370
And so you can see his eclectic
tastes there's this really

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.880
close relationship.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.870
The relationship
predates his presidency.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.300
When he was Secretary
of the Navy, Roosevelt,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.950
Teddy Roosevelt would come
here to join the Librarian

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.550
and other invited
guests in the Attic,

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.810
which is where the cafeteria was
at that time, to join Librarian

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:06.520
of Congress Putnam's round
table as sort of a gathering

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.000
of intellectuals, visiting
dignitaries, diplomats,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.380
what have you, and a few
chosen staff members.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.870
Not all of them, certainly.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.240
And if you look into the
Librarian's ceremonial office,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.880
just down the hall,
you'll see the round table,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.160
which is there on display.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.870
So there were lots of
reasons for presidents

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:33.420
to love the Library of Congress.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.500
And here you see T.R. again.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.890
Another guest at the round
table was H.G. Wells.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.970
He was lamenting being
in the United States

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.000
and not enjoying it at all.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.470
And he visited the
Library in 1906 and wrote,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.800
"I found at last a little
group of men who could talk.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.270
It was like a small raft
upon a limitless sea.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.990
I lunched with them
at their round table.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.510
And afterwards Mr. Putnam
showed me the Rotunda."

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.120
And just to point out
the obvious there, again.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.260
Once the Library occupied
this building, it became even

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:10.360
that much more of a tourist
attraction and people could look

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.890
into the Reading
Room, they could look

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.800
at the beautiful works of art.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.100
Now not all the people in the
White House who used the Library

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.400
of Congress were presidents.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.140
Members of the family
frequently borrowed books.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.270
And so in -- as the archives,

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.280
there are registers
of borrowers.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.970
And one of them is when Lincoln
was a member of the House

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.530
of Representatives, and
you see his page of books

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.180
that he borrowed, and
it includes these kind

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.760
of spicy romance novels in there
[laughter], and you think, well,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.630
my goodness, is he
reading this before

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.870
or after he's reading
the Articles of War?

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.190
It turns out those were
borrowed by Mary Lincoln,

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.460
as people determined later.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.540
But the members of the family
could certainly borrow books.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.200
And this extraordinary
photograph --

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.280
I could not resist putting
it in here somewhere.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.550
As you see, it's a Granafolo
[sic] which is an early machine

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:12.350
for playing records that
amplifies sound without the use

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.020
of the great big trumpet that
you see with the Victrola.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.500
And, anyway, they were often
made to look like furniture,

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.880
and hers looks just
like a piano,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.880
which I think is
kind of hilarious.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.230
And there she is with the
disc that she's playing.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.770
She didn't just play
music on her Granafolo,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.580
she also played music
on the piano.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.780
Unfortunately, she did not
always return the music

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.670
that she borrowed from
the Library of Congress,

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.450
and I know this because
the Chief

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:43.090
of the Music Division wrote
to Library of Congress Putnam

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.340
that they'd asked her several
times to return these things,

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.110
and she still had not done it.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.560
And I guess they -- he
wanted the Librarian

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.180
to handle this somewhat
sticky situation.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.320
First Lady Lou Henry Hoover --

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.300
I'm sure some of you will be
familiar with her reputation

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.410
as a scholar and as a person
who studied many languages,

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:11.110
Mandarin as well as Latin
and the Romance Languages.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:17.040
And she had had a delivery
of her so-called Agricola's.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.510
In other words, <i>Incunabula</i>
by George Agricola,

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.850
aka George Bower, that was
first published in 1556.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:33.860
And she assured the
Librarian that 20 years ago,

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.580
when she was working
with these early volumes,

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.020
she would have been
able to decide

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.780
that herself in a few minutes.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.710
But it has been so long since
she has read German script,

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.010
particularly German manuscript,

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.730
that it would take her a
very long time to do it now.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.060
She is therefore imposing
on you and Mr. Martel.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.210
She's referring to the Chief
Classifier at the Library

00:18:54.210 --> 00:19:00.890
of Congress, Charles Martel, who
was born in Switzerland and came

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:06.580
to the United States and
became an excellent classifier,

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.580
but also retained his immense
knowledge of German language

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.340
and literature, and was able to
provide her with the information

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:20.210
that she needed on the
<i>Agricola's </i>as she called them.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:25.420
Now, everybody knows Eleanor
Roosevelt had a separate career

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.420
and identify prior to
becoming First Lady.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.900
She wrote the "My Day"
column from 1935 to 1962.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.240
She had her own radio program
called <i>Mrs. Roosevelt's Own</i>

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.760
<i>Radio Program </i>.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.790
And she wrote a column,
a monthly column,

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.160
in the <i>Ladies Home
Journal </i>beginning

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.630
in 1941, if you ask me.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.530
And, of course, she travelled
around everywhere and spoke

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.110
to everybody who asked her to.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.370
So she frequently
consulted with the Library.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.500
She would forward letters
she had received in Braille

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.000
to the Library so that
they could be translated.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.390
And she would ask sometimes
for help in remembering

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.430
where a certain quotation
came from.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.730
She had this in her mind.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.120
Maybe she wanted to write it in
a column or give it in a speech,

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.660
but who wrote this quote?

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.120
And some of them the
Library could answer.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.610
Others -- maybe she
made them up.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:22.910
Who knows?

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.210
The next Librarian of
Congress I'm going to talk

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:28.320
about was a friend and worked
with the Roosevelts prior

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.250
to their coming to the Library.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.820
His name was Archibald McLeish.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:40.120
And he had come to know the
Roosevelts during the campaign

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.420
for the White House.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.720
He was at that time writing

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.400
for <i>Fortune Magazine </i>and had
already received a Pulitzer

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.700
Prize, one of three.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.740
He was just here a short time.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:58.020
A librarian/historian prior to
my time, called his tenure here

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.300
at the Library, the
brush of a comet.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.360
It was brief and spectacular,
and you could see him here.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.120
This is a clip, a Berryman
cartoon, of course,

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.200
and he's working for
the opposite facts

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.690
and figures while he's
Librarian of Congress

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:19.210
and he's shooting cannonballs,
I guess, at Fort Truman.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:25.280
And so he was a known person,
not a shy, retiring librarian,

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.220
but a real public
figure in his own right.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.450
And he accomplished so much

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.570
in such a short time
at the Library.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.680
He oversaw the reorganization
of the Administration

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.100
and founded the Library of
Congress "Quarterly Journal

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.800
of Acquisitions," as well as
the "Information Bulletin,"

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.920
which is still in publication.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.860
He really helped the Library
to gain a war footing.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.130
He was an ardent defender
of democracy and thought

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.530
that libraries should be
the arsenal for democracy.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.900
And here you see him with Lord
Lothian accepting the deposit,

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.140
temporary deposit, of a
copy of the <i>Magna Carta </i>.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.660
Part of what he did in
war, preparation for war,

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.340
was to send the <i>Magna
Carta </i>and the <i>Declaration</i>

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.820
<i>of Independence </i>and <i>The
Constitution </i>to offsite

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.870
storage, Fort Knox.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:22.530
And those were returned in 1945.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.010
Also there were 29 truckloads

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.680
of so-called irreplaceable
material.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.130
So they did this
great big 10,000 hours

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.060
of Library staff volunteer
time to assess the collections,

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.280
conserve them, list them,
box them, send them off-site

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.750
to Dennison University Ohio, and
in Virginia the VMI, Washington

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.420
and Lee College and
the University

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.880
of Virginia, excuse med.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.060
And this is a cartoon marking
the return of these documents.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.810
And there you see MacLeish.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.300
"Easy, boys.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.660
And watch those doors"
over <i>The Declaration </i>.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.170
And be sure the glass
is good and clean ."

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.040
And you see <i>The
Declaration </i>returning,

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.590
and <i>The Constitution </i>.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.590
And the caption is, "May they
never have to be hidden or kept

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.570
in the dark ever again."

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:17.660
And so you see the Library's
connection to winning the war

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.040
and re-establishing ourselves.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.690
And certainly Archibald MacLeish
was very involved in that.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.600
He wrote radio scripts.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.160
He wrote -- gave presentations.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.560
He wrote articles for
various publications

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.930
on democracy and things.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.200
And so he was a very influential
person in the time period.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.330
And here you see another one,

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.880
the Return of <i>The
Declaration of Independence </i>.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.970
This and the other illustrations
are from our Prints

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.270
and Photographs Collection.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.470
I just really admire that image.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.280
And, of course, it
was used on the cover

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.780
of <i>The New Yorker Magazine </i>.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:02.210
I hesitate -- this is kind of
a joke, but there was a point

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.970
in time in which
<i>The Declaration</i>

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.360
<i>of Independence </i>was stolen.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:12.850
You see, Dr. VonMorgue had
hypnotized Little Abner

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:18.220
with his Z-Ray and influenced
him to buy a fake copy

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.640
of <i>The Declaration of
Independence </i>and to pick

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.920
up a rock and to enter the
Great Hall, smash the case,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.200
replace it with the fake,
and make off with it.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.940
Now, of course, he returned it

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.500
and everything was
fine after that.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.590
I just thought, this is in 1938.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:38.030
So it gives you the idea of
how well known these documents

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:42.610
in The Shrine in the Library
of Congress were at the time.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.300
So I want to focus a
little bit of attention

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.670
on some more recent
collaborations having

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.610
to do with literacy.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:54.470
And beginning with Barbara
Bush, she was already a champion

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.610
for literacy and
causes related prior

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.530
to coming to the White House.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.400
But her first -- she took her
first meeting in the White House

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.300
with the Librarian of
Congress and the --

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.390
now the Library's
Historian, John Cole.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.570
Then he was the Director
for the Center for the Book.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:17.080
And within a month, as he
tells me, she was reading

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.140
to children in the Great Hall.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.680
So this was really a natural
collaboration, but something

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.110
that had not been done before.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.180
And it wound up into --

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:34.590
resulting in a number of
programs to further reading

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.760
and the cause of reading
and literacy beginning

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:44.120
with the Year of
the Young Reader.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.090
And, as you know, this coming
Saturday is the Book Festival.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.450
This is probably the most
successful collaboration the

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.600
White House and the
Library of Congress have had

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.710
because First Lady Laura Bush
brought the Book Festival

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.540
concept to the Library
of Congress.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.410
It began in 2001 until 2014.

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:06.960
The Book Festival
was held on the Mall.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.810
Now it's in the nice and cool
Walter E. Washington Convention

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.660
Center supported by
numerous public benefactors,

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.170
foundations, and corporations.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:23.000
And in 2016, John Cole, who
I mentioned, was recognized

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.360
by the Bush Foundation as
a champion of literacy.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.410
He has worked here at
the Library for 50 years.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.740
He was the Founding Director of
the Library Center for the Book,

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.240
and founded programs for readers
of all ages, including Letters

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.510
About Literature, Books
and Beyond Authors Series,

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.450
the Ambassador for Young
People's Literature,

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:46.900
and recently opened the
Library's Young Readers Center.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:52.320
And so I'm just recognizing him
and his valuable contribution

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.420
to us as a library,
the collaboration

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.580
with the White House,
and looking forward

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.790
to many more fruitful
collaborations in the future.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.500
If anybody has any questions,
I'd be happy to try to answer.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.500
Skimmed over that
pretty quickly.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.030
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:20.640
[ Applause ]

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.330
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
