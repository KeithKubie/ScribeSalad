00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.850
MAHIRI MWITA: The primary
purpose of the program

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.650
is to study the language,
the Swahili language,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.330
in an environment
where the speakers are

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.900
native speakers of the language.


00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.490
We offered the
two-year sequence here

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.890
that fulfills Princeton
University's language

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.910
requirement program.


00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.110
To acquire proficiency, high
proficiency of the language,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.940
it is very important
for us to take students

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.990
to the communities where
the language is spoken,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.880
and we immerse them in the
culture and the language.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.020
So the primary
purpose of the program

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.210
is to take them to East Africa,
so they can listen and hear

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.210
the language as they
learn it, and also

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.670
interact with the
people's culture.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.210
LIA COITO: In Tanzania, I
think I'm pretty excited, more

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.710
than anything, to just be
immersed in a language.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.760
I've never really had that.


00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.830
Just in the fact here,
when you learn it,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.870
you do it in a classroom.


00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.240
You might do some exercises,
but it stops, and then

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.860
you talk with everyone
else in regular life,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.360
whereas this is
really an immersion

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.900
into a cultural way
of life, and just

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.780
being able to be
surrounded by something new

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.660
and learning in the process.


00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.520
MAHIRI MWITA: The second
purpose of the program

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.380
is to enable them to be
adaptable to the culture

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.900
of the Swahili people.


00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.820
So to enable them to do
that, I plan activities

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.650
with the community whereby
they get out of the university

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.790
setting, so they can go outside
and interact with the people.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.210
MATT GWIN: I
volunteered every day

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.550
at the orphanage, the
[? Chakawan ?] orphanage.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.750 position:97%
 


00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.420
I developed a really
strong relationship

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.460
with a few the kids.


00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.210
That was one of the
highlights of my trip,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.040
was doing that every day.


00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.830
ELISA VERA: I wanted
to just something that

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.540
wasn't going to be affiliated
with my major at all.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.040
In a sense, like
one of those things

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.990
to just make sure that I'm
ultimately doing something

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.950
that I want to be
doing, and just

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.770
to experience
something different.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.780
Why not learn Swahili?


00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.870
BEN DOBKIN: I hope
to really understand

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.100
more about what
I see around here

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.450
as a comparison to what is
so different in Tanzania.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.040
And I hope to understand
like a separate culture.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.780
Being there for
almost two months,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.960
I'll really get a great grasp
of like how people interact

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.950
and what the social norms are.


00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.600
Being in a culture that's
so disparate from my own,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.970
I think it will
enable me to open

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.920
my eyes to a different
way of thinking.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.670
TARIKUA ERDA: So it's
great that Princeton

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.180
offers this opportunity.


00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.020
And coming here and
spending a year here

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.700
has taught me that there's a
lot I don't know about myself

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.580
and my own country,
because when you get

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.580
plugged out of what you've
lived in for 19 years,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.500
then you learn a lot of
new things about yourself

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.500
and that place that you are
in from another perspective.
