00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.500
- In the woods of a peaceful island

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.170
off the coast of Portland, Maine,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.030
the concrete remains of a massive

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.630
World War II-era gun battery

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.740
are hiding in plain sight.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.670
I'm Jessica Hester,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.220
staff writer at Atlas Obscura,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.387
and we're going inside Battery Steele.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.960
Today, visitors think of
coastal Maine as a getaway.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.160
It's a place where I kayaked

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.580
and ate lobster rolls.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.850
But there was a time when the coast

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.188
was a border that needed defending.

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:34.410
In the 1940s, the military thought

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.453
the war might come to American shores.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.580
To defend Casco Bay and its shipyards,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.610
the Navy installed nets
to capture submarines.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.470
Their tools could detect
something as small

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.913
as fish swimming by.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.220
The island's military history museum

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.560
has a huge collection of photos

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.670
showing what it looked like at the time.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.610
You can see barracks,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.670
observation towers,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.720
and Battery Steele,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.963
whose huge guns pointed out at the water.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.770
The military legacy is still
visible on the island today,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.937
if you know where to look.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.630
Any explorer can visit Battery Steele,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.810
but it takes some work to find it.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.940
It was built to be hidden

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.323
and it still kind of is.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.150
The low concrete building
looks both forgotten

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.170
and a little futuristic.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.030
It's overgrown

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.200
and seems to just kind of
rise up out of the earth.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.670
I couldn't tell how big it was

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.520
or exactly where it ended or began,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.330
but it's giant.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.440
Hundreds of feet long,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.683
just camouflaged by rocks and trees.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.050
Feeling around in the darkness,

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.880
it was hard for me to
imagine Battery Steele

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730
being frantic or crowded.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.180
It was just so quiet and desolate.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.600
The light near the entrance
vanishes almost right away,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.220
and it's kind of like walking into a tomb.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.710
It was a little unsettling.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.160
You don't know exactly where you are.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.420
There are these far-off
sounds of dripping water.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.200
And you don't know what
your flashlight will find.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.400
It took a while to walk
from one end to the other,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.820
and to poke around in the side rooms

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.831
where the control panels were.

00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:00.560
I wondered how long it would have taken

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.300
to load one of those 60-foot guns

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.623
with 2,000-pound projectiles.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.360
Even if they were never fired at a ship,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.873
they looked terrifying.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.060
Before the guns were scrapped in 1948,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.690
locals sometimes climbed on them

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.433
like they were boulders or trees.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.600
Today, the walls are marked
up with murals and graffiti.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.680
Some residents eventually turned
old barracks into cottages

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.660
and they made them cheerful

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.560
by painting stuff on the sides like plants

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.623
and windowsills.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.070
A number of other structures burned down,

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.410
but if you wander around the woods

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.360
in the middle of the island,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.220
you might come across an observation tower

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.330
peeking just above the tree line.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.170
It's easy to imagine climbing up there

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.373
and keeping watch out toward the horizon.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.760
You'll also see a couple
of little white buildings

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.807
with narrow slats right at eye level.

00:02:48.807 --> 00:02:50.590
People would have hunkered down in there,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.560
standing guard,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.063
ready for an enemy attack.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.160
Visitors come because it's beautiful

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.993
and peaceful.

00:02:56.993 --> 00:02:59.030
And the water's a big part of that.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.380
On the shore, you could go
all day without noticing

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.700
the relics from when people thought

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.293
it was a dangerous place to be.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.611
It's strange to think I
could have missed all of it,

00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:09.340
if I hadn't wandered into the woods

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.660
and gotten a little lost.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.690
And I never would have
known what I could've found

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.440
if I just looked a little closer.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.580
Thanks so much for watching.
