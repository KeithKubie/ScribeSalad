00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.000
As more and more comic books burst to life
on the big screen, the action, storylines,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.430
and casts are only getting bigger and bigger.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.360
As a result, some of the simple mistakes and
errors that would normally be caught in editing

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.860
are slipping through more than ever.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.651
And as audience grow more and more excited
to see their favorite heroes on screen, some

00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:25.260
massive mistakes have gone completely unnoticed.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.140
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Huge Mistakes
in Superhero Movies.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.189
General Zod’s Faulty Clock

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.140
Although Man of Steel star Clark Kent spent
his entire life keeping his alien heritage

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.620
a secret from the world, General Zod spills
his secret to every corner of the world.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.110
When the Kryptonian first arrives at Earth,
he broadcasts a message in multiple languages

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.199
around the globe, telling people in America
and Asia that "they are not alone."

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.860
Seeing people huddled around their campfires
or TVs, and learning that an alien lives among

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.280
them is a powerful image, but all the scenes
being set at night, no matter which side of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.750
the planet they're on doesn't quite add up.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.150
Since the message of the scene is to unite
all of Earth in fear, fans will likely be

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.190
willing to overlook it.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.190
Turned Around Tumbler

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.960
Christopher Nolan isn’t afraid of leaving
a few errors in his films since the thrills

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.420
or twists they bring with them are usually
worth it in the end.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.030
In the case of his re-imagined Batman, the
director bet that audiences would be too thrilled

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.490
to see the new Dark Knight in action – along
with his signature set of wheels – to notice

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.960
a few major mistakes.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.470
During Bruce’s first test drive of the camo-patterned
Tumbler, he brings the vehicle to a dramatic

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.420
stop with a sudden slide.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.180
But a closer look reveals that Bruce turns
the wheel hard left to stop, while the car

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.110
ends up sending the car sliding to the right
before stopping instead.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.240
Making eagle-eyed viewers wonder just how
difficult the vehicle must be to pilot.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.240
Crowded Chase

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.420
When Batman finally takes his new Tumbler
into the field, a Gotham City Police pursuit

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.850
has him cornered atop a large parking structure.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.700
With cops swarming, Nolan clearly hoped audiences
would be too excited or caught up to notice

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.810
the massive group of crew members and camera
men on set, completely exposed by a police

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.810
chopper’s searchlight.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.540
And he was probably right.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.390
Wolverine’s Faulty Skull

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.550
When Wolverine and Rogue pay a visit to Bobby
a.k.a. Iceman's family in X2: X-Men United,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.450
the mutant's brother calls the police, ambushing
the entire group on the house's front porch.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.420
A jumpy police officer drops Wolverine with
a bullet to the head, taking the situation

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.140
from bad to worse.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.380
Fans knew that Wolverine’s healing factor
would bring him back to the fight in no time,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.030
but the actual shot doesn’t make much sense
considering the nearly-invincible hero’s

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.070
usual fighting skills.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.920
The first question is how the bullet managed
to lodge itself in his head in the first place:

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.450
a skull made of indestructible Adamantium
means the bullet should have glanced off harmlessly,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.360
instead embedding itself in the millimeter
of skin on his forehead.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.810
Why he was knocked unconscious doesn’t make
sense either.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.060
Despite making his claws and bones unbreakable,
is the same metal useless at protecting his

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.060
brain?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.560
Of course, there’s always the chance that
the cop was firing Adamantium bullets – but

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.810
that seems like a long shot.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.920
Shield Logic

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.210
Once Steve Rogers finally starts to prepare
for field work during the first Captain America,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.500
he stumbles upon a prototype of his famous
vibranium shield.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.820
Described as “completely vibration resistant”,
it succeeds in not deflecting bullets, but

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.319
stopping them dead in their tracks.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.730
It isn’t just bullets, either.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.040
In The Avengers, its invulnerability is tested,
stopping even Thor’s hammer, directing his

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.540
godlike attack into a massive shockwave.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.270
Unfortunately, in the effort to make the Winter
Soldier sequel a more grounded and realistic

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.470
adventure, the strengths of Cap’s shield
flew completely out the window.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.250
Not only was Steve able to use his shield
to deflect bullets at his enemies, but kicks

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.980
and punches were able to knock him around,
and a single RPG sent him tumbling through

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.980
the air.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.980
A Shifting Pentagon

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.940
Considering just how much X-Men: Days of Future
Past deals with time travel and re-writing

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.290
history, plenty of inaccuracies can be explained
away as slightly different in the alternate

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.290
timeline.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.580
– although we’re fairly certain that in
all realities, the Pentagon is technically

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.210
located in Arlington, Virginia, not Washington
D.C. as the movie claims.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.210
A Rogue Kitty

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.470
Most fans know that the original cut of the
movie had the team of future X-Men seeking

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.500
help from Rogue after an unconscious Wolverine
mortally wounded Kitty Pryde.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.819
With Kitty’s health failing, Rogue was brought
in to absorb her power, and take over.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.900
In the end Kitty was simply shown to tough
it out in the finished version, but the filmmakers

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.020
didn’t remove the previous storyline completely.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.730
When a wounded Magneto slides to the ground
as the final battle reaches its conclusion,

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.070
Kitty is supposed to be maintaining the link
to the past, but can just be spotted slumped

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.340
on the floor next to him.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.599
Extremis Measures

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.340
Not every Marvel fan was happy to see Tony
Stark separated from his signature armor in

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.479
Iron Man 3, but his gift for invention and
careful planning showed he was a threat with

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.639
or without his suit.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.069
Even so, the filmmakers may have turned a
blind eye to a few mistaken details.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:38.629
The brilliant Doctor Maya Hansen threatening
to inject a syringe carrying “1200 cc”

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.819
– an amount equal to 1.2 litres – is an
odd mistake for her character to make, but

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.960
it wasn’t the movie’s only inaccuracy.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.129
Tennessee Express

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.169
Iron Man 3’s questionable math continues
when Tony realizes his suit in Tennessee has

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.800
finally been powered online, asking the henchmen
on hand exactly what distance the armor pieces

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.069
need to travel to reach him.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:03.949
The suit bursts in just minutes later: a major
problem once fans start doing the math.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.650
The payoff is worth it, but the idea that
the pieces could travel around 7,000 mph proves

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.249
comedy beat out actual physics in this case.

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:13.249
Identity Crisis

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.800
For all its action, the first Thor movie served
to prove one point: that godly power was a

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.960
gift, not a privilege, and that the Asgardian
hero needed to learn some humility.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.199
He learned his lesson in the end, saving his
father and kingdom from his brother’s betrayal.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.219
Once Loki was beaten, the would-be king chose
to fall into a wormhole in space, eventually

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.180
making his way to the villain Thanos, and
back to Earth to fight The Avengers years

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.180
later.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.180
But his family mourned him all the same, with
Thor taking a private moment to tell Odin

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.139
that he could never be as good a king as his
father.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.710
The sentiment is returned to at the end of
Thor: the Dark World, when Odin asks Thor

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.439
if he still believes that the father should
rule, and not the son.

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:57.919
It’s a subtle callback for the die-hard
fans, but there’s one problem: the film

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.619
ends by revealing that it isn’t Odin on
the throne, but Loki in disguise.

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:05.659
A slip-up on the writer’s part is likely
to blame, since there’s no way Loki should

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.669
know about the pair’s conversation as he
was drifting through space.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.270
Some might argue he was eavesdropping from
across the universe, but we like to think

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.339
Loki has better ways to spend his time.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:17.339
So what do you think of our list?
