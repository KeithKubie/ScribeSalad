00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.170
Hi.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.310
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse Mythology
and today we’re talking about another hero.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.170
One who eventually becomes a god.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.360
A demi-god.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.210
Which is another way of saying semi-god.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.210
Kinda.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.580
Anyway, it’s our old friend Herakles!

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.310
Who some call “Hercules”: sometimes a
man, sometimes a god, but always a guy who

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.500
really knows how to rock a lion skin, right
Thoth?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.670
[[Thoth in lion skin]] OH NO I MEAN - you
look really good too!

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.480
Very heroic.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.470
INTRO
Herakles has a reputation for being kind of

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.470
a brute.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.809
All brawn, no brain.

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.839
But… remember when we talked about Herakles
in an episode on tricksters?

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.469
Remember how he tricks Atlas into holding
up the sky forever?

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.719
He may be buff, but Herakles sure ain’t
dense.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.260
Though, he doesn’t always makes the best
choices.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.129
Sometimes Herakles is his own worst enemy.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.190
Even worse than the hydra, and that was a
pretty bad one!

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.890
But let’s not get aHEAD... of ourselves!

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.640
Like many heroes, Herakles had a miraculous
birth.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.450
Zeus, God of lightning bolts but not consent,
takes a liking to Alcmene, the queen of Thebes.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.920
Zeus transforms himself into the form of the
king, Amphitryon, and sleeps with the Queen.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.460
Nine months later Alcmene gives birth to two
boys, Iphicles and Alceides.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.159
One of them is Amphitryon’s son, and the
other is Zeus’.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.539
But oh DIVINE BOYS - which is which?!

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:33.939
This is how sitcoms get started.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.789
When Hera finds out about this debacle ‒ yet
another Zeus-ian infidelity ‒ she sends

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.830
two revenge serpents to Iphicles and Alceides’
cribs.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.539
When the king and queen rush in, Iphicles
is crying and Alceides is holding the two

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.939
serpents, strangled in each of his tiny baby
hands.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.960
Mystery solved, I guess!

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.430
Alceides would later become … Herakles.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.119
Alceides is raised as a prince of Thebes,
but he’s a bit of a problem child.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.289
His godlike strength keeps getting him into
trouble.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.759
At one point, he gets so mad at his music
teacher that he smashes a lyre over his head

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.230
and kills him.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.590
This is the last straw for Amphitryon, and
the king sends the dangerous demi-god princeling

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.570
away to tend sheep.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.170
As a shepherd, Herakles gets to put his great
strength to use.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.620
A monstrous beast named the lion of Citharion
had been terrorizing the cattle of Thespios,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.830
king of Thespiae.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.099
When Herakles catches it and slays it, Thespios
is so overjoyed that he allows him to take

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.519
one of his fifty daughters to bed each night.

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.019
[PAUSE] Gross..

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.950
Eventually, Alceides moves back to Thebes
and marries princess Megara.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.010
They start a family, and things begin to settle
down.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.110
Despite the earlier adventures, though, THIS
is where we get to the turning point in Alceides’

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.990
life: suddenly, he goes mad.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.269
He takes his three children, and two of his
nephews, and burns them alive.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.209
There is some ambiguity here in the story,
whether this madness was Alceides finally

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.610
giving in to his wild nature, or whether it
was caused by a vindictive Hera, who can really

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.610
hold a grudge.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.599
But either way - when Alceides comes to his
senses he implores an oracle for help.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.079
The oracle tells him ‒ appease Hera.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.340
Change your name to Herakles.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.689
And to atone you must travel to Tiryns, and
allow your rival, King Eurystheus, king of

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:34.209
Tiryns and Mycenae, to set your punishment
for killing your children.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.170
This is the beginning of the ten labors of
Herakles.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.170
Yup, ten.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.170
Don’t worry.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.170
We’re gonna get there.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.329
When Herakles arrives and tells Eurystheus
what he’s done, the king of Tiryns gives

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.239
him a set of impossible tasks.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.510
These ten labors will take Herakles far and
away, confronting all manner of monster.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.599
And if he succeeds, he won’t just atone
for his family-murdering, he’ll also be

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.150
granted immortality.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.819
These are the heroic tasks that made Herakles
famous, let’s count them off.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.879
ONE - THE NEMEAN LION
Harkening back to his days as a lion-slaying

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.550
shepherd, Herakles’ first labor is to go
to Nemea and kill a monstrous lion.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.390
This lion’s skin can’t be pierced by arrows
or spears but Herakles doesn’t let this

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.110
stop him ‒ he puts the beast into a chokehold
and strangles him.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.110
CHECK!

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.780
Herakles must then defeat the Lernean Hydra,
a swamp dragon with nine heads.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.910
Everytime he slices one of the heads off,
two grow back in its place and before long

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.570
Herakles is practically drowning in craniums.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.570
Luckily, his nephew Iolas (who somehow managed
to avoid the nephew killing-by-fire from earlier),

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.920
brings Herakles flaming torches.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.410
The torches cauterize the dragon-neck-wounds,
preventing the hydra from multiplying.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.130
Herakles kills the Hydra, dips some arrows
into its bile, y’know: just in case, and

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.820
returns triumphant.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:08.080
But, Eurystheus tells him: this isn’t Herakles
and Iolas’ ten labors ‒ you can’t get

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.570
outside help.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.040
That one doesn’t count.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.490
Second labor: DISQUALIFIED.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.730
For his third labor, Herakles must capture
the gold-horned Hind of Ceryneia.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.730
ALONE.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.500
It’s tough, but after some chasing or trapping
(depending on which version you prefer), Herakles

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.100
snags the Hind.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.100
CHECK!

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.860
Next, Herakles must go to Psophis and kill
the giant Erymanthian Boar.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.660
On the way he stops at the cave of the centaur
Pholos and ... accidentally kills him with

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.260
one of those Hydra-bile soaked just-in-case
arrows.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.760
After burying the centaur, Herakles traps
the Boar and takes it to Mycenae.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.940
CHECK! but also rest in power Pholos.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.870
So far, all of Herakles’ labors have been
giant scary beast related.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.930
For this fifth labor, Eurystheus tells him
he must ... clean out the stables.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.350
Of Augeus, King of Elis.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:08.110
Augeus owned 3,000 immortal cattle and hadn’t
cleaned his stables in 30 years.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.930
Thats’ about 650,000 pounds of immortal
dung.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.130
YEAH WE DID THE MATH.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.560
Herakles agrees, and says to Augeus ‒ “If
I manage to clean all this out in a single

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.800
day, will you agree to give me a tenth of
your immortal cattle?”

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.970
OOOOOO TRICKY HERAKLES IS BACK
Augeus agrees, and instead of grabbing a dung

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.730
shovel, Herakles goes upstream and diverts
two nearby rivers through the stables.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.730
The water washes out the years of dung in
minutes.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.790
Augeus, who thought this labor was impossible,
bails on their deal . Herakles takes him before

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.640
a judge and wins the case.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.980
But, Augeus flies into a rage and banishes
him before Herakles can claim the cattle.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.520
Herakles returns to Eurystheus empty-handed,
only to have Eurystheus announce that this

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.780
labor didn’t count because Herakles tried
to get paid for it!

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.030
Fifth labor: DISQUALIFIED!

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.020
After the immortal-dung-debacle, Herakles
is back to wrangling monstrous animals.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.250
This time, in Arcadia where he must drive
away the Stymphalian birds.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.660
Herakles scares ‘em off with just a pair
of bronze castanets.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.850
Sixth labor: CHECK.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.850
Easy peasy.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.030
Birds hate castanets!

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.300
[[THOTH SHOWS UP WITH CASTANETS, DRESSED AS
A FLAMENCO DANCER]]C’mon Thoth - you’re

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.050
an Ibis… not a FLAMENCO.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.670
Herakle’s seventh labor is to capture the
rampaging Cretan Bull.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.050
Which he could do this in his sleep at this
point.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.060
Seventh labor: no sweat CHECK!.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.940
Next , Herakles has to go to Thrace to capture
the man-eating mares of Diomedes.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.780
There’s a lot of different versions of this
one, but they all end the same way...

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.620
Eighth labor: CHECK!

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.710
Herakles’ ninth labor is to fetch the belt
of Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.220
At first, Hippolyte agrees to just give Herakles
the belt.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:01.160
But then Hera starts a rumor that Herakles
has come to kidnap Hippolyte, and the Amazons

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160
jump him.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.320
In the ensuing struggle, Herakles kills Hippolyte
and takes her belt.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.340
Ninth labor: CHECK!.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.710
Hippolyte, we barely knew thee.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.030
Just one labor left, but there were two disqualifications!

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.490
For Herakles’ final three labors, let’s
go to the Thought Bubble:

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.470
The tenth labor takes Herakles far to the
west, to Erytheia, where he must seize the

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.590
red cattle of Geryon.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:32.779
On the way, Herakles is so angry about how
hot the Sun is that he aims his bow and arrow

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:33.779
at it.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:39.050
The Sun is so impressed with Herakles’ bravery
that he gives the hero a golden cup.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.519
And not just any cup.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:41.750
A magic cup!

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.619
That’s also a ship.

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:48.800
After Herakles kills Geryon and his herdsman
and his two-headed guard dog, he uses the

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.430
cup to transport the cattle back across the
sea.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.389
But then they escape and he has to chase them
all over Europe.

00:08:55.389 --> 00:09:01.480
When Herakles finally gets them to Eurystheus,
the king sacrifices them to Hera–thats labor

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.410
ten CHECK!–and tells Herakles ‒ okay,
you screwed up twice.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.410
Here are your two make up labors.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.930
Labor eleven is collecting golden Apples from
the nymphs, the Hesperides.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.260
This is the one where he tricks Atlas into
helping him.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.279
He also frees Prometheus.

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:17.810
You how this turns out: CH-CH-CH-CHECK!

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.560
And the twelfth, and final labor is to travel
to the Underworld and bring back that damned

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.470
doggo Cerberos, Hades’ three headed guard
pup.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.930
Herakles travels to the land of the dead,
where Hades happens upon Herakles and tells

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:36.620
him ‒ you can have Cerberos, but only if
you can defeat him without any of the weapons

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.930
you’ve brought.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:42.480
Herakles agrees, snags Cerberos around the
neck and chokes him into submission.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:48.430
He drags the dog to Eurystheus, gets him to
sign off on the final labor––CHECK TO

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.730
END ALL CHECKS and then returns Cerberos to
Hades.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:51.730
Good boy, Cerberos.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.730
And nice work Herakles.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.730
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.050
After all that adventuring, Herakles manages
to complete his ten-turned-twelve labors.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.990
While this is Herakles’ most famous story,
it’s far from his last adventure.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.110
He gets married again.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.259
That’s right…no happily ever after with
Megara.

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:07.720
Disney lied to you.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.970
Eventually, he even manages to achieve that
elusive immortality.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.490
Though, at a great cost.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.730
Well after his twelve labors, Herakles is
crossing the river Evenus with his new wife

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:18.790
Deianeira.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:25.160
The ferryman, a centaur named Nessus, tries
to rape Deianeira midstream and Herakles kills

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.160
him.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.439
But with his dying breath, Nessus tricks Deianeira
into preparing what he tells her is a love

00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:35.740
potion that she can use if Herakles ever loses
interest in her.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.230
Sure enough, Herakles later falls in love
with Iole.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:44.449
In order to win him back, Deianeira soaks
his shirt in Nessus’ “love potion” AKA

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:48.720
and of course a horrible, horrible poison
because what else would it be NESSUS WAS CLEARLY

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.960
A BAD GUY.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:55.670
Herakles puts on the shirt, and dies an extremely
painful death, burning on his own funeral

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.670
pyre.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:02.980
Finally Zeus tells Hera, hey, enough is enough
and sends Athena down to make Herakles immortal

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.920
and bring him to Mount Olympus.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.139
So Herakles becomes a god and gets to live
on Olympus.

00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:10.319
Right near Hera.

00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:11.319
… Yay?

00:11:11.319 --> 00:11:16.050
So... what makes Herakles, a screw up and
a child murderer, such an enduring hero?

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.550
I mean as demi-gods go, the guy isn’t exactly
a role model.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.550
He sleeps around.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.880
He loses his temper and kills people.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.779
The ancient world seemed to love him for the
variety and excitement of his adventures.

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:31.819
But what do we do about Herakles today?

00:11:31.819 --> 00:11:34.519
Herakles presents a real problem.

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:39.870
He’s been given power and strength and brains,
all courtesy of creepy, absent, irresponsible

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.670
father, but he still has to struggle to live
an ethical life?

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.570
Maybe we don’t have to fight hydras.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.930
I hope we don’t.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.060
Well, I definitely hope I don’t.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.930
Yet we all have to work to try and live with
each other respectfully and responsibly.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.310
We can’t rock a lion skin, but maybe we
can rock that.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:24.379
See you next time for the last in our hero
series - about Ma’ui.

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:48.329
You’re welcome.
