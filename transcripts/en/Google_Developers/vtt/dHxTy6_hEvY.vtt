00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.870
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: Sure. My name is Mike Szivos. I
work for Electronic Arts. So we have a successful

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.730
app on other social networks, and we see social
networks as a reach medium right now. So the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.210
choice to go to open social is to basically
reach more users than the ones we currently

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.550
reach and just to, to make sure, to get our
application in the hands of as many people

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.119
as we possibly can.
&gt;&gt; Which features of open social appeals to

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:38.710
the most users?
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: A couple of features that we found

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.720
really useful are signing through the make
request method that allows us to validate

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.810
request without knowing which container they
came from. When they're signed, we know that

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.740
they come from a valid container, so that
saves us a lot of time. It's just all the,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.280
the social features that allow for viral spread
of an application 'cause that's kind of how--that's

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.600
our business is, is based on viral spread
of our apps through people enjoying them and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:18.390
then sending them to their friends.
&gt;&gt; So what language or technology do use in...

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.530
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: So primarily the backend, we use
Java. And on the front end we use exclusively

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.060
Flash, Flash 10. We do--we develop very feature
rich gaming applications. So Flash allows

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.390
us to do, you know, a lot of animation and
cool features that would be harder to do into

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:46.310
this in a web technology.
&gt;&gt; And what features are missing...?

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.799
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: So far, we haven't really felt
anything is missing. We have everything we

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.260
need to make success--make our game success
through open social. We--we would recommend

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.400
that you guys continue to do really solid
documentation and a sample code is really,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.170
really key for us. And one other feature that
I think we would--we would be able to--we

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.130
would find very useful is additional debugging
information especially through make request

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.810
when we have--when we're using signing so
that we know whatever we're sending is getting

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.390
to our server.
&gt;&gt; And do you have [INDISTINCT] in the counter...?

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.280
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: Just learning the iGoogle platform
and dealing with the developer--development

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.980
environment which was, you know, it's not
released yet. I don't know if it's in beta

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.150
or prebeta, but sometimes that would not be
too stable. So that would impact our development

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.540
efforts. But beyond that, it's been--it's
been great to work with.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.959
&gt;&gt; And how do you measure the user retention?
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: So we--we decided that a user is

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:11.819
retained if they comeback to play a game within
30 days. So monthly active users is how we,

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:21.610
kind of how we gauge the success of our app.
&gt;&gt; And how do you spend most of the [INDISTINCT]...?

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.760
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: So we have a, you know, we have
a really strong commitment to quality at EA.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.739
So the products we ship have to be, you know,
really polished. So we're--we spend a lot

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.849
of our time on debugging and really polishing
them so that our--our users when we launch

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.300
get like the best experience and that's an
experience that they then want to share with

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.069
their friends around the Internet. So primarily,
it's, it's debugging and polishing before

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:58.239
launch 'cause we want to--we want to launch,
launch strong. And we also--we're doing--we

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.629
spend a lot of time on scaling the backend
too because we want it to be, you know, really

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.489
high up time and we want it to be responsive
and snappy. So that's a major focus for us

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.489
too.

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.310
&gt;&gt; Okay. What are the stories you would like
to share and with the difficulties...

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:23.410
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: Yeah, you know, having a very successful
application can be stressful because you have

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.699
hundreds of thousands of people a month come
to play it. So really have to--you have to

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.780
have confidence that the thing will scale
easily or you'll end up being a victim of

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.990
your success which is kind of a nice position
to be in, but also can be challenging for

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.590
the whole team.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, thanks for you time.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.656
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: Well, thanks for having me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.270
&gt;&gt; SZIVOS: And thanks for the free phone.
