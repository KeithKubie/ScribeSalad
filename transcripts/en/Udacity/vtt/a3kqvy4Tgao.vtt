00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.040
Along with labels, placeholders
like this one are super useful for

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.500
text or numeric inputs.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.330
Use placeholders to give
users a concrete idea

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.080
of exactly what they should type.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.450
For example, an input on a city field
show what is the expected value

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.010
telling users they should use
a full name of the city, like here.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.870
But remember that placeholders disappear
as soon as the user start typing

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.260
in the element, which means they
are not a replacement for labels.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.180
They should be used as
an aid to help guide users.
