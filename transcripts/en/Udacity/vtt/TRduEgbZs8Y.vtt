00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you consider an independent set versus a vertex cover,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
what you have is the following.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you have the smallest possible vertex cover, that means you have selected

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.500
a minimum number of vertices so that each edge is next to at least one of those vertices.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
If you were to remove those vertices from a graph, then no edges would remain

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.500
because every edge is connected to at least one of those vertices of the vertex cover,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
so what remains is always an independent set.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And since you've selected the smallest possible vertex cover,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so the smallest number of vertices you need to remove,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.500
what remains must be the largest set or a largest set of independent vertices.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
And now that discovery is, of course, really great news for Alice,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but it's also even better news for Carol whose smile gets a bit bigger,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.500
and, of course, also Bob because what they have now found out is this:

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.000
clique and independent set are really closely connected.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So if Bob discovers a good--or if any of them discovers a good algorithm for clique,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.500
then they have not only solved "clique" but also "independent set."

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.000
So if just one of those two problems is solvable in polynomial time

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.300
or, in other words, if just one of those two problems turns out to be tractable,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.500
then the other problem will be tractable as well.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.500
And now we have also connected vertex cover to independent set

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.500
because we've basically figured out that finding the largest possible independent set

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.500
for a graph is almost the same as looking for the smallest possible vertex cover.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.000
This also means that if you can find the smallest possible vertex cover,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
then you have found the largest possible independent set

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
which we already know, through transforming the graph, let's you find

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the largest possible clique.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So, actually, we can also draw this connection here

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
because we already know about these two connections.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What they have discovered is something that is commonly known as a reduction.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And we'll get more deeply into that in the next unit.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
What a reduction is is basically a transformation between two problems

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so that if you find out that one of them is tractable,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
then the other one is tractable as well.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So now the big question is, for clique, vertex cover, and independent set,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
are those three problems tractable--in which case

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Alice, Bob, and Carol would really keep smiling--

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or will it turn out that all of these problems are intractable--in which case

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Bob, Alice, and Carol would tend to be rather unhappy?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So which one is it going to be?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Are all three going to end up very happy, are all three going to end up very sad,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
or is there maybe something in between?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You can find out how that story continues in our next unit

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
of our Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science.

00:02:45.000 --> 99:59:59.999
Plus, in the next unit, I will also tell you how you could quickly win a million dollars.
