many of the countries that we are

many of the countries that we are
 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.500
many of the countries that we are
working in I agree completely that it is

crucial not to encourage dependence on
 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.370
crucial not to encourage dependence on

aid and that's why from the very
 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.620
aid and that's why from the very
beginning when we go into a situation we

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630
beginning when we go into a situation we
 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.930
