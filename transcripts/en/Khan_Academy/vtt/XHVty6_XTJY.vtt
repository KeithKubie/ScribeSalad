00:00:00.473 --> 00:00:05.001
- [Instructor] As we enter
into the 3rd Century BCE,

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:09.168
we see the Roman Republic
that was founded in 509 BCE

00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:13.350
has now exerted control over most

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.869
of the Italian peninsula.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.203
But it's not the only
power in the Mediterranean.

00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:21.880
We have the remnants of
Alexander the Great's empire

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.396
and we also have the Carthaginians.

00:00:24.396 --> 00:00:26.741
And you can see here in blue

00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:28.878
that Carthage had an extensive empire

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:32.930
that controlled most of the
the western Mediterranean.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.437
You can imagine, it was
only a matter of time

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:38.145
before they come into
conflict with each other.

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.447
It turns out they are
actually going to have

00:00:40.447 --> 00:00:42.830
three significant wars.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.137
Some historians view it
as the most significant

00:00:46.137 --> 00:00:48.443
and largest scale wars

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:51.232
up to that point in history.

00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:53.165
The first of these

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:54.332
happens in 264

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:56.946
BCE

00:00:56.946 --> 00:01:00.107
and then it goes on for 23 years

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:00.940
to 241

00:01:02.023 --> 00:01:03.377
BCE.

00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:05.544
This is known as the First

00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:10.030
Punic War.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.596
You can see it on the
timeline right over here

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:14.254
going from 264

00:01:14.254 --> 00:01:15.087
to 241,

00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:20.845
right over there.

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:23.410
It's a result of a conflict

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.207
that starts between two
city-states in Sicily.

00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:30.745
Sicily is this island right over here.

00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:32.997
You have the city-state of Syracuse

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:34.580
which is a powerful

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:38.338
city originally established by the Greeks,

00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:40.637
and it gets into a scuffle with Messana

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:43.713
which is another
city-state at the northern,

00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:46.360
northeastern tip of Sicily.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.157
Rome and Carthage, these two
great powers get embroiled

00:01:50.157 --> 00:01:53.733
and it ends up being a conflict
over the island of Sicily

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:58.562
where Carthage already had a
foothold on the west coast.

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:01.593
What's interesting going into this war

00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:03.411
is that Carthage had a powerful,

00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:06.538
you could view it as
an empire over the sea.

00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:08.802
It had a very powerful navy.

00:02:08.802 --> 00:02:11.101
While Rome had a very powerful army.

00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:13.748
Not really much of a navy, to speak of.

00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:17.208
But as we'll see as we go
through the First Punic War,

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:18.916
that will change.

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:23.094
The first major battle
happens at Agrigentum,

00:02:23.094 --> 00:02:25.216
I'm probably mispronouncing it here,

00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:26.049
on Sicily.

00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:29.488
The Romans are able to win decisively,

00:02:29.488 --> 00:02:31.087
and then the Carthaginians,
you could imagine,

00:02:31.087 --> 00:02:31.920
started to say,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.605
"Well maybe we should
engage them more into sea."

00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:38.227
That happens in 260 at the
Battle of Lipari Islands

00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:39.853
which are right over here.

00:02:39.853 --> 00:02:42.152
When the Romans get
defeated there, they say,

00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:45.774
"Hey, maybe we need a
little bit more of a navy."

00:02:45.774 --> 00:02:49.520
And so over the course
of these several decades,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.749
you have

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.089
this continual fighting.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.072
There are some Carthaginian
or Punic victories

00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:57.288
we've talked about in previous video.

00:02:57.288 --> 00:02:59.808
The word Punic is derived
from what the Romans

00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:02.234
called the Carthaginians which is derived

00:03:02.234 --> 00:03:04.707
from their roots as Phoenicians.

00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:08.724
You have some Punic victories,
but for the most part,

00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:10.849
Rome is successful.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.333
And so, at the end of the First Punic War,

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:14.750
a few things happened.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.785
You have Carthage leaves Sicily.

00:03:17.785 --> 00:03:19.202
Carthage expelled

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.793
from

00:03:24.432 --> 00:03:25.265
Sicily.

00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:30.627
You have war indemnity.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:34.215
Rome tells Carthage,
"Hey, you've gotta pay us

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:35.709
"for all of the damage you created."

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.845
This is difficult for Carthage because

00:03:37.845 --> 00:03:39.587
a war cost Carthage a lot,

00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:42.695
and Carthage, especially, it
didn't have citizen soldiers.

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:44.945
Its army was made up of ...

00:03:46.108 --> 00:03:49.059
Its navy had citizen, I
guess you say, sailors.

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:53.059
But it's army was made
up mainly of mercenaries.

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:56.297
These are soldiers

00:03:57.327 --> 00:03:59.116
who really, if you pay them enough,

00:03:59.116 --> 00:03:59.949
they're gonna fight for you.

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.346
They don't really have allegiances

00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:04.747
based on some type of
ideology or citizenship.

00:04:04.747 --> 00:04:07.522
Carthage, as they went
through this many decades war,

00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:09.693
they went ahead and pay
all these mercenaries.

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:11.144
They had their own cost.

00:04:11.144 --> 00:04:14.302
And now, Rome is making
them pay indemnity.

00:04:14.302 --> 00:04:15.385
War indemnity

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.872
to Rome.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.312
The other, I guess you
could say side effect

00:04:23.312 --> 00:04:24.814
of this First Punic War

00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:29.581
is that it was a catalyst
for Rome building its navy.

00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:30.905
Rome

00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:31.738
builds

00:04:33.561 --> 00:04:35.048
navy.

00:04:35.048 --> 00:04:38.670
You can imagine especially the
cost of the First Punic War,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.899
it becomes very difficult for Carthage.

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:43.148
It actually de-stabilizes Carthage.

00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:45.540
A lot of the mercenaries,
when they're not paid

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.698
as they see they should
be, they actually rise up.

00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:52.460
From 240 to 238, you have a Mercenary War.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.841
So 240

00:04:53.841 --> 00:04:54.674
to 238

00:04:55.931 --> 00:04:56.764
BCE,

00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:01.985
you have a Mercenary War.

00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:07.274
Eventually, it's able to be
put down by the Carthaginians

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:09.628
but the side effect is
it weakens their hold

00:05:09.628 --> 00:05:11.416
on Sardinian Corsica.

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:14.749
And so, by the end of the Mercenary War,

00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:21.539
the map looks like this right over here.

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:22.898
You could view this map

00:05:22.898 --> 00:05:27.388
as what the Mediterranean
looked like in 238

00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:28.607
BCE.

00:05:28.607 --> 00:05:29.977
Where you see now the Romans

00:05:29.977 --> 00:05:31.890
not only have control of
the Italian peninsula,

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.415
they've gained control
over Corsica, Sardinia, and

00:05:36.415 --> 00:05:37.248
Sicily.

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:42.747
Roman power is only going to increase

00:05:42.747 --> 00:05:45.696
but the Carthaginians, this proud empire,

00:05:45.696 --> 00:05:47.375
they're not done here.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:48.208
In 218,

00:05:49.262 --> 00:05:51.404
the Carthaginian general Hannibal,

00:05:51.404 --> 00:05:55.230
the famous Hannibal, decides
to attack the Romans.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.796
He does it in a unconventional way.

00:05:57.796 --> 00:05:59.375
He attacks from the north.

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:02.788
He takes his army,
which includes elephants

00:06:02.788 --> 00:06:04.402
through the Swiss Alps.

00:06:04.402 --> 00:06:06.283
This is an artist depiction of

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:09.742
Hannibal's army with its
elephants going through

00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:11.020
the Swiss Alps.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.029
They're able to wreak havoc
over the Italian peninsula.

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.862
This goes on for roughly 15 years.

00:06:19.688 --> 00:06:20.930
From

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.763
218

00:06:23.357 --> 00:06:24.190
BCE

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.153
'til 201

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.395
BCE,

00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:30.895
you have the Second Punic War.

00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:39.134
Even though Hannibal's
able to wreak havoc for

00:06:39.134 --> 00:06:41.432
over a decade on the Italian peninsula,

00:06:41.432 --> 00:06:44.831
he's never able to fully
take control of Rome.

00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:47.292
There's several explanations there.

00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:49.127
One is that the people that he conquers

00:06:49.127 --> 00:06:50.772
kept rising up against him.

00:06:50.772 --> 00:06:52.781
They weren't just happy to be subjugated

00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:54.839
by the Carthaginians,

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:57.901
by the Punics, I guess you could say.

00:06:57.901 --> 00:07:00.505
And he never was able to
get as many reinforcements

00:07:00.505 --> 00:07:03.953
as necessary to fully subjugate Rome.

00:07:03.953 --> 00:07:06.054
By the end of the Second Punic War,

00:07:06.054 --> 00:07:09.247
the Romans decide to take
the battle to Carthage.

00:07:09.247 --> 00:07:10.751
In 202

00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:12.918
BCE at the Battle of Zama,

00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:17.752
the Romans are able to
decisively beat Hannibal.

00:07:17.752 --> 00:07:20.782
Hannibal is called back
to defend the homeland

00:07:20.782 --> 00:07:23.510
and he is defeated here at Zama.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.353
In 201 BCE, you have the
end of the Second Punic War.

00:07:27.353 --> 00:07:30.799
By that point, at the end
of the Second Punic War,

00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:31.799
you now have

00:07:33.238 --> 00:07:34.488
Rome in control

00:07:35.327 --> 00:07:37.796
of significant chunks
of the Iberian peninsula

00:07:37.796 --> 00:07:40.320
that used to be under control of Carthage.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.871
And Carthage has really been reduced to a

00:07:42.871 --> 00:07:45.358
client state of Rome.

00:07:45.358 --> 00:07:49.084
This is roughly what the map looks like.

00:07:49.084 --> 00:07:51.303
After this, Rome isn't happy.

00:07:51.303 --> 00:07:53.230
This was a pretty ugly war.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.703
Hannibal was here wreaking
havoc on the Italian peninsula.

00:07:55.703 --> 00:07:58.861
He was almost successful
at taking over Rome.

00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:03.028
He was an existential threat
to the Roman Republic.

00:08:05.123 --> 00:08:07.664
Carthage essentially becomes
a client state of Rome.

00:08:07.664 --> 00:08:09.028
They have to pay war indemnity.

00:08:09.028 --> 00:08:12.134
They really can't have a
significant army anymore

00:08:12.134 --> 00:08:13.967
or a significant navy.

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.474
Many people in Rome over
the next several decades

00:08:17.474 --> 00:08:18.940
even though Carthage is weakened so much,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.203
they start arguing,

00:08:20.203 --> 00:08:24.429
"Hey, we should just
completely destroy this city

00:08:24.429 --> 00:08:28.724
"because every time we destroy
them or at least we beat them

00:08:28.724 --> 00:08:29.977
"we get into this peace treaty

00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:31.434
"but then they get powerful again and then

00:08:31.434 --> 00:08:32.621
"we get into a war with them."

00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.188
These are very ugly wars.

00:08:35.188 --> 00:08:36.521
Finally, in 149,

00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:41.903
let me write this,

00:08:41.903 --> 00:08:43.370
149

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.203
BCE

00:08:45.298 --> 00:08:49.612
as Carthage is starting to
reassert a little bit of power,

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.612
it's trying to rebuild its military,

00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:55.611
the Romans get scared.

00:08:55.611 --> 00:08:58.038
They say, "You know what,
let's just finish them off

00:08:58.038 --> 00:08:59.617
"once and for all."

00:08:59.617 --> 00:09:00.450
They say, "All right."

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.049
They start to put very onerous
terms on the Carthaginians.

00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:06.951
They say, "Hey, move
your city further inland.

00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:08.786
"We don't want you to ever be a power."

00:09:08.786 --> 00:09:11.224
The Carthaginians of course really can't.

00:09:11.224 --> 00:09:13.186
They say, "Hey, we're just
gonna move our entire city

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:16.437
"and we're gonna cede to your demands."

00:09:16.437 --> 00:09:21.301
And so the Romans used
that as grounds for attack.

00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:22.837
From 149

00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:23.670
BCE to 146

00:09:25.206 --> 00:09:26.529
BCE,

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:28.946
you have the Third Punic War.

00:09:31.255 --> 00:09:33.405
Which is really the one where

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:36.133
Rome goes to destroy Carthage,

00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:40.274
and they are able to
destroy Carthage ending a

00:09:40.274 --> 00:09:41.107
700-year

00:09:42.222 --> 00:09:46.139
city-state, empire,
whatever you wanna call it.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.857
The city of Carthage is utterly destroyed.

00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:53.104
Its inhabitants are enslaved

00:09:53.104 --> 00:09:55.655
which the Romans like to
do for subjugated people.

00:09:55.655 --> 00:09:58.072
The city was burned in a very

00:09:59.282 --> 00:10:01.771
systematic way for 17

00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:02.604
days.

00:10:02.604 --> 00:10:04.388
The Romans wanted to ensure that Carthage

00:10:04.388 --> 00:10:08.637
could never rise up
again to threaten Rome.

00:10:08.637 --> 00:10:10.727
After the Third Punic War,

00:10:10.727 --> 00:10:14.268
the Romans are now the dominant empire

00:10:14.268 --> 00:10:16.137
in the Mediterranean.

00:10:16.137 --> 00:10:18.158
Not only did they control that,

00:10:18.158 --> 00:10:20.748
what they controlled going
into the Third Punic War,

00:10:20.748 --> 00:10:22.665
but now they controlled

00:10:26.123 --> 00:10:28.724
Carthage's African colonies.

00:10:28.724 --> 00:10:30.641
The same year, 146 BCE,

00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:36.498
the Romans were also able
to take control of Greece.

00:10:36.498 --> 00:10:39.558
As we exit out of the Third Punic War,

00:10:39.558 --> 00:10:41.573
you now have a Rome

00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:44.157
that is extremely powerful

00:10:44.157 --> 00:10:48.352
and this Roman Republic is
starting to resemble this

00:10:48.352 --> 00:10:49.246
empire.

00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:50.650
It's not officially an empire yet.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.974
It's still officially a republic,

00:10:51.974 --> 00:10:53.675
but it's taking control of other people

00:10:53.675 --> 00:10:55.178
so you could view it as an empire.

00:10:55.178 --> 00:10:59.563
It's starting to take shape
as this major civilization

00:10:59.563 --> 00:11:03.730
that will eventually control
the entire Mediterranean.
