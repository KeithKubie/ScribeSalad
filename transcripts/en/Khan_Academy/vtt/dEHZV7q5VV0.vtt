00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:01.755
- [Instructor] So we're told that f(x)

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:03.409
is equal to the infinite series,

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:05.678
we're going from n equals one to infinity

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:09.845
of n plus one over four to the
n plus one, times x to the n.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:13.080
And what we wanna figure out is, what is

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.226
the definite integral from
zero to one of this f(x)?

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:19.593
And like always, if you feel inspired,

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:21.509
and I encourage you to feel inspired,

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.309
pause the video and see if
you can work through this

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.292
on your own, or at any time
while I'm working through it,

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.193
pause it and try to keep on going.

00:00:28.193 --> 00:00:30.627
Well, let's just rewrite
this a little bit.

00:00:30.627 --> 00:00:32.176
This is going to be the same thing

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:34.192
as the integral from zero to one.

00:00:34.192 --> 00:00:38.659
F(x) is this series, so I could write

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.742
the sum from n equals one to infinity

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:47.342
of n plus one over four to the n plus one,

00:00:47.342 --> 00:00:49.308
times x to the n.

00:00:49.308 --> 00:00:51.225
And now what I'm about
to do might be the thing

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:53.991
that might be new to some of you,

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.010
but this is essentially, we're taking

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.942
a definite integral of a sum of terms.

00:00:57.942 --> 00:01:00.791
That's the same thing as taking the sum

00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:02.657
of a bunch of definite integrals.

00:01:02.657 --> 00:01:04.041
Let me make that clear.

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:06.331
So if I had a, let's say
this is a definite integral

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:11.081
zero to one, and let's say
I had a bunch of terms here.

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:12.231
I could even call them functions.

00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:16.227
Let's say it was g(x) plus h(x),

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:19.948
and I just kept going
on and on and on, dx,

00:01:19.948 --> 00:01:21.897
well, this is the same thing
as a sum of the integrals,

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:26.448
as the integral from zero to one of g(x),

00:01:26.448 --> 00:01:30.615
g(x) dx plus the integral
from zero to one h(x) dx,

00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:35.696
plus, and we go on and on and on forever.

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.446
However many of these terms are.

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:40.121
This comes straight out of
our integration properties.

00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:41.679
We can do the exact same thing here,

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.763
although we'll just do it
with the sigma notation.

00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:46.763
This is going to be equal to the sum

00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:51.512
from n equals one to infinity

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:56.446
of the definite integral
of each of these terms.

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:58.228
So I'm gonna write it like this.

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:01.962
So of the integral from zero to one

00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:06.129
of n plus one over four
to the n plus oneth power,

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:11.344
times x to the n, and then it is dx.

00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:16.946
Once again, now we're taking
the sum of each of these terms.

00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:20.696
Let's evaluate this
business right over here.

00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:25.211
That is going to, I'll
just keep writing it out.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:28.564
This is going to be equal to the sum

00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:32.231
from n equals one to
infinity, and then the stuff

00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:33.832
that I just underlined in orange,

00:02:33.832 --> 00:02:34.665
this is going to be, let's see,

00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:37.530
we take the antiderivative here.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.363
We are going to get to
x to the n plus one,

00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:44.263
and then we're gonna divide by n plus one.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:47.596
So we have this original n plus one over

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.280
four to the n plus one,
and that's just a constant

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.464
when we think in terms of x, for any one

00:02:54.464 --> 00:02:57.053
of these terms, and then
here we'd wanna increment

00:02:57.053 --> 00:02:59.997
the exponent, and then divide
by that incremented exponent.

00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:02.446
This just comes out of, I
often call it the inverse,

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:06.945
or the anti-power rule, or
reversing the power rule.

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:10.862
So it's x to the n plus
one over n plus one.

00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:13.829
I just took the antiderivative,

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.145
and we're gonna go from zero
to one for each of these terms.

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:18.444
Before we do that, we can simplify.

00:03:18.444 --> 00:03:21.511
We have an n plus one,
we have an n plus one,

00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:23.927
and so we can rewrite all of this.

00:03:23.927 --> 00:03:25.743
This is going to be the same thing,

00:03:25.743 --> 00:03:29.177
we're gonna take the sum from
n equals one to infinity,

00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:32.293
and this is going to be,
what we have in here,

00:03:32.293 --> 00:03:35.376
when x is equal to one, it is one,

00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:40.123
we could write one to the n plus one

00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:42.494
over four to the n plus one.

00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:44.160
Actually, yeah, why don't
I write it that way.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.443
One to the n plus one over
four to the n plus one,

00:03:48.443 --> 00:03:51.693
minus zero to the n plus one
over four to the n plus one,

00:03:51.693 --> 00:03:53.576
so we're not gonna even
have to write that.

00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:55.626
I could write zero to the n plus one

00:03:55.626 --> 00:04:00.566
over four to the n plus one,
but this is clearly just zero.

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:02.509
And then this, and this is starting

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.161
to get nice and simple now, this is going

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:06.958
to be the same thing, this is equal

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.375
to the sum from n equals one to infinity.

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.492
And we almost are gonna
get to our drumroll

00:04:13.492 --> 00:04:16.758
of 1/4 to the n plus one.

00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:18.275
Now you might immediately recognize this.

00:04:18.275 --> 00:04:20.980
This is an infinite geometric series.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.758
What is the first term here?

00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.258
Well, the first term is, well,

00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:32.841
when n is equal to one,
the first term here

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.508
is 1/4 to the second power.

00:04:39.607 --> 00:04:40.674
Did I do that right?

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:41.507
Yeah.

00:04:41.507 --> 00:04:45.241
When n is equal to one, it's going to be,

00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:49.505
so this is going to be
1/4 to the second power,

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:54.425
which is equal to 1/16,
so that's our first term.

00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:58.592
And then our common ratio
here, well that's gonna be,

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:04.539
well, we're just gonna
keep multiplying by 1/4,

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.888
so our common ratio here is 1/4.

00:05:06.888 --> 00:05:09.121
And so for an infinite geometric series,

00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:11.788
this is, since our common ratio,

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:16.107
its absolute value is less than one,

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.890
we know that this is going to converge,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.719
and it's gonna converge to the value,

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.302
our first term, 1/16, divided by

00:05:24.718 --> 00:05:28.589
one minus the common ratio, one minus 1/4,

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.756
so this is 3/4, so it's
equal to 1/16 times 4/3.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.858
This is going to be equal to 1/12.

00:05:40.858 --> 00:05:41.946
And we're done.

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:43.725
And this seemed really daunting at first,

00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:45.099
but we just have to realize, okay,

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.258
an integral of a sum,
even an infinite sum,

00:05:48.258 --> 00:05:50.975
well, that's gonna be the sum
of these infinite integrals.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:53.474
We take the antiderivative
of these infinite integrals,

00:05:53.474 --> 00:05:54.524
which we were able to do, which is kind

00:05:54.524 --> 00:05:58.091
of a cool thing, one of the
powers of symbolic mathematics,

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:00.008
and then we realized, oh, we just have

00:06:00.008 --> 00:06:00.841
an infinite geometric series,

00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:02.467
which we know how to find the sum of.

00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:03.717
And we're done.
