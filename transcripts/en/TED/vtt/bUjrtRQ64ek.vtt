00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.040
In 2009, in August, my office
weathered two major scandals.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.856
The first was the arrest,
trying and conviction

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.760
and subsequent incarceration
of Detroit's very popular mayor.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.040
The second caused the Detroit
police department crime lab to be closed.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.240
I thought nothing else could go wrong.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.256
And then the phone rang.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.656
(Laughter)

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.376
It was the deputy chief
of my special victim's unit,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.416
who was breathless
on the other end of the line.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.720
He said, "Boss, you are never
going to believe what I just saw."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.736
I had a sinking feeling
in the pit of my stomach,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.536
because I knew instinctively

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.376
that Detroit was getting ready
to suffer its third major scandal,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.720
in just over one year.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.296
He told me that he had just visited what
he thought was an abandoned warehouse

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:19.120
where the Detroit police department
was storing evidence.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.816
Inside were 11,341 abandoned,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
untested rape kits.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.440
Some of them went back to the 1980s.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.200
And some of them now
are over 40 years old.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.456
These kits were spilling out
of large, black garbage bags

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.080
and empty oil drums.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.176
Each kit represented a victim,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.656
mostly a female,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.920
that had suffered
a violent sexual assault.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.416
Each of them voluntarily endured
an hours-long rape kit process,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.440
with the hopes that as a result of that
they would find their perpetrator.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.656
And unbeknownst
to all of them, all 11,341,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.600
those kits were never tested.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.216
I cannot even begin to describe -- oh!

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.096
And by the way, before I move on,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.416
in the interim of those 40 years,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.280
those perpetrators were allowed
to continue to offend with impunity.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.360
I cannot tell you or describe to you
how outraged, mad and angry I was.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.296
I myself was a victim of sexual assault,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.960
back many decades ago,
when I was in law school.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.840
I also am the mother of three girls,
a 21-year-old and nine-year-old twins.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.176
I was even more horrified to learn --
if I could be more horrified --

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.120
that the oldest of those kits --

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.560
one of the oldest of those kits --
belonged to an eight-year-old girl.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.760
I'm going to tell you her story,
but I'm going to call her Natasha.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.176
On January 2, 1990, Natasha was at home
and a man knocked on her door.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.416
This man was familiar
with her neighborhood

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.496
and was familiar with the comings
and goings of her family,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.080
but Natasha did not know him.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.616
He told her that her grandmother,
the only mother that she had ever known,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.536
had been in a terrible accident

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.720
and was laying on a couch
in his house, calling for her.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.696
Terrified that Natasha was going to lose
her grandmother, she went with him.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.776
But of course, we all know
her grandmother was not there.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.736
Once he had isolated Natasha,
who was eight years old,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.296
he began to rape her violently.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.696
He raped her with his mouth,
his fingers and his penis.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.560
And he even forced his penis
into her mouth.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.016
When he was done,
he ordered Natasha to get dressed,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.696
he got dressed himself,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.376
and he put a blindfold across her head.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.200
And walked her to a factory area
on the edge of the neighborhood.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.656
He asked her if she knew --
he removed the blindfold,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.176
and asked her if she knew
how to get home from there.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.640
And when she indicated that she did,
he let her go and he walked off.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.376
Natasha's rape was reported immediately,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.000
and a rape kit was done.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.800
Now, the rape kit process
terrifies and traumatizes adult women.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.216
Can you imagine what it was like
for a little second-grader,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.816
who still wore pigtails
and still believed in Santa Claus,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.440
going through this exam?

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.136
Natasha's kit sat on the shelf
in that abandoned warehouse

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.880
for 26 years.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.856
Pamela, 19 years old --

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.216
I'll call her Pamela,
that's not her real name --

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.976
nineteen years old,
was walking down the street

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.736
after she had come
from visiting her boyfriend.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.136
She was grabbed from behind,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.600
and she felt what she thought
was a gun, in her side.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.736
She was taken to an abandoned house,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.480
to a bedroom in that house,
that was filled with trash.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.880
Every time she tried to resist,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.080
he would hit her
about the face and the head.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.976
He violently raped her
on the floor of that bedroom

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.960
that was filled with garbage.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.416
When he was done,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.296
he put on his clothes,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.400
he stole her money,
and he just walked away.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.240
Pamela also reported her rape right away.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.176
She also had a rape kit done.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.000
And like Natasha's,
her kit sat on the shelf for 15 years.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.856
Now, criminals, like people
who raped Natasha and Pamela,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.880
often leave their DNA at a crime scene.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.480
But for a rape victim,
their body is the crime scene.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.976
So many elect to go through this
hours-long rape kit process

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.856
that requires every inch and orifice
of a victim's body

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.240
to be combed, swabbed and photographed.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.840
All right after a violent sexual assault.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.856
The reason that most people do this,
who have a rape kit,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.496
is because they want the forensic
scientists to study that rape kit.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.336
And hopefully come up
with a genetic profile

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.800
that will help identify their perpetrator.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.776
Once forensic scientists
come up with this genetic profile,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.576
they enter it into CODIS,
hopefully have a match.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.896
CODIS is filled with DNA profiles
of people who are arrested

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.440
and/or convicted
of certain prescribed offenses.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.856
If in fact a profile is made
and entered into CODIS,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.120
it can help identify a perpetrator
in the matter of minutes.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.800
CODIS stands for
Combined DNA Index System.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.360
Now, how did we get here?

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.720
Detroit had no money.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.576
It cost, at that time
that these kits were found,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.576
up to 1,500 dollars per kit
to have it tested.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.336
So, you do the math
about how much that was going to cost.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.616
In addition to that,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.416
within four years of these kits
being found in 2009,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.056
Detroit would be the largest municipality
in the history of the United States

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.480
to declare bankruptcy.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.936
We didn't know what we were going to do.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.176
But not only that.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.736
As we began to study and investigate
how this possibly could have happened,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.600
we discovered there were other issues
besides just financial ones.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.136
During the course of these decades
where these kits sat in that warehouse,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.496
we discovered there had been
multiple changes of police leadership,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.776
with different priorities
and different agendas.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.016
There was woefully inadequate training
for sex crimes officers

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.840
in the police department in general.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.896
They were chronically understaffed,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.096
and they had other resource issues.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.376
And there was perpetual victim blaming

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.936
when these victims came
to report their crimes.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.600
That's the rape culture.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.816
And because of this victim blaming

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.296
of someone that had been
violently assaulted,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.656
some of these victim were even ridiculed

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.760
into not continuing
to proceed with their case.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.200
The bottom line is,
that 11,341 rape kits sat on that shelf.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.296
I wanted transparency.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.576
I asked myself: How in the world
can we stop this from spreading?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.176
I don't want to go through all this work
and five, 10 years down the line,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.640
figure we have the same issue.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.096
At that time, police officers
had the sole discretion

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.736
about whether and when and if

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.336
they were going to submit
the rape kits for testing --

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.736
any rape kit in their
jurisdiction -- for testing.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.976
That had to change.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.696
We had to take that discretion
away from police officers,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.336
and pass state laws

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.056
to ensure that every rape kit
released by the victim to law enforcement

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.360
is tested immediately.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.176
I also knew that there had to be
some kind of system

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.216
to keep everybody honest and to keep
everybody accountable, put in place,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.760
where we knew where these
rape kits were, at any given time.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.520
The answer was simple.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.216
Think about all
of the hundreds of thousands

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.576
and perhaps millions of packages,

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.440
that are moved by
a logistics company every day.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.656
They are scanned and tracked,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.176
and they know where they are,
at every bend and turn,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.616
from the time that they're stored
in the warehouse,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.360
until the time that that package arrives
on the purchaser's front steps.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.680
Why couldn't we do that for rape kits?

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.016
I had no desire to reinvent the wheel.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.560
So I contacted UPS.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.016
UPS, within two weeks -- two weeks --

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.416
of our first meeting with UPS,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.536
they had come up with a major plan

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.616
where they involved
all the stakeholders --

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.536
the police officers, the prosecutors,
the medical facilities,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.856
the forensic nurses, the hospitals,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.576
the lab personnel
and the victim advocates,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.680
could know where the rape kits were
at any given time.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.016
They sent a team of experts out

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.056
and fanned the Detroit area,
talked to all the stakeholders

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.696
and developed a plan,

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.416
and studied the life of a rape kit,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.936
from the time the rape kit was collected,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.296
through to the time
that it was tested in the lab

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.576
and returned to the police personnel.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.776
They also developed a web-based portal

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.496
that all the stakeholders could look into
and see where any given rape kit was

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.296
at any given time.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.256
UPS had the technology,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.336
UPS knew how to use that technology
to solve our problem,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.800
and we didn't.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.496
We launched -- we, we --

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.536
UPS and the prosecutor's office --

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.776
(Laughter)

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.840
launched this pilot program in Detroit.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.576
And we started this process
on January 28, 2015,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.056
through to May 25 of 2016.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.696
And during that period of time --

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.136
remember, we're not dealing
with the ones we found,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.976
because they'd already been stored --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.696
we're dealing with any new kit
that came in as of January 28, 2015.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.616
And we knew where that rape kit was.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:51.336
For the 16 months of this project,
we didn't lose a single rape kit.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.576
Not a single one.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.056
We knew where they all were.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:00.496
(Applause)

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.416
This project went on
until the state of Michigan,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.896
the elected officials in state government,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.016
took notice of everything
that UPS was doing.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.976
And everything that my office was doing.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.936
And they decided that they
were going to use state funds

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.576
to develop a state-wide tracking system.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.440
Not in just Detroit,
but state-wide tracking system.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.056
Hopefully, that system
will be up and running soon.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.096
But I loved working with UPS.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.456
I loved their innovation,
I loved how fast they worked,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.016
I loved their unorthodox approach to ideas
to solve an everyday, common problem,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.320
whose solution should be simple.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.656
So, after working with them

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.176
I knew that even with one company,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.056
working on one issue,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.800
the progress that could be made.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.760
We've been at this now for nine years.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.136
And it was nine years ago

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.720
that we rescued those rape kits
from the warehouse.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.040
That warehouse has since been torn down.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.536
But all of the kits
have either been tested,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.600
or are in the final stages
of being tested.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.376
We still have a lot of work to do

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.616
in terms of investigation
and prosecution of those cases,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.656
but our rape kit issue,
in terms of testing, is done.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.760
As of June 28, 2018,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.200
our CODIS hits have showed us
and identified 2,600 suspects.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:40.120
We have identified 861 serial rapists.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.056
Just within this project.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.536
That means 861 potential defendants

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.400
that have raped within the project
two or more times.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.040
And 50 to 75 of them
have raped 10 to 15 times a piece.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.400
In one city, in one state.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.376
Also, the CODIS results that we have

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.256
have tentacles to crime scenes,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.696
have linkages in 40 states
in the United States.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.976
Forty of the 50 states have tentacles
to our crime testing of these rape kits.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.576
From Alaska to Florida

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.336
and from Maine to the most
southern parts of California.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.200
A sea to shining sea,
string of CODIS hits.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.480
Natasha is now 36 years old.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.976
When she heard about the work
that we were doing with the rape kits,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.856
she contacted my office,
the Wayne County prosecutor's office.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.056
Her kit was eventually tested.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.136
And it had identified Paul Warwick.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.416
In the interim, Paul Warwick
had raped two more women.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.760
One in the state of Colorado.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.896
Paul Warwick is now serving a sentence
in the Michigan Department of Corrections,

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.576
in prison, of 15 to 40 years.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:08.456
(Applause)

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.256
Pamela's kit was also tested.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.696
And her kit led to the identification --
her CODIS hit on her kit --

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.400
led to the identification
of Bernard Peterson.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.680
In the interim, Bernard Peterson
raped 10 more women.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.976
Each of those women had a rape kit done.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.800
And each of those women's rape kits
sat on that shelf next to Pamela's.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.520
For a varying number of years.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.576
Bernard Peterson is now serving a sentence

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.656
in the Michigan Department of Corrections,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.856
concurrently -- that means
at the same time --

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.016
of 60 to 90 years,
and 90 years to 125 years,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.616
for the rapes that he committed.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:56.856
(Applause)

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.056
We still have a lot of work to be done.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.456
And we desperately need
the help of the private sector.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.856
We need the help of the tech industry.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.216
To help us develop -- not help us,
we want them to develop --

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.496
information management systems,

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.776
so we can all talk to each other

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.696
and stop these perpetrators

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.360
from raping and maiming
and killing with impunity.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.536
We also need help from those of you

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.296
with marketing
and advertisement backgrounds.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.776
We need you, desperately we need you,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.056
to develop campaigns for our children
and other people to listen to,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.376
so we can stop the culture,
change the culture of rape victims

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.720
being too afraid to come forward
because of what may happen to them.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.616
UPS was one company, as I said.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.816
They helped us with their innovation,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.096
and they revolutionized the way
that we can track rape kits.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.296
Every single aspect
of our lives is tracked.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.216
Every like, every mood,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.976
shopping history,
browsing history, reading history,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.040
our entire web history
is tracked these days.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.496
What if we could track the activities
and the comings and goings

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.336
of criminals who commit crimes?

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.720
Just like people track
every aspect of our lives.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.455
In 2015, the Obama White House

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.096
and the US Department of Justice

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:33.136
put the number of untested,
abandoned rape kits at 400,000,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.616
across this country.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.296
Four hundred thousand.

00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:38.480
That's a national pandemic.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.496
We know where a lot of those kits are.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.216
Our testing showed

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:48.576
that women were raped waiting
in their cars, waiting for friends,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.136
on their way to work,
on their way from work,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.520
at gas stations, at shopping malls.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.896
And even one of the first
cases that we did

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.376
when these rape kits
were starting to be tested,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.616
was a man who came into the window

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.800
and got into the bed and raped a woman
who was in bed with her two children.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.360
He raped her while he was
in bed with her two children.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.136
Every time I look at a rape victim
that comes into my office,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.816
because their case is being called

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.031
or they're being interviewed
by the prosecutor,

00:18:19.055 --> 00:18:20.616
they are being prepped for case,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.760
I look into their eyes
and I think to myself,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.336
they didn't have to be
one of the ones that was raped.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.456
They didn't have to be
one of those victims.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.880
And maybe they would not have been,
if these rape kits had been tested timely.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.160
How many more Pamelas are in this world?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.656
How many more Natashas are in this world?

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.136
We may never know.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.416
But what I do know
is that you have the technology,

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.656
you know how to use it

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.000
and you can help us solve the problem
of rape kits being stockpiled.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.856
Thank you.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:01.600
(Applause)
