00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.150
So I think a lot about this
relationship between beauty,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.705
aesthetic works, and catharsis.

00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:24.835
And at what price?

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.137
The philosopher Alain De
Botton had an amazing passage

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:33.970
in his book, "The
Architecture of Happiness"

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.730
in which he described an
individual being so moved

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.300
by work of art that he
was shaken to tears.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.440
He was literally bawling
because he was so

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.990
affected by the outrageous
beauty emanating from the work

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.390
that he was looking at.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.850
And the imaginary
foundation define beauty

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.840
as this kind of rousing,
symphonic climax.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.260
It's explosive.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.800
So this extraordinary
moment of poetry and grace.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.535
But, again, at what price?

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:07.900
And I recently came across
an actual affliction

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.080
called the Stendhal Syndrome.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.080
This is an actual
psychosomatic condition.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.820
And actual medical
condition in which

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.065
an individual can be so moved
by an aesthetic work, a work

00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:22.593
of art can affect him so
deeply that he can, literally,

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:24.224
lose consciousness.

00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:27.010
The individual can,
literally, pass out

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.510
from the aesthetic impact
of the work of art.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.800
How far are we willing to
go to make beautiful art?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.216
Can beautiful art destroy us?

00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:41.590
The artist has to ask himself
this question all the time.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.060
At what price?

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.690
Can you have too much ecstasy?

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.090
How far are we willing to go
to have that catharsis, even

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.740
if it kills us?

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.500
Can we be destroyed by
art, by our own art?

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.860
I guess that's the question.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.910
