00:00:00.568 --> 00:00:01.942
Voiceover: So in the last few videos

00:00:01.942 --> 00:00:03.391
we've essentially done an overview

00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:05.231
of Benjamin Franklin's entire life,

00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:07.432
and if people want to go more in depth,

00:00:07.432 --> 00:00:10.950
there's a very good biography,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.591
which I encourage people to read.

00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:14.135
Actually it is fascinating.

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:16.335
You know just big picture takeaways,

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.871
what are the lessons from Ben Franklin?

00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:21.462
Voiceover: Well first of
all he was a renaissance man

00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:23.366
of the enlightenment, which was cool.

00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.169
He loved science as well as
writing and the humanities.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.162
He was our best scientist,
inventor, diplomat.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:31.569
He was a good business strategist.

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.057
The first rags to riches person.

00:00:33.057 --> 00:00:35.753
He's also the person who invents, I think,

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:38.016
the essential American character,

00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:40.816
which is being proudly middle class,

00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:43.432
being proud to be a shop
keeper as he put it,

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:45.249
a member of the Leather Apron Club

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:46.825
who gets up every morning,

00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:47.937
puts on the leather apron,

00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:49.496
and helps fellow citizens.

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:52.369
He also knew that the backbone of America

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:54.505
was going to be a shopkeeping class

00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:56.569
who formed civic organizations

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:58.089
that brought people together.

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.313
That's why he forms all these things

00:01:00.313 --> 00:01:02.049
like the libraries and the hospitals

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.088
and the academies and that sort of thing,

00:01:04.088 --> 00:01:07.897
and also he has a notion of tolerance.

00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:12.423
We were very ethnic people in the colonies

00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:16.185
up until Philadelphia rises,

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:18.824
and Philadelphia is the first
city that has everything

00:01:18.824 --> 00:01:21.111
from Anglicans and Moravians and Jews

00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:25.144
and Quakers and freed slaves and Indians,

00:01:25.144 --> 00:01:27.320
and Franklin is a shopkeeper

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.409
who becomes an apostle of tolerance,

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.622
saying if we help bring people together.

00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:35.118
and tolerate everybody's beliefs

00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:36.677
and religions and backgrounds,

00:01:36.677 --> 00:01:40.681
that's going to be the secret
source of America's diversity.

00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.502
You see it throughout his life.

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:46.725
You need wonderful passionate people

00:01:46.725 --> 00:01:49.389
like John and Sam Adams if you're going

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:50.701
to have a great country,

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:52.525
and you need revered people
like George Washington,

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:54.573
but you also need the people who say,

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:57.717
"Our strength will come
from bringing us together,

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.094
"from our diversity."

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:01.270
Over and over again, when he creates

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.708
a civic organization the
motto will be things like,

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:06.824
"The good we can do together is greater

00:02:06.824 --> 00:02:09.414
than all the goods we can do separately."

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:12.981
and, "To pull forth benefits
for the common good is divine."

00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:15.238
That's engraved on the hospital.

00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:19.853
He does his first editorial
cartoon called "Join or Die,"

00:02:19.853 --> 00:02:21.271
which was about the colonies.

00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:23.902
They all have to get
together and join or die.

00:02:23.902 --> 00:02:26.325
When he goes to Albany in the 1750s

00:02:26.325 --> 00:02:29.518
to bring the colonies
together so that they

00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:32.293
aren't sort of a Catholic
colony of Maryland

00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:34.253
and a Puritan colony of Massachusetts.

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:37.565
We're all one country
but religiously diverse.

00:02:37.565 --> 00:02:41.181
Finally I'll go to the end of his life,

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.726
because it seems symbolic at that time,

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.325
after he brings people together

00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:47.173
at the Constitutional
Convention and everything else,

00:02:47.173 --> 00:02:50.493
I realize that during his lifetime,

00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:53.021
he donated to the building fund

00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:55.798
of each and every church
built in Philadelphia.

00:02:55.798 --> 00:02:59.006
At one point they were building a new hall

00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:01.205
during the Great Awakening,

00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:03.478
when preachers used to ride
around America and preach,

00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:05.581
and they wanted a hall in Philadelphia

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:08.118
that a visiting preacher could preach at,

00:03:08.118 --> 00:03:10.749
and Benjamin Franklin writes
a fundraising document.

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:14.477
It says, "Even if the Mufti
of Constantinople were

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:17.552
"to send somebody to preach Islam to us

00:03:17.552 --> 00:03:20.063
"and to teach us about
the prophet Muhammad,

00:03:20.063 --> 00:03:22.112
"we should offer a pulpit and listen

00:03:22.112 --> 00:03:24.280
"for we may learn something."

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.569
Voiceover: This is in
17? Back then, you know.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.127
Voiceover: Yes this is
in the 1760s, 1770s.

00:03:32.127 --> 00:03:35.267
He's very religiously tolerant.

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:38.194
On his death bed, I looked
at the ledgers of this,

00:03:38.194 --> 00:03:40.723
he's the largest individual contributor

00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:42.938
to the Mickve Israel Synagogue,

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:45.466
the first synagogue built in Philadelphia.

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.699
So when he dies,

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.107
instead of his minister

00:03:49.107 --> 00:03:51.091
accompanying his casket to the grave,

00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:55.634
all 35 ministers, preachers, and priests

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:59.522
of Philadelphia linked arms
with the rabbi of the Jews

00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:02.674
for this huge funeral procession

00:04:02.674 --> 00:04:04.914
that marched with him to the grave.

00:04:04.914 --> 00:04:10.555
It was that type of tolerance, freedom,

00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:14.203
belief that we could all live together

00:04:14.203 --> 00:04:16.308
despite our different backgrounds

00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:18.697
that was what they were fighting for,

00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:24.106
what they created in 1776 and in 1787

00:04:24.106 --> 00:04:26.434
when they create the United States,

00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:29.105
and it is still the essential thing

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:31.147
that the United States is fighting for

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:34.402
both around the world but also at home

00:04:34.402 --> 00:04:38.559
to keep that legacy of Ben Franklin alive.
