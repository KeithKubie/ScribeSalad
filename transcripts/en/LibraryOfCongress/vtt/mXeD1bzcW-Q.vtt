Good evening guests and

colleague colleagues, I would

 all of you.  Thank you for 
joining the library of congress 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:53.537
and the library this evening for
 the 2017 Frederic  R and Molly 

00:01:53.538 --> 00:01:56.231
S. 
Kellogg lecture on

00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:08.664
 juris prudence.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.371
&gt;&gt; I apologize if I have 
massacres any names.  Thank you 

00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:22.241
Mr. And Mrs. Kellogg for your 
support and for joining us this 

00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:24.557
evening, we really appreciate 
your support.

00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:36.379
(Applause). .  Thanks to you, 
the library has the pleasure of 

00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:39.728
welcoming these legal scholars 
to debate a variety of 

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:44.400
interesting and legal 
philosophical topics.  This year

00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:47.604
 is no exception.  We are 
delighted that professor Jeremy 

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:51.387
Waldron of New York University 
school of law joins us this 

00:03:51.686 --> 00:03:55.804
evening to address how countries
 regulate immigration, 

00:03:56.115 --> 00:03:59.666
specifically if nations have a 
right to consider their economic

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:01.667
 and cultural

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:10.701
 interests to

00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:29.407
 -- for the 2017

00:04:34.758 --> 00:04:44.158
 Frederic  R. And Molly Kellogg 
lecture on jurisprudence.  

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:49.527
&gt;&gt; Greetings.
This is the fifth biannual 

00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:55.582
lecture, we have reached our 
eighth anniversary.  Ronald 

00:04:57.383 --> 00:05:03.912
Dworkin was the first, and 
Joseph Roz in March 2011, 

00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:09.396
Michael Sandel in 2015.  Today, 
we are pleased to have professor

00:05:10.546 --> 00:05:15.138
 Jeremy Waldron of New York 
University.  Before introducing 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.386
him, who we first met in England
 in 2000, I would like to thank 

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:25.008
the jury that chose him without 
knowing that fact.

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:31.808
Mark Metish, Don Wallace, and 
the library of congress.  Molly 

00:05:32.182 --> 00:05:34.182
and I are insulated

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:39.809
 from the selection 

00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.041
process.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:00.741
She served Representative Pickle
 of Austin, Texas, who if still 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:03.119
actival,

00:06:05.722 --> 00:06:07.742
actival,ative was the first to 
get things back on thethe

00:06:13.795 --> 00:06:15.795
 partisan

00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:22.780
 tract.
Our goal is more modest.

00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:27.526
But here also, it is to give 
time and incentive to legal 

00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:32.275
scholars to think through the 
major philosophical issues of 

00:06:32.276 --> 00:06:38.673
our time and of the law.
Endowed lectures can influence 

00:06:40.044 --> 00:06:48.359
the law, the lectures at Yale, 
and the lectures at Harvard 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.308
battled back and forth, like 
heavyweight

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.734
 crews.  There was the lecture 
in 1958, challenging the

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:06.095
 use

00:07:07.523 --> 00:07:09.523
 of the

00:07:13.137 --> 00:07:15.137
 constitution

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.497
.
And our lecture, positivism, and

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:46.049
 the separation of law and 
morals, and Dworkin's

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.810
 eply,

00:08:02.043 --> 00:08:04.999
  reply.
  They had given lectures at 

00:08:05.312 --> 00:08:07.363
Harvard and Yale, and addressed 
issues

00:08:11.683 --> 00:08:14.877
 through a command of 
fundamental theory, equality, 

00:08:15.873 --> 00:08:22.522
dignity, torture, hate speech, 
judicial review, positiveism 

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.921
and, not least, legislation, 
which might be at the heart of 

00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:32.943
his theoretical program.
Last week, I was in Cambridge 

00:08:33.735 --> 00:08:38.453
for the bicentennial of Harvard 
Law School, attended by six 

00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:44.166
justices, including the chief, 
with a day of seminars, where 

00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:48.192
much was said about legal 
education at Harvard, but not a 

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:54.137
word about hand, heart, Dworkin 
positiveism, principles, the 

00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:56.461
great issues of

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.441
 the last century.
  These topics are virtually 

00:09:05.877 --> 00:09:08.170
dead at Harvard today.  He 
teaches a course on legislation,

00:09:08.486 --> 00:09:10.486
 so I ask, do you cover

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.696
 Jeremy Waldron? Legal 
positiveism claims that it must 

00:09:22.697 --> 00:09:26.110
be considered from it's sources,
 the least of which is 

00:09:27.235 --> 00:09:30.809
democratic legislation.  But the
 theorists have failed to take 

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.579
that dispute of positiveism to 
its crucial next point: How can 

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.064
and should a view of legislation
 address the philosophical 

00:09:40.065 --> 00:09:42.065
issues of the last

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.926
 century?
That had been professor 

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:55.986
Waldron's question.  This 
questioning is typical of 

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.727
Jeremy, who takes his 
questioning back to John lockke,

00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:06.131
 who feels deeply about our 
country, pursues topics in 

00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:13.321
detail, focusing like a 
microscope without losing the 

00:10:24.002 --> 00:10:26.002
big picture.

00:10:27.803 --> 00:10:34.450
Yes, he does cover Waldron, so 
there is hope for Harvard.  I 

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:39.181
give you professor Jeremy 
Waldron, and after, you are all 

00:10:39.182 --> 00:10:46.199
invited to the reception in the 
Madison Hall on the first floor.

00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:57.336
(Applause).

00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:48.531
Aauso

00:11:59.603 --> 00:12:05.045
  &gt;&gt; Thank you, the topic is 
immigration, which is a pressing

00:12:05.633 --> 00:12:09.395
 issue for people who were 
former green card holders, like 

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.798
me.
  I want to say -- (speaker far 

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:13.799
from mic) -- a little bit about 
the relationship

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.741
 between the two. 

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:37.316
 Jurisprudence is the study of 
law and legal reasoning, and the

00:12:37.317 --> 00:12:41.837
 study of law in the abstract 
sense.

00:12:41.838 --> 00:12:46.764
It is special, and in especially
 special ways.  It is special 

00:12:47.084 --> 00:12:51.209
because it embodies the first 
principles of the law in a 

00:12:51.518 --> 00:12:54.840
family of legal systems, like 
the juris prudence of the common

00:12:57.093 --> 00:13:02.684
 law, or Islamic law, or it is 
special because it studies the 

00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:06.069
principles of a topic, like 
criminal law, or the law of 

00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:20.339
torts, or law of immigration.  
We will look at the laws that 

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:24.873
allow, permit, and restrict 
human movement on the face of 

00:13:25.248 --> 00:13:28.663
the earth, the movement from 
society to society, nation to 

00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:31.146
nation.
  The inquiry is analogous to 

00:13:32.192 --> 00:13:34.192
other forms of special

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.460
 jurisprons,

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:00.437
ce,

00:14:03.434 --> 00:14:05.434
 and we

00:14:08.124 --> 00:14:12.995
 try to go to a better 
perspective of law.

00:14:12.996 --> 00:14:17.759
  A foundational approach is 
different from what my 

00:14:18.183 --> 00:14:22.114
philosophical colleagues call an
 applied ethics approach.  In 

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:30.018
applied ethics, someone sets out
 a policy problem as it exists, 

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:34.238
and it considers evaluations in 
favor of, or against, particular

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:38.674
 aspects of that policy problem 
as it is presented in the 

00:14:39.038 --> 00:14:41.038
politics of

00:14:43.905 --> 00:14:47.438
 country.
Instead of doing applied ethics 

00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:51.620
of immigration, which is an 
honorable enterprise, I want to 

00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:53.621
take us

00:15:00.788 --> 00:15:02.788
 deeper.
