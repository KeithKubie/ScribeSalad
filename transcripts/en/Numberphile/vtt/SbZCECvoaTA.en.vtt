00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.230
-Math.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.540
DAVE BROWN: Maths-type stuff.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.580
-Do the math for me.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.050
-This is the story of maths.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.640
VI HART: Say you're me
in your math class.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.200
-Science without maths.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.470
DR. LYNNE MURPHY: Emotions
run high how about

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.060
maths versus math.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.940
If you're an American living in
Britain, you will have been

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.490
corrected a lot and told things
like, what's wrong with

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.340
you Americans?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.780
Don't you realize that there's
an S on the end of

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.760
mathematics, so you need an
S on the end of math.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.300
BRADY HARAN: You are an American
living in Britain.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.830
DR. LYNNE MURPHY: I am an
American living in Britain.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.610
BRADY HARAN: Tell me about how
much problem this causes you.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.080
DR. LYNNE MURPHY: Well, I mean,
it's enough that I now

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.705
say maths, because I don't
want to have an argument.

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:42.130
Well, it's only in the 19th
century that people started

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.210
abbreviating mathematics.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.920
And at that point, the
first known use of

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.916
math is from 1847.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.350
That's what the "Oxford English

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.520
Dictionary" has recorded.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.920
There, you know, people are
using it with a full stop-- or

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.760
a period, as we Americans say.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.990
And there's not a lot of
evidence there that people

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.400
were actually saying it.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.150
It looks like it started out as
an abbreviation in writing

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.830
and not an abbreviation
in speech.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.600
So that starts around 1847.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.380
It's not until 1911 that we
see maths with an S. And

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.880
again, it looks like
people weren't

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.730
probably saying it then.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.790
They were probably just writing
it in course catalogs

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.450
and things like.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.650
English people will say to me,
there's an S on the end of

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.372
mathematics, so you
need to put the S

00:01:25.372 --> 00:01:26.970
on the end of maths--

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.920
which I counter, but we don't
put the last letter from other

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.650
abbreviations onto the end
of those abbreviations.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.140
So when you say fax instead of
facsimile, you don't say

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.000
facsie, just because there's
an E on the end of fax.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.150
So that argument that you should
put the last letter

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.970
onto an abbreviation, I don't
quite understand.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.870
Except that a lot of people say
this because they believe

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.920
that mathematics is plural.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.070
And so you have to use the
S to mark the plural in

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.880
mathematics on maths.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.160
The problem with that is that
mathematics isn't plural.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.560
You don't say there are
two mathematics that I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.940
need to look at.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.690
And when you make maths or
mathematics agree with a verb,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.360
you make it agree with
a singular verb,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.710
not a plural one.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.680
So you don't say mathematics
are interesting.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.100
You say maths is interesting.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.050
So there's plenty of linguistic
evidence that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.920
that's a singular.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.923
But people see the S and think,
if there's an S on the

00:02:30.923 --> 00:02:32.456
end of a noun, it
must be plural.

00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:35.170
BRADY HARAN: Does that mean
Americans have this deeper

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.030
understanding of what
constitutes plural?

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.370
DR. LYNNE MURPHY: No,
I don't think so.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.860
I think it's that-- and I don't
think, necessarily, that

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.460
British people put the S on the
end because they did think

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.560
it was plural.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.540
It was the habit that was got
into, probably because it was

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.880
first a written form.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.290
And in written forms, you might
abbreviate things all

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.530
sorts of ways.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.570
But once they saw the S, they
interpreted it as plural.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.290
So this is what we call
a folk etymology.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.320
You see something with a form
that looks familiar, and you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.760
assume it has that form
for a reason.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.490
And so people are always looking
for reasons why their

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.910
form of the languages is more
logical than the other.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.180
And the problem is that language
on the vocabulary

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.940
level doesn't follow logic.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.170
Vocabulary is just,
anything goes.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.570
BRADY HARAN: Which is ironic
when you're discussing

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.446
mathematics, which is
so the opposite.

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:33.220
DR. LYNNE MURPHY: [LAUGHTER]

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.380
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.520
One cat is fluffy.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.390
Two cats are fluffy.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.370
So in English, we mark the
number in a sentence in

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.370
various places.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.480
We can do it with a numeral.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.210
We can do it with
a plural suffix.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.860
And we do it on the verb.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.040
So math is fun.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.090
The question comes, when you've
got that S there, what

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.550
are you going to put here?

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.520
Is this S telling you that
it's plural or not?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.250
And the fact of the matter is,
people say maths is fun.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.460
They don't say maths are fun.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.330
In linguistics, when things are
wrong, we put a star in

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.020
front of them, an asterisk,
to signal that.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.980
So that's kind of--

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.280
BRADY HARAN: That's
the smoking gun.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.540
DR. LYNNE MURPHY: That's
the smoking gun.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.070
You don't have one mathematic,
two mathematics.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.190
BRADY HARAN: I now believe
you that it's not plural.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.880
Why do we have an S on the
end of mathematics?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.370
DR. LYNNE MURPHY: OK.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.170
Well, it's a long story,
starting in Greek--

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.860
which doesn't have an S on the
end of mathematics, but it did

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.085
have an A, which was the
plural ending there.

00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:35.530
BRADY HARAN: So that
was mathematika.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.580
DR. LYNNE MURPHY: Mathematika.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.210
So that A there was taking an
adjective for mathematic and

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.400
making it into a noun.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.980
So the way to make an adjective
into a noun in Greek

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.630
was to add this A, which
was a plural marker.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.540
So what it meant was all
the mathy stuff, right?

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.040
So all the mathematical stuff.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.580
And so you get that in physics,
you get that in

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.360
linguistics, you get that
in all of these sort of

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.540
Greek-rooted studies
of meanings.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.290
BRADY HARAN: What, the A
became an S, did it?

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.390
DR. LYNNE MURPHY: So the A
became an S in English because

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.740
the people who were taking these
words from Greek knew

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.990
enough Greek to know that
was the plural.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.710
Brought the plural
into English.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.440
But then it evolved away from
the plural very quickly in

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.530
English, because we weren't
treating it as meaning all the

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.730
things to do with X. We were
treating it as meaning, the

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.890
study of X, which is a more
singular meaning.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.950
Well, the thing about language
is people get very

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.980
nationalistic about
these things.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.390
Your language is a huge
part of your identity.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.930
If somebody else says something
a different way, you

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.040
want to believe that the way
you say it is right.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.100
I've been confronted about
people who are angry when

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.460
people say, "you do the math"
instead of "you do the maths,"

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.710
as an expression.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.200
And I think that's kind of rich,
because I believe the

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.280
original was American, and it
was originally "you do the

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.240
math."

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.060
But yeah, I'm not sure
why this one

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.150
exercises people so much.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.310
Maybe because it is more of a
scientific group who's worried

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.310
about it, or because you think
that since mathematics is

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.096
precise, the word for it
should be standardized.

00:06:18.096 --> 00:06:19.470
I'm not sure.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.500
Aluminium versus aluminum is
the other one that really,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.210
really gets people.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.470
So that sort of goes along with
that hypothesis that it's

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.966
the scientific ones that
really rankle.

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:34.130
-I don't know about Americans in
general, but I can say that

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.200
for me, when I moved to London,
I was really thrown by

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.440
the double numbers thing
for quite a while.
