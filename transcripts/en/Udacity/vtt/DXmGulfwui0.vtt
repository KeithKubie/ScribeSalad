00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.590
Now that we have applied pipelining to laundry, let's try

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.494
to apply it to instructions, again, in the form of a

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:09.680
quiz. Let's say that we have a processor with a five

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.220
stage pipeline. And each stage takes one cycle to do. And

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.720
let's say we have a program with ten instructions. Assuming

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.855
that these ten instructions can just flow through the pipeline, so

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:23.330
that we don't have to worry about whether they need to

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.040
talk to each other in sound they just kind of flow.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.945
With no pipelining how many cycles does it take to finish these ten

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:35.000
instructions in this pipeline, and with pipelining how many cycles does it take?
