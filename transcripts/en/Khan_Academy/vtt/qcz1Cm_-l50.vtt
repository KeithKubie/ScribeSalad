00:00:00.144 --> 00:00:01.409
- So, let's set up a relationship

00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:04.149
between the variables x and y.

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.534
So, let's say, so this is x and this is y,

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:12.570
and when x is one, y is four,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.950
and when x is two, y is eight,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.253
and when x is three, y is 12.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.886
Now, you might immediately recognize

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:24.904
that this is a proportional relationship.

00:00:24.904 --> 00:00:26.141
And remember, in order for it to be

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:28.061
a proportional relationship, the ratio

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:31.196
between the two variables
is always constant.

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:35.451
So, for example, if I look
at y over x here, we see

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:38.605
that y over x, here it's four
over one, which is just four.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.486
Eight over two is just four.

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:42.262
Eight halves is the same thing as four.

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:44.607
12 over three it's the same thing as four.

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:46.880
Y over x is always equal to four.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.466
In fact, I can make another column here.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.565
I can make another column
here where I have y over x,

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:56.187
here it's four over one,
which is equal to four.

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:59.425
Here it's eight over two,
which is equal to four.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:04.425
Here it's 12 over three,
which is equal to four.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.584
And so, you can actually
use this information,

00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:10.145
the ratio, the ratio between
y and x is this constant four,

00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:14.642
to express the relationship
between y and x as an equation.

00:01:14.642 --> 00:01:16.510
In fact, in some ways this
is, or in a lot of ways,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.994
this is already an
equation, but I can make it

00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:22.407
a little bit clearer, if I
multiply both sides by x.

00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:25.112
If I multiply both sides by x,

00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:28.630
if I multiply both sides
by x, I am left with, well,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.868
x divided by x, you'd just
have y on the left hand side.

00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:35.212
Y is equal to 4x and
you see that's the case.

00:01:35.212 --> 00:01:37.185
X is one, four times that is four.

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:39.880
X is two, four times that is eight.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.654
So, here you go, we're
multiplying by four.

00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:47.654
We are multiplying by four,
we are multiplying by four.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:52.126
And so, four, in this
case, four, in this case,

00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:56.654
in this situation, this is our
constant of proportionality.

00:01:56.654 --> 00:01:59.846
Constant, constant, sometimes people

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:02.075
will say proportionality constant.

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:07.057
Constant of proportionality, portionality.

00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:10.589
Now sometimes, it might even be described

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.833
as a rate of change and
you're like well, Sal,

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:16.528
how is this a, how would
four be a rate of change?

00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:18.179
And, to make that a little bit clearer,

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.421
let me actually do another example,

00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:22.021
but this time, I'll actually
put some units there.

00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:26.838
So let's say that, let's say
that I have, let's say that x--

00:02:26.838 --> 00:02:30.652
Let me do this, I already
used yellow, let me use blue.

00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:34.548
So let's x, let's say
that's a measure of time

00:02:34.548 --> 00:02:39.078
and y is a measure of distance.

00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:43.204
Or, let me put it this way, x
is time in terms of seconds.

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:44.711
Let me write it this way.

00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:48.753
So, x, x is going to
be in seconds and then,

00:02:48.753 --> 00:02:51.022
y is going to be in meters.

00:02:51.022 --> 00:02:54.075
So, this is meters, the units,

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.954
and this right over here is seconds.

00:02:56.954 --> 00:03:00.878
So, after one second, we have traveled,

00:03:00.878 --> 00:03:02.838
oh, I don't know, seven meters.

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:06.253
After two seconds, we've
traveled 14 meters.

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:09.480
After three seconds,
we've traveled 21 meters,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.316
and you can verify that this
is a proportional relationship.

00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:15.307
The ratio between y and x is always seven.

00:03:15.307 --> 00:03:18.356
Seven over one, 14 over
two, 21 over three.

00:03:18.356 --> 00:03:21.197
But, I wanna write that
in terms of it's units.

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:25.198
So, y over x is going to
be, if we look at this point

00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:28.955
right over here, it's seven
meters over one second.

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:32.489
Seven meters over one second,

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.626
or it's equal to seven meters per second.

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:38.957
If you look at it right over
here, if you say y over x,

00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:43.957
it's 14 meters, 14 meters, in
two seconds, in two seconds.

00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:50.741
Well, 14 over two is seven,
14 over two is seven,

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.523
and then the units are meters per second.

00:03:54.523 --> 00:03:57.245
So, that's why this constant, this seven,

00:03:57.245 --> 00:04:00.530
in all of these cases we have
y over x is equal to seven,

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.315
that this is also sometimes
considered a rate.

00:04:04.315 --> 00:04:08.108
And over here it's very clear,
this is my distance per time.

00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:09.903
Now, if I wanted to write it generally,

00:04:09.903 --> 00:04:11.878
I could say that, look, if I'm dealing

00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:14.401
with a proportional relationship,

00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:16.624
it's going to be of the
form, I can always construct

00:04:16.624 --> 00:04:19.863
and equation of the form, of the form,

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:23.888
either y over x is equal to k,

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:25.494
where k is some constant.

00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:27.758
In this first example, k was equal to four

00:04:27.758 --> 00:04:31.035
and in this second example,
k is equal to seven.

00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:33.450
Or, you can just manipulate
it algebraically,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.450
multiply both sides by x and
you would have y is equal to,

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:43.020
y is equal to kx, where
once again k is our constant

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.339
of proportionality or
proportionality constant.

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:49.581
So, this is a really, in some
ways it's a very simple idea,

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.326
but in a lot of ways, you'll
see this showing up multiple,

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:54.764
many, many times in
your mathematical career

00:04:54.764 --> 00:04:56.679
and it's neat to be able to recognize this

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.854
as a proportional relationship.
