interesting book it's gotten a lot of
 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.760
interesting book it's gotten a lot of
popularity because it's targeting an

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770
popularity because it's targeting an
 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.190
popularity because it's targeting an
issue that is front and center for a lot

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
issue that is front and center for a lot
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.990
issue that is front and center for a lot
of people in the United States and

of people in the United States and
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.959
of people in the United States and
around the world namely the issue of

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969
around the world namely the issue of
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.890
around the world namely the issue of
jobs creation and unemployment

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900
jobs creation and unemployment
 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.179
jobs creation and unemployment
essentially the thesis of the book the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189
essentially the thesis of the book the
 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.910
essentially the thesis of the book the
author is Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
author is Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.880
author is Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew
McAfee make the point that their goal is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890
McAfee make the point that their goal is
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.839
McAfee make the point that their goal is
to introduce technology as a key engine

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
to introduce technology as a key engine
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089
to introduce technology as a key engine
of the changes that we're looking at in

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
of the changes that we're looking at in
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.400
of the changes that we're looking at in
terms of unemployment and job creation

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
terms of unemployment and job creation
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.340
terms of unemployment and job creation
and so the book really focuses very

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
and so the book really focuses very
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.760
and so the book really focuses very
heavily on the pace of technology

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770
heavily on the pace of technology
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.310
heavily on the pace of technology
innovation at one level highlighting the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
innovation at one level highlighting the
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.380
innovation at one level highlighting the
exponential improvement in price and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
exponential improvement in price and
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.650
exponential improvement in price and
performance of technologies but then

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
performance of technologies but then
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.770
performance of technologies but then
focuses on the impact that has in terms

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
focuses on the impact that has in terms
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.010
focuses on the impact that has in terms
of increasingly taking away jobs through

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
of increasingly taking away jobs through
 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.350
of increasingly taking away jobs through
automation that more and more jobs jobs

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
automation that more and more jobs jobs
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.650
automation that more and more jobs jobs
that we thought we're going to be immune

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
that we thought we're going to be immune
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.020
that we thought we're going to be immune
from automation are increasingly

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
from automation are increasingly
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789
from automation are increasingly
becoming vulnerable to automation

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
becoming vulnerable to automation
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980
becoming vulnerable to automation
because of the power of technology and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
because of the power of technology and
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.690
because of the power of technology and
at that level I think it's a very

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
at that level I think it's a very
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.719
at that level I think it's a very
powerful book their technology is

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729
powerful book their technology is
 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.149
powerful book their technology is
advancing at a very rapid pace and it is

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
advancing at a very rapid pace and it is
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.719
advancing at a very rapid pace and it is
becoming more and more able to take over

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729
becoming more and more able to take over
 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.700
becoming more and more able to take over
activities that we as humans have been

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
activities that we as humans have been
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.030
activities that we as humans have been
performing I think the issue is though

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
performing I think the issue is though
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.179
performing I think the issue is though
by framing the the challenge as a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
by framing the the challenge as a
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.240
by framing the the challenge as a
technology challenge what they miss is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
technology challenge what they miss is
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.120
technology challenge what they miss is
the reason why these jobs are so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
the reason why these jobs are so
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.200
the reason why these jobs are so
vulnerable to technology essentially if

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
vulnerable to technology essentially if
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539
vulnerable to technology essentially if
you step back and look at what the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
you step back and look at what the
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.330
you step back and look at what the
modern corporation is and how it evolved

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
modern corporation is and how it evolved
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910
modern corporation is and how it evolved
through a model that we describe as a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
through a model that we describe as a
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.080
through a model that we describe as a
push model basically it has to do with

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090
push model basically it has to do with
 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.910
push model basically it has to do with
developing forecasts and predictions and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
developing forecasts and predictions and
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.670
developing forecasts and predictions and
then making sure that the right people

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
then making sure that the right people
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.770
then making sure that the right people
are in the right place at the right time

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
are in the right place at the right time

are in the right place at the right time
and following tightly scripted

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770
and following tightly scripted
 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.569
and following tightly scripted
activities to respond to that demand in

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579
activities to respond to that demand in
 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.999
activities to respond to that demand in
stepping back from that that's a formula

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
stepping back from that that's a formula
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.429
stepping back from that that's a formula
for automation if you have tightly

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
for automation if you have tightly
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.350
for automation if you have tightly
scripted jobs that are highly

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
scripted jobs that are highly
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.140
scripted jobs that are highly
standardized where there's no room

boom for individual initiative or

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250
boom for individual initiative or
 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.559
boom for individual initiative or
creativity machines by and large can do

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569
creativity machines by and large can do
 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.690
creativity machines by and large can do
those kinds of activities much better

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700
those kinds of activities much better
 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.729
those kinds of activities much better
than human beings they're much more

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739
than human beings they're much more
 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.530
than human beings they're much more
predictable they're much more reliable

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540
predictable they're much more reliable
 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.860
predictable they're much more reliable
we as human beings have flaws we tend to

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870
we as human beings have flaws we tend to
 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.099
we as human beings have flaws we tend to
get distracted we tend to go off into

get distracted we tend to go off into
 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.800
get distracted we tend to go off into
unexpected areas and so I think that the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810
unexpected areas and so I think that the
 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.050
unexpected areas and so I think that the
real reason that we have such an issue

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
real reason that we have such an issue
 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.679
real reason that we have such an issue
in terms of unemployment and and job

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689
in terms of unemployment and and job
 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.050
in terms of unemployment and and job
loss through automation is that we've

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060
loss through automation is that we've
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.649
loss through automation is that we've
crafted these jobs exactly so that they

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659
crafted these jobs exactly so that they
 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.720
crafted these jobs exactly so that they
would be vulnerable to automation we've

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730
would be vulnerable to automation we've
 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.330
would be vulnerable to automation we've
put kind of a bulls-eye target on

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340
put kind of a bulls-eye target on
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.119
put kind of a bulls-eye target on
workers around the United States around

opportunity now is to step back and say
 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.449
opportunity now is to step back and say
is that the way we need work to be done

how work is conducted was developed in
the last century and it was based on a
