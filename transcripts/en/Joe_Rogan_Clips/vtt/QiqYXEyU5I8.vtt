1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.530
There is a way out that there is a way to do more,
to get more,

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:05.550
to obtain more.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.990
But I personally don't want to lose all that I've been able to get.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.110
So I need to make sure that I do everything to keep it
so I can't be content.

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.880
MMM.
So there is an understanding,

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.160
but I refuse to click on the switch of hi.

7
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.730
<v 1>So even if you like,</v>

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.080
even if you have more money than you'll ever spend for the rest of your life,

9
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.090
that's not what it's about.
No.

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.630
It's about the inspiring people and the influence and constantly giving back and

11
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:43.710
moving forward in a positive way.
And the only way you can do that as a stack,

12
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.750
<v 0>it's the story,
man.
Yeah.
You know where,</v>

13
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:51.160
where we're all writing a book.
What's your book look like?

14
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.040
What is your fucking book look like?
Like your life is a book.

15
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.880
You got a bunch of chapters in your book,
but when they closed that book,

16
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.270
how good was the book?
How good was your book?

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.820
What was the ending to your book?

18
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.480
If the ending to my book can be so amazing because of all that was done at the

19
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:18.204
money.

20
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.980
All that was accomplish the first to do the man that did this.

21
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.180
He calls the merger between this,
because of his commitment and growth to this,

22
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.390
the communities were then given this made education,

23
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:34.860
this change the way to schooling was blah,
blah,
blah.
Gave books,

24
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.090
go computers,

25
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:40.380
gave them all of the things that can be associated with you and your existence

26
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.560
become a part of the chapters in your book.

27
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.830
So my drive is about my book.

28
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.530
I was a New York Times number one best seller.
People will be done.

29
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:56.900
They did it right in another book.
Yeah.

30
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.743
What's it happen?

31
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.130
What happens if you are two time New York Times number one bestseller?

32
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.990
If you get the two,
what happens if you get the three?
Hey man,

33
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:09.150
how books become successful?
Who publishes them?

34
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.750
I want to start a publishing company.
Hartbeat publishing.
Why not?

35
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.670
That's the thing.

36
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.670
All I'm doing is sparking though awareness and others to go,

37
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.060
why not?
Why can't I create?
Why can't I start?

38
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.540
Why can't I be a business?
Why can't I be a CEO?

39
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.520
Why can't I be a tech guru?

40
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.050
Why can I fucking create cooking privates lotion?

41
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:38.280
Since there's so much that some people just don't understand they can do.

42
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.840
Let me be a spark to show how much,
how many different that you don't have to do.

43
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.270
Just one thing.
When it's all said and done,

44
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:49.770
my book is going to be full of all the shit that Kevin Hart did cause I never

45
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:53.250
was content with doing just one,
two or three.

46
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.030
Why not,
Kevin?

47
00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:01.210
Why are you creating fucking health and wellness products?
Why not?

48
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.940
I'm big on health and wellness.
Why can't I?

49
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.840
Why can't I try to create something that I feel is fucking great and jump into a

50
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:15.010
space and I'm already in already give 100% of me in this space?

51
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.473
Why not?

52
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.370
Why can't I talk about financial wealth?

53
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.330
Why can't I go back and educate those that don't know why not?

54
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.630
You don't have time.
I'll make time would you certainly can,

55
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:29.740
but it's just so unusual.

56
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:34.090
Someone dedicates that much energy and time to to giving back and getting

57
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:38.800
involved with the kind of projects that you're talking about as well as be super

58
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:42.630
ambitious with your own career.
It makes me happy.
No,
I can tell I'm,

59
00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:47.500
I'm genuinely happy.
Discovery makes me happy.

60
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.210
Like when you find different things to be excited about,

61
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.240
it makes me happy and it's weird when it clicks and school days to tell you all

62
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:01.690
the time,
information is key.
Read these books.
There's so much Knology man,

63
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:05.230
fuck that book.
Got Tired of read that book.
I want to go home.

64
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.890
God Damn Sonic the hedgehog that want to play.
I'm at level three.

65
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:10.420
I ain't got time to read his book.

66
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.090
The information and stuff that was forced down your throat at a certain age,

67
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:20.500
you just,
you just may not be receiving it correctly,
but then it clicks.

68
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.380
You may gain information differently and what you do with that information is up

69
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:30.400
to you.
But people,
people have different roles.
They can go down.

70
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.540
The education wasn't my pick of choice.
It,

71
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.060
it didn't do it for me,

72
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.660
but the knowledge and the common sense that I have naturally allow me to gain

73
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:45.460
information,
apply it differently.

74
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:50.461
It allowed me to grow smart in so many different avenues to where I said,

75
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.250
oh my God,
I found my niche,
I found my talent,

76
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.880
and now there's other things that my talent can take me to.

77
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.490
I don't have the all the knowledge and awareness,

78
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.960
but I can allow myself with people to do that,

79
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:06.700
can teach me because now guess what?
Learning is cool.
Yeah.

80
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:08.920
That's what happens when you don't have to do it anymore,
right?

81
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.580
It's all in your kid.
They force you into this school.

82
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.850
Don't want to learn,
but then when you get out and you realize like,
oh,

83
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:19.270
this actually benefits may,
this is making me a better person.
It makes me wiser.

84
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.430
It's 100% the reality and it's weird how it happens,

85
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.590
but when you go,
oh my God,
learning and knowledge is power.

86
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.140
Fuck.
They used to tell me this when I was 10 yes,
10 11 years old.

87
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:39.190
I heard that shit all the time.
Now I finally get it.

88
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.810
Damn.
I'm about to be 40 to y'all.

89
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:46.690
It's time to get the gut their code,
but I got it.
Yeah,

90
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.600
it hits you at a different time and when it does,
big side about it,

91
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.680
man.
Excited.
I'm excited about with 50 years,

92
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.420
I'm just now getting a 40.
Do you read books?
I don't read a lot of books.

93
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.850
Do you listen to books on tape?
I have listened to books and all that.

94
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.670
Let's do what Tony Robbins.
He's great.
Tony's uh,
uh,
uh,
like

95
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.010
I like his approach to giving information.
Um,

96
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.650
I like his attitude in general.

97
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.710
I like podcasts.

98
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.290
I like things that are real and out of presented in front of me.

99
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.800
I like information that I can go to the source in and touch and talk to the

100
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.700
mayor if I'm reading a book.

101
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.870
It's a book that was recommended by such and such and the person who gave it to

102
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:40.280
me.
And after reading that book,

103
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.300
I learned more about the individual that I thought I already knew and now I

104
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:47.810
gained more.
Michelle Obama's book.
Great Book.

105
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.880
Great fucking book.
I met her,
talked to her.

106
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.290
I've been in the same rooms.
I've seen her success.

107
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.770
What did her book going to be about?
Mm,
overeat.
A book.

108
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.700
Wow.
I get it.

109
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.910
I get why it's moving.
All the units that is moving.

110
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.960
I get why women are reading his book and walking away feeling better,

111
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.240
feeling like they can't.
I get it.
Oh Wow.
Hmm.

112
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.760
Certain friends,
Dwayne Wade wrote a book that's focused on being a father,

113
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:27.260
his road to becoming a better father.
What he went through with his kid's mother.

114
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.950
How you developed a relationship than a bond with his son's like nobody else.

115
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.940
Wow.
Didn't know that day.
That's dope.

116
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.810
I love how you put it on page.
There's certain things that you just want to know.

117
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.620
Uh,
certain books help.

118
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.110
I understand why people read books.

119
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.940
I get what the information does.
You know,

120
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.970
the book that I'm working on now is all about the mental approach that you have

121
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.970
with life and people not understanding that your biggest enemy is you.

122
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.200
My whole book is about you battling yourself.

123
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.840
People don't understand is you against you.

124
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.450
The only person that gets in your way as you,
nobody else is.
You know,

125
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:17.780
when you write a book like this,
and especially about something like this,

126
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:22.730
this is the way you've managed to navigate through life art.
Do you,

127
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.870
do you write it out in essays?
Do you,
do you,

128
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.180
do you have like bullet points that you think about?

129
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:31.730
And then once you have those bullet points in your head and then you write on

130
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:35.960
those out,
how do you do it?
I'll show you leave it on your phone.
It's all,

131
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.160
all voice notes and transcripts.
Okay?

132
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.940
So because of your time,
you don't have,

133
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.680
you don't have the time to sit and actually write.

134
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.190
So you need somebody that you can talk to for hours,

135
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.310
hours,
hours on it.
Hey,
I need an hour block,

136
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.550
an hour for me.
I got some stuff we want to talk to you about.
Kev,
what was that?

137
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.510
All right.
Book title,
idea,
subtitle,
ideas.

138
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.960
My dedication is my introductions.
Um,
within my introductions,

139
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.370
these all powerful paragraphs and things that I've just said that are now

140
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:18.360
transcript.
I get to go back and read it.
Um,
let me see here.

141
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.180
There's no conversation at all.
Every one of them.
Um,
no conversation at all.

142
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.040
And that's what the Internet has allowed people to do.

143
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.870
The Internet has allowed people to skip steps one through 30 has a lot of people

144
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:34.710
to jump straight to 100.
Fuck you got a job off,
take them down.

145
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.120
You should be dead.
Oh God.
Fucking can't stand this.
Whatever.

146
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:43.320
The hate of the anger is when listen,
one,
listen.
Okay.

147
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.950
When I listen and I can change,
I'm not that guy.

148
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.810
We're doing these weird things now that people aren't taking the time to sit and

149
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:52.644
think through.

150
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.970
What I've understood is that what people are doing has nothing to do with me.

151
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.250
I should always be a step ahead because I'm thinking differently because I'm

152
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:03.660
thinking about myself.

153
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.920
Making myself better puts me in a position to make others better.

154
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.650
Be the example,
not the problem.

155
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.920
The best way to take away the problem is to alienate yourself from,

156
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.770
these are visitors thoughts.
It's fucking thoughts.

157
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.910
I can go through and just read it.
This is so you just have these philosophies,

158
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.990
the way you live your life and you just just speak it.
Just speak it Diane.

159
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.580
So now this is all true landscape.
Look along with this.
That's incredible.

160
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.320
This all fucking transcript.
This is all.

161
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.950
So I'll just go back throughout the day and I read it and I say,
this is great.

162
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.070
This makes sense.
This didn't let me reword this.

163
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.580
I make sure that it's all flowing together.
And at the end of the day,

164
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.780
what's my reason for the book?
My reason for the book is to make people better.

165
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.280
My reason for the book is to make people understand.
Yeah,
we all agree.

166
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.800
We all should think that we're great.

167
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.590
There's no reason for you to not think that you're great.

168
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.460
If you don't think you're great,
ask yourself why?

169
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.080
Why don't you think the highest of yourself when you do?

170
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.350
People have no,
you have no choice but to follow suit.

171
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.080
Mm got no choice but to follow suit.

172
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.090
<v 1>A lot of people,
their base it on their past,</v>

173
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.660
they base it on the life that they've experienced up until this moment makes you

174
00:11:19.661 --> 00:11:22.960
better.
Yeah,
it does make it back.
She better makes you smarter.
Yeah.

175
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.530
I'd like to hear I like you said.
Yeah,
man.
That's what's interesting about it.

176
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.640
That's what's interesting about life.

177
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.030
You can hear a guy like you say that and then it changes your perspective and

178
00:11:31.031 --> 00:11:33.880
then you'll go out and take action that you might not have taken before.

179
00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.610
I had a five 85 on my sat confessions.

180
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.710
I didn't even take my confession.
You 400 for putting your name on a paper.

181
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.540
It's true story.
Wow.
I guess a,
B,
a,
c,
a,
d.
A.
I did Abracadabra all way.

182
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.090
True Story.
I swear to God,
I handle my mother's grave,
a,
B,
a,
c,
a,

183
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.680
d all the way down.

184
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.510
<v 0>I didn't care because it was a class trip.
That same day I wanted to go.</v>

185
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.353
Great adventure.

186
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.250
I was told that not taking my sats seriously,

187
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.180
but prohibit me from furthering myself in life.

188
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.530
I thought I was told at the moment,
I said,
damn,
maybe I should've.

189
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.440
Maybe I shouldn't apply myself.
Maybe I shouldn't be different.

190
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.310
When I saw all my friends get their test scores back and they were static,

191
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.580
800 909 sixties everybody's going to college.

192
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.440
It felt like the biggest idiot in the fucking world,

193
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.870
the biggest idiot in the fucking world because the same people that I want to

194
00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:30.460
rush to go to great adventure with.
They'd taken an sat the week before.

195
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.540
They already got their work done.
They did everything they were supposed to do.

196
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:36.220
So that moment of fun was real fun for them.

197
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.380
I was the only dumb ass that didn't prioritize and take care of my shit.

198
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.230
So I'm the only one going to community college.

199
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.640
Everybody's else off the Villanova Temple University,
Drexel University.

200
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.300
God Damn,
I just got left behind.

201
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.810
Why didn't y'all tell me that y'all did it the week before?

202
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.710
How can I tell me that we was serious about the college shit?

203
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:03.580
Y'All ain't telling me y'all was trying to go to temple or Drexel.
All weight

204
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.860
is because my life isn't their life.
Their,

205
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.300
they're focused on themselves.
Wow.
They're,

206
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:16.690
they're doing what they're supposed to do.
Hey Jack Ass.

207
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.210
Go sit by yourself and figure it out because this is where you should be less

208
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.053
than learn.

209
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.460
Any opportunity given should be taking series from this point on because if not,

210
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.710
you can find yourself feeling just like this.

211
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.440
It's hard to get down on myself and fucking moment and learn from it.

212
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:38.100
Learn from it.
Now if I got to take a goddamn tests,

213
00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:40.540
you best believe I'm studying for that fuck test cause I don't want to feeling

214
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:42.760
like I'm the guy that didn't prepare.

215
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.530
Now I've got a story to tell my kids about what it feels like to be the kid in

216
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:49.570
class that didn't prepare.
This got the words gray,

217
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.840
when to give all those grades back,
but it's because of my experience.

218
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.740
I don't look down on those moments.
You take those moments,

219
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:59.080
you make the best of them because they're live lessons.

220
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.940
That sample you're saying is positive,
but it's really just simplicity.

221
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:06.820
That's real drill.

222
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.470
<v 1>It's real and it's your life experience and it's your life's lessons.</v>

223
00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:13.530
One a hundred percent but the fact that a guy like you comes out and talks about

224
00:14:13.531 --> 00:14:14.011
it like that,

225
00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:16.770
that's where it makes it really powerful cause it's not just something that you

226
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:20.190
learned from,
but now other people can learn from your past too.

227
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.420
That's what I'm hoping they'll look at themselves and they did realize like we

228
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:25.890
all start from a different spot.

229
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.270
<v 0>You're not saying,
yeah,
this is why I'm so candidate.
I'm so candidate.</v>

230
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.340
I'm so open.
They're there.

231
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.030
There is no like guys,
I'm,

232
00:14:37.031 --> 00:14:41.680
I'm fine with being an open book.
I'm fine with the good,
the bad,

233
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:43.960
the ugly.
I'm fine being flawed.

234
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.460
I'm fine with all the things that have happened to me that have been exposed.

235
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.930
I'm fine with it all.
I don't hide from it.
I don't run from it.

236
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.180
I don't,
I don't,
uh,
avoid any of it.
I'm fine.

237
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.410
It's all right.
It's a bed that I made for myself.

238
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:08.150
I happily lay in it and I'll be fine figuring it out.
Moving forward,

239
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.380
son,
don't stop for nobody,
man.
Sundo fuck.
Stop.

240
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:13.970
Sign going to be up in the morning regardless.

241
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.920
That sun is going to be up in the morning regard,

242
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.380
regardless of how I fucking feel and how depressed I am.

243
00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:26.381
The Sun is going to fucking shine in the morning and at nighttime to moon going

244
00:15:26.431 --> 00:15:28.730
to be there and you're gonna look up these days going to keep going by.

245
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.620
So do you let the days go by and look up and you didn't waste a year doing what?

246
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.090
What do you just pick it up?
All right,
well I got to figure it out.

247
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:41.510
Made some mistakes as life goes on.
Let me figure out life from this point.

248
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.820
I'm a life goes on type of guy.

249
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:50.220
<v 1>You're a bad mother fucker.
Kevin Hart,
very,
very,
very inspirational and I'm,</v>

250
00:15:50.221 --> 00:15:52.220
I'm really glad you came down here and talked about it.

251
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.600
<v 0>I'm more than glad.
I think that is that</v>

252
00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.220
<v 1>it took too long actually.
And this is the first of a,
of what will be many man.</v>

253
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.120
I'm for sure.
I'm a fan too.

254
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:06.220
I just think what you're doing is not just inspirational in terms of like what

255
00:16:06.221 --> 00:16:08.170
you've been able to achieve and who you are,

256
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.400
but also inspirational and how you're so dedicated to helping other people.

257
00:16:12.401 --> 00:16:16.390
That means a lot to me.
It's very,
it's very motivating.
It's very powerful.

258
00:16:16.391 --> 00:16:20.890
I wanna I want all your listeners know that is not,
um,
it's not the top.
No,

259
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.321
this is,

260
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:24.880
this is no way it could be you if you were doing that just for talk and be like,

261
00:16:24.881 --> 00:16:28.810
listen,
just fake it and then become that guy because you're,
you're on.

262
00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:32.940
It's something,
if you could do that and just say it in dark,

263
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.070
fucking forget about whatever it's fake or not.
