00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.460
If we add the two equations together, the x terms eliminate and add to zero. 15y

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.611
and negative 4y equals 11y and negative 75 minus 2 makes negative 77. We can

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:15.497
divide both sides by 11, so one 1y is equal to negative 7. We found y so now

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:20.823
let's go and find x. Remember we could use either of the original equations to

00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:25.415
find the other variable. Usually it's best to use the original equations,

00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:29.447
because sometimes we might have made a mistake when multiplying, so we don't

00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:33.360
want to use these multiplied equations. I'm going to use the second equation, 5x

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.342
plus 2y equals 1. This is a great opportunity to pause the video. Maybe you can

00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:41.882
try to find the value of x by plugging in to this first equation instead. See if

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:47.758
we get the same result. So I can take the value of y, which is negative 7, and

00:00:47.758 --> 00:00:53.153
plug it in for y in this second equation. So I get 5x plus 2 times negative 7

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:58.081
equals 1. 2 times negative 7 is negative 14. Then we add 14 to both sides of the

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:05.021
equation. So 5x is equal to 15. We divide both sides by 5, so x is equal to 3.

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:08.495
This is great. We found our solution.
