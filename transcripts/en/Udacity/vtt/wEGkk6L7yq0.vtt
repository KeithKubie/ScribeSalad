00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.300
Hi, and welcome to Georgia Tech.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.200
My name is David Joyner,
and I'm an instructor and

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.960
course developer in the OMSCS program.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.560
&gt;&gt; My name is Eboni Bell, and
I'm a current student in the program.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.290
We're here in the Klaus Advanced
Computing Building, the headquarters for

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.350
the College of Computing and
its masters program.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.660
As you start your journey as a Georgia
Tech masters student in the online

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.860
program, we want to give you all
the information you'll need to succeed.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.600
&gt;&gt; Over the next several lessons, we'll
go over some of the basic facts that you

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.400
should know about the program itself.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.350
We'll also go over many of
the tools that will comprise

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.370
the majority of the time you
spend in the OMSCS program.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.310
We'll also give you some tips for

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.130
success that we've gathered over the
past several semesters from students and

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.810
instructors alike.
