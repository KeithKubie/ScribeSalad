00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.800
So I've made a small change to my app.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.270
And I'm just changing the location
that we're actually looking at.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.200
And I've set it to be the latitude and

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.880
longitude of the street right outside
the studio where I'm filming this.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.940
So I called panorama.setPosition on
this, and I do everything else the same.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.550
And I'll show you what
the app looks like.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.270
Here you can see the area outside
the studio, and I'm on Latham Street.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.750
And you can see Latham Street
in the street view itself.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.610
And if I go to other places,
we can see Showers Drive and

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.370
the other part of Showers Drive.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.770
And as a result you can see all
the street names being updated.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.360
Here we can see Showers Drive
again from this angle.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.340
So street names are on.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.330
And you may want to turn this off.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.830
The default value is
that it would be on.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.940
Now let's take a look at what
it takes to turn it off.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.694
Now, if you remember, it was just
panorama.setStreetNamesEnabled and

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:50.670
we'd pass at a boolean.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.650
I want to turn if off, so
I'm going to set false.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.720
So now I'm going to rerun
the application and

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.400
we'll see what it looks like.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.820
And here's the same application running
now with the street names turned off.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.380
And you see I can just
see the view outside.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.738
The street names have
not been overlayed.

00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:08.520
The default behavior was for
street names to be there, but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.460
I've overwritten that, and in some
cases it might make for a better app.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.780
It's really up to you and
what the needs of your app are.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.690
Play with the others, the user
navigation and the zoom gesture, for

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.410
yourself and
see if you can get some nice effects.
