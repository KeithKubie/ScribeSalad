00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,730
This is Jocko podcast number
90 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,340
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,173
Okay.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,500
As my wife,

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:20,501
Tori mentioned this past week has been
in one of the most challenging of my

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,554
life.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,050
I want to say thanks to my friends
and family for your support.

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,010
You really have no idea how much a few
words of encouragement can mean when you

9
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:35,890
are at a time and place like this.
Thanks again.

10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,040
My platoon isn't a very active area
of operations in southern Afghanistan.

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,520
Our mission is to close
with and destroy the enemy.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:47,750
Yeah.

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,520
There is no outside the wire
here because there is no wire.

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,810
My boys are simply always on alert.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,290
We haven't had a shower since
we've been in Afghanistan.

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:02,700
Yeah.

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,700
We've run nonstop missions and have been
very successful at accomplishing these

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,640
without experiencing
any injuries to our own.

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,290
I'm just trying to paint a picture of
life here and not trying to make you feel

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,550
sorry for us.

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,643
Yeah,

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,513
trust me.

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,290
I belong here with these
guys and we are a family.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,280
Rather.

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,420
I want to paint a picture because I'd
like to tell you about Travis mills.

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,640
I know you don't know him,

27
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,480
but it would mean a lot to me
to be able to spread his story.

28
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,020
My platoon string of missions without
injury came to an abrupt and violent and

29
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:53,880
last week when we hit a dismounted
IED during combat operations,

30
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,290
I had three paratroopers
injured from the blast.

31
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,870
Yeah.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,930
One was minor,
one was severe

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,210
in one was simply beyond words.

34
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:15,220
The most severe injury was sustained
by my weapons squad leader,

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,230
Travis.
Big Mills.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,360
I'd like to take the opportunity
to tell you about them.

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,010
Even under the conditions that I've
described. He is the best of us.

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,570
Yeah.

39
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,200
He was the biggest guy in the platoon
and has the biggest heart to go with it.

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,880
Yeah.

41
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,700
He was eager to please
and always cheered us up.

42
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,070
Yeah.

43
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,980
He led from the front and
was injured because of it.

44
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,740
He preferred that he take the
injury over any man in his squad.

45
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,840
He was the most fearless person
I have ever seen in combat

46
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,000
when we weren't in combat. He
was great to have around. You.

47
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:04,600
Woke up every morning and saying
a bunch of different songs to us.

48
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,290
Usually Keisha or Britney spears or
the songs of some other girl band.

49
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,530
We had this ritual. Anytime we finished
a patrol where we had a firefight,

50
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,170
once we returned to the strong point,

51
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,490
he'd run to the front of the formation
and sing songs about the 82nd airborne.

52
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,080
He would do dance gestures and all.

53
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,800
He even did it for the brigade
commander when he came to visit.

54
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,220
It was a big hit.

55
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,750
I laughed at how are he laughed at how
serious I am and how I don't like to be

56
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:41,864
touched.

57
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,530
So he made it his personal
mission to make me laugh.

58
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,610
Usually this involved an overly aggressive
and a little too intimate man hug,

59
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:56,430
followed by a middle school style
dance where he'd grind on me.

60
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,923
Yeah,

61
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,880
he kept me sane.
I laughed at his antics constantly

62
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,370
in combat. There is no one we
would rather have been with.

63
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,320
He risked his life to
save all this constantly,

64
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,190
and I can recall two times specifically
where he literally saved me.

65
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Needless to say,
I took his injury hard,

66
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,080
including the personal guilt
that'll leader feels when
he is responsible for his

67
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:31,120
men.
So I wanted to tell you these things.

68
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,220
Everyone is asking how I'm doing.
Yes,

69
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,773
I am hurting.

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:40,920
Yeah,

71
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,270
but you know I'm going to be okay.
More importantly,

72
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,610
Travis is going to be okay.

73
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,420
The truth is obscene things here,

74
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:54,540
so terrible that I'll never be
able to put them into words.

75
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,240
Travis injury being at
the top of the list,

76
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,370
but I've also seen things
here so wonderful that I'll
never be able to put them

77
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,240
into words either.

78
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,990
Yeah,

79
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,060
I know that sounds crazy,
but it's true.

80
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,430
How do you put into words the spirit,

81
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:16,220
like the one I've just
described in big mills,

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,950
the reality of it is that I have the
honor of leading people like Travis.

83
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,470
Yeah.

84
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,830
There are many more in
my platoon just like him.

85
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,910
So while I've seen some things I'd
like to never talk about again,

86
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,680
I've seen just as many that I'll spend
the rest of my life trying to explain to

87
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:40,730
anyone who will listen.

88
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,920
I've seen a tremendous love and care
between brothers that have only each other

89
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:53,520
to rely on
and have only one care

90
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,140
to bring each other home.

91
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,900
It's a selfless,
deep,

92
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,910
everlasting bond that I consider myself
lucky and absolutely privileged to be a

93
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:07,744
part of.

94
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,680
Thank you so much again for your support,
but know that I am fine.

95
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,180
I am exactly where I need to be right now.

96
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,230
My family here is taking care of each
other and we will persevere as one.

97
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,793
Oh

98
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,970
now that
is a

99
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,070
letter that was written to friends and
family at home from Lieutenant Zack

100
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,720
Lewis,
commander of First Platoon Bravo troop.

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,240
Yeah,

102
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,570
473rd Cavalry Squadron,

103
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,810
Fourth Brigade Combat Team of
the 82nd airborne division,

104
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,190
the all Americans

105
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,280
and I think that letter describes staff
Sergeant Travis Mills as only a fellow

106
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:20,230
platoon member could

107
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,670
explaining is unbelievably
positive attitude.

108
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,700
There's courage under fire

109
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,630
and is on wavering leadership

110
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,880
and tonight

111
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,980
I am honored beyond words to have the
man that Lieutenant Lewis spoke of Travis

112
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Mills here with us to talk through
his experiences on the battlefield

113
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,243
and off.

114
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,820
Travis, welcome to the show. Good evening.

115
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,570
Thank you for having me. Yeah.
Now I'm going to say this upfront.

116
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,050
I was a little nervous about having you
on because this show has a reputation of

117
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:24,880
being very serious
and very solemn.

118
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,320
And I know that you have an issue
with both of those terms in a broad

119
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,663
perspective.

120
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,410
So for those of you that haven't
heard anything from Travis before,

121
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,213
okay.

122
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,610
There's not a lot of serious stuff

123
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,260
that Travis does, so, um,

124
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,280
serious comedian and hilarious
guy with an incredible attitude.

125
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,070
Um, welcome to the show, man. Thanks
for coming on. Thank you so much. I'll

126
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,930
do my best to be serious.
Um,

127
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,880
I think my ltd described it very well
in that letter he wrote to his family.

128
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,770
I made sure that I kept their spirits up
and I would hug him and everything like

129
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,930
that. But under fire it was a
whole different person. Yeah,

130
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,220
yeah. No, I thought he did a
great job of capturing, you know,

131
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,100
what everyone's feeling over there. And
I didn't, I didn't go in Afghanistan,

132
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:21,330
but what does the similar to what
we'd fill in Iraq. Um, and you know,

133
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:23,700
I talk about this a
lot about the fact that

134
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,320
this is why guys miss combat.
You know, you miss combat,

135
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:33,321
even though it's when you're over there
and you're in this crappy situation and

136
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,580
you're like, oh, I can't wait to get
home. But then when you get home,

137
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:37,860
you have that little thing in
the back of your mind that says,

138
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,550
that misses that comradery,
which only comes from that place.

139
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,450
So he did a good job of describing that.
So

140
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,190
I think to,
to understand where a man ends up,

141
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:53,250
we kind of got to understand
where a man comes from.

142
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,220
So going back to the beginning,

143
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,650
the young Travis mills,

144
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,120
the young Travis Mills, and you know
how you grew up in all that. Um,

145
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,560
talk a little bit about that.
Yeah, I'm a, I'm from Michigan.

146
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,170
When I go around and I speak
throughout the nation and I always say,

147
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:19,040
is anybody from Ohio before? I
tell him permission and I yell, Oh,

148
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,230
H and then they yell io and to get
real passionate and then I yell sucks,

149
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,270
you know? And I get, I get some booze,
but I'm from a small town in Michigan, um,

150
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,310
right around the film area. I grew up
playing football, basketball and baseball.

151
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,590
I have an older sister
and younger brother. Um,

152
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:38,580
my parents are phenomenal people and
you know, just good, wholesome values.

153
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:40,920
And then I went to college
and play football, uh,

154
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,850
after high school was over and decided
that probably wasn't the right time for

155
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:47,410
me to go to college and take it serious.
So I went to the,

156
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,550
hold on. So you were playing
three sports in high school and I,

157
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,770
I got a quote from your book in here
by the way. Um, I'm going to read it.

158
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,843
Yeah.

159
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,360
I was the fun kid who lived
at the end of your block.

160
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,030
I was big for my age and for a lot of
boyhood years I had a big gap between my

161
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:09,630
two front teeth. Yup. Now
is that a negative thing?

162
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,330
Um, no, not at all. Okay.
Because some of us at the table,

163
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:18,680
you're still have a gap between
our phones. I'm just saying. Oh,

164
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,310
I on the sides now, right?
Yeah, I do. But I, uh,

165
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,310
I like to wear my hair,
my hair shaved and a buzz cut,

166
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,030
particularly in the summer is when it got
hot with that opie Taylor kind of look,

167
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,950
I fit into small town America.
And you did karate,

168
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,903
by the way.

169
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,590
You're looking at the 1993 create
a cry state champion. I Michigan,

170
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,250
I was six.
But that's,

171
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,570
it's not a competitive age
bracket for karate champion chess,

172
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:50,120
spinning back kick kids right
over at rest on that breaking.

173
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,350
Uh, actually you had, you had
a contest here. I'm going to,

174
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,610
I'm going to read about it.
It wasn't all easy.

175
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,140
And one of my first karate matches,

176
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:01,030
I got kicked hard in the
sternum and couldn't breathe.

177
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,230
I gas panic and tried to suck air when
my normal breathing didn't return.

178
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,780
Immediately I raised my hand
and forfeited the match.

179
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,210
I'm kind of disappointed my dad rushed
over. Travis, what are you doing?

180
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,680
You forfeit the match.
You,

181
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,260
you never forfeit the match no
matter how hard you're hurting.

182
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,940
You never quit ever.

183
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,160
Yeah. My Dad was disappointed in me
too. Yeah. So I never did it again.

184
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:28,090
And then I just, I dunno, I just went
hard the rest of that after that, I just,

185
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:32,410
I don't know. My Dad taught me good
values. My mom took karate with me. Um,

186
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,880
so don't mess with your mom
either. No. No. Wow. Yeah.

187
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,370
She's, she's five foot two, 125 pounds.
How did, how did she produce your big ass?

188
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,500
I don't know. I don't know. That was your
dad a five. 11. No kidding. Yeah. Yeah.

189
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,410
But I was six foot three when I was
at my walk around weight and, uh,

190
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,560
the first match I ever had,

191
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:56,170
I had a girl and she beat
me cause I wouldn't hit her.

192
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,290
And then I was cleared to like hit
girls and I thought that, okay,

193
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,720
so the next year I thought it
went, went to town on, you know,

194
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,090
just put a weapon and now I know you
don't hit girls either way. So I learned,

195
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:10,450
you know, that's a lose,
lose situation. But then your
mom, your mom told, you know,

196
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:13,990
go hit her. Yeah, that's what it is in
the book. Like she was like, hey listen,

197
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,060
you got to go beat her up. Well, okay.
So it was competition and she was in my,

198
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,070
you know, they didn't have
the separate gender brackets.

199
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:23,500
So everybody was the same.
And the first girl I faced,

200
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,740
I wouldn't hit and I lost about,
and then the next girl after that,

201
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:30,340
my mom was like, you can, you can
hit them. And I was like, oh, okay.

202
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,240
So I was just like, you're
going down. And I went after it.

203
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,570
Oh, that's jacked up, man. I was sick.
So I mean, I hadn't, yeah. You know,

204
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,050
puberty and everything he didn't hit yet.
That was seven for me.

205
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,690
The uh, football team, Vince Laville.
Did I say that right? I love, Yay.

206
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,950
Okay, well, you know, don't worry about so
much of a French speaker over on my end.

207
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,130
Oh, whatever that language is. If I know
his name, I would've said the same thing.

208
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,220
Here's how he described you.
The first time I met Travis,

209
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:04,860
he was in middle school at track meet.
I had heard about him.

210
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:08,040
So I went over to watch him. He won the
shop put, which meant she was strong.

211
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,230
Then he ran over. Then he ran over to
the 100 yard hurdles in one though too,

212
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,970
which meant she was fast.
You don't see that combination a lot.

213
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,420
I knew that this kid was going to
be a special athlete in high school.

214
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:22,560
He became a superstar three sport athlete,
baseball, basketball and football.

215
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,520
He was the leader on each team and made
first team all conference in all three

216
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:30,240
sports with football. He was definitely
a big cog in our teams. We'll,

217
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,200
we're the smallest school in our
conference and we got beat up for a lot of

218
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,160
years,
but his junior year,

219
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:38,880
Travis and his friends got
into weightlifting and power
lifting and went to all

220
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:41,010
the football camps.
That year.

221
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:45,090
We won the conference championship and
made the playoffs for the first time ever.

222
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,270
Travis has work ethic moded
everybody motivated everybody.

223
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,120
Everybody got stronger because
Travis was their leader. Jack

224
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,120
and steal.

225
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,490
What champions do first time we ever made
to play off. How did you, how did you,

226
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,380
what like got you. What made you start
lifting a coach? When I was in seventh,

227
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,520
sixth or seventh grade, he said that
after school, if I wasn't playing a sport,

228
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,970
I had to go lift weights and he was
the vice principal, the high school.

229
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,850
So having friends in high places is
nice because when you get in trouble you

230
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:18,080
don't really get in trouble,
you know? Um, the story.

231
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,380
Yeah. The story in there about me getting
in trouble in class freshman year.

232
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,720
Where'd you do? Uh, I don't really,

233
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,400
I broke a childish, nevermind,
but just tell us what you did.

234
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,180
It's in the book, you know, my buddy
fired in class, got kicked in the hallway,

235
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,040
so then my other buddy did,
so I wanted to go out there.

236
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,640
So I finally let one rep so I can go out
in the hallway and he took us into the

237
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:40,640
office, but he just said, guys, knock
it off. You can't do this anymore.

238
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,390
Which protein? Powder. Oh, that's
all. Yeah. So my buddy Eric,

239
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,280
he got his parents are very competitive
like mine were and we were the both the

240
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,700
team captains and stars of the show, if
you will. So I went home and said, hey,

241
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,200
can I get some cell tech and nitrile tech?

242
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,040
And it was before they had the rally reg
regulations on it and my parents like,

243
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,200
no, you can't do that. I'm like,
well Eric's parents let him get it.

244
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,190
Maybe it wasn't true.
Right.

245
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,080
Eric went homes at the same thing to his
parents so we both got to get on those.

246
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:07,480
And then, I mean, you
know, protein powders,

247
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,130
it's often that's going
to disrupt science class.

248
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,730
But no, I mean it was, it was
fun. You know, everybody, I
worked at a grocery store,

249
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,440
um,
after the football games,

250
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:21,590
the old man would come in and drink
coffee and hang out with me and my boss.

251
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:22,230
Just like the owner.

252
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,580
The storage is accepted it like the wives
would shop and you get away with it.

253
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,900
Yeah. As at the water cooler. Bowser
coffee pot and we just hang out.

254
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,850
Tell me what I did wrong.
I did write very varsity

255
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,740
varsity blues town. Big Time. Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:40,130
I saw some video footage of you at those
games and it was like madness at those

257
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:44,170
games. We'll have the one, the one run.
I had looked pretty good on film. Yeah,

258
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,040
look pretty good to me.
It was one time I did anything special.

259
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,660
So you get done with your
senior year of football.

260
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,710
And Did you maintain the high level of
discipline in your grades after that

261
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:58,240
point?
No,

262
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,160
actually I broke up with a
girlfriend that has a 4.0.

263
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,580
So my grades went right down.
No more steady partner. No,

264
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,930
no more like she would help do homework.
Yeah.

265
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,830
Be in the same class and write lefthanded
for the scratch work and hand her to

266
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:14,120
me. Nothing like that. And so that,

267
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,440
that meant, did you get looked at, did
you get looked at for college ball? I did.

268
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:22,130
I had a couple offers for
baseball and football. Um,

269
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,620
D two couple of d one smaller d ones.

270
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,010
And for some reason my guidance counselor,
he just,

271
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,230
I think he just knew Mr. Sampson,
great guy.

272
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,080
He kind of figured I wasn't going to
like college and be disciplined enough.

273
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:35,990
So he's like, what about this community
college? They're really good. Um,

274
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,130
you can go there and play football. And
I, and I decided to go there and, uh,

275
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,800
I just,
I mean if I was cut off from football,

276
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:46,020
I wasn't cut out for this study in there
at that, at that time in my life. Right.

277
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,950
And so you went there for what? A
one year? A semester. One semester.

278
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,480
And my girlfriend was like,
you should move home.

279
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,450
So I did and I met her
boyfriend, Collin. So then,

280
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,520
then I joined the army. He moved
back in my life. How did this happen?

281
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,950
It's her fault. I have no one to
call him lately. I haven't talked.

282
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,590
I haven't, you know, we
all look him up. I mean,

283
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,700
he worked at a popup golf course
and I found everything out.

284
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,700
So I grabbed my buddy up and went over
there and the manager of the place,

285
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:18,450
like sent them home. Why'd she tell you
to come home? Chill. I can be by her,

286
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:21,030
I guess. I don't know. And then I
was like, Hey, what's this about?

287
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,550
And then she finally broke down
and told me. So I was like, oh hey.

288
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:26,520
Did you know the army was taken
people and give them bonuses. See Ya.

289
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,360
Cause you were in debt,
you ran up, you know,

290
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,320
it was about 10 grand in
debt for community college,

291
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,510
but that was for the whole year. The
baseball coach asked me to play there too.

292
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,930
Um, yeah. But then you,
uh, you're in debt. You're,

293
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,860
um, Collin wisdom on the scene
now that kind of threw a loop.

294
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,930
So you end up joining the army.
I joined the army,

295
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,750
I went to all the recruiters and
the army had the best thing going,

296
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,010
which was cash, $24,000.
That money's at today.

297
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,390
No idea. Does, did Budweiser
get any of that money? You know,

298
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:02,030
now I don't, I'm actually, I'm
not a beer. Not a boozer. Whoa,

299
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,340
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, that's
not go that far. I'm a whiskey fans,

300
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,030
but uh, no. I mean I just, I
saw a way to pay my bills back.

301
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,470
I saw a way to travel and
do some more fun stuff.

302
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:19,410
I went in there to be an electrician and
they show me airborne video. I was like,

303
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,700
I want that. Oh yeah, deal. Deal.
What's that called? Bait and switch.

304
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,090
But I really want to do is I want
to get a good thing, you know,

305
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:29,970
where I can carry on in the civilian
life and have a good trade that you have

306
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:32,460
that I can play back to the civilian
world. They're like, watch this video.

307
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,100
You're like that.
That's me.

308
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,820
Is it like airborne recruiting
video? Um, well to be honest with Ya,

309
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:45,960
I was a ranger regiment recruiting
video and I signed up for all that.

310
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:49,170
But then all the rumors were like if you
don't make it, you're going to Korea.

311
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,340
And I'm like,
I don't want to go to Korea.

312
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,840
And then 22 of my friends went to Fort
Bragg cause you got to pick your duty

313
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:57,240
station because they were filling up
the new brigades and they're like,

314
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,000
oh you guys, we need you to fill in
here and you can pick where you go.

315
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:04,240
So all of us from basic training went
cause what year was this? 2006 Oh yeah.

316
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:04,551
So that's,

317
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:09,551
so that's totally different from me
because I joined the navy in 1990 oh yeah.

318
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:13,590
That was before I was even a Christ
a champion. We're talking old school.

319
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,900
So there was no war going on.

320
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,040
And even though in my mind I always
thought like the seals were just like

321
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,660
fighting wars worldwide at all times,
which was not true. But I thought that,

322
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,900
but yeah, it wasn't like everyone
that was joining the military.

323
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,560
It's not like when you guys joined the,
your generation of people joined,

324
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,920
you knew you were going to war. Oh,
absolutely. 100%. You know, I, uh, the,

325
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,710
the biggest regret I actually do have and,

326
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,420
and not to kiss up to what you've done,

327
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:44,421
but it's not tried to go to the Rangers
or go special forces or to the see like

328
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:46,380
not even, I didn't even try
it. I wish I would have.

329
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,630
Well you would of w w did
you start thinking about
that further in your career?

330
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,970
Absolutely. Yeah. I was
going to come back, um,

331
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,090
and I was either going to a recruiter and
get my last year and a half of college

332
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:56,980
cause I went to college when I could.

333
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,250
I took college under enlistments and that
was going to try to go recruit her to

334
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,270
um, go ahead and get my degree and then
go to the special operations world.

335
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,260
Because if you don't do it that way,
if you become an officer lady,

336
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,970
you got to go back through
the queue and everything.

337
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,660
But it was either going to be go right
to a special operations and try that out

338
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:18,250
or go become an officer and then
go. But yeah, just uh, you know,

339
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,630
I dunno,
I have no excuses stuff for us.

340
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,450
It's a weird thing and I don't
really like anybody. Like I was,

341
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,260
if you compare you as an athlete in high
school and me and as an athlete in high

342
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:30,850
school, it's not even comparable. You,

343
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,810
you were like 10 times the athlete I was
for some reason I was stupid enough to

344
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:38,350
think like I can make it through that
training and you weren't smart enough to

345
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:41,020
go. Like, I can make that see the
gallery to, cause you would on this,

346
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:42,760
the saddest thing is with the whole,
uh,

347
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,480
the ranger contract I had and all these
guys were going and I got talked to my

348
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:49,510
buddies that go into Fort Bragg. I ran to
a bunch of them. They're like, oh yeah,

349
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:53,740
we made it. I was like, oh my gosh, I
could have this. It's an interesting,

350
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,180
it's an interesting, uh, it's actually
humility. It's you being like, hey man,

351
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,050
you know, I don't know.
I played, you know,

352
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,590
football and baseball and ran track or was
that, is that right? Well, a basketball,

353
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,230
football, baseball and
basketball. I'm a great athlete,

354
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,840
but I might not make it through that.
That's actually a form of humility,

355
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:14,650
you know, I think it is. I was just,
yeah, I don't know where her head was at.

356
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:16,660
I just, I, I, you know, looking back now,

357
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:18,300
I'm embarrassed about it
a little bit and I wish I,

358
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,460
I wish I would went and tried it out.
I mean, I live a really good life.

359
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:23,380
I have a wonderful life and everything.
Not to jump ahead.

360
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,670
A two beautiful children. So life life's
good. As bad as the situation. I'm,

361
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,290
you know, I found myself in in
April of 2012 but, but looking back,

362
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:36,790
I wish I would've tried something. Yeah,
yeah. I mean, but the 82nd airborne is,

363
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:40,600
which is where you ended up is
freaking awesome unit. Oh, I yeah.

364
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:44,350
I mean I drink the koolaid and
everybody's like, oh, about standards.

365
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,350
How'd you like,
and this is something that,

366
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,870
cause a lot of people that listen to
podcast, um, they joined the military,

367
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,093
believe it or not.

368
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,960
And like we just met a guy the other day
who's going September 18th going in the

369
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,720
Marine Corps. But I always want to tell
them like when you show up to bootcamp,

370
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,970
it's going to be a shock to your
system, right? I mean it is going to be,

371
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:06,460
you're going to lack of sleep. It's not
going to be stuff that you used to it.

372
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,890
It sounds like you've got a little,
you know,

373
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,610
shock to your system and you showed up
there of just normal military stuff.

374
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,820
And I guess my point in saying that is
when you show up to bootcamp who campus

375
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,240
is, is not going to be fun for you.
It's going to be a transition. I mean,

376
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:21,790
you can mentally prepare all day,
you know,

377
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,430
and then you get yelled at
and you're like, why is this
guy always yelling at me?

378
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,420
I didn't, I'm doing the wrong leave
me alone. Um, it made me eat coleslaw.

379
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:32,080
I don't even like Cole slaw. I mean, the
first thing I come out and they're like,

380
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:34,120
oh, well I guess Coleslaw
for lunch. I'm like, Shit.

381
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,050
So they put it on my slate and then
after I eat the Coleslaw you at first I'm

382
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:40,270
like, oh, he wants me eat this
for some reason to do this.

383
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,330
And then the next time at dinner and
I'm like, okay, finally. No. Cool.

384
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:46,070
So it's like military big bastard,
Jude eight first. I remember

385
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,000
you, you get to school goals,
so damn happy. Those aren't,

386
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,060
you know, so yeah. Yeah. That's uh, that's
boot camp, right? Yeah. That's okay.

387
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,700
I always thought when I talked to that are
going on, I'm like, just play the game.

388
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,330
Understand it's going to end and make the
army what you can make it like make it

389
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,090
work for you.

390
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,990
I understand the job you're getting
yourself into and things like that because

391
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:08,360
people ask, would you still join if you
know what happened? And I said, yeah,

392
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,350
absolutely I would. Um, I enjoyed every
second. I was going to be a 20 year guy.

393
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,650
I figured and I reenlisted
and, and uh, just,

394
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,830
you know. Yeah, it's cool. This is cool.

395
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,950
A thing that you wrote kind of as
you're wrapping up bootcamp, um,

396
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,430
you're thinking about September
11th, you know, like I said,

397
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:30,230
that for you is one that you clearly knew
that going in in 2006 and here's what

398
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:34,580
you said. I remember feeling a ragged mix
of emotions, anger, confusion, dismay,

399
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,360
and wondering why anybody
would want to do this to us.

400
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,010
I was American,

401
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,030
I understood we'd been attacked and
that our country was now at war.

402
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,250
And that when there's a war,

403
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,350
somebody needs to have the courage and
intestinal wherewithal to do the actual

404
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:52,184
defending,

405
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,310
fighting and unavoidable killing that
accompany military actions that would turn

406
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:00,350
out to be me.

407
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,630
And that's another thing that people need
to think about if you're doing in the

408
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:08,400
military. And I've gone through this with
a bunch of people that, you know, I, I,

409
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,880
this happened to be a long time
ago, this parent, you know, said,

410
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:13,820
can you come talk to my son and he really
wants to be a seal. And I was like,

411
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:17,540
yeah, sure, no problem. And so I
meet this kid strapping young kid,

412
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,890
look super happy and positive and he
does water polo and he's a great athlete.

413
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,590
And he's like, yeah, I really want
to do it in the seal teams. You know,

414
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:26,390
what advice do you have
for me? I'm like, are,

415
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,940
are you ready to kill people
and are you ready to die?

416
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,030
And it was like the whole room got just
them two but they're looking at me like

417
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,350
I'm crazy.
But my point was like,

418
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,430
that's what the military is. You kill
people and you risk your life. That's,

419
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,560
that's what the military is

420
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,070
mean. Yeah, absolutely. They have the
combat and noncombat a combat mos is,

421
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,420
you know, just in every of your service.
So with the seal teams, with the infantry,

422
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,640
that's, that's what your job is and
you're willing to risk your life. Um,

423
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,290
for others. I mean it's just when
I signed up I was like, yeah,

424
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,570
I'm ready to do this, but you're
never really understand everything.

425
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:02,940
And then when you go through
basic training and they
show you all these videos

426
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,190
and a lot of it, they showed a
lot of band of brothers stuff,

427
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,050
which is what got me interested in
going into the military. And um,

428
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,780
I just took it as like, this is what I
is what I'm born to do. This is awesome.

429
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,060
Yeah. But when I get what you're
saying and then people ask me,

430
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:19,560
can you talk to out of doing this?
And I'm like, no, no, you can't.

431
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,130
You can't talk yet. Poor a young
man out there doing this stuff.

432
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,450
Find people that want to tell you
like, well, I was going to join.

433
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:28,650
But then I did this and I'm like, I
don't, I don't care. Like don't, you know,

434
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,630
and everybody I talk to, not
everybody, but that's what I talked to.

435
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,660
They got to give me their worst
story possible. I was like, oh,

436
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:37,590
I got a brother who's a friend that
lost two legs, you know, in a bear trap.

437
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,060
And I'm like, okay, so I know what
you're going through. I don't.

438
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,130
Okay.
That works for me

439
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,210
I guess. Do you got to watch out for
them? Bear trap. Sneak up on you.

440
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,600
My brother's friend was crazy. I met
him one time. When I get what you're,

441
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,110
I know exactly what you're
doing. I'm like, oh, okay dude.

442
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,590
Uh,
this cracked me up.

443
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,530
You're at airborne school most
you're doing your first jumps.

444
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:04,750
Do five jumps at airborne school, most
back to the book most without incident,

445
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,950
except my third jump,

446
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:09,700
which was supposed to be a daytime combat
jump with full gear on the way down.

447
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:11,440
I dropped my rucksack too slowly.

448
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,960
You're supposed to release it
when you come to the tree line.

449
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,500
But when I released the packet,

450
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,780
stayed just ahead of me and I landed
on top of the metal frame frame. Ouch.

451
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:20,740
I yelled in pain.

452
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,160
The jump master was already on
the ground and yelled back at me,

453
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:26,890
did you bring something
private mills? I said, no.

454
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,510
He glared at me and added then shut up.
I showed up

455
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,750
airborne schools.
Really funny.

456
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,840
And so this is what happened to me at
airborne school. I was a first for review.

457
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,630
I'm not like I'm,
I,

458
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm a person that falls fast
through the air when parachuting.

459
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,180
I don't know why I'm just one of those
people float though. I don't flow. And,

460
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,140
and the other thing was I
didn't like doing a PLF,

461
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,120
which is the proper way to land,

462
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:55,390
which is you keep your feet and knees
together and then you like act like you

463
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:58,390
have one big leg and that's the way you're
supposed to prevent getting injured,

464
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,830
breaking your ankle or knee or whatever.

465
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,030
And so when I was parachuting at Airborne
School, I wasn't really doing a PLF.

466
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:08,140
I was just kind of athletically
landing on my feet, right? So anyways,

467
00:28:08,141 --> 00:28:11,830
they got these loudspeakers
down on the, on the, uh, field.

468
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,880
And as all these new guys, all of us are
just new. And the guys on the megaphone,

469
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:18,640
he goes and he's talking to me because
my feet are apart and I'm just going to

470
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:23,070
do an athletic cleaning, goes feet, knees
together, feet together, a bone feed,

471
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,190
knees together on the street, names
together, a burn. Y'all write airborne.

472
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,880
So, uh, yeah, I thought that was funny.
Is that correct? Did it hurt? No,

473
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,850
I didn't get hurt. That's impressive
to get hurt because you got, you know,

474
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:37,291
I was a,

475
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:41,770
I was actually a jump master dart towards
the end of my military time that was

476
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:45,820
in and you know, got the balls of
feet, calf, you know, I had it all day.

477
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,830
You had dialed, oh, those instructors,

478
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,730
how long has the jump master school to
be an instructor at Fort Benning? Well,

479
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,510
Admin, so it's completely different. So
it's not that much different I guess.

480
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:58,090
But for me it was like a three week course
and I was able to like check people's

481
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:02,020
equipment, but they didn't
make you memorize the Turman.
Oh, they did. Did, did they?

482
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,890
Uh,

483
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,130
you got to memorize like the pre jump
brief and everything and stuff like that.

484
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:10,470
But no, like, like this is a nylon
stitch with 5,000 grain testing.

485
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,470
Steel is stronger than America, so he
doesn't no way stronger than in America.

486
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,670
No Way. But no, they don't. They
don't do that to you. That's a,

487
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,650
that's a good good

488
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,630
times.
Um,

489
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,350
you're getting ready for your first
deployment to show up at 82nd. Everyone,

490
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,990
you're, you're there, you're getting
ready for your first deployment. You know,

491
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:37,991
you're going to Afghanistan and you're
leaving just after Christmas and here or

492
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:42,010
go into the book.
My Dad didn't to me about leaving

493
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,090
over the next few days. We hung out
and did whatever we normally did,

494
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,320
but most he said during that time
was be sure to keep your head down.

495
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,200
Then the day before I left, Dad told me
a story about when he went into the army,

496
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,330
he taken washable paint and written a
note to his parents in their shower stall

497
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,400
where they were sure to be able to see it.

498
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,250
It said one short sentence of reassurance.
All will be fine.

499
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,530
Early in the morning that I left,

500
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,940
I took a washable marker and went into
my parents' bathroom right above the

501
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:21,230
faucets where they were sure to see it.
I wrote the same short message.

502
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,930
All will be fine.
I was miles away from the house.

503
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:29,930
When my dad called,
he told me he saw the note,

504
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,300
I didn't say much and he didn't say much.
He told me he loved me.

505
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Then his voice became hoarse and his
words of support for me came out,

506
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:42,680
broken and choked.

507
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,370
First time going on deployment.

508
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,480
And it was, it was a little rough too
because I'm a guy from my hometown,

509
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,900
a marine. Uh, he was a buddy of
mine. His Dad was my baseball coach.

510
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,290
His brother was in my grade and the
day after Christmas on the 26th,

511
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:04,160
he got shot by a sniper in Iraq and
ended up right to his heart and he didn't

512
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:07,490
make it home. So his, uh,
my brother's actually,

513
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,920
his girlfriend was his,
uh,

514
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,880
Chris is a little sister and she was
at my house and I found out from,

515
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,110
from friends that what had happened before
the family found out from people that

516
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:21,710
were deployed with the unit. So, I mean
that was, that was rough on my parents,

517
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:23,300
you know, to have me, you know,

518
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,570
in a couple of weeks going overseas and
then I'm at home the day after Christmas,

519
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,550
you know,
a guy gets shot that I know.

520
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,520
Yeah, there's uh, um, it's one,

521
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:34,070
I think that's one of the
hardest things for a win.

522
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:39,140
Win military families see
someone wounded or killed,

523
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,970
they know that that could be their,
their loved one. And that's why that,

524
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,690
that's, I mean a days before you're
leaving, man. That's, that's harsh.

525
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,250
And, and then we're good.
We're close friends with the
family. Like, like I said,

526
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,810
his dad coached me from I
think 10 years old, up to 14.

527
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,040
Yeah, 14 or 15, but you know, knew
the family, are they? Well, so,

528
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:03,610
so it was a little rough and things
like that for a bit, uh, on my parents.

529
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:06,850
But you know, people now when
they see me, they say, Hey,

530
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:09,060
do you go and speak to a lot of
military things? And I'm like, you know,

531
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,500
I don't really do that that much.
If they want me to come in I will,

532
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:14,050
but I'm not sure. But guys are going
overseas want to see me on stage saying,

533
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:18,500
hey guys, you're going to be
a okay. You know, I'm yes,
try not get her out. I mean,

534
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,370
I mean I talked a lot of companies but
when it comes down to that I'm like,

535
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:25,420
hey guys, you'll be good over there.
It's like some movie that that six uh,

536
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,510
I don't know it is, but they're like maple
tree made me the man I am today. Yes.

537
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,530
Yeah, I've never seen it. Mega told that
line and he's got like two fake legs.

538
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,900
He's good. He's real good with
movie quotes, especially bad movie.

539
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,950
I'm so glad I forgot you were here.
No, it's great. Now and then chime in

540
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,690
here. So your first
deployment, what are you,

541
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:47,810
are you in the e three Ernie
for? Um, when I went over there,

542
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:50,820
I think I was in e three. That's, I
might have been an easy to actually,

543
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:54,710
am I personalizing, I was only in the
military like six months where I deployed.

544
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,010
That's, that's crazy. I was a good time.

545
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:02,600
I worked for a colonel basically PSD
for the kernel, right? Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:06,380
So like try me and like a young private,
you go to a unit that's not an infantry,

547
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:09,300
you don't get treated like
crap. You work for a, uh,

548
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:14,150
lieutenant colonel who was a direct
descendant of colonel Custer. He's, uh,

549
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,860
it was his great uncle and the guys
just as wild Scotty d and he always walk

550
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,190
around and see what's better than
a pair of vases, guys to pair.

551
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,640
And he show like the double A's on
his own and a phenomenal guy really.

552
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,920
And we just go around with them.
So we ever got yelled at or my,

553
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,500
my team leader was, was a
cook sergeant rush. Like if
we, if we ever got yelled at,

554
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:35,570
he just go to the colonel and be
like, hey, so they're bothering us.

555
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,700
And in the crumby be like, don't
even talk to my guys. And I'm like,

556
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,550
this is so nice. Being protected
sign. Literally a colonel.

557
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:44,540
So that was a relatively
Kush. And you were living on
a, if you're with a colonel,

558
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:47,740
I'm assuming you were living in like
pretty good fom Salerno. Oh yeah.

559
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,910
And they have like hard
buildings and they had tents.

560
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,210
We were in the very first hard building.
Oh.

561
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,690
We all went in and bought a satellite
Internet. I had a shower every day.

562
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,760
Hot meals. It was a wonder if, how often
are you rolling out into town every day.

563
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,860
Okay. But we'd go out to government
work and come back, you know,

564
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:05,780
and then I was in the gym.
I'd go eight o'clock.

565
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:08,530
I don't like being in the gym with
people. Like I was like, I don't know,

566
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,640
none of my machines.
And I super set it a lot.

567
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,210
So I'd go from eight till 11 at night,
just crush it. And then midnight child,

568
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:18,620
which is like the greatest thing ever.
Yeah, no crowd. Oh, you just, you're like,

569
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,850
I'll like omelets and hot wings.
Oh,

570
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,980
you get the Combo breakfast and
dinner scenario booming down.

571
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,190
I know you're a much cooler guy than me,
but when you got the midnight child,

572
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,280
five sal, I'm telling you, it's
like, yeah, I went to the hot wings,

573
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,670
I'll take pancakes and,
and don't,

574
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:39,750
she doesn't take mashed potatoes
with gravy on that. And uh,

575
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,400
you guys, it sounds like on that first,
well you didn't, you didn't even shoot,

576
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,920
you even shoot your gun first
employee didn't have to,

577
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:47,180
I was on patrols every day.

578
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,600
I had a suicide bomber run out the house
and like detonated on the front of our

579
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:55,270
truck. Just like what an idiot. No,
I mean like, and like, you know,

580
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,740
it's nuts. Ax hanging off the light
and as you know, but he's just,

581
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,540
the truck's not hurting. It's like
genius Bro. Genius job. Well done.

582
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,890
A for effort. Yeah. Like a
F for judgment. Yeah. Yeah.

583
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,260
But still that, I mean that, that
having a suicide bomber hit your truck,

584
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,040
that's like, uh, that's at least a reality
check out a minimum. Right? Well, I mean,

585
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,610
yeah, so it was, it was our, our uh,

586
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:24,480
one of our front trucks and then also we
had a guy run up on the kernel opening

587
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,460
the hospital and detonate himself.
Um, I was in the truck at that time,

588
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:29,001
like in the gun,

589
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,970
but we just found out if we go out there
and we just make sure that everyone

590
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:34,460
knows, we're really aware. Every
time we take a turn, you know,

591
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:37,770
our guns are rotating, we're not
sleeping, we're up and out. Um,

592
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,000
we didn't really get messed with and um,
and that, and that helped. I mean, I was,

593
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,900
you know, I was in a place where
there was bombs and things like that,

594
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:47,070
but I was very protected,
you know,

595
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,450
dod would roll out before the colonel
went anywhere. Oh, that's right. Yeah.

596
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,900
How many guns, how many go on trucks
did you take on a convoy? Just portal.

597
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,740
Just four of us would have been the three
truck or two trucks. He was in the two.

598
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,650
I was just a hundred the first,
like six months. And then I was a,

599
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:05,580
I moved to like be a TC, but it, it, it,

600
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,570
the threat level was like medium. I
mean, cause you have to take it. Yeah.

601
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:13,440
You can take a bigger convoy
with more aggressive facilities.

602
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:17,260
If I was in the Hump, it was all Humvees
we were before, like any other there.

603
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,210
And I had a two, four, nine like is my,
my main weapon I had to saw. They're like,

604
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:24,750
yeah, okay. The front truck.
Yep. 50 cal a backdrop.

605
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:28,410
We're gonna give you a mark and you just
going to get a saw. And I was like, oh,

606
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,420
awesome. Thank you. So I had, I had
a saw. That's what I put it up there.

607
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:38,040
Like it was a big old gun. Yeah.
That's awesome. Good Times. Yeah.

608
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,900
Why didn't they give you a real
gun up there? Uh, apparently the,

609
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,290
my biceps were big enough. That was a
real gun show, you know, and I get that.

610
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,280
I had 22 at the time.
I got some supplements sent to me.

611
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,880
Respect SF guys found a way for me to
get some of their supplements. Wonderful.

612
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,330
Uh, no. Do you went to for, is this the,

613
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:02,280
is this deployment you went
for a home for R and R on?

614
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,430
It is and you had your first meeting,

615
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,990
first meeting with one of your platoon
mates, sisters, you know, I love it.

616
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,430
I love to antagonize people. And I
got in my space friend request and uh,

617
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,760
I thought, man, this must be a
dating Paige is it, you know,

618
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:21,240
cowgirl hat around blouse, shirt,
whatever, Jean skirt. I was like,

619
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,210
that's a dating site. You know,
there's an ad, wait a second,

620
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,570
that last name is Sam was my medic.
Let's do some investigation.

621
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:30,510
He was home and rnr and I was
looking through, I was like,

622
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,750
that's his little sister. She's 18
so it's legal. And I was just like,

623
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:38,220
except you know, and we started chit
chatting and I just did to make him mad,

624
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:39,054
you know,

625
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,420
but we ended up enjoying each other's
company the first time we ever met.

626
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,910
I was like, I just a vacation. I've been
here 11 and a half months, you know,

627
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,510

You want, you want to go on vacation?

628
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:52,140
She was like, yeah, sure. So we decide
we're going to go to Cozumel, Mexico.

629
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,400
How'd you, how'd you talk to
her dad into that? She was 18,

630
00:37:56,401 --> 00:38:00,630
so she knew what she wanted, I guess. I
don't know. He didn't kill me so heavy.

631
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,080
Right. And so you go to
Mexico, that's your first date.

632
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:06,660
Is that I'm just going to take you to
Mexico. Yeah. Yeah. You guys. I say,

633
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:11,030
I don't know that $24,000 when I know
exactly where, um, went to Mexico,

634
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,150
then back to Michigan for a week, had a
great time. Uh, she went back to Texas,

635
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:18,410
had to go back overseas. I got held up
in Atlanta, so I called her up, was like,

636
00:38:18,411 --> 00:38:20,370
Hey, I'm in Atlanta for the night.
You want to come? And she said, yeah.

637
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,940
So she came out the next morning saying
our goodbyes crocodile to your streaming

638
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:27,670
from her face. Um, and she's like, I

639
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,940
So I love you too. You know, as fast
as I could. It's like, I love you all.

640
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:34,500
I didn't even pause. It's just like in
between her soft, I wanna marry you.

641
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:36,010
And I'm like, yeah, I
get that. But you know,

642
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:38,400
in my head I said that cause I was like,
I want to marry you to

643
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,590
real Casanova here, jump on that airplane,
get back overseas, give her a call.

644
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,290
Right. 24 hours later and Afghanistan,
I'm like, Hey, what's going on baby?

645
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,780
She's like, guess what? I'm like,
I don't know what weddings plans.

646
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,940
zales.com bought her a ring and called
her dad and whatnot and he living,

647
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,780

okay, thanks. And then we got married.

648
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,600
How did her brother feel about it?

649
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,060
Was he was her brother in your platoon
with you? I'll use my medic. Yeah,

650
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,690
he actually wrote in the same truck as
me am I colonel would pick on him on the

651
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:14,720
radio. Hey Buck, what do you think mills
is doing with your sister? And it's like,

652
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,900
I'm like breakfast break.

653
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,060
You can let that go because you mean
I'm standing up in the truck, you know?

654
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:22,300
And Josh can do hammer makes when the
back seat. And I'm like, no, no, no.

655
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:26,650
Don't do this. Don't do this
here. Um, but, uh, no, he,

656
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:29,170
he knew I was good guy. He's like, he
told his mom and dad, he's like, look,

657
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:31,600
I know how it looks. And he's
actually a good guy and really nice.

658
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,000
So we'll see how it works out. And
then I ended up marrying her. Yeah, no,

659
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,560
that's awesome man. That's a
great story. Do you detail it, um,

660
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,520
in here that it's pretty,
uh,

661
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,950
it's pretty unbelievable. You know,
that you pulled all that off? Well,

662
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,250
in the colonel was actually setting me
up to go to the prep school in Virginia

663
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:53,950
for West Point. He's like, you should
be playing football on my, my uh,

664
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,030
lieutenant at the time. Um, Lieutenant
Phillips, now he's a major but,

665
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,580
or maybe as a colonel now,
but, um, he was training,

666
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:03,820
he was a football coach and he
holds a record in Chicago. Yeah.

667
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,780
Most consecutive losses at the school
that he was coaching hat in high school.

668
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,120
Yeah. They were that
bad. Great guy though.

669
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:12,970
And he was like helping me coach and
train up and lift weights and do whatever.

670
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,260
But then I met Kelsey, I was like, I
be, I'm just going to do this, you know?

671
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,520
So we got married when I got back.
How long,

672
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:22,840
how long after you went home for
Christmas did you come back? Uh,

673
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:25,780
I came back in April and the 13th night.
14th morning.

674
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,610
And then you won't find it in my book,

675
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:30,430
but we got married at the courthouse
on the 17th. So there you go. Yeah.

676
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,050
And then we got married again and big
wedding junior like most miniature,

677
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,020
that money. Well, I needed to, I spent
all my money, you know, I was like,

678
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:41,140
I don't know how to get a house. So
I'm on, I'm like, look, we need to,

679
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,990
I need that Bh face during must've
favor with this damn wedding. You know?

680
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,270
So when you guys do your waiver in
Texas in Mckinney, about 112 that day,

681
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,710
and then, uh, did you say you settled
down and now you, now you know,

682
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,170
you're staying in the army,
you've pretty pretty much saying,

683
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:58,540
I'm saying the army at this point.
Well, I mean, I really enjoyed it.

684
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:01,210
I got moved around to another unit and
when I got back because I had to go to

685
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,960
like a line unit, couldn't be a PSD
guy. I mean I was up for it. I was like,

686
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:08,710
this is awesome. But uh, yeah, we've got
a house or an apartment in North Carolina,

687
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,220
uh, right outside Fort Bragg
there bought a dog. Um,

688
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,320
life was good and I figured the military
is doing well and then just kind of

689
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:20,220
hung out for 15 months or 18 months
before I deployed. I was going to say,

690
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,780
so it's 18 months between
deployments for you?

691
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,890
It was that usually a year and three
months. So like I went for 15 months,

692
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:31,480
so they gave me 18 months off and I went
for a year and then I, they gave me, um,

693
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,150
15 months off. Then I had to go again
for my third. But I'm jumping ahead here.

694
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,650
So you, you get back
over on deployment? Um,

695
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,070
yeah.

696
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,910
And this is, uh, this is like within
days that you deal type me up on that,

697
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:47,060
but one of your,
one of your friends,

698
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,110
Tyler Juden is saying that,
right? [inaudible] Yup. He's uh,

699
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,380
out on amount of patrol.
IED hits the first vehicle,

700
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,140
then they get a snarl small arms
ambush and I'm going to the book.

701
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:00,020
Here are guys needed to get the
disabled vehicle out of the way.

702
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,330
And while they worked
toward this objective,

703
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:06,740
Tyler sprinted up to a high sight on a
nearby hale and fired through some five

704
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,380
to seven magazines,
ammo protecting his soldiers below.

705
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:13,730
When the disabled truck was finally
cleared, Tyler sprinted back to the truck.

706
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,100
But the enemy had specifically targeted
him and RPG flew in and he was hit.

707
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,120
They rushed him back to the hospital
at the fob, but it was too late.

708
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,090
Tyler died on the operating table.

709
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:27,480
Yeah,

710
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,390
fury rose up inside of me.

711
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,980
I wanted to find whatever Taliban savages
did this to Tyler and shoot them in

712
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:36,710
the face.
Tyler was always cautious.

713
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,370
He took his job extremely
seriously and never made mistakes.

714
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,100
There was no reason for him to die.

715
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,910
He described to me once how he believed
his job as a sniper ultimately saved

716
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,290
innocent lives. He was putting into
practice what he knew to be true.

717
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,200
He was helping the world,
not hindering it,

718
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,920
and he'd been trained to be one of the
rough man who stands ready in the night,

719
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,600
prepared to do his duty, prepared to visit
violence on those who would do us harm

720
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:09,310
Tyler's death far hit far too close
to home and we'd only just arrived.

721
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,550
Yeah.

722
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,220
So that's not a fun way to
kick off deployment. No.

723
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,560
And I'm not sure if he's
experienced in your unit,

724
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:21,100
but it seems like the guys get hit are
the ones that you don't expect will ever

725
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:26,090
get hit. So Tyler was a year older than
me. Uh, I respected him. I mean it was,

726
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:28,570
it was crazy cause you know,
a guy's your older cycle or whatever,

727
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:32,420
but he had such a professionalism about
them and I looked up to him and I tried

728
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:34,570
to learn what I could from him.
And he only had like a,

729
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,120
he probably had an extra year and
a half in the army than I did, but,

730
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,500
but either way and highly ranked
sniper and a, he went up and just,

731
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,040
he didn't take bad shots, so he was just
popping everybody. They did Tyree him.

732
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:49,110
He actually, I'm pretty sure it was
a camp Chapman that he at the end,

733
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,200
not sure if you've ever been to the
SF. No, I haven't based there. Um, uh,

734
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,570
but anyway,
that's where he ended up not making,

735
00:43:55,571 --> 00:43:58,840
there's only two weeks into the
appointment and um, you know, when,

736
00:43:58,841 --> 00:44:01,780
when that guy like that gets hit one
you obviously frustrated and angry,

737
00:44:01,781 --> 00:44:04,750
you don't know why it happened, but two,
it's like, well Geez, if he can get,

738
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,760
you know, hit or taken out, you know,
it kind of takes you down to competence,

739
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,010
integrity, a peg or two as well because
he's the guy you wouldn't expect.

740
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,990
Not that you expect anybody to
get hit I guess. But you know,

741
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,760
like a super soldier style guy.
Yeah.

742
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:23,680
Yeah. And I'm sure like everybody,
if you held them in that regard,

743
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,830
everybody held him in that regard and so
everybody's feeling that same kind of a

744
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,010
straight up nervousness, right? Yeah. And

745
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,360
there was, he would walk by like on our
ACU is I could have a strange pulls,

746
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,090
tuck the string in some standard stuff
if my way that would be hanging out and

747
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:42,450
he's what might yank on it and they
make you do pushups and yell at me and I

748
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:44,940
wanted to punch him in the
face but I couldn't, you know,

749
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,750
and I understood why he was doing it so
much is a fun story I guess I like tell

750
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:52,780
people cause I mean if I could've decked
him I probably would have only been in

751
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:57,270
one fist fight ever and knocked myself
out playing volleyball. That was it.

752
00:44:57,271 --> 00:45:01,570
That was the one, yeah. It's sad
but true. It's in the book. Yeah.

753
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,400
I don't know what that really,
you might as well tell it.

754
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,400
Well yeah we just were playing volleyball
and I never got mad is going over the

755
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:12,630
net. We made [inaudible] for
like cables for the antennas.

756
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:16,010
We use those and five 50 cord and
it was like quick go over net.

757
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,240
I was six foot three and the net was
only six foot tall. So I was like,

758
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:22,380
just hammering it home. I had a
vertical, you know, like Lebron.

759
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:25,740
So he's ridiculous.
Whole belly button above the net.

760
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,330
And I kept going over
and they kept yelling.

761
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,320
So I pulled my hand back real fast for I
did it and I caught myself right in the

762
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:33,810
eye socket knocked out.

763
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:38,760
Do you actually knocked
yourself out? Yeah. Yeah. But,

764
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,820
but later on when I had this happen,
I didn't get knocked out.

765
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:47,070
Game engine with a fist of fury could've
done Floyd winter stood a chance

766
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:48,490
against me.
I don't know if I'm impressed,

767
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,840
if that's like super impressive
or super not impressive. Right.

768
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,990
You either have the office of iron
or glass jaw. We're not sure which.

769
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,720
I hit a bomb knocked out.
So my answers had been just of iron.

770
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,240
The questions have been answered.

771
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:06,270
Probably be in jail right now if I
went in fisticuffs with anybody. So,

772
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,090
uh,
you,

773
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:14,070
it sounds like you guys ended up
doing Overwatch's of a road in,

774
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,690
um,
what up bae?

775
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,450
Zach Pass. Okay. Yeah. And great time.

776
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,930
How long were you on that for? Oh, we
went out there and they were like, yeah,

777
00:46:22,931 --> 00:46:24,790
just go ahead and pack for you know,
a couple of weeks.

778
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,430
And then we were out there
I think 57 50 days or so.

779
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,510
And we just live on top of a mountain.
And then like just monitoring the road.

780
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,980
Yeah.
Just cause they had a,

781
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:36,730
they were bringing up convoys that jingle
trucks with military gear on to build

782
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:41,110
another farb and we had people on
both sides. And I actually, uh,

783
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,980
I was so afraid to tell my wife I
went down one day and get some food or

784
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:49,480
something or get a resupply and uh,
I'm only back up. They made a stop.

785
00:46:49,481 --> 00:46:51,190
They want to register mortars.
And I was like, what the,

786
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,360
I just want to get back up there.

787
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:55,360
I got out and I slammed my door
and like the brilliant guy am,

788
00:46:55,361 --> 00:46:56,470
I went ahead and use a fist.

789
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:00,460
If you're in a hammer to homer and I
ripped the scab open on my hand and I told

790
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:03,880
the wife my story of my life, it was so
much blood, it was gushing was ridiculous.

791
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:06,910
But, uh, as my wedding ring
fingers, I took my wedding ring off,

792
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:10,240
put on the front of the Hummer and I got
the medic. I was like, get out your doc,

793
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,310
you know, Willis or whatever
have fixed this up for me.

794
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,650
And he had to put tape on it.
I got back in,

795
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,050
left my wedding ring right on the
front of that Hummer and drove back up

796
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:19,420
mountain.
So lakes for 37 days.

797
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:22,240
Every time I got a chance to go down
the mountain I was headed metal detector

798
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:23,770
out. Like please find
this tungsten ring please.

799
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:24,640
I don't want to tell my whole life

800
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,180
I you have in front of it.
And I,

801
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,270
I was like to give people that
didn't serve a little, you know,

802
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,180
impression or of of what it's like.

803
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:39,700
And I thought this one wrapped it up
pretty good. Going to the book here,

804
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:44,020
going so long without taking a shower
came with its share of complications.

805
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,860
Guys got trench foot from their feet being
wet and sweaty and not taking care of

806
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:48,694
them properly.

807
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,900
I got strange rashes in intimate areas
and it wasn't uncommon for a guy to

808
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,410
mutter about his balls sticking
to his leg when he hiked.

809
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:00,700
Every dude got chafed up pretty
badly in his bodily crevices.

810
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:04,510
And a common complaint
was that a guy had SLAs,

811
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,100
slang for sweaty ass.
My armpits hurt.

812
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:14,580
I sweated so much that the
salt got trapped in my skin
and my back broke out in

813
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:18,700
a raised bubbly rash.
This happened to other guys too.

814
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:23,440
The only solution is to get your ID card
out and have another dude scrape your

815
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:26,110
back hard until the salt crystals pop out.

816
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,790
It's a brutal procedure and it feels
like getting cut with a razor blade,

817
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,010
but it's all part of the fun
day to day,

818
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:37,810
day to day get.
So

819
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,870
I mean it sounds like I was complaining
to them that one, Huh? No. Yeah,

820
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:47,620
watching someone like scrape salt crystals
like size of table salt come out of

821
00:48:47,621 --> 00:48:50,740
there. But I'm not sure
if you've ever experienced
anything like that. No, but uh,

822
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,900
yeah, that's pretty bad. And you
get so gross and then, I don't know,

823
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:56,590
I took four real showers out
here. Yeah, like real ones.

824
00:48:56,591 --> 00:48:59,050
I mean you'd go get a water bottle and
poke holes in the top and spray yourself

825
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:01,390
down, but then you got to
get dirty all over again.

826
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,860
This whole long process or like how it
takes like nine days or something before

827
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:08,410
you get comfortable with
your nasty. Yeah. Yeah.

828
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,780
And then you don't even want to
break the cycle and get clean again.

829
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,310
Take you 90 days to get used to it again.
No, the best part, it's like the winter,

830
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:16,630
cause you don't smell
as bad in the winter.

831
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,990
Like when the winter you don't
take showers, you're like,

832
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,873
oh it doesn't even matter.

833
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,100
I brush my teeth keeping pearly white
teeth look whiter, you know? But uh,

834
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,810
yeah, no, it's pretty. I actually
decided I'm halfway into that deployment.

835
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:31,960
I was like told, my wife just sent
me eight pair range of panties.

836
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,260
So I wore a whole bear like range of
panties for a month and I just took them

837
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:36,310
off. I was like, no,

838
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:40,360
we're not gonna wash these just all more
here except it and move on 12 bucks.

839
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:45,400
Wellsmith so matter of fact,
whereas abs like past my, uh,

840
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,200
my pants got so torn,
they were like chats.

841
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,110
Like I bought chicks are hanging out
stuff and one of the sergeant majors came

842
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:54,150
in, you know, and they're all out of out
of shape. Like looking back at diction,

843
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,160
change brands. I'm like Sargent
Major. If I change my pants,

844
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,690
I'm gonna get another pair.
It looks just like this.

845
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,750
Like I'm not on the fob
and you come into like,

846
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,140
you got to get a new uniform and all that.
I'm like, bring me one. I'm like, yeah,

847
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,820
okay, let me do that.
You got it bud. I know.

848
00:50:08,821 --> 00:50:10,570
Going to get back in that truck
and roll your ass out of here.

849
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:15,050
So back to the chicken wings and pancakes.
Oh,

850
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:19,090
I know a lot of Mras delicious.

851
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:23,770
Good Times. Yeah. You know I
gotta just straight up. I mean in,

852
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:27,980
in the seal teams we just don't GAF to

853
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,720
eat that many. Mrs is yet to
do the, either you make them,

854
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,060
you can make those things
delicious. Yeah, you can.

855
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:38,720
That burrito get at me makes
it a little bit in there.

856
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:44,030
Yeah. Uh, I actually, my
first deployment to Iraq,

857
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:47,840
we eight Mras for a little while and
I was legitimately sick of them and,

858
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,770
and it wasn't, it wasn't that long,
but I was already sick of them at one.

859
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:56,570
No 50 days. I can promise you that.
Yeah. Well I mean, yeah. Yeah.

860
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,350
You're just going to say something about
the seal teams weren't you? No, not,

861
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:03,230
I would never,
I don't have fiscal period defend myself.

862
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:06,740
So we're getting shipped in steaks,
crap like that.

863
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,640
I mean that later on that point we had
like steaks on like one day a week they'd

864
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:13,220
bring out like these frozen steaks and
we'd cook them over like an open pit of

865
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:17,570
fire with the stick through them.
Yeah. Dude is legit. Like I,

866
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:19,730
we'd go out to some rant,
my first and when we'd go out to,

867
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,720
cause we were living at, we on by op and
Baghdad, Big Chow Hall, everything good.

868
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,610
And we'd go out to do an op somewhere
to be some SF group in the middle of

869
00:51:28,611 --> 00:51:31,010
nowhere and you'd see how they're living.

870
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,380
And it wasn't always an SF group or
someone's just an army, you know,

871
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:36,320
some Army platoon or company out there
in the middle of nowhere and you're like,

872
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:40,300
Dang, these boys are roughing
it nasty and we're here.

873
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,660
Like they brought Gatorade. They
bought a case. Give me too. Me Too.

874
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,160
I'm a hide one of my pillow case.
You'd feel bad. They did. Oh man,

875
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:47,420
you're in the seal teams are like,
dude,

876
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:50,750
I'm ashamed to do like even be
hanging out with you right now.

877
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,300
You guys smell so bad, but I don't
know why they brought me out here.

878
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,810
You guys go sit over there. We're
just gonna sit here. Leave us alone.

879
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,440
We'd hit guys. Do you know what? We've
gone three days without a shower.

880
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,430
This is crap, man. Yeah, we did that.

881
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,740
Let's totally the same life,
but in during this, I mean,

882
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,940
and during the shock is still like, it's
funny like my friends from high school,

883
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:17,090
right? I have two really good
friends, I can talk with whatever,

884
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:19,790
but if I run to another person
from high school or whatever,

885
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,290
we'll catch up on everything.
Then it's like,

886
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,570
oh great talking to you and you know,

887
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:24,920
and then you'd find a
way out the conversation,

888
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:28,100
but you run the military buddies you
haven't seen in years and you can just go

889
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,800
right back into it. You know, just
cause you understand where you've been,

890
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:35,390
where you're going through. Um,
speaking to going through stuff.

891
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,180
Here we go back to the book,

892
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:42,080
the Taliban screeched to a
stop and started shooting
at the amp bullets cracked

893
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:46,280
all around us. We got word
from higher command to engage.
I yelled to my men fire,

894
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,770
we shot our rifles and Schwartz let
loose with several bursts of machine gun

895
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,130
rat, a tat, tat rat, a
tat, tat rat a tat tat.

896
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,280
This is my first large scale
fire fight of any kind.

897
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:03,050
It hit me with a wham that this wasn't
really a training exercise anymore.

898
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,220
This was the real deal. My adrenaline
rose and way that a surge of energy,

899
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:12,620
but I also felt calm as if all my training
kicked in at once and I just did what

900
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:15,830
I was trained to do.
I honestly wasn't afraid.

901
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,290
I took aim and fired at the bad guys.

902
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,830
They fired at me and it didn't phase me
to think that I might kill somebody when

903
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:25,040
I wanted, when they wanted
to kill me first, I,

904
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:28,950
several Taliban members get hit
and fall more, fell and more.

905
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,900
The last few who are left turned around
and took off, took off up the wadi.

906
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,740
We got word to get not to
give chase because why?

907
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:40,470
These are great choke points for
a potential enemy and bushes.

908
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,960
When the shooting died down completely,

909
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,230
we approached close enough to see the
bodies of the enemy soldiers I just helped

910
00:53:47,231 --> 00:53:49,800
to kill.
It was a surreal feeling,

911
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:53,190
but I reminded myself that this is
what a soldier's are built to do.

912
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:59,390
We receive reports later that three of
my men are three of the men killed were

913
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:03,510
top Taliban leaders in the region.
So there's your first gunfight.

914
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,740
Yeah,
it was pretty awesome.

915
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:10,590
So the a and p m AP commander was a
former Taliban guy and he switched over

916
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:13,380
sides and ran NP and he was like,
yeah, they're having a big meeting.

917
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:15,690
I got to call, they're going to come
down this Swati, we'll go check it out.

918
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:20,310
And then all of a sudden just like just
dropping, you know, Martin 19 and, um,

919
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:25,320
the 50 cal and two 40 on him and just
hey, you know, going nuts. And then, uh,

920
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,750
then, you know, they, they
come back and they, they,

921
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,230
they're really good about taking their
bodies away with them. You know, they're,

922
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:34,160
they're pretty good about it, but they
were like 18 or a 20 people deep in the,

923
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:38,070
in the wadi coming in. We just
led into him and uh, yeah,

924
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:40,500
that was my first like real taste
of like I shoot my gun at people.

925
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:43,740
What were you a team leader
at this point? Uh, no,

926
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:46,380
I was so I was actually a squad
leader. Oh, that's right. I was,

927
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,050
I was a position up so
I was still in e five,

928
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:54,051
but I was in a squad leader position so
I was trying to do is of what a weapons

929
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:58,110
squad? No, no, that we were actually, uh,
we were mounted. So I had my own truck,

930
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,840
but I had two tracks that were
under me, so I had to, to uh,

931
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:03,240
two trucks that were two teams.

932
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:06,030
[inaudible] had two team leaders that
were underneath me and then we each had a

933
00:55:06,031 --> 00:55:08,400
truck.
So my senior like team leader had one,

934
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,400
he was a TC of his truck and then as a
TC of the junior team leader that, yeah,

935
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:13,743
that's a good time.

936
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,350
Again,

937
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,050
I said that it does speak in somewhere
or the other day and I said something

938
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:21,240
along those lines and
like somebody said like,

939
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,380
I think it's kind of weird that you say
it's good time and fun. And I'm like,

940
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:29,730
well, it's adrenaline rush. Like, yeah,
that's a good time and fun. I mean

941
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,560
they shot at me first and then
he started it.

942
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,140
Defend Yourself. But uh,
yeah, and then I mean,

943
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:44,700
yeah, it just, it doesn't, it didn't
phase me, it didn't hit me hard.

944
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:49,050
I wasn't worried about it. Um, just
kept moving on. It. Matter of fact,

945
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:53,190
that region died right down
like completely after that
if you kill all those bad

946
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:57,230
guys, they just in fact like a, that
was our first night out there too.

947
00:55:57,231 --> 00:55:59,960
They moved out to the middle of nowhere
and the snow storm and I was like,

948
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,340
maybe I have not first night or second
night out there and we just shot

949
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:05,400
everybody and then for the next like two
months it was quiet and they were like,

950
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,040
they back filled with some
other platoon that like, hey,

951
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:09,210
we're going to bring you
in this platoon here.

952
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:12,180
You guys are going to go up north where
there's a lot of fighting in Baltimore.

953
00:56:12,181 --> 00:56:14,610
God, all right, cool.
Let's do it. So that's,

954
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,570
that's the next big movement that you
made was that spot and that place had a

955
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:22,410
bad rep like as far as being
a lot of fighting there.

956
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,250
I bomb guy was real heavy,

957
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:29,320
real heavy. It was, I'm the bottom
of river. And when we got there, um,

958
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,380
the Italians were there before us and I
guess they were just like, hey, Taliban,

959
00:56:32,381 --> 00:56:35,710
don't mess with us. Here's, here's some
money and we're good. And we're, uh,

960
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,380
we're the a second. So we're
like, no, not going to happen.

961
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:43,270
And the infantry platoon that we replaced,
I mean, for the record, I am infantry,

962
00:56:43,271 --> 00:56:47,410
I was in a cab unit, but they always have
a Charlie troop is an infantry platoon.

963
00:56:47,411 --> 00:56:50,690
They bring in and then we had these coin
between was always like two infantry in

964
00:56:50,691 --> 00:56:55,180
two cab squads to make platoons up.
But um, yeah, we replaced these uh,

965
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,150
immature guys. They had two guys
killed, unfortunately fell into a river.

966
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,390
There's actually a ceasefire with the
Taliban defined the bodies and bring the

967
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:05,650
bodies back. Um, and we got
up there and there was like a,

968
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,930
a line in the sand. They said,
look, you cross this line,

969
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:11,950
you're going to get shot at. And we
were like, all right, cool. So we,

970
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,860
we started taking ground and um,

971
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,100
everywhere that there's a fighting
position on top of the mountain,

972
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,760
they would booby trap it when they
were done. So a guy, one of the Fo's,

973
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:25,000
Sergeant Fox, good guy, he picked
up a matchbox. It's like, Yep,

974
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:29,080
I got a matchbox it looks like. And then
just finally found his torso that was,

975
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:32,860
you know, everything else was
gone, just his body armor. Um,

976
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,740
but instead of staying
in one spot at this one,

977
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,220
we took one more spot and
they're like, yeah, well some um,

978
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,010
Marsac guys went up here
was these,

979
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:47,140
the strong points are corvette and impala
is that we're talking about now? Yeah.

980
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,150
Yeah, yeah. These are in your book,

981
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:54,160
you talk about those being an
impala was the, the even worse one,

982
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:56,350
even further into enemy territory.
Yeah. And they were like, yeah,

983
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:59,900
we had like a march. That guy got shot
in the head when he was up there. Um,

984
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,830
because there's like an eight man
team that went in there. Like,

985
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:05,770
you guys can't really go there. So we
decided one night we're going to go there.

986
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:09,820
We'd trained, we've got all ready for
it. Uh, what was the impala physically,

987
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:13,760
what does it like a little, uh,
former, like, like house or something.

988
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,030
It was actually absolutely as a house.
Um,

989
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,750
and we decided we're going to take it one
night because it was the last house on

990
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:22,810
the edge of town and then there was 1200
meters between the next like village

991
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,970
and the Taliban would go in there
and shoot at us and you know,

992
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:30,670
be able to sneak down away far
enough. And, uh, we had, um,

993
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,980
a javelin team come up on one side.

994
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,590
We went up in the middle of night on
this side and we had other people on this

995
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:40,540
side and we just, we just took it in the
middle of the night and then they said,

996
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:43,300
we're going to go up there for like
three days. Do we constantly come back?

997
00:58:43,301 --> 00:58:44,800
And they're like, Hey, you know
what? We're going to stay there.

998
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,940
So the work didn't stop. We had to
fill sandbags, put up barbed wire. Um,

999
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,860
and then we went up the side of a
mountain and, and Doug in a, uh,

1000
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:58,870
um, an LP, but it was like we had
21 guys or a tablet and never knew.

1001
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,270
We only had 20 minutes a one man platoon.

1002
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,140
So we had like 13 down at the cop and
then we'd sent the rest of them up on top

1003
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:08,830
of the hill and we dug in so deep that
was eight foot deep pits and there was a

1004
00:59:08,831 --> 00:59:13,450
living room, uh, two 40
pit, a 50 cal pit, um, uh,

1005
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:17,200
like a little dining kitchen area. And
then like three sleeping pits, like three,

1006
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:19,090
like that two cots would fit in.
Like it was huge.

1007
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,560
Did you put overhead cover
on them somehow? Uh, no.

1008
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:23,900
We just dug them deep enough where
he didn't, didn't need it. Yeah.

1009
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:27,890
I mean we put our, I guess we put our,
uh, um, ponchos over it, you know,

1010
00:59:27,891 --> 00:59:31,490
things like that. Not Protection
from mortars. No, no. Yeah.

1011
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,070
And if you stood up when they were
digging it and they started digging it,

1012
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,310
when you stood up and you were digging,
they start shooting at us.

1013
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,650
And then we just rain hell. And, um, we
dug in and after about a month of that,

1014
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:44,810
we just were killing so many. They just
gave it up. They're like, all right,

1015
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:48,830
we're done. Um, and that's where
we, I mean, we can't, they came out,

1016
00:59:48,831 --> 00:59:52,930
we were black on water and then like
the brass came out. They're like, well,

1017
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,250
why don't you guys shaven? Where's
your haircuts? I'm like, Hey,

1018
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,860
we didn't have water. Are you
kidding me right now, bro?

1019
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,410
And then at the same sergeant,
you're yelling for my pants.

1020
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:04,640
They wanted to go up to cop. So my platoon
sergeants like, hey, sergeant middles,

1021
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:06,620
I need you. Can you take one
of your teams and just go?

1022
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:10,520
So we took four men out and I walked them
right over what I thought the road was

1023
01:00:10,521 --> 01:00:11,091
clear,
you know,

1024
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:14,720
but it was all filled with water when
we took the place walking more huge IUTs

1025
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,510
that just the batteries had died in them
cause they waited, we waited too long.

1026
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,540
But when they're dried up,
like, oh, there's a mortar.
Oh look at that. That's it.

1027
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:24,410
That's 18 mine and triple stack,
you know? Um, but anyways,

1028
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:26,570
side would like took them up on top of
the [inaudible] and stuff like that.

1029
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,510
And it was funny because as they're
yelling at us for not being shaven or

1030
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:30,344
cleaned up,

1031
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,200
I go according to the way up this just
like a hundred yards probably like I'm a

1032
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:37,190
straight up and I go up a quarter of
the way with them and I said, all right,

1033
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,820
I'll be right back. So I run to the
top and I'd say, Hey Lt, you know,

1034
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:44,000
the sergeant major is coming up in
the kernel so just be ready, you know,

1035
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:46,490
sort of like trying to put our uniforms
on and everything instead of like just

1036
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:49,490
our tee shirts. And I run back down
and he's bear calling. He said,

1037
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,230
sounds like I can't do it. I'm
like, no, eat your midnight child.

1038
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,650
Childless us alone. How about
that? Are you kidding me?

1039
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:00,890
Did he make it to the OPI? He made
it up to the top. He did eventually.

1040
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,230
And I'm like, but I came back down. I
kind of put a little bit of fear in him.

1041
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:06,710
I said, sergeant major, this is not the
spot that you want to stop right there,

1042
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:09,320
that town that's Taliban held
anybody in that town's shoots at us.

1043
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,490
And if they see that we're not moving
quick, they're going to take pop shots.

1044
01:01:13,491 --> 01:01:16,550
So you're gonna need to, yeah, I mean
mostly true. Yeah. And he's like,

1045
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,800
he was like sitting down and looking
and I was like, no, no, no, no.

1046
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:22,370
You need to need to move. Sorry to
make you need to go. And I mean,

1047
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:25,100
and no offense to Nebraska,
it wasn't even my sergeant major.

1048
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:26,640
I don't think that was there at the time.

1049
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:30,400
It was like a different unit or whatever.
But, but yeah, I mean it was, it was a,

1050
01:01:30,401 --> 01:01:33,480
it was a wild, wild west. We were just
shooting, um, firefights everyday,

1051
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:37,050
but we were the northern limit, you know,
there was no buddy farther posts, uh,

1052
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,790
push to than us. Yeah. I want one
part. You're talking about how you,

1053
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:45,930
you ended up shooting 11 javelins
in, in a day, I think. Yeah. That's,

1054
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,460
that's getting after it on pretty
much anyone's standards. Yeah.

1055
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:53,750
I think we shot 29, that whole
deployment. Um, it was, it was cool.

1056
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:59,630
Damn. Um, so you conventional
army can be fun. Yeah.

1057
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,433
Yeah.

1058
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:05,240
Do the conventional army we were within
Ramadi were freaking getting after it

1059
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:09,650
every single day is, they
were awesome. Awesome. Um,

1060
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:15,530
like you were getting in a firefight
everyday there, huh? Um, or for a bit.

1061
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:19,380
There we were and then it died right down.
They were just tired because you know,

1062
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,130
once they shot once

1063
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:24,120
we just, we let loose. We had enough
ammo to, to last us for years probably

1064
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,630
and we let them know we'd let them know.
Yeah.

1065
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:32,100
America's real cool when it comes to ammo.
Yeah. In those situations it's like, oh,

1066
01:02:32,101 --> 01:02:36,580
you guys need more. Yeah,
we'll be right there. Uh,

1067
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:41,730
all right. You are. Yeah. Seem to
happen. You were like, you were like,

1068
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,160
did you find you found triple
stacked ids in your position? Yeah.

1069
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:51,690
So dumbest thing ever. We went in and we
cleared it and then we had like marines,

1070
01:02:51,691 --> 01:02:53,550
EOD,
like Marsac EOD clear stuff.

1071
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:57,570
Like there was like an unexploded RPG
round in the side of one in the walls.

1072
01:02:57,571 --> 01:03:01,230
And then there was other booby traps
while it turns out where we were rolling

1073
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:04,920
all of our big barrels for the
generator and stuff like that was like,

1074
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:08,460
it was all bootstrapped, right. We're
exactly where we step. And this guy,

1075
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:11,700
Sergeant Barton, he's a great guy. He,
there's this metal out of the ground.

1076
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:15,060
He's like, Huh, what's that?
Starts beating on it with
a shovel. And I'm going,

1077
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:19,710
I'm getting ready to go on my rnr Tang
and like, what are you doing dude?

1078
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:22,320
Cause like some in the ground here,
just looking,

1079
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,800
looking at it and started digging around.
He's like, oh, oh that's not oh shit.

1080
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:30,600
And then it turns out we were on these
50 gallon drums taking all this supplies.

1081
01:03:30,601 --> 01:03:33,300
Oh, right over top, right in the
breezeway. God is where I would.

1082
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:38,040
So it was so hot there. And uh, I mean I
get I racks out too, but it was so hot.

1083
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:42,020
Like me and my buddy who was on
my, uh, team, uh, leaders, um,

1084
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,480
would go out there and spare ourselves
as water. Bobby being our PT shorts,

1085
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,390
sprays out of the water bottle,

1086
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,790
lay on our cots and just
see how long it took to dry.

1087
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,830
Usually about 10 to 15
minutes to get completely dry.

1088
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:54,510
And our costs were right on
top of these just and no,

1089
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:57,090
I do cause I mean EOD came
through and they didn't find it.

1090
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,740
So was it,

1091
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:01,350
you figure it was like a command debt
that had the battery died or something?

1092
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:05,800
Uh, it was uh, yeah, well it was
um, a pressure plates. Oh my XO.

1093
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:09,220
Like these big drums were having the
circuit connect but the batteries and I'm

1094
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:13,400
dying, you know. Luckily we didn't take
the property to, you know, after like the,

1095
01:04:13,401 --> 01:04:15,920
I think after the march
that guy's got hit. Um,

1096
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:18,790
they went in there and booby trapped at
all knowing that we were trying to take

1097
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:21,130
it,
but somehow the batteries didn't work,

1098
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:22,990
which helped out for us because we like,

1099
01:04:22,991 --> 01:04:26,440
we jumped over a rock wall that they had
where there's like a hole in the wall

1100
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:30,790
ready from probably a hell
fire or something from time
before. So right where we,

1101
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:32,500
you know, obviously be easy
place for us to jump over.

1102
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:35,920
That's where we all jumped over and
there was stuff stack there too. So

1103
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,170
it's where you talk about
it in here. Um, and,

1104
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:41,710
and I heard this from the Vietnam seals.

1105
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:46,950
They would set up ambushes
on VC and they would,

1106
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,690
you know, go, okay, we're going to shoot
from here and when we shoot from here,

1107
01:04:49,691 --> 01:04:51,420
they're going to take cover
over here behind this lock.

1108
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:54,720
So they'd put a big claim or one
underneath that log and there you're,

1109
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:58,660
you're talking about how the Taliban
is doing the same thing over there. Um,

1110
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,430
you know, basically, oh, we, as
soon as we start shooting at them,

1111
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:02,860
they're going to run to
these covered positions.

1112
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:05,830
So we'll just put booby traps your
minds in any of these covered positions.

1113
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,020
Yeah, we actually had
to change up our, uh,

1114
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:11,140
slps are standing operating procedures
on my third deployment and instead of

1115
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,910
diving for cover, you had to
take a knee. Yeah, that's,

1116
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:16,180
that's what I was reading it. I was
just, that's what it reminded me of.

1117
01:05:16,181 --> 01:05:18,040
It reminded me of that's,
that's what

1118
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:23,310
my predecessors in the seal teams in
Vietnam would do to the enemy and now the

1119
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:28,030
enemy was doing it to us or to
you guys. It's really scary. Um,

1120
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:31,870
this is, this is an interesting spot.
You're heading home for leave. From there,

1121
01:05:31,871 --> 01:05:35,110
I left in May and caught series of
connecting flights home to America.

1122
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,980
I gave Kelsey a huge kiss at the airport
in Dallas and when I got back to the

1123
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:42,400
house, gave our dog buddy a big
hug. It felt great to be back,

1124
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,660
but it also felt surreal. And this is
the strange part of this leave time.

1125
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:48,970
I didn't quite know
what to do with myself.

1126
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,400
I could take a hot
shower anytime I wanted.

1127
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:53,860
I could sit on the couch
and play video games.

1128
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,580
I could drink a beer and eat a
cheeseburger outside on the back porch.

1129
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:00,820
Nobody was shooting at me.
Nobody stunk.

1130
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:03,160
Nobody was sleeping on triple stacked.

1131
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:07,870
IDDS Kelsey was finishing up the
semester with college and work.

1132
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:11,110
So I bought a truck and we drove
up to Michigan to see my parents.

1133
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,920
We had a few bright and happy days
with them than it was soon time to go.

1134
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:17,470
Just like that,
I hugged my parents,

1135
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:21,970
gave Kelsey a big kiss and flew out
to Detroit to head back overseas.

1136
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,600
It felt oddly good to
be back to Afghanistan.

1137
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:29,140
The feeling is difficult
to explain in America.

1138
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,560
When I'd hung around with some friends
in Dallas and got reacquainted with some

1139
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:34,510
of my buddies from high
school back in Michigan,

1140
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:38,470
I'd seen firsthand hand how
most of the people my age lived.

1141
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,560
If a dude who's 22 or 23 like me,

1142
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,550
he was usually finishing up college or
hanging out trying to find an internship

1143
01:06:45,551 --> 01:06:46,840
or an entry level job.

1144
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:51,010
He might be living in his parents'
basement trying to scrape together enough

1145
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:51,910
money to move out,

1146
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:56,260
or maybe he was partying hard on
weekends or maybe still in a frat.

1147
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,800
He was almost always short on money.

1148
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,440
Almost always wondering
what to do with his future.

1149
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,110
Not that there was anything wrong with
any of that guy's got to do what a guy's

1150
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:10,060
got to do. But by contrast,
at my age in the military,

1151
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:13,450
I lead people in combat.
I controlled firefights.

1152
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,270
I handled hundreds of thousands
of dollars worth of equipment.

1153
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:21,490
I made decisions that affected whether
people would live or die. It felt real.

1154
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:27,160
On a personal level. I made decent money.
I was married, I had a good credit score.

1155
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,080
I was thinking of buying a house soon.

1156
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,590
It felt good to be trusted
with this much responsibility.

1157
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:38,320
I was proud of my drive and sense of
accomplishment. I was already a man.

1158
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:46,390
I think statements like that are
like what? Get kids or if I say kids,

1159
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:49,560
but like when I meet kids, like
I've just met at, at this uh,

1160
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,880
event we were just at in this,
you know, he's like, Hey,

1161
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:53,290
I'm 19 I just joined the Marine Corps.

1162
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:58,291
I'm leaving September 18th and that
statements like that is what I think makes

1163
01:07:58,901 --> 01:07:59,734
people do in the middle of,

1164
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:03,400
it gets a lot of people that joined the
military like 22 years old. Oh yeah,

1165
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,310
you're getting paid.
You've got a steady job.

1166
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:10,510
Your job is more meaningful than any
job they could have. I mean, nevermind,

1167
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:14,230
maybe they're working in fast
food, right? Like I did. You don't,

1168
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,310
never mind that they're working Wendy's.
Even

1169
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:18,620
if they have a kick ass job somewhere,
it doesn't matter.

1170
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:21,920
Your job is more meaningful because you're
a soldier fighting for freedom. Yeah.

1171
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:23,210
And they would,
you know,

1172
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:25,610
you'd go back home and you see what
they're doing and you're like, wow,

1173
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:29,940
my life to change. You know? And I'm
like, I'm going to Afghanistan. Uh,

1174
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,190
I got married, I have an apartment. I'd,
you know, I'd have two cars or whatever.

1175
01:08:34,191 --> 01:08:37,470
And it's at that young of an age, I
mean, and my friends back home, they,

1176
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,470
they were still a really nice,
and you know,

1177
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:40,520
I still get along with
them and everything.

1178
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:43,650
I just felt like what I was doing
was, was a different purpose. And,

1179
01:08:43,651 --> 01:08:45,710
and I was trusted with more things.
I mean,

1180
01:08:45,711 --> 01:08:47,810
when you're in college and everybody's
like, Oh, you're a kid in college,

1181
01:08:47,811 --> 01:08:50,450
but when you're in the army and
you're like, oh, you're in the army,

1182
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:52,080
you're on your second deployment,
you know,

1183
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:56,780
what do you do it while I'm in charge
of seven other lives is included as well

1184
01:08:56,781 --> 01:08:59,090
as my own. And I tell them
where to move, what to do,

1185
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:02,900
how to shoot and how to do things.
And they're like, oh, okay, yeah,

1186
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:07,070
I'll get some kid in the gym. They might
jam, will be like, oh yeah, well you know,

1187
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,530
well I'm only 23 and I'll,
oh yeah,

1188
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,080
when I was at 23,000 my
third seal platoon killed.

1189
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,450
Actually we weren't, we were drinking
beers because there was nothing going on.

1190
01:09:17,451 --> 01:09:22,190
But anyway, still in Budweiser
killing Budweiser, like a beast. Um,

1191
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:26,540
so then how did you feel about that
two weeks of leave during the middle of

1192
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:29,450
deployment? Well, I mean, it's a constant
worry. Like, how am my guys doing?

1193
01:09:29,451 --> 01:09:32,210
We all had a satellite phone, we didn't
have internet or things like that,

1194
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:35,840
so I couldn't just be like, hit him up
real quick. On a, because the army is,

1195
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:40,330
makes you do that well, yeah, yeah.
They, they allow it and then they,

1196
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:42,920
they say you need, you know this
stuff. But they're pretty, aren't they?

1197
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:45,540
Don't they push it
pretty hard? No, I mean,

1198
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:51,470
well that's uh, and I, and I don't
just, uh, I don't discriminate.

1199
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:53,420
I don't know how to say this
politically correct. There's,

1200
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:58,450
there's the army that's at Bagram air
force base that wears PT belts that,

1201
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,840
you know,
goes to Dunkin,

1202
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,840
goes and gets her Dunkin donuts and that
complaints because not a lot of taste

1203
01:10:03,841 --> 01:10:06,260
to hot. And then there's the
people like us where it's like,

1204
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:11,030
there's 22 of us are 21 of us sitting out
in middle of nowhere taking no showers.

1205
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:12,860
No one's going to come say,
hey, you need to do this.

1206
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:15,620
We had one kid come out and I
ran into him again and Lansing,

1207
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:17,960
Michigan actually had an event,
you know, out of the military.

1208
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,980
And I didn't realize it was him, but he
came out, he chose to be a financial, um,

1209
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,950
guy, unless it is in the financial
world and that's fine. Hey,

1210
01:10:24,951 --> 01:10:28,400
you want to do finance or you want work
on the s four shop great comes out.

1211
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,181
They're given a survey,

1212
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:32,150
some dumb survey that they're
just whatever big army wants,

1213
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:33,800
you know the good idea,
fairies or whatever.

1214
01:10:33,801 --> 01:10:36,840
But he's on the rooftop and he's like,
Oh man, I hope we get in a gun fight.

1215
01:10:36,841 --> 01:10:40,550
It's going to be great and look over and
say excuse me. And he's like, well no,

1216
01:10:40,551 --> 01:10:43,700
I just, you know, cause I, I'm on the
five all the time. I just, I love,

1217
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,090
I want to see a gun, you know, I
hope we get in a firefight. I said,

1218
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:49,250
w what don't you get if they shoot at us,

1219
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:52,570
my guys could get hit for
what you're hoping happens
here. I said, I got an idea,

1220
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:56,600
get off my roof. And he's like,
well, I said, no, seriously get,

1221
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,730
I'm going to throw you off this roof.
You don't get off it.

1222
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:02,660
And he looked at a critter. When am
I when a guys and criticals, oh no,

1223
01:11:02,661 --> 01:11:05,170
sergeant mills is real. He'll throw
you off this room. And I said,

1224
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:08,090
if we get shot at,
don't get my guys, wait,

1225
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:12,890
stay the fuck off the roof and get down.
And he was just like, but I don't get it.

1226
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:16,290
I'm like, it's not a game.
This isn't, I mean, when we
get in a firefight, you know,

1227
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:17,180
we get,
you know,

1228
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,790
people run up on their PT shorts and their
flip flops and they got the Kevlar on

1229
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,860
their body armor.
But I mean that's real.

1230
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:25,170
I bullets are flying and the
way he was just so nonchalant.

1231
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,790
I hope we get a firefight.
That'd be really cool.

1232
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:30,300
It's like my guys could get shot. Like
what, what part of cool don't you get?

1233
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,760
So I mean the, the, you know,
the army does push something to,

1234
01:11:33,761 --> 01:11:38,080
but other times were just left alone.
Yeah. I just remember guys going from La,

1235
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,910
from guys that were in combat
all the time, not fobbing but,

1236
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,400
and they did seem like the command,

1237
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:47,310
their commands wanted him to go home
for those two weeks and hey man,

1238
01:11:47,311 --> 01:11:49,890
you need to take this break on
the leaves. Mandatory. Yeah.

1239
01:11:49,891 --> 01:11:52,220
I thought you meant like calling home,
calling home stuff's not man.

1240
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:55,530
[inaudible] going home. Sorry. Yeah, yeah.
You have to go home. You have to go. Okay.

1241
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:58,170
That's what I thought in a lot of guys.
Some guys don't want to, but you have to,

1242
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:01,080
you know the call home
thing I think is is,

1243
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,740
I don't know how often you called home,
but I tried to call him like once a week.

1244
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,260
Once or twice a week.
Because if you start doing more than that,

1245
01:12:07,261 --> 01:12:10,720
I think it's worse on both before you run
out of things to say, oh, that's cool.

1246
01:12:10,721 --> 01:12:13,560
What's going, you know, for,
I mean, no offense to anybody
who loved life out there,

1247
01:12:13,561 --> 01:12:17,720
but in my wife and I get along great, you
know? But when I would call home, hey,

1248
01:12:17,721 --> 01:12:19,770
were you doing well? I just know today
in Afghanistan, I don't want to be like,

1249
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:21,360
well,
I was out now I got shot at,

1250
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:24,320
and then I ended up killing two people
and then this guy got hurt. But it's,

1251
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,090
it's okay, he's going to be fine.
Don't worry about dates, you know?

1252
01:12:27,091 --> 01:12:29,490
She can't say that Kinda stuff like, oh
well, you know, I went on patrol today,

1253
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:33,300
got to help with help a kid tie his
shoe, you know, and like that gets old.

1254
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,260
And then what'd you do?
Well,

1255
01:12:34,261 --> 01:12:36,700
I went to school today and I mean
there's no real story there, right?

1256
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:40,570
So you got to let it build for
a week or two. You know, I,

1257
01:12:40,571 --> 01:12:44,210
I definitely recommend that. I mean
that in the nicest way. I know. Totally.

1258
01:12:44,211 --> 01:12:48,390
And I think if you're, if you're calling
home every day, then you're like,

1259
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:52,140
you're missing it. You're
connecting and just like, no,
like you said, let it build,

1260
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:55,800
have something to talk about Rio and
cause then it gets annoying. Like, well,

1261
01:12:55,801 --> 01:13:00,030
what are you thinking about? And then
you get, you know, I see it happen. I,

1262
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:03,300
you know, I even say I, it happened
to me and Kelsey, um, you know, like,

1263
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:04,800
what are you thinking about?
Whoa. No. Are you thinking,

1264
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:06,690
what do you want to talk
about? Well, I don't know. Oh,

1265
01:13:06,691 --> 01:13:09,180
you got nothing to talk to me
about. It's like, well, no, I don't.

1266
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:12,090
And it's not a bad thing. It's not that
I love you any less, it's that literally,

1267
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:14,880
I can't tell you what happened here
because it's not going to make you feel

1268
01:13:14,881 --> 01:13:17,700
better about the situation.
So you know,

1269
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:20,930
another thing is,
you know,

1270
01:13:20,931 --> 01:13:23,550
you got all this stuff going
on and the new website,

1271
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,110
you won't believe this and you're
like, what? And she's like, um,

1272
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:32,010
we lost that library book that we got
out and now they called and they want us

1273
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:36,000
to pay for it. And you're like, it just
got the check was getting the check.

1274
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:39,750
We're going to be good. Are they
overcharging? I mean, do your research,

1275
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:45,230
you find it online cheaper.
Yeah.

1276
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:50,400
Yeah. Some of the big, the big, yeah,
the big trauma drama at home, you know,

1277
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:53,370
they're wide eyed. Like,
oh no. It's like, okay,

1278
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:56,200
well I watched the guy bleeding nose
bleed out today and put my finger on a

1279
01:13:56,201 --> 01:14:00,270
bullet holes, so I get what you're saying.
The same thing. I was like, Whoa, my God,

1280
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:04,650
can you believe this? But you go ahead.
Tell me about what happened with you.

1281
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:07,860
Tell you, tell me about the spoiled by
mandates that you had on your sandwich.

1282
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,980
MMM. Oh, that's no joke.
That's awful. You get home

1283
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,790
from that deployment. Going back to the
book, my parents flew down from Michigan,

1284
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:19,710
Josh and Deanna, this is your,
Josh is your brother-in-law. DNS.

1285
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,440
His wife were there and some of
the guys from my unit came over.

1286
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:27,550
I manned the barbecue smell of charcoal,
fired hamburgers,

1287
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:30,820
drifted over the neighborhood,
and I felt like the luckiest man alive.

1288
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,840
Kelsey and I had a dog,
two cars and now a house.

1289
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:38,050
We were young family
living the American dream.

1290
01:14:38,051 --> 01:14:40,070
So you had the goal of Vine House and
now you actually bought one, right?

1291
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:42,750
Power of attorney. I called my wife
and she's like, guess what I did today?

1292
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,390
I was like, what? She goes,
I bought a house. I'm like,
how'd you do that? She's like,

1293
01:14:45,391 --> 01:14:49,470
well, you bought it on that piece of
paper. I'm attorney. So speaking of jokes,

1294
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,200
I tell every time I talk
get there. But uh, no.

1295
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:54,780
We bought a house and then my brother
in law, he was, they had a young,

1296
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:59,520
a young child. They still do Reagan,
but at the time she was like seven,

1297
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:02,460
eight months old I guess.
And it's like you drink at night Josh,

1298
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:04,920
because I have responsibility,
you know, like, oh I'm,

1299
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,110
I'm all holier than thou or
something like I can't drink.

1300
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,230
And then by the end of the
night he passed out in the fire.

1301
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,790
Junk is can be smoked a pack, a snack.
He doesn't even smoke cigarettes,

1302
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:15,000
smoke cigarettes,
trying to wake him up.

1303
01:15:15,001 --> 01:15:18,060
He's in a fire ant here on my
backyard like, oh, that hurts so bad.

1304
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:23,160
And then I was like responsibilities,
famous last words

1305
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:26,390
back to them

1306
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:27,680
book.
Fortunately after I got home,

1307
01:15:27,681 --> 01:15:30,770
I didn't struggle with any past
memories of combat. Although I do,

1308
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,780
I know any number of soldiers who do.

1309
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:35,510
I told a few stories to
Kelsey about our units,

1310
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:40,511
time and row and BMG about going without
a shower for so long and about some

1311
01:15:40,581 --> 01:15:43,130
firefights.
We got into an impala and corvette,

1312
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:47,630
but she didn't like to talk about those
things much and I understood that.

1313
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,170
I found I could shut off
the memory's pretty easily.

1314
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:55,820
My logic was straightforward. I was
a combat soldier. That's what I did.

1315
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:59,930
I told my mind to go to certain places
and I refuse to allow it to go to other

1316
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:03,590
places. I found that I could connect
with my family best that way.

1317
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,660
Although I know other guys handled
things differently with equal success.

1318
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:12,800
And the reason I threw that in there,
it's just cause you know,

1319
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:15,790
I get a lot of guys that
asked me about how to handle

1320
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,450
the, the whatever memories
that are bringing it home.

1321
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:21,900
And I thought that was a pretty
good methodology man. Like, okay,

1322
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:23,700
I'm not going to think about
that right now. Yeah. I mean I,

1323
01:16:23,701 --> 01:16:25,540
it wasn't like I had a barrier. Um, you,

1324
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:28,800
you're just so desensitized when
you're over there. Like, um,

1325
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:30,030
I'm pretty sure the book talks about it,

1326
01:16:30,031 --> 01:16:33,420
but we went out on patrol and then when
the a and a guys or amp was wearing a

1327
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:35,670
bright green, you know, uh,

1328
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:39,990
like a construction vest and now we're
all in the getting ready to load up in

1329
01:16:39,991 --> 01:16:43,260
the trucks. And someone made the joke,
I think it was me or maybe creator,

1330
01:16:43,261 --> 01:16:45,240
but either way, we're like, well
that guy's going to get shot today.

1331
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:46,103
Cause he stood out,

1332
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,940
ended up being the only guy that was
shot that day and he ended up dying,

1333
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,710
you know, eventually from his wounds.
But she's like, oh well he got he. Yup,

1334
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:55,140
that guy died. But you're just, you
don't say it like hoping to get shot,

1335
01:16:55,141 --> 01:16:57,990
but you're just like, whoa. That's
part of what happens. But, uh,

1336
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:00,360
she didn't like hearing my stories
of the combat and things like that.

1337
01:17:00,361 --> 01:17:02,190
So I was just like, well, I guess
I won't talk about him. She's like,

1338
01:17:02,191 --> 01:17:04,980
you just get so excited about telling
those stories and you laugh about it and

1339
01:17:04,981 --> 01:17:09,260
it's real serious. I'm like, well,
I made it like, you know, well,

1340
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:10,280
you still snap in action.

1341
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:15,260
I was driving in my house with my buddy
and we went past the firing range and

1342
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:20,180
they opened up the two forties and like
I hit the brakes, contact, right contact,

1343
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:22,750
right. And I pull over and me and
him are both reaching for our,

1344
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,170
our m four is we're supposed to be next to
us. We're like, oh Yo, I made a minivan.

1345
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:32,960
It was a Chevy impala for
me. It wasn't anywhere.

1346
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:37,550
That's beautiful. I haven't been even,
I love it. Oh, speaking of minivans,

1347
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:39,620
you found out you're, you're, uh,

1348
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,410
going to be a daddy at this point to
when you came home from your second

1349
01:17:42,411 --> 01:17:44,750
deployment. Oh no, that'd be awful.
If I came second appointment,

1350
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:47,850
if I was gonna be a day, it
took us a little while. Oh Wow.

1351
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:51,200
Four months after I got back to find
out we're gonna. Yeah. Right on. Yeah.

1352
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,790
I guess confused. I wasn't home. I wasn't,
I wasn't trying to imply anything. Yeah.

1353
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:00,620
But we, uh, yeah, so, uh, I
didn't plan on it right away.
Um, you know, having children,

1354
01:18:00,621 --> 01:18:05,030
but found out we were going to have
children or have a daughter and worked out

1355
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:07,970
great. You know, I'm very excited.
Did the whole nesting thing.

1356
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,960
My wife had a sweet Mazda three hatchback
would love testing thing. You know,

1357
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:14,050
like you said the baby room
up, get everything. Oh yeah.

1358
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,120
I could tell my wife because I bought
her a brand new car in 2010 it was brand

1359
01:18:17,121 --> 01:18:20,780
new off the line Mazda three hatchback.
She loves it. I loved it. And I was like,

1360
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:23,270
that baby, she's not gonna fit in
that car. And she was like, yeah,

1361
01:18:23,271 --> 01:18:27,020
it's going to be fine. I'm like, no,
it's not. Finally I got so mad one day,

1362
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:28,640
like after arguing with her about it,

1363
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,800
I went up there and I popped
the car seat in and say,

1364
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:32,540
go ahead and jump into Jerry
driver's seat, honey, go ahead.

1365
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,850
Jump in there and she couldn't fit in.
She's like, Oh, just get rid of it. Then.

1366
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:40,250
She was so mad. I loved every second
of, you know, cause then I won.

1367
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:44,190
I won that game. Right. You
were right. That feels good. Um,

1368
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,600
I got you off topic. Sorry.
Yeah, we're going to have a kid.

1369
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,680
I'm straight on topic of way tight on
topic over here. I know you're, yeah,

1370
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:57,050
well you're a professional. I
didn't doubt that. Uh, September 27,

1371
01:18:57,051 --> 01:19:00,500
2011, our daughter was born. Wow.

1372
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,020
I made some weird noises
in the back of my throat.

1373
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:08,900
There are kid was with Goo all over her
and she was wrinkly and scrunched up and

1374
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:12,440
all I could think of that. She was
the most beautiful thing in the world.

1375
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:15,290
It's so great to cry.

1376
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:20,530
The nurse said I didn't know how to cry
so I just kept making weird noises in my

1377
01:19:21,111 --> 01:19:25,790
throat is awkward. I was like, nurses
like it's okay, it's okay to cry,

1378
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:28,760
Mr. Mills. I'm like
cry. And I'm like, whew.

1379
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:34,220
That was weird in the side. He's
like, this guy's taking this kid home.

1380
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:36,170
I mean almost fought the
pediatrician that day

1381
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:40,610
they were talking about Belgium beer or
some damn thing and like I hear the two

1382
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:43,400
doctors talking and my kids in there
crying and the nurse comes out say, hey,

1383
01:19:43,401 --> 01:19:46,460
who suppose to be looking at my kid?
And they're like, oh doctor this you,

1384
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:49,070
he has a baby in there cause I don't
have one in there. And she goes,

1385
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:51,410
you must have a guy goes,
huh? I almost forgot. Huh?

1386
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:53,900
And chuckles it off and then
goes back talk. And I told her,

1387
01:19:53,901 --> 01:19:56,240
I said get that kid back in that room.
And I turned around and that guy,

1388
01:19:56,241 --> 01:19:57,530
and I'm already up like you know,

1389
01:19:57,531 --> 01:20:01,700
1820 hours cause we went into labor and
do so whatever and eyes are bloodshot

1390
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:05,750
and I'm just like still jack from
lifting weights and I'm like, you know,

1391
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:08,100
you're not going to look at my kid,
find a better pediatrician.

1392
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,220
And the guy's like, and I had to go
get calcium element in the in. She was,

1393
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:13,730
they were very nice when they,
I don't know,

1394
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,530
I don't know why I'm
towering over this guy.

1395
01:20:16,531 --> 01:20:19,710
Like I will beat you if you touch my kid.
You're not doing your job bro.

1396
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:22,650
Now let me put her in the car.

1397
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:27,090
So you'd take her home and we get home
and my mother in law's with us and we're

1398
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:30,510
looking at in Kelsey [inaudible] she was,
why she not buckled as a damn man.

1399
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:33,970
I thought you did. She was trapped. I
thought you did it strike, you know,

1400
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,220
direct on for my kid.

1401
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:38,820
Good Dad award number one coming out of
the gates coming out of the gates strong.

1402
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:43,350
I picked fail 45 minute drive, no car or
no buckled. Garcia. I'm a good driver,

1403
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:47,550
so that's good. Luckily, uh, and meanwhile
this time you're still a soldier.

1404
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:47,970
You go to,

1405
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:52,970
you go to a jump master school and you
failed jump master school the first time

1406
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:58,110
I did any, did the sad part, it wasn't
like the j Npi or you guys jump masters.

1407
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:03,180
Did you fail the written exam?
That reading is fundamental.

1408
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:06,480
What that academic um,
part of jump master school,

1409
01:21:06,481 --> 01:21:10,030
I've heard that's the most brutal part.
It was rough. It was rough. And uh,

1410
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:13,710
I feel I failed that and everyone's like,
oh, you must be a dumb ass. I'm like,

1411
01:21:13,711 --> 01:21:16,700
I am. But I went back
the next week, you know,

1412
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:20,900
the next cycle and I ended up through,
you know, I thought it was cool in here.

1413
01:21:20,901 --> 01:21:25,260
You talked about, um, you know, one
kid you threw out the plane. Yeah,

1414
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:29,940
yeah. I get another kid. You kicked
out of the plane. They were fine. Yeah.

1415
01:21:29,941 --> 01:21:31,620
And that's the thing, they
can't win. Thank you later.

1416
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:34,340
Cause they're just like scared. Right?
I'm not sure if they made it on,

1417
01:21:34,341 --> 01:21:39,300
I don't know really well in the
whole book that you made up here.

1418
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:43,260
Yeah. And claimed most
fabricated look. Uh No. Yeah.

1419
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:47,610
So I give them a brief and I they always
made the youngest or the like the least

1420
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,580
senior guy give the brief.
And so like you tell him the brief,

1421
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:53,190
if you know I say green light go and
you don't go give you the orchard more

1422
01:21:53,191 --> 01:21:56,810
times. If you don't jump out we'll unhook
you, attach you, give you all four.

1423
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:57,930
And I'll such equipment though,
you know,

1424
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,690
say go to the real
paratroopers or whatever.

1425
01:21:59,691 --> 01:22:02,930
It's what I know jumper is that when
it's called a name for it. Yeah.

1426
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:04,660
A jump refusal jump refusal.
That's right.

1427
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:08,700
So yeah cause then that military term pro.
Oh yeah. And then as I'd say my brief,

1428
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:10,410
your, this is all three
pages you got to memorize.

1429
01:22:10,411 --> 01:22:11,610
That stopped my brief right there and say,

1430
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:16,290
but I guarantee you today if you're on
my door you are going. So I told the guy,

1431
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:17,910
you know,
green light go.

1432
01:22:17,911 --> 01:22:20,300
And like the first guy went the
second I went there and guy went,

1433
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:21,330
fourth guy or whatever,

1434
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:25,410
then I'll go and then finally I get to
like 13 or 14 I supposed to exit all,

1435
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:29,840
you know, 30 paratroopers are 32,
whatever. Uh, and this guy's like froze.

1436
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:30,600
And I'm like,

1437
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,360
I know you think you're not going to
go but you better jump off this plane.

1438
01:22:33,361 --> 01:22:36,300
And he was like, you know, and I
said, I told you you were going.

1439
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:39,480
And then back with shirt back was pants.
I just throw them out.

1440
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:42,040
And then the person behind was like,
I'm like getting going there.

1441
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:46,250
And then another jump, the
same thing happened. I said,
I told you you were going,

1442
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:50,130
he's, they're frozen the door like in one
foot back. And I just grab the top of,

1443
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:51,690
oh, sorry. I backed up,
grab the top of the plane.

1444
01:22:51,691 --> 01:22:54,210
I just kicked right in the back of
his parachute out the door. He went,

1445
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:59,130
I was like, we'd hear those rumors,
but I never saw it happen. I mean,

1446
01:22:59,190 --> 01:22:59,941
if they don't jump,

1447
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,640
they're going to lose money and then
they're going to waste a good pass and end

1448
01:23:02,641 --> 01:23:04,100
up playing.
Either can go back around,

1449
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:07,360
make another pass and like prolong
everybody's night and make it harder.

1450
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,720
Because I haven't personally
gotta do paperwork on now,
which I don't like to do.

1451
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:13,660
Or you can barely write.
Yeah. What I understand.

1452
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:18,150
So why no right hand so please be right
handed. So we expect, but that's cool.

1453
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:22,520
Take tape folks to me with
like, um, but, but yeah,

1454
01:23:22,521 --> 01:23:25,960
I mean I saw it was just fear got the
best of them and I just was like, no,

1455
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:27,660
we're going today. And you're, you know,

1456
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:29,620
I said some other choice words
in their ear, but they went.

1457
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:34,480
But what I liked about that from like a
broader perspective than just airborne

1458
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:38,410
school is like so often, man, people just
need to like go. Cause like you said,

1459
01:23:38,411 --> 01:23:40,390
once you go and you get that
first thing under your belt,

1460
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:42,640
then can they go and they jump.
It's no problem. You know,

1461
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:44,410
but so often people or
did they just hesitate,

1462
01:23:44,450 --> 01:23:47,380
they're just scared of the unknown. You
know, and what you gotta do is just go,

1463
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:52,420
just jump. Well, my fit
jumping airborne school back,
I was, you know, Pv two mills,

1464
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:56,020
I jumped out and it was nighttime
combat was so scared. I know what to do,

1465
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:58,990
but I was like, I'm not going to be the
big sissy on this airplane, you know.

1466
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:03,550
So I dove out like Superman and I got
my left leg caught up in the risers.

1467
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:04,384
I was coming down like a,

1468
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:09,420
like a flamingo and my shoot started
collapse on me and I was shaking my,

1469
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:12,040
I was falling fastener,
but I pull my reserve. You,

1470
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:15,820
you pulled your reserve and everyone cool.
Yeah, no kid. They were mad about that.

1471
01:24:15,821 --> 01:24:19,570
Oh yeah. But I was dropping fast and I
guess you survived, which is a good thing.

1472
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:21,880
Yeah. Yeah. But my leg
was tangled up so bad.

1473
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:24,100
Send the first jump in
division and I'm like, oh,

1474
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,090
I don't know if I want to do this anymore.

1475
01:24:25,091 --> 01:24:28,210
And then the guy in front of me went
and I was like, well, okay. He did it.

1476
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:31,870
That's, yeah, that's not
good to have, uh, uh,

1477
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:35,500
have to pull your reserve and
airborne school. Um, but I mean,

1478
01:24:35,501 --> 01:24:37,450
it wasn't because of a malfunction.
It's cause my own stupidity.

1479
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,670
I dove out like you see
with me on my left leg,

1480
01:24:39,671 --> 01:24:41,350
got caught up in there and
I couldn't shake it out.

1481
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,690
And then I was hit like watching
the silhouettes above me,

1482
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:47,830
like boilers are of
males. I'm like, okay, um,

1483
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:49,660
you pick up,
he's six,

1484
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:55,300
so now you're now you're staff
sergeant take over a weapons squad,

1485
01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:01,540
which is a senior spot. But I was, I went
to work that day on the, I got picked,

1486
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:05,980
finished all ALC or whatever.
Um, and which is e six course.

1487
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,130
I went to my first started,
said I have offers and you know,

1488
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:11,320
second first brigade a five away and I'm,
I'm going to take those.

1489
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:13,220
I don't have a squad leader spot.
You know,

1490
01:25:13,221 --> 01:25:16,320
when I get back from this four
day vacation or four day break,

1491
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,440
I came back and gave me the senior
spot. Here. He goes, Oh yes.

1492
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,740
Uh, and Kelsey, she didn't really want
you to go overseas again. Did she?

1493
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:31,660
I mean, yes and no. She understood it,
but I mean obviously no wife wants to,

1494
01:25:31,661 --> 01:25:33,850
their loved one to go overseas
or their husbands go overseas,

1495
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:37,390
but we just bought a house. The
baby was just born. Quite frankly,

1496
01:25:37,391 --> 01:25:38,110
we could have used,

1497
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:42,100
we could use the tax free money 100% could
use the money that you get from being

1498
01:25:42,101 --> 01:25:46,030
over there and also we have the soldiers
come to my house and have barbecues and

1499
01:25:46,031 --> 01:25:49,150
she sees how they look up to me and
how I'm in charge of them and it's this

1500
01:25:49,151 --> 01:25:51,640
whole comradery and brotherhood thing.
I had orders to Fort Hood.

1501
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,820
I had my sergeant major
cancel them. I was like, ah,

1502
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,160
I don't know why you're kicking me out.
He goes, I'm not kicking you out. I said,

1503
01:25:57,161 --> 01:25:59,770
sergeant major, I have orders to Fort
Hood and he's like, do you not want to go?

1504
01:25:59,771 --> 01:26:02,470
I said, no, I need you to play
with these guys. So he's just like,

1505
01:26:02,471 --> 01:26:04,010
I'll take care of.
Yeah.

1506
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,210
The way you put it in the book is,

1507
01:26:05,211 --> 01:26:08,480
the reason I went overseas was
because of the soldier next to me.

1508
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:12,740
The guys in my squad, our job was to
protect American, keep the Taliban at bay.

1509
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:17,750
I drained my men, I taught them all. I
knew it was my job to take care of them.

1510
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,330
I couldn't imagine them
deploying without me.

1511
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:26,400
Yeah. I mean I was quite frankly
upset when I got those orders. Um,

1512
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:29,700
but they were building a new brigade and
they want to combat ncls with over two

1513
01:26:29,701 --> 01:26:33,570
years of combat experience to go
help, you know, lead these guys.

1514
01:26:33,571 --> 01:26:37,710
And I was like a noble, I get it,
but not, not for me right now.

1515
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:40,090
Okay.

1516
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:44,680
You leaving? Um, and Josh is
going away at the same time.

1517
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:47,770
Your brother in law,
your wife's brother going away.

1518
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,790
Same time here we go back to the book.
She was in tears,

1519
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:55,540
a beautiful mess. Josh was leaving
on that same deployment too,

1520
01:26:55,630 --> 01:27:00,250
but a day later than I was. So he came
to see me off and support his sister.

1521
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:02,470
I hugged him and he hugged me back.

1522
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:05,890
Chloe was five months old and
sleeping soundly in her car seat.

1523
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:09,640
She never woke up. When I
kissed her cheek, I on strap.

1524
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:13,180
My daughter picked her up and cradled
are tightly. One last time in my arms,

1525
01:27:13,570 --> 01:27:16,990
she inhaled,
deeply smiled and carried on sleeping.

1526
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,860
Then I waved goodbye walking
away from my loved ones.

1527
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:25,861
I had to ask myself if
this third deployment felt
different from the first two I

1528
01:27:25,901 --> 01:27:28,570
had a child to think about now a family.

1529
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:32,170
I knew there would be 10
stays in firefights ahead,

1530
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:34,540
but honestly I wasn't afraid of dying.

1531
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:35,930
Yeah,

1532
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:39,590
I wouldn't be reckless and make myself
an easy target and I didn't want to die,

1533
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:43,070
but I knew that if I got hit,
then I got hit.

1534
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:48,740
If it happened that it was meant to be
as a soldier,

1535
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:52,970
it's not like I talk about my emotions
every day. I don't write poetry.

1536
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:58,130
I don't watch romantic comedies. As
a rule, I'm trained to kill people.

1537
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:59,360
That's what I do.

1538
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:03,680
You've got to be tough in the 82nd
you've got to be as hard as life.

1539
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,950
You don't want to show weakness ever,
particularly with any of your guys around.

1540
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:14,390
When you're overseas and out in the middle
of nowhere and you have 12 to 20 guys

1541
01:28:14,391 --> 01:28:19,010
with you, you can't take a seat
and say you're done. As a leader,

1542
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:22,310
I couldn't throw my helmet down and
complain that things weren't fair.

1543
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:26,720
You have to make the best of it.
You'd have to keep going.

1544
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:32,640
You've got to be as tough as they come.
But even so,

1545
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:35,670
as I walked away from my wife
and child and brother-in-law,

1546
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:41,930
the wind struck my eye and I wiped away
the wetness with the back of my sleeve.

1547
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,193
Okay.

1548
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:48,300
Harder going away on this deployment?

1549
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,680
No, a little bit. Yeah. It didn't feel
right. Um, I actually had a conversation,

1550
01:28:52,681 --> 01:28:55,620
my brother in law and in his garage
with him and I was like, you know, Josh,

1551
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:58,730
it's always the guy that you don't
expect to get hit and it gets hit and uh,

1552
01:28:59,070 --> 01:29:01,830
we can start naming all the people
from our deployments cause we the same

1553
01:29:01,831 --> 01:29:05,280
brigade, always just different units
has it. I just don't feel good about it,

1554
01:29:05,281 --> 01:29:08,680
you know? I mean, not that I couldn't go
where I wasn't going to go, but, but yeah,

1555
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,380
it was harder. You know,
my wife and everything,

1556
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:13,050
I was supposed to leave the next day I
went to work and they're like, hey, look,

1557
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:15,660
we need you to take this
chocolate guys over. Um,

1558
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:20,130
can you leave tonight instead of tomorrow
night? And I was like, well, yeah,

1559
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:23,040
but I got to leave work right now and
I gotta go see my wife and my kid.

1560
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:27,090
And they're like, yeah, yeah, you can go.
So I went. Um, but it, it does, you know,

1561
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:30,000
I wouldn't say each deployments harder.
Um,

1562
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:33,060
the second one wasn't hard for me
to go. I mean, had said goodbye,

1563
01:29:33,061 --> 01:29:36,450
but part of my job, the
third one was more, man,

1564
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:40,140
I hope I get to come back home. But you've
got to push those thoughts, you know,

1565
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:44,490
out of your head. You can't
stop. You can't dwell on it.
You can't think about it.

1566
01:29:44,491 --> 01:29:47,610
You can't, you know, worry
about what's going to happen.

1567
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,240
You got to just push through and whatever
happens does happen. But you know,

1568
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:53,970
as long as you're not reckless
and careless, you know, you,

1569
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,600
you can't affect what your
outcomes are going to be anyway.

1570
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:59,160
So you might as well just keep
pushing forward. Yeah. Do you, um,

1571
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,630
and now you end up on
this deployment the fall,

1572
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,940
but a strong point that you're in so
small, it doesn't even have a name,

1573
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,980
just like out in the middle of nowhere.
This is drunk.

1574
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:15,390
And you got there. And what was the,
uh, what was the environment like there?

1575
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:20,490
I mean, the, the units that leave
always give real great advice.

1576
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:22,770
Um,
and their commander told our commander,

1577
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:26,190
you're not gonna really change a
lot stuff here with how the rules of

1578
01:30:26,191 --> 01:30:27,600
engagements now,
um,

1579
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:30,960
because the rules of engagements over
different presidencies are different.

1580
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:34,890
Leadership changed. And they
said, you know, when we go out,

1581
01:30:34,891 --> 01:30:38,130
we take shape and cream, we line where
we walked, you know, we come back,

1582
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:40,960
that's all you're gonna do. And of course,
when we get there were hard charging.

1583
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:42,870
We're like, we're going to go here,
here, here, and here and here.

1584
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:48,210
And Sop is changed. The bow space,
I'll changed. Uh, we lived in, um,

1585
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,060
like my first boat,
I was on a big five second appointment,

1586
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:55,620
I was in a row of little out, a
little strong points and fobs. Um,

1587
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,810
and then this one we were
just like, hey, here you go.

1588
01:30:57,811 --> 01:30:59,250
We're going to helicopter
you and you're dropped off.

1589
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:04,260
They says you ThreeSixty around is all
bad. And uh, that's just how it was.

1590
01:31:04,261 --> 01:31:08,400
So we'd go out the first day I went
out and got huge firefight. Um,

1591
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:11,940
and that's when my guys really understood,
like I wasn't a lot of schools.

1592
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:15,630
Like I went to college and went to
jump school and went to the advanced

1593
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:20,480
leadership course, ALC course for aesics.
So when I got back and I got to, uh,

1594
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:23,760
the weapons squad leader spot, some of
the guys didn't know who I was from.

1595
01:31:23,761 --> 01:31:27,330
Anybody. My first sergeant knew man,
that's why I got the spot. But, um,

1596
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:30,450
the other guys were like, why the hell
is this guy jokes around? He doesn't,

1597
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:34,380
he's not mean he doesn't smoke
anybody. He's, he's, you know, really,

1598
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:37,560
I was polite I guess or whatever,
you know, normal everyday guy.

1599
01:31:37,561 --> 01:31:40,490
I didn't have this chip on my
shoulder after I first firefight,

1600
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,440
like two of the guys that came from a
different industry unit where like, look,

1601
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:45,000
I didn't get while you
were in the squad leader,

1602
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:48,000
I didn't get how you got you six.
Um, and while you were in charge,

1603
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:51,540
but now I do because you know
when shit hits the fan and I was,

1604
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,250
I was a guy needed to be there I guess.
Yeah.

1605
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,280
I mean this firefight going
to go into the book here. Uh,

1606
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:59,620
Sergeant Butler yelled, I'm hit, I'm hit.

1607
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,270
One of his team leaders,

1608
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:05,680
Sergeant Marty Miller ran over to him
and swept his hands long Butler's body to

1609
01:32:05,681 --> 01:32:08,740
look for blood. Miller ran back to
our lieutenants are four we could,

1610
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:13,750
he couldn't find any.
And you, you just, um,

1611
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:19,690
you sprinted out into this river bed
during this fire fights going on and here

1612
01:32:19,691 --> 01:32:22,860
you are. I'm still wearing my body armor,
but I was essentially weapon lists.

1613
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:25,120
If I'd kept my rifle,
it would only slowed me down.

1614
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:29,050
I ran over to where Sergeant Butler lay,
he was probably 50 meters total away.

1615
01:32:29,051 --> 01:32:32,200
It's my leg. He shouted. I can't put
any weight on it. Shut up. I yelled,

1616
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:36,160
get on my back. Now let's go
without waiting for him to answer.

1617
01:32:36,161 --> 01:32:38,590
I grabbed his right hand with my left,

1618
01:32:38,591 --> 01:32:41,440
squatted down and threw him over
my shoulders and a fireman's carry.

1619
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:46,120
He was probably 185 pounds.
I have to come up and ran back to safety.

1620
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,970
So there you go.
Just uh,

1621
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:54,430
I understand after you perform like that
to firefight your boys like, oh yeah,

1622
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:56,900
we get it. Well we uh, yeah, so we were

1623
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:01,710
on one side of the Wadi, the
driver bed and uh, my CEO was like,

1624
01:33:01,711 --> 01:33:05,170
we're going to cross this river bed. And
I'm like, all right. I mean that's really,

1625
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:09,030
really open but let's do it. So
first, second and headquarters,

1626
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,080
whatever went across.

1627
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,720
Right, exactly. And just, just,

1628
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,960
I always have to point this stuff out
cause we have a lot of guys that are in

1629
01:33:14,961 --> 01:33:18,230
the military that listen to this and so
you're just doing a classic cover move.

1630
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:21,410
One element is going to stay back on the
high ground or on one side of the river

1631
01:33:21,411 --> 01:33:23,510
to cover as the other other
elements pushing across.

1632
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:25,100
Yeah.
And this was our first day in country.

1633
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:26,720
So we're just trying to
learn the battlespace. Okay.

1634
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:31,820
Cause we were thinking about setting up
another uh, oop or strong point on the,

1635
01:33:31,821 --> 01:33:34,760
on the Wadi,
cause there's a lot of traffic and um,

1636
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:38,240
they start to move over over there
and they'd get about 50 meters away,

1637
01:33:38,241 --> 01:33:41,870
75 meters, whatever. And then all hell
breaks loose shots from everywhere.

1638
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:46,130
And third squad and four squad weapons
squad was just me are over on the river,

1639
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:48,200
you know,
riverbed and we start laying in,

1640
01:33:48,201 --> 01:33:52,130
everybody ducks down takes cover and I'm
still standing and I'm yelling at them.

1641
01:33:52,131 --> 01:33:54,590
One of my guns shooting to the far left.

1642
01:33:54,591 --> 01:33:56,410
Where should we shoot into the far right,
use the right elements.

1643
01:33:56,411 --> 01:33:59,850
So I walk over and I kicked
the team leader, you know,
actually I think it might,

1644
01:33:59,851 --> 01:34:03,050
it's Max's head real hard. And I said,
I said, you fix this and fix it now.

1645
01:34:03,051 --> 01:34:04,130
And I told him where to shoot.

1646
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:07,730
And went back over and a
direct to some more traffic.

1647
01:34:07,731 --> 01:34:10,250
And then some of the other two team
leaders from the third squad were just

1648
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,650
firing all their rounds after
we already gained the fire.

1649
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:14,600
Superiorities I yelled at them and said,
you to know better,

1650
01:34:14,601 --> 01:34:16,490
you've been here before,
control your rounds,

1651
01:34:16,491 --> 01:34:18,830
control your flyer and just
make sure it's a pressing.

1652
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,940
And then Butler went down and were
like, oh, Butler just got hit.

1653
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,870
And he ended up tearing his MCL ACL
and a meniscus or whatever. I mean,

1654
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:30,560
this is pretty bad damage. And um,
my first starts like third squad,

1655
01:34:30,561 --> 01:34:33,440
go and get him and I, I said,
no first our nor, but I got it.

1656
01:34:33,441 --> 01:34:36,080
So I took my weapon off am I am
for, you know, and I was like, here,

1657
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:38,870
hold this for me. I tossed in my m
four, because there's just, you know,

1658
01:34:38,871 --> 01:34:43,240
it gets in the way and I
ran down. Then the ane, hey,
we're on the riverbank, right?

1659
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:46,370
Kind of right behind where they're at.
I said, you guys do not shoot that,

1660
01:34:46,371 --> 01:34:49,610
don't you? I can shoot, you
know, don't you shoot me in
the back? Sorry about that.

1661
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:51,990
I ain't gotta edit that or
maybe you don't. I was like,
don't you guys shoot me?

1662
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:56,180
I ran out and got him, took him back
and I set him down. So I ran a out 50,

1663
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:59,820
came back and took them about
about 50 to 80 behind the building,

1664
01:34:59,821 --> 01:35:03,380
set them down and I sat down and
get a drink of water at first sight.

1665
01:35:03,381 --> 01:35:06,830
Like my first son goes to sergeant males
need you back here. Oh, okay. I ran back.

1666
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:10,490
I was like, Oh crap. Where's my gun? And
Marty had it somewhere. He's like, Oh,

1667
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:12,920
here you go.
And I was the last one on the objective.

1668
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:16,890
We had to hike back two miles
with Butler on a stretcher. Um,

1669
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:19,580
but that was the last one with
the fo on the objective, uh,

1670
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,730
and smoke for the Kyle was to come
over and cover our movement to them.

1671
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:26,330
The two guys at yelled at,
or the ones that told me,

1672
01:35:26,331 --> 01:35:27,400
they found me a hell and back like,

1673
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,180
we get it now sergeant mills
will find you're held back.

1674
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,970
They were just kept shooting them like,
you guys are team leaders,

1675
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:32,990
you've been here.
What are you doing?

1676
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:38,000
Yeah, that's awesome man. Just reality
check. It's, it's a, it's another example.

1677
01:35:38,001 --> 01:35:42,110
I mean again, just you're talking about
how you were in leadership position.

1678
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,610
You're just backed off a little bit.
You're,

1679
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,020
you're paying attention
to what's going on.

1680
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:48,770
Instead of you being on
your gun and shooting, your
backed off, you're watching.

1681
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,600
That's what you need to do
in a leadership position.

1682
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:53,420
You got to back off a little bit.
You got to observe what's happening.

1683
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:56,540
You got to make sense of what's happening
and then you've got to make sure that

1684
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:57,590
people are doing the right things.

1685
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:02,420
Yeah, I mean, you know, I, if I
shot my gun, I mean that's great.

1686
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:05,000
I got chance changed,
shoot my m four and do had to do,

1687
01:36:05,001 --> 01:36:08,390
but if I wasn't controlling my
too heavy weapons squad, you know,

1688
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,140
like I had the two forties I was
king of the battlefield, if you will,

1689
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,120
and with the heaviest fire pilot,
I was in charge of it.

1690
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:16,470
They weren't doing the job the right way.
Then we were all in trouble.

1691
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:21,380
Yeah. As I always say, God
bless the machine gunners. Um,

1692
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,170
yeah.
Any of that.

1693
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:31,310
It sounds like that deployment was,
I mean the,

1694
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:35,550
the firefights that you talk
about in here, we're a lot,

1695
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:40,030
you're getting a lot of firefights every
other day, if not every day. And so,

1696
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:43,420
so this one here, you went
out and did this raid, um,

1697
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:48,480
and then you get word after you do this
raid that there's no aircraft to come

1698
01:36:48,481 --> 01:36:51,480
and pick you up from the raid
and go ahead and walk back.

1699
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:56,950
Yeah, that's good times. Yeah.
We, uh, we went out, we, um,

1700
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:59,680
I told my guys like, look, it's
going to be hellacious. Bring extra.

1701
01:36:59,710 --> 01:37:04,360
We had each of us 2000 rounds of seven,
six to gain. And then we also had,

1702
01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:08,500
um, I always carried 2000
rounds of seven, six,

1703
01:37:08,501 --> 01:37:11,470
two or I guess depending on the mission,
it would change me a thousand to 2000.

1704
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:15,310
And then I carry 20 grenades,
10 on my, on my, uh,

1705
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:20,170
armor and 10 in my bag. And then another
20, 40 Mike, Mike and I have two or three.

1706
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:24,070
Jesus. And then 420, um,
five, five, six rounds,

1707
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:29,500
like not in my magazines. And I always
had programs like freaking 200 pounds.

1708
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,800
Yeah. What? Yeah, but without, without
ammunition you're kind of screwed.

1709
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:37,060
That's true. Good point. So I was at 12
magazines on my person and then I'd have,

1710
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,660
you know, 13th 1:00 AM I in the chamber.
So I had 13 full magazines on me,

1711
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,310
not because 13 is like
some special number,

1712
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:46,360
just cause like my mag pouches where yeah,
my mag pouch was, you know, too deep.

1713
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:50,680
So I could have six, three
on each side. Um, yeah.

1714
01:37:50,681 --> 01:37:53,770
And we went out there and we ended up
getting like seven different firefights in

1715
01:37:53,771 --> 01:37:58,560
my back home we had for, and uh, I got,

1716
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,453
I got,
um,

1717
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:02,830
I got put next to the gun the one time
and you know how it's called pig town rat.

1718
01:38:02,831 --> 01:38:05,370
Tell the cop when you put
your seven, six, two Lincoln,

1719
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,540
you have one side come out and then you
switched back it in and then they'll try

1720
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:12,000
to come out. So when you hooked
to a gun, it pulls out your bag.

1721
01:38:12,001 --> 01:38:14,430
And then if you have another bag
next to you, clip it together. Oh,

1722
01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:15,940
we shot through all my rounds.
One the,

1723
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:18,600
one of the things which I do all the
seven, six, two rounds. I was like, oh,

1724
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:23,160
this is so much on like lighter. And I
got to another spot in one of my guys,

1725
01:38:23,161 --> 01:38:26,940
Brandon, um, fast that he was one of
the guys got hurt with me later on,

1726
01:38:26,941 --> 01:38:29,610
but he was almost knocked at like
past now. So have you. I said,

1727
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:33,030
I'm going to take my bag. He goes, no,
I go, sorry. I said, gimme your bag.

1728
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:35,670
Don't argue with me. And I was like,
you need to make it back to the fob.

1729
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,110
And then our, uh, our pa the, that
came out with this awesome guy,

1730
01:38:40,111 --> 01:38:43,920
ranger regiment guy and it
turned into be a doctor.

1731
01:38:43,921 --> 01:38:47,790
He was dehydrating really bad on the
lock back going hallucinations and stuff.

1732
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:52,440
So, um, w we decided,
me and two other guys,

1733
01:38:52,441 --> 01:38:53,274
three other guys,

1734
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,030
go ahead and just like try to head
and walk faster than everybody else.

1735
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:59,940
I'm like made it back to the fob first
to get a get a m m wrap to come get them.

1736
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:04,220
But yeah, and we actually, one of
the guys who were detained, we, we,

1737
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:08,670
we detained all these guys that had 600
pounds, homemade explosives, batteries,

1738
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:12,750
RPGs. And the thing was a
drone filed their RPG team
back on a motorcycle to this

1739
01:39:12,751 --> 01:39:17,220
compound, AK 47. But we didn't
get pictures with all their stuff.

1740
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,730
So we turned them over to the local
national government and they said,

1741
01:39:19,731 --> 01:39:22,380
well you didn't get pictures of
these guys or these guys are free.

1742
01:39:22,381 --> 01:39:27,100
So they let them go. Turns
out the guy that uh, um,

1743
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:29,250
we had detained one of
them cause we hide them.

1744
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:31,550
Fingerprints were all
over my bomb and the,

1745
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:35,460
there's 13 bombs in a row and they're
all over the bombs at the one that I hit.

1746
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:37,810
So the guy that we captured as
the one that put the bomb in

1747
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:41,890
Alpha troop caught him
and he took care of them.

1748
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:44,903
So,

1749
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,500
all right, sorry to bring
it down to tone. My Bet.

1750
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:55,030
Going to April 10th,

1751
01:39:55,030 --> 01:40:00,030
2012 you get some Intel on the afternoon
that there's a IED out in the village

1752
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:05,500
and you guys are going to go check
it out and here we go into the book.

1753
01:40:05,501 --> 01:40:09,460
We hiked only about 400 yards to the
village in addition to my weapons team.

1754
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:12,940
There were other squads along on patrol,
a total of 28 soldiers.

1755
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:18,390
My Lieutenant Zachary Louis went to the
left with the first and second squads

1756
01:40:19,301 --> 01:40:22,750
heading to meet with the village elders
while the rest of our men went with me

1757
01:40:22,751 --> 01:40:27,010
around the village to the outside to
offer support in case of an attack along

1758
01:40:27,011 --> 01:40:32,011
with my gun team I had in my platoon
sergeant and a medic Sergeant Daniel

1759
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:35,560
Bateson with my group all looks calm.

1760
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:39,820
It was just another day in Afghanistan,
another normal patrol.

1761
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:45,330
We approached and abandoned ANA security
posts to portable buildings and stop

1762
01:40:45,971 --> 01:40:48,460
near the buildings to
establish a security perimeter.

1763
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:53,440
I called for fessy to bring the sweeper
check.

1764
01:40:53,441 --> 01:40:57,300
This area was the only order I gave fast.

1765
01:40:57,330 --> 01:41:01,150
He walked up a path used by villagers
and scanned all the area around.

1766
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:05,890
He went up and back and all was clear,
no beeps.

1767
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:09,120
There was no reason to
question anything fast.

1768
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:13,210
He finished his mind sweeping duties and
went up and went to set up on the far

1769
01:41:13,211 --> 01:41:14,044
flag.

1770
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:19,710
I called riot up to to me and asked him
where he thought we should put the gun.

1771
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:23,920
I knew where it should go,
but I wanted to let him decide,

1772
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,870
making sure he knew his stuff.

1773
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:30,490
He motioned to exactly where I thought we
should put it, a good spot, and I said,

1774
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:33,850
all right, go get NAF and bring
them up here. That was it.

1775
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:39,520
Riot let left to go get Nafta and
as he did, I set my backpack down.

1776
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:45,430
The backpack, touching the dirt was
all. It took such a simple act of war.

1777
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:51,330
My world erupted.
I saw a flash of flame and hurt,

1778
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:56,240
hurt a huge Kaboom, hot, jagged
piece, pieces of explosives.

1779
01:41:56,420 --> 01:42:00,710
Rip through me.
I cartwheeled backward end over end,

1780
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:04,820
hit the ground and slammed my face
hard against the compacted earth.

1781
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:09,110
Instantly I felt my left
eye starting to swell shut.

1782
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:11,990
I smelled burning flesh my own.

1783
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:16,850
I tasted dirt and I was wet
with sweat and moisture,

1784
01:42:16,851 --> 01:42:18,920
just like I'd walked out of a hot shower.

1785
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:20,330
Yeah,

1786
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:24,170
dirt fell everywhere through the air.
It rained down and clung to my eyes,

1787
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:27,260
nose and mouth.
I don't remember rolling over,

1788
01:42:27,261 --> 01:42:30,740
but I must have because I glanced to
the side and saw that my right arm was

1789
01:42:30,741 --> 01:42:31,760
completely gone.

1790
01:42:33,110 --> 01:42:37,700
I caught a glimpse of my left arm
covered in blood and tattered by arm.

1791
01:42:37,701 --> 01:42:39,650
Tremble does,
if it had a will of its own.

1792
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:43,160
I looked down and saw my
right leg was also gone.

1793
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:46,070
The stump looked like a piece of raw meat.

1794
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:49,340
The bottom of my left
leg was still attached,

1795
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:52,100
but held on only by a few strands of skin.

1796
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:56,300
I saw all this in a flash.
In an instant.

1797
01:42:57,470 --> 01:42:58,140
Yeah,

1798
01:42:58,140 --> 01:43:02,430
I felt confusion, but no panic. My
first thought of what was of my guys,

1799
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:06,180
I flopped my remaining
arm toward the microphone,

1800
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:10,140
clipped to my carrier plate and somehow
managed to push the button. I hit a bomb.

1801
01:43:10,141 --> 01:43:13,320
I said, I need help. Bateson.

1802
01:43:13,321 --> 01:43:17,640
My medic rushed up to me along with
staff sergeant Keith Handbright,

1803
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:21,960
our platoon sergeant, only about 30
seconds had passed since the blast.

1804
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:26,160
Immediately they applied tourniquets to
hold whatever blood was still inside me.

1805
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:31,200
I'm not gonna make it. I said, leave
me and go to save my guys. Shut up.

1806
01:43:31,201 --> 01:43:34,080
Sergeant Mills said,
Bateson let me do my job.

1807
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:39,950
I ignored Bateson and yelled my man's
name like roll call fasc riot nef to see

1808
01:43:40,831 --> 01:43:45,831
if they were okay to were hit fastly
and riot and other medics were already

1809
01:43:46,681 --> 01:43:50,490
caring for them. They were
bleeding, but nothing was missing.

1810
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:55,580
They yelled back that they were
going to be okay. I calmed down.

1811
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,400
More soldiers ran toward me.

1812
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:03,760
Sergeant Alex Voice and
other medic wondered aloud
where to best get ivy access.

1813
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:08,300
There are no pulses to check
except for my carotid order artery.

1814
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:11,180
He quickly ripped open my vest,

1815
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:15,230
shaved a spot on my chest and put
an IV straight into my sternum.

1816
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:20,540
It hurts going in and I must've howled
because he yelled at me that I was going

1817
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:24,770
to be fine. I yelled back, doc, shut up.

1818
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,830
I know he and I both calmed down.

1819
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,430
Someone's stuck offense
in all pop in my mouth.

1820
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:36,260
It's a potent pain killer that releases
as the pop dissolves I down the first

1821
01:44:36,261 --> 01:44:39,860
one, spit out the stick and asked for
another. You won't need it. Someone said,

1822
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:46,190
I was still thinking that I was going
to die. I didn't want to show fear.

1823
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:51,050
I didn't want to freak out. You never
want to show for your around your men.

1824
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:56,540
Let me let my family know I dealt
with it without crying. I said,

1825
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:01,610
tell him yourself someone
grunted he was being encouraging,

1826
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:06,530
letting me know I wasn't dead yet.
I tried to see around me.

1827
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:10,070
I raised my head wanting to
get a visual of FASC in riot.

1828
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:15,380
Someone's shoved my head back
down by still commanded a voice.

1829
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:20,830
My one eye was swollen,
completely shut.

1830
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:25,690
The other eye was blurry from dirt. I
tried to raise my head again. Again,

1831
01:45:25,691 --> 01:45:28,300
I was pushed flat.
My eyes were watering.

1832
01:45:28,301 --> 01:45:32,980
Now the dirt turning to mud time passed
and I didn't know what was happening.

1833
01:45:33,790 --> 01:45:35,860
I mumbled something,
but there was no reply.

1834
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:41,140
Only this steady wa or warp of a Black
Hawk helicopter touching down nearby.

1835
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:45,550
Six men surrounded me,
have teed me up and carried me over.

1836
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:47,583
All told,

1837
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:50,890
it might've been 10 minutes since the
blast until the helicopter arrived.

1838
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:54,730
Fessy in riot were first
inside the helicopter.

1839
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,450
Everything was foggy and noisy and I
couldn't make out my surroundings clearly.

1840
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:02,980
My two guys were on seats and I saw
blood and bandages jumbled in their

1841
01:46:02,981 --> 01:46:07,780
direction. FASC had shrapnel
in his face ride, had shrapnel,

1842
01:46:07,781 --> 01:46:11,890
his face, legs and hands.
Their images faded away.

1843
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:13,290
Yeah.

1844
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:15,150
I focused on the noise of the rotors.

1845
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:20,550
We were in the air and the flight medic.
We're taking care of me

1846
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:26,220
right at yelled in pain. I tried to look
around. Someone needed to attend to riot.

1847
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:29,900
Where are the medics? One of the medics
were talking to the pilots upfront.

1848
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:34,830
Riot was yelling again. I looked in fessy
direction and told them to calm down.

1849
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:36,810
Fessy nodded.

1850
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:41,100
Riot stopped yelling and I winked at him
to let him know he was going to be okay.

1851
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:42,510
Yeah,

1852
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:46,680
it was all I could think to do.
The flight medic.

1853
01:46:46,681 --> 01:46:50,160
Was it back in view? I could barely
see him. The goop in my eyes.

1854
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,250
You are a green flight suit and
had a big Darth Vader helmet.

1855
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:59,250
I tried to speak. He gave me a quizzical
look. I yelled as loud as I could.

1856
01:46:59,251 --> 01:47:02,340
Take your helmet off.
He took his helmet off.

1857
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:07,050
Get my guys water and tell them they're
going to be okay. I barked, don't worry.

1858
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:08,250
I'll take care of them for you.

1859
01:47:08,251 --> 01:47:12,480
He said he was busy with some
task on me that I couldn't see.

1860
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15,570
A moment went by and I added,

1861
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:19,470
I'm sorry for what the medic asked for,

1862
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:23,760
making you take your helmet off.
He gave me a ride grin.

1863
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:28,860
I realized he'd been doing his
job all, all along doing it. Well,

1864
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:34,080
both the medics had. I just couldn't
see all that was happening around me.

1865
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:38,460
My mind went in and out.
I was coherent but fuzzy and spots.

1866
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:41,130
In 15 minutes,

1867
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:45,080
the helicopter landed in
Kandahar hospital staffed,

1868
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:49,410
rushed me straight to the operating table.
We're going to put you under.

1869
01:47:49,411 --> 01:47:53,490
Now came a voice from
above me. I'm fine. I said,

1870
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:58,440
leave me alone. The mass came over
my face and I tried to push it away.

1871
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,410
I remember asking one question,

1872
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:05,430
am I ever going to see my baby girl again?

1873
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:18,593
Cool.

1874
01:48:21,210 --> 01:48:23,890
Little intense. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh,

1875
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:28,060
my is more choice words. I didn't put
in the book, I said to the flight medic,

1876
01:48:28,061 --> 01:48:31,120
I had yelled three times and then
last time through the f word in there,

1877
01:48:31,121 --> 01:48:33,880
take your effing helmet
off. And he did, uh,

1878
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,100
in my head I was just
thinking saving private Ryan,

1879
01:48:36,850 --> 01:48:40,030
don't go out like for your mom, like
the medic when he got shot in the movie.

1880
01:48:40,570 --> 01:48:42,550
And uh, I just, you know,

1881
01:48:42,551 --> 01:48:46,180
I was the guy that I had a sniper round
crack next to my head and I rolled in

1882
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:49,120
and I was so embarrassed to
have rolled away from it. Um,

1883
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:52,120
then I stood on top of the mountain in
Shawn off a magazine and a half before I

1884
01:48:52,121 --> 01:48:56,590
got back down. And, uh, so
just the whole don't show fear.

1885
01:48:56,591 --> 01:49:00,190
I figured I can't change what happened
right now. If I raise my policy,

1886
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:04,840
I'm going to bleed faster. And,
um, you know, thanks to my platoon,

1887
01:49:04,841 --> 01:49:09,640
sergeant, uh, Sergeant Hambright and
Doc Bates and then doc voice, uh,

1888
01:49:09,641 --> 01:49:11,880
I was able to maintain most of my blood.

1889
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:15,710
They must've slapped those things
on you. Quick tourniquets. Oh,

1890
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:19,740
within 20 seconds or 30 seconds I think.
And how did was that,

1891
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:23,100
was the aircraft airborne somewhere
and got redirected to you?

1892
01:49:23,101 --> 01:49:24,990
How'd you guys get a
helicopter there so fast?

1893
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:26,120
I don't know.

1894
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:30,340
We usually only went out when it was when
there was helicopters on station, um,

1895
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:33,800
because the threat was so, so real. Um,

1896
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:38,090
not that we need to talk about this
and you guys edit it out. But, um,

1897
01:49:38,570 --> 01:49:41,540
at nighttime the Taliban had free
reign to do what they wanted.

1898
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:45,920
We were told because of politics
or whatever, somebody said,

1899
01:49:45,921 --> 01:49:48,610
we can go at nighttime.
So we had the best nighttime capabilities,

1900
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,880
but we couldn't go out. So on the
red camera, 30 feet in the air,

1901
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:55,630
we would watch them on the screen and
watch them put bombs in at nighttime and

1902
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:59,650
we couldn't shoot him, couldn't
shoot mortars at them and
couldn't get him. So, uh,

1903
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:03,910
it kind of sucked because you'd watch
them put the bombs and then the next day

1904
01:50:03,911 --> 01:50:05,110
you're supposed to go
out and try to find him.

1905
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:08,840
And that's why in 2012 they
wouldn't let you shoot them a,

1906
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:11,170
they won't let us go out and get them.
They're like, no, I can't go at nighttime.

1907
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:14,340
And we're like, but we can see
them. I mean, I don't want,

1908
01:50:14,341 --> 01:50:17,380
if you guys talk about it,
you know, it doesn't bother
me. I just reality, you know,

1909
01:50:17,381 --> 01:50:17,930
I don't like,

1910
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:20,800
I want you don't get political so
you don't have to on this with me.

1911
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:23,560
But just watching him put bombs and
knowing I had to go and try to find them.

1912
01:50:23,561 --> 01:50:27,190
And then the guy that I found, uh,
or we walk back through, you know,

1913
01:50:27,191 --> 01:50:30,100
seven different firefights and 10 clicks,
uh,

1914
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:34,390
when they went out to do the surveillance
on the site, that got blown up at, uh,

1915
01:50:34,391 --> 01:50:38,380
I blown up. There was 13 in a row
right there. And if some reason the,

1916
01:50:38,381 --> 01:50:41,890
my super Brandon went up and down, not
once, but twice and nothing alarmed him.

1917
01:50:41,891 --> 01:50:44,830
So there was six daisy chain together,
call it squad killer.

1918
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:47,360
So you had to be the front guy to hit
the first one and then everybody behind

1919
01:50:47,361 --> 01:50:48,940
them would get just taken out.

1920
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,520
So in a way it was as probably
better that I got hit that day.

1921
01:50:51,521 --> 01:50:53,850
Then have somebody walk past and hit
it and then everyone behind him you're

1922
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:58,120
taken out too. Um, yeah. So just,

1923
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,930
just the politics of war I guess kind
of sucked because I would watch him put

1924
01:51:01,931 --> 01:51:03,430
bombs in,
couldn't shoot him.

1925
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:06,160
The Chi was to come on station and the
guy shooting Nsa Han yards away with

1926
01:51:06,161 --> 01:51:08,680
dropped their weapons and walk away
and all of a sudden they were no longer

1927
01:51:08,681 --> 01:51:12,640
combatant until the Chi was, we're out
of fuel and we weren't going to run,

1928
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:16,000
you know, a thousand meters
this way because if we did,

1929
01:51:16,001 --> 01:51:20,530
then the guys just take either a case
and take off. So, you know, the red tape.

1930
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:25,450
But when I got blown up, I did rate
on my lt until, yeah, I got hit. Uh,

1931
01:51:25,451 --> 01:51:27,040
I don't know how bad it is.

1932
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:29,530
And I told my ma get away from me and
he kept fighting me off and tell me to

1933
01:51:29,531 --> 01:51:33,690
somebody my job. Then the doctors worked
on me for 14 hours. I was told nine, uh,

1934
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,760
nine doctors and seven nurses
and two nurses for nine hours,

1935
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:41,290
pump air into my lungs, keep me alive,
like took turns pumping air. Um,

1936
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:42,490
I was so low on blood,

1937
01:51:42,491 --> 01:51:45,630
they did over 30 transfusions and
they didn't have enough in stock.

1938
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:50,050
They were like on the big speaker in
Kandahar saying a positive blood and

1939
01:51:50,051 --> 01:51:52,710
universal, we need it now.
And they were right from,

1940
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:54,970
I had a lot of tests I had to do for like,
you know,

1941
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,400
possible HIV or things like
that because it was just like,

1942
01:51:57,401 --> 01:51:59,350
just take it and put it right
in. Yep. Cool. All right,

1943
01:51:59,351 --> 01:52:02,080
thanks for your blood and we're
gonna put it right in them. Um,

1944
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:06,100
they knocked me out medically,
you know, maybe unconscious. Um,

1945
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:09,160
and they kept me like that for four days.
So

1946
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:12,420
I just realized, you know, I always
said God bless them machine gunners,

1947
01:52:12,421 --> 01:52:16,080
but how about a little God
bless the doctors and nurses
for sure. Oh absolutely.

1948
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:18,240
And the medics and the medics.
I would sound like

1949
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:22,270
I go when I speak, I, uh, my
one side's about perspective
and I tell him, you know,

1950
01:52:22,271 --> 01:52:25,120
about the guys that have not made it
back home and I'm thankful to still be

1951
01:52:25,121 --> 01:52:29,230
around and living and I'm going to keep
living, you know, for them so that,

1952
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:30,310
you know,

1953
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:34,150
their sacrifice wasn't in vain because
what happened to me is nowhere near what

1954
01:52:34,151 --> 01:52:36,130
happened. My Buddy Francis
Gene Phillips, a fourth there,

1955
01:52:36,131 --> 01:52:38,200
Frankie great friend of
mine, he died, you know,

1956
01:52:38,201 --> 01:52:39,940
let behind a wife and a
four year old at the time.

1957
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:44,650
So I'm thankful for the medical
advancements in Vietnam.

1958
01:52:44,651 --> 01:52:47,000
A lot of guys didn't come back like me.
And I get sometimes people are like, well,

1959
01:52:47,001 --> 01:52:49,280
we just didn't see people like you
who during the Vietnam War. It's just,

1960
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:52,760
it's so sad this happened.
And I say, well, that's the
guys, they didn't come back.

1961
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:55,070
Yeah. You know, so, so yeah.

1962
01:52:55,071 --> 01:52:58,580
I mean the doctors know how to tie things
in and my calf muscles around the end

1963
01:52:58,581 --> 01:53:03,500
of my left leg now I guess for padding
or something, I'm just nuts, you know.

1964
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:06,500
But um,

1965
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:09,330
that was on the 10th and then I
still had my left hand when they,

1966
01:53:09,810 --> 01:53:13,040
they got done working on me. My wrist
is blown up pretty bad by my finger,

1967
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:17,480
my index, my middle of my thumb.
And then two days later in bog them,

1968
01:53:17,481 --> 01:53:18,171
they cut it off.

1969
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:21,350
My brother in law flew in from his outpost
to Kandahar with me and escorted me

1970
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:24,980
because did you guys have to feel
blue books out moving before deployed?

1971
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:28,190
We call it the blue book. It's
like, if I die, bury me with this.

1972
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:32,120
It's not a blue book, but we
do. We do do that. Yeah. Well
I don't know. It was, yeah,

1973
01:53:32,121 --> 01:53:34,550
like a little blue pants.
They'd call it the Blue Book and the army.

1974
01:53:34,551 --> 01:53:37,550
But it's like, if I die, you
know, I want my wedding ring,

1975
01:53:37,551 --> 01:53:40,970
I want picture of my wife and I, my kid,
or you know, I want this music to play.

1976
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:44,660
Right. Basically. Plan your
funeral is kind of morbid,
but I guess it's all right.

1977
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:48,020
Um, but he was a guy who was
supposed to escort my body back home.

1978
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:53,170
So he came to where I was at and then
they shipped me to bother them on April

1979
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:56,840
12th and I was 12. They took a look at
my hand, like, it's not gonna make it,

1980
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:59,570
it's just necrotizing and you know,
limb length is a huge thing,

1981
01:53:59,571 --> 01:54:03,890
so they cut it off. Um, and then, so
they didn't tell him they're doing it.

1982
01:54:03,891 --> 01:54:07,320
So I worked, rolled into surgery and
I came back into my hand was gone. Um,

1983
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:10,880
but I didn't know, cause I still,
you know, medic or sedated.

1984
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:15,740
And then two days later they went for
the very first time on April 14th and I

1985
01:54:15,741 --> 01:54:18,470
woke up in the room, my brother in law,
he was wanting to tell me, but what I,

1986
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:21,100
I don't know if I'd put it in the book.
I don't think I did April 14th,

1987
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:25,130
actually my birthday. So my 25th birthday
I found out as was a quadruple amputee.

1988
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:29,420
And it's funny because on my first
deployment when I didn't know about

1989
01:54:29,421 --> 01:54:32,120
amputations and things and Josh was just
a friend of mine, not my brother in law,

1990
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:35,060
I was like, look, I'm very athletic.
I play a lot of sports. If I,

1991
01:54:35,061 --> 01:54:37,130
if I lose a leg or something,
just let me bleed out. Like,

1992
01:54:37,131 --> 01:54:41,150
I mean I was that naive at 19 years old.
Like if I lose a hand, just I don't,

1993
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:43,550
I don't need to live, you know,
cause I didn't know any different.

1994
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:47,660
We're now I have, I wake up, no arms
and legs and I'm like, oh, okay.

1995
01:54:47,661 --> 01:54:49,070
Well at least I made it,
I guess.

1996
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:55,670
Um, meanwhile, back on the home
front, going into the book,

1997
01:54:55,671 --> 01:54:59,780
Kelsey received a call at 11:53 AM her
time while standing in her parents'

1998
01:54:59,781 --> 01:55:02,840
kitchen in Dallas, Texas. She
was making a tuna fish sandwich

1999
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:09,520
and, and then it's the commander on the
phone and she describes, you know, he,

2000
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:14,300
he tells her straight forward,
you know, the severe injury.

2001
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:16,220
And this is what she wrote in her journal.

2002
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:19,430
I could not wrap my head around the
pain my husband must be feeling.

2003
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:22,820
I was all alone in the
house and my action subset,

2004
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:24,770
my daughter to the point
where she was screaming,

2005
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:28,700
I could do nothing to sooth
her. I couldn't pick her
up. I couldn't look at her.

2006
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:31,400
My body felt like he was being torn into.

2007
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:37,060
I wanted so badly to be able to talk to
Travis and let them know I love him and

2008
01:55:37,161 --> 01:55:39,800
that I think God,
that he was still alive.

2009
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:47,170
Did it continues on.
Kelsey called my dad in Michigan,

2010
01:55:47,171 --> 01:55:50,050
but when she tried to tell him what
happened, little would come out.

2011
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:55,150
My Dad knew something was wrong
and kept repeating. Is he alive?

2012
01:55:55,270 --> 01:55:57,670
Is he alive?
Is he alive?

2013
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:03,980
And then your dad said this until you
go through something like that yourself,

2014
01:56:03,981 --> 01:56:06,590
it's hard to describe the feeling.
There is no eating anymore.

2015
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:09,950
You don't leave the house. There's a
lot of pacing around. You just wait.

2016
01:56:11,330 --> 01:56:13,070
Whenever the phone rang,
we jumped.

2017
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:17,450
You look at the phone and you don't
know if you want to answer it or not.

2018
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:29,770
So it wasn't, obviously,

2019
01:56:29,771 --> 01:56:34,000
it wasn't just you that got
hit, um, to, you know, your,

2020
01:56:34,090 --> 01:56:38,860
your family back home gets hit with the
shock of all this and all also in your

2021
01:56:38,861 --> 01:56:42,790
squad. [inaudible] yeah, there. Yeah.

2022
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:46,060
Which is the coolest name ever,
right. Cause it's spells the riot.

2023
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:49,540
I've mentioned him earlier.
Um, but yeah, he got wounded.

2024
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:51,270
He was pretty bad.

2025
01:56:51,271 --> 01:56:54,090
I mean he was able to get up and walk
a couple days after he was, it was,

2026
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:55,650
he was sore for quite a bit

2027
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:58,200
and then,
and then fast he got hit as well.

2028
01:56:58,230 --> 01:57:01,830
He did. And luckily he had his
sunglasses on, um, because he,

2029
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:05,990
his face was just blasted, but he still
has, his vision is doing great. Uh,

2030
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,860
just got engaged. So, um, I mean like,
yeah, it's just a bad day. You know,

2031
01:57:10,861 --> 01:57:13,320
my dad, when he says you
don't eat and do that stuff,

2032
01:57:13,321 --> 01:57:17,010
he actually was in the hospital with me
and got diverticulitis real bad and he

2033
01:57:17,011 --> 01:57:17,551
almost died.

2034
01:57:17,551 --> 01:57:21,040
He was so dehydrated and had to go in
and like give him surgery and like get

2035
01:57:21,130 --> 01:57:23,420
handout for six months. You probably
would be mad if I told her about it.

2036
01:57:23,421 --> 01:57:27,050
But he had a class me back cause you
got so dehydrated, um, cause you cared.

2037
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:31,190
You know, it was just so, so
worrisome for him, you know?

2038
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:32,910
And then when I woke up,
I was kind of a Dick.

2039
01:57:32,911 --> 01:57:35,250
I didn't want to like my brother
and I was like, you got to call,

2040
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,960
you know Kelsey and you got to call
your mom and dad. And I'm like,

2041
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:39,190
I'm not talking to anybody. Can
as you know, you're angry or sad.

2042
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:42,540
You're questioning does God
hate me and my bad person?

2043
01:57:42,541 --> 01:57:45,300
What did I do wrong in life to get
this? I mean I pay my taxes, you know,

2044
01:57:45,301 --> 01:57:47,130
I have a family,
why would this happen to me?

2045
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:50,160
And then a little bit goes like Forrest
Gump where it's like lieutenant Dan like,

2046
01:57:50,161 --> 01:57:53,870
no, what, what, what the hell, you
know, why did I live through this? Um,

2047
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,050
is this some kind of sick punishment
that for something I did wrong? And, um,

2048
01:57:58,110 --> 01:58:00,510
I mean you, you come to a
realization like, hey, you know what,

2049
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,190
sometimes bad things happen
to good people. It is what
it is. You can't change it.

2050
01:58:05,191 --> 01:58:07,590
You might as well keep pushing forward
and it's nothing I did wrong in life.

2051
01:58:07,591 --> 01:58:09,150
It's just what was slated.
So,

2052
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:13,420
you know, that's what happened. Yeah.
I thought it was interesting. Um,

2053
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:19,660
uh, that one of the guys on the
Medevac Bird Lik Rhoda Rhoda,

2054
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:24,460
a Facebook to Kelsey and was explaining,
you know,

2055
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:29,440
what it was like and, and
uh, yeah, I mean here,

2056
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:33,700
here's what he wrote.
My name is first sergeant weight,

2057
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:37,960
the other medic, the other flight
medic was staff sergeant hockersmith.

2058
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:42,010
You belong to a family of warriors.
Other wounded soldiers in

2059
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,940
the aircraft were injured and screaming,
but your husband is warm, worried about,

2060
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:48,670
more worried about then than himself.

2061
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:52,341
He described it.

2062
01:58:52,341 --> 01:58:55,120
Then he describes how you were doing the
thing and tell him to take his helmet

2063
01:58:55,121 --> 01:58:59,530
off and, and uh, you know,
here coming back to the book,

2064
01:58:59,531 --> 01:59:02,830
his face was dirty and there was Dustin,
his eyes, but he never shed a tear.

2065
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:07,390
I replay in my mind a moment when he
looked at other wounded soldier at another

2066
01:59:07,391 --> 01:59:10,840
wounded soldier and wink to
reinsure them that it would be okay.

2067
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:15,160
My crew is still on duty
and his unit's area.

2068
01:59:15,161 --> 01:59:19,270
Now we go back to Kandahar on Monday,
but we won't go back the same way.

2069
01:59:20,110 --> 01:59:25,090
I'm an e eight, but this aesics is the
example for myself and others to emulate.

2070
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:26,993
Okay.

2071
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:29,710
I actually, yeah, I've had to get my,

2072
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:33,160
I was strapped down so I had to get my
arm out because when I was yelling at him

2073
01:59:33,161 --> 01:59:35,170
I was like, Hey, take your hand
off. I said, take your helmet off.

2074
01:59:35,171 --> 01:59:38,740
And that finally I got my arm off
straight. How were you conscious man,

2075
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:43,560
that's freaking crazy. Good genes I guess.
Uh, you know, but I put my arm out and I,

2076
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:46,600
I said, take your, you know,
helmet f word helmet off.

2077
01:59:46,601 --> 01:59:49,720
And I put my hand over my head,
the emotion, like, you know,

2078
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:53,410
as my arms drooping down or whatever,
but I just don't take your helmet off.

2079
01:59:53,411 --> 01:59:55,420
And then he did and I was like,
get my guys walked around me fine.

2080
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:58,130
And then later I did apologize for
yelling at him. I was like, Hey,

2081
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:01,810
sorry I yelled in this war. I, yeah.
You know, but you know, at that time,

2082
02:00:01,811 --> 02:00:06,340
I guess maybe it was easier for me to
like think about everything else going on

2083
02:00:06,341 --> 02:00:10,480
except for myself, you know? And I
just, I just figured it is what it is.

2084
02:00:10,481 --> 02:00:13,560
Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen
and it doesn't do me any justice to

2085
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:16,360
scream out or yell or, or
be afraid. I mean, Hey,

2086
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:20,920
I can't change what's going on right now.
So just do the best I can to, you know,

2087
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:21,813
help situation.

2088
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:26,220
Yeah, man. And, and Josh
shows up like you, you know,

2089
02:00:26,221 --> 02:00:28,350
you just talked about this
and Josh just say, Hey,

2090
02:00:28,351 --> 02:00:31,140
I'm going to tell it to you straight.
[inaudible] cause you asked,

2091
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:35,760
you said to Josh, Hey, am I paralyzed
and I'm going to the book here. No Man,

2092
02:00:35,761 --> 02:00:39,960
Josh said you're not paralyzed. You
don't need to lie to me. I whispered.

2093
02:00:39,961 --> 02:00:43,890
I can take it. I'm going to
tell you straight. Josh knew.

2094
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:46,200
I'd want to know the truth.
You're not paralyzed,

2095
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:48,960
but both your arms and legs are gone.

2096
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:53,560
The date was April 14th,

2097
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:57,550
2012 still the same day as
when I'd heard the news.

2098
02:00:57,580 --> 02:01:01,870
I was a quadruple amputee.
It was my 25th birthday.

2099
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:03,433
Okay.

2100
02:01:06,490 --> 02:01:07,323
Damn.

2101
02:01:08,410 --> 02:01:12,160
You talk about the pain and I think
this is something that people don't get

2102
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:16,200
myself included. Um, uh,

2103
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:19,600
the pain was so bad. Part of the pain
was the thought of what I'd become.

2104
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:23,740
I could hardly picture the new me yet.
The pain was more than emotional.

2105
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:28,630
It was a physical pain. It coursed through
my body. I felt like I was on fire.

2106
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:32,830
I tried to focus on my breathing and
take stock of why my pain was so bad.

2107
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:35,110
Even with all the medications
flowing through me,

2108
02:01:35,111 --> 02:01:39,530
it still felt like I was in a
red hot vice. I could hardly it.

2109
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:41,180
I knew Josh would never lie to me,

2110
02:01:41,181 --> 02:01:43,820
but my arms and legs still
felt like they were attached.

2111
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:47,630
My hands felt like they were burning
like someone who was clamping them inside

2112
02:01:47,631 --> 02:01:52,610
of an industrial furnace.
But my hands weren't there.
The flames were eating away.

2113
02:01:52,611 --> 02:01:56,300
My ligaments, my nerves, my skin, my legs,

2114
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:00,920
my phantom legs were clamped in
that same fire bolt's of agony,

2115
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:03,320
surge from limbs that
weren't the register,

2116
02:02:03,321 --> 02:02:06,260
that weren't there and registered
to a brain that's still was.

2117
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:10,520
The pain came and went, came
and went, came and went.

2118
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:17,310
Josh started in his seat and leaned or
starting to seat and lean closer. Travis,

2119
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:20,280
you need me to get the nurse,
nurse. I didn't say anything.

2120
02:02:20,430 --> 02:02:25,080
I was itchy and sweating bad.
He pressed a buzzer than then.

2121
02:02:25,081 --> 02:02:27,600
Went out and got a cool cloth
and laid it on my forehead.

2122
02:02:28,290 --> 02:02:33,290
The nurse came in and upped my morphine
just before I went under again.

2123
02:02:33,870 --> 02:02:36,960
Everything that I'd always drilled
into myself, rushed through my mind.

2124
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:41,580
Never show fear. Never let your
guys see you in pain. Don't cry out.

2125
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:46,620
Even when I'd been lying on the ground
right after the blast, I'd felt pain then,

2126
02:02:46,621 --> 02:02:51,420
but I hadn't showed it when that I was
shoved through my chaff that was chest.

2127
02:02:51,421 --> 02:02:55,620
I was painful, but I wasn't going to
complain. Then you don't let people down.

2128
02:02:55,710 --> 02:02:59,520
You just don't,
but this time the pain was so bad.

2129
02:02:59,790 --> 02:03:04,470
It was still so bad, even with more
pain killers in me now. So bad.

2130
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:06,480
So bad,
so bad.

2131
02:03:07,970 --> 02:03:10,400
This time I want to do the unthinkable.

2132
02:03:12,290 --> 02:03:16,280
Two words. Rose then began
to vocalize within my throat,

2133
02:03:17,530 --> 02:03:20,830
Josh. I said, yeah,
what do you need buddy?

2134
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:23,800
I swallowed and whispered to words.

2135
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:26,203
I quit.

2136
02:03:34,030 --> 02:03:38,560
Yeah, not good. I uh, I
don't know what I mean.

2137
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:40,650
Is this a lot of pain? I
guess. I don't know why.

2138
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:42,230
Yeah.

2139
02:03:42,230 --> 02:03:46,280
You know, you sit there any question like,
am I going to be a burden on my family?

2140
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:49,460
Right. Why? How, you know, my wife,
should she stay with me? I mean,

2141
02:03:49,461 --> 02:03:52,190
what do I have left to
offer? Um, my dollar.

2142
02:03:52,191 --> 02:03:55,280
Am I going to be a monster when I get
to see her finally and then it's like,

2143
02:03:55,281 --> 02:03:59,300
why did I live through this? Why did
you know, why not make it, not that I'm,

2144
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:02,930
I guess angry. I lived or at the time,
oh, you know, when that was happening,

2145
02:04:02,931 --> 02:04:06,110
I wasn't so much angry. He's just more
of a question. Like, why, what, what's,

2146
02:04:06,111 --> 02:04:09,440
what's the purpose? Why not just let
me go out. My life gets, you know,

2147
02:04:09,441 --> 02:04:10,730
400,000 from the government and,

2148
02:04:10,731 --> 02:04:13,500
and then she can go remarry and have
somebody that's able bodied and,

2149
02:04:13,810 --> 02:04:17,570
and live a happy life. But, uh, you
know, a lot of questions or you know,

2150
02:04:17,630 --> 02:04:20,240
when you're sitting in the hotel room
or I'm in a hospital bed, you know,

2151
02:04:20,241 --> 02:04:22,760
in a hospital room and you just got
stare at the ceiling the whole time.

2152
02:04:22,761 --> 02:04:26,060
You just never know what would
think in the military. It's easy.

2153
02:04:26,061 --> 02:04:28,100
Everything laid out for you.
This is our mission.

2154
02:04:28,101 --> 02:04:30,050
This is our plan is what we're going
to do is how we're going to get it done

2155
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:31,790
there.
It's just all unknown.

2156
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:36,980
And that pain, like from missing
limbs, it sounds freaking,

2157
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:38,010
oh yeah.

2158
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:40,770
I mean it was, I guess spike
getting drove through my heel, uh,

2159
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:44,940
fingernails getting just ripped off and
then see it and it was just, it was bad.

2160
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:49,410
What causes that? Uh, well, I mean
a lot of it is phantom limb pain.

2161
02:04:49,411 --> 02:04:52,800
So your nerves try to find where
your hands and your feet are.

2162
02:04:52,801 --> 02:04:55,350
And if they can't find it, they try to
redirect and keep trying to find it.

2163
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:58,890
So it's just one excruciating,
you know,

2164
02:04:59,070 --> 02:05:03,720
zap to another and then they, uh,
in, you're probably gonna talk,

2165
02:05:03,721 --> 02:05:08,130
they had like experimental, um, things,
they try it on me cause it was so bad.

2166
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:13,000
And after the second one, they tried, um,
I was like, oh, I feel a little better.

2167
02:05:13,001 --> 02:05:16,950
And then the doctor like was all excited.
Then I was like, oh no, the pain's back.

2168
02:05:16,951 --> 02:05:20,880
And I went, you know, got all yelling
out in pain and stuff. And he just,

2169
02:05:20,881 --> 02:05:21,541
he actually cried.

2170
02:05:21,541 --> 02:05:25,260
He felt so bad because it was to the
point where they've got to find some cure

2171
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:30,420
or I'm going to be so,
um, um, just in the agony.

2172
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:34,740
Yeah. Agony. Or I'll be
so used to the medication,

2173
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:38,550
um, that the doses are going to get to
the point where I'm just gonna Odi on him,

2174
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:42,270
you know, because I'm going
to be so, so, uh, a customer,

2175
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:44,460
I can't think of the word
right now. It's killing me. Uh,

2176
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:48,150
like you're talking to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2177
02:05:48,151 --> 02:05:52,710
My tolerance would be so high that
I'm just going to end up Odeon. Damn.

2178
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:56,640
Of course. I was kind of like, you know,

2179
02:05:56,641 --> 02:05:58,210
you're wondering where you
get your sense of humor.

2180
02:05:59,170 --> 02:06:02,320
You're telling your dad what happened
and you're like, I stepped on a mine,

2181
02:06:02,321 --> 02:06:06,640
went flying through the air. I did a
one 80. It was crazy. Well, Travis,

2182
02:06:06,700 --> 02:06:10,720
my dad said, the important question
is, did you look good doing it?

2183
02:06:11,250 --> 02:06:14,120
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think I did.

2184
02:06:15,970 --> 02:06:20,440
Yeah. Um, and meanwhile, Kelsey,

2185
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:25,720
she, she, you know, you've been voice in
some of these concerns like about, hey,

2186
02:06:25,721 --> 02:06:28,610
can I even be a good dad now can,
I'm not going to be a burden.

2187
02:06:28,611 --> 02:06:33,610
You're kind of telling Josh some of those
things and she told or he told Kelsey

2188
02:06:34,210 --> 02:06:35,380
and here we go back to the book.

2189
02:06:35,381 --> 02:06:38,320
My brother told me that Travis has nervous
to see me because he doesn't know how

2190
02:06:38,321 --> 02:06:40,930
I will react or if I will continue
to love him as my husband.

2191
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:45,160
These worries seem so trivial
to me because I will love
him through sickness and

2192
02:06:45,161 --> 02:06:46,780
health until death do us part.

2193
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,470
I did not use those words
lightly when we got married.

2194
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:53,710
I will be biased side everyday
for the rest of our lives,

2195
02:06:53,711 --> 02:06:54,880
whether he likes it or not.

2196
02:06:55,820 --> 02:06:56,260
Yeah,

2197
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:59,470
I know his natural reaction will be to
push me away because of embarrassment or

2198
02:06:59,471 --> 02:07:00,910
feelings of letting me down.

2199
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:05,080
But I just wish I could constantly
reassure him that my love for him is

2200
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:06,070
unwavering.

2201
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:13,150
Yeah. Well I mean when I saw her, I told
her she should go. I said, you know, hey,

2202
02:07:13,151 --> 02:07:16,090
you should take what we have. The house
is yours, the cars are your cell mine,

2203
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:18,340
you know,
whatever and do what you need to do.

2204
02:07:18,341 --> 02:07:21,730
And I'll financially fund whenever
I can, you know? And she was like,

2205
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:26,020
that's not how this works.
I want the handicap parking.

2206
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:28,750
You know what she said?
So I was like,

2207
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:32,180
man,
you are,

2208
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:36,100
there's like a level of luck

2209
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:40,330
involved when you get married.
I don't care who you are.
Um, oh. You know, like do,

2210
02:07:40,331 --> 02:07:44,410
you could easily marry like Satan,
you know, and I know, I know you,

2211
02:07:44,411 --> 02:07:48,070
I know plenty of guys that have made some
really bad came and call bad decisions

2212
02:07:48,071 --> 02:07:49,630
because it's just like, oh, okay,

2213
02:07:49,631 --> 02:07:52,990
I understand if you have this great coding
thing and all that and your whatever

2214
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:55,240
that you can make a good decision,
then that's great.

2215
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:57,520
But like a lot of guys in the military,
you're young and you're like,

2216
02:07:57,521 --> 02:07:57,911
you know what,

2217
02:07:57,911 --> 02:08:01,600
we're getting married and there's
just like a flip of the coin and you,

2218
02:08:01,630 --> 02:08:05,290
you got a saint. I mean, I literally
did, I'm like 17 days in person,

2219
02:08:05,291 --> 02:08:06,460
you know what would be great.

2220
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:09,380
We just went to Mexico and that was how
we were gonna get married and then we

2221
02:08:09,381 --> 02:08:12,490
just got married. Yeah, let's do that.
That'd be a great story for everybody.

2222
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:13,570
Whether it works or not.

2223
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:19,180
Then you scored for sure.
Uh,

2224
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:24,670
she got lucky to have me too. Well, I
didn't really pick that up, but um, okay.

2225
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:27,970
We'll go with it. Yeah. Moving on. Hey,

2226
02:08:27,971 --> 02:08:29,590
I wasn't when you've saw
Chloe for the first time,

2227
02:08:29,591 --> 02:08:30,910
so you need didn't get
back to Walter Reed?

2228
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:34,920
I did, yeah. April
17th. I got back and um,

2229
02:08:35,940 --> 02:08:38,700
the first time I got to see Kelsey
wasn't that hallmark moment, you know,

2230
02:08:38,701 --> 02:08:40,830
it's like, oh my gosh, I love
you so much. It was actually,

2231
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:45,990
I was getting rushed in my really one
of my right leg ripped open and they're

2232
02:08:45,991 --> 02:08:46,561
like,
Mrs. Mills,

2233
02:08:46,561 --> 02:08:48,720
you're in charge of his medical history
now you have to sign this piece of paper.

2234
02:08:49,140 --> 02:08:51,180
Um, he has to get two inches
of conference, right leg.

2235
02:08:51,181 --> 02:08:55,350
We need your consent consent. And she's
like, what? And she almost passes out in,

2236
02:08:55,351 --> 02:08:57,450
they're like, Mrs. Mills. I'm like, Kelsey
just signed the paper and I'm yelling,

2237
02:08:57,451 --> 02:08:58,770
just sign the paper.
It's okay.

2238
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:02,040
And she signs and that's the first time
I got to see her. Just real quick. Yup.

2239
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:02,970
Go ahead and hack them up.

2240
02:09:03,390 --> 02:09:07,620
And they went and took my leg two inches
off on the right and reseal that next

2241
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:08,610
day is when I tell her like,
you know,

2242
02:09:08,611 --> 02:09:12,570
this isn't probably anything
that you signed up for you.
You can go and, you know,

2243
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:15,330
you're not, it's no big deal. I'm not
worried about it. And she's like, nope,

2244
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:18,330
not how this works. We'll get through
this together. And then they, you know,

2245
02:09:18,450 --> 02:09:21,510
they induced me into this coma later on
because the pain was so bad and I was

2246
02:09:21,511 --> 02:09:24,810
getting my tolerance level built
up for the pain meds. And, uh,

2247
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:28,530
she sat with my bed like 20 hours a day
and not knowing I wasn't gonna wake up

2248
02:09:28,531 --> 02:09:30,330
for five days,
we're gonna put them out for five days.

2249
02:09:30,530 --> 02:09:33,470
So yeah. So this was crazy. Uh,
reading about in the book, you,

2250
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:37,640
you're in such horrible, horrible
pain, like undescribable pain.

2251
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,530
Is this basically an experimental thing
procedure that they did on you? Yeah,

2252
02:09:42,531 --> 02:09:46,910
I'm the second in the nation. Never have
the ketamine coma in 30th in the world.

2253
02:09:47,510 --> 02:09:49,010
And Sonic case studies on me.

2254
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:54,040
The ketamine coma is 600 mellow
milligrams of ketamine per hour.

2255
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:59,570
Yeah. So it goes around the clock
as well. It is based on that

2256
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:03,360
wait and things. So I'm sure like
different measurements. But, uh, they,

2257
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:07,740
when they did it, you go in and
then it just circulates through.

2258
02:10:07,741 --> 02:10:10,620
It's supposed to reset your brain to
think where your nerves is and where they

2259
02:10:10,621 --> 02:10:15,240
end and you know, you come out and
it's just loose knit like crazy.

2260
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:17,430
And getting on TV is
what was real life to me.

2261
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:20,190
Yeah, no the, I'll, I'll hit some
highlights from your hallucinate.

2262
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:22,290
Cause when you get,
when you get done out of the coma,

2263
02:10:22,350 --> 02:10:25,650
you're in a coma for five days,
which is just black. Nothing, right?

2264
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:30,660
There's no nothing, nothing there. Then
you go into hallucinations. You got um,

2265
02:10:31,050 --> 02:10:32,850
chasing kids that stole things from,

2266
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:38,180
you got gangas con that you're out with
Gangas con you're a swat team is coming

2267
02:10:38,181 --> 02:10:39,014
to get you.

2268
02:10:39,110 --> 02:10:43,970
You got you and your cousins are riding
skateboards in a TV reality show.

2269
02:10:44,150 --> 02:10:47,570
You've got yourself playing
hockey in the NHL. Um,

2270
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:51,100
I was particularly concerned about a 50
year old go go dancer that crawled on a

2271
02:10:51,101 --> 02:10:55,540
leash down the hallway of Walter Reed.
That one made me a little bit nervous. Uh,

2272
02:10:55,610 --> 02:11:00,590
the service dog, apparently
Kramer from Seinfeld stops by. So,

2273
02:11:00,591 --> 02:11:04,280
so you go through these massive
hallucinations that that's freaking weird.

2274
02:11:04,620 --> 02:11:04,861
Yeah,

2275
02:11:04,861 --> 02:11:08,910
I mean it got to the point where I'm
getting on my tangents and they said for

2276
02:11:08,911 --> 02:11:11,310
the first like seven days,
you know it's going to be bad.

2277
02:11:11,311 --> 02:11:12,690
Then after that it'll start to fade out.

2278
02:11:12,691 --> 02:11:15,630
In that 10 days you should be able to
tell when you're having one or not.

2279
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:17,700
But I remember my final,

2280
02:11:17,701 --> 02:11:20,190
I'll come in one morning and the caps
game was on the night before and I was

2281
02:11:20,191 --> 02:11:22,190
watching it. I was like, I scored
nine goals with Ovechkin vegetarian.

2282
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:24,360
I had a triple hat trick. He's
like, oh that's, that's great.

2283
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:28,320
And then I thought the way I got blown
up when I woke up the very first day,

2284
02:11:28,321 --> 02:11:31,620
I thought that this guy from my hometown
made a derogatory comment towards my

2285
02:11:31,621 --> 02:11:32,850
mom, my wife, my daughter,

2286
02:11:32,851 --> 02:11:35,880
and my buddy's not jumped in the car and
chased him and went off the road and I

2287
02:11:35,881 --> 02:11:37,470
smacked a tree and I
killed my two best friends.

2288
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:43,110
And like I made my mom and my wife
like full on. Oh leaved those 100%.

2289
02:11:43,140 --> 02:11:46,350
I told my brother and all of the story
just in intently or intense as I told my

2290
02:11:46,351 --> 02:11:49,320
wife, and he listens like, oh yeah.
And everybody just going with it.

2291
02:11:49,321 --> 02:11:50,970
And so I try to like argue
with me and they're like,

2292
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:52,283
we're just gonna go with this.

2293
02:11:52,770 --> 02:11:55,720
And I called them my buddy's a
message and I'm like, I am so I,

2294
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:57,120
I hope you're not dead.

2295
02:11:58,410 --> 02:12:00,960
And then I finally came out of his
nation and I realized what happened to my

2296
02:12:00,961 --> 02:12:03,720
brother. And I walked back in. I was
like, Hey man, thanks you dick is, well,

2297
02:12:03,810 --> 02:12:06,240
I didn't want to tell you any different
when I was like, yeah, no, I understand.

2298
02:12:06,530 --> 02:12:10,050
You know, that's like, don't text
when you're drunk or whatever. Yeah.

2299
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:13,370
Don't call people leave messages and
when you're on seven day hallucinate.

2300
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:16,280
Yeah. Trips. And I only left two messages,
but they're two of my best friends.

2301
02:12:16,281 --> 02:12:18,410
So it was cool. And both them
was, I'm sorry I killed Judah,

2302
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:21,230
the hey man over on you. I
think I killed you. And, uh,

2303
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:24,050
and then I got to a point where
I get to tell what was going on.

2304
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:29,410
So like I started having another one, um,
and I was like, oh, that's hallucination.

2305
02:12:29,450 --> 02:12:31,490
And then finally I get to a
point I was playing with people,

2306
02:12:31,491 --> 02:12:33,710
like Josh was in my room and I was
like, Josh, he goes, what? He goes,

2307
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:37,220
I see dead people. I said, what? You're
serious? I'm like, no, I'm just kidding.

2308
02:12:37,740 --> 02:12:40,790
I was like, okay. And that's our
looking at the ceiling. I was like, oh,

2309
02:12:40,791 --> 02:12:43,250
they're all around me. He's like, w
w where, where? I'm like, oh my gosh,

2310
02:12:43,251 --> 02:12:44,820
Josh Turner Ward.
And I like jabbed him.

2311
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:51,870
So I started messing people once I got
the hang of it. Oh, that's awesome. Uh,

2312
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:54,500
and that kind of like did it
though, right? Yeah. Yeah.

2313
02:12:54,501 --> 02:12:58,250
So I did about five more months of
pain pills. Um, and then finally,

2314
02:12:58,251 --> 02:12:59,030
like in October,

2315
02:12:59,030 --> 02:13:01,910
I was home for Thanksgiving in North
Carolina at my house at Fort Bragg.

2316
02:13:01,911 --> 02:13:04,610
And I was just like, you know what, Kelsey
came, I was, I don't want him anymore.

2317
02:13:04,611 --> 02:13:08,270
I'm done. Just like, you can't just quit
these. And I said, no, I really, I'm done.

2318
02:13:08,271 --> 02:13:11,750
So I was like five days of pain and
then now, no medication, nothing.

2319
02:13:11,751 --> 02:13:15,860
I'm good to go. So the ketamine
coma and my documentary, you know,

2320
02:13:15,861 --> 02:13:18,580
it says I wouldn't do it again,
but that was five months after the fact.

2321
02:13:18,590 --> 02:13:22,370
I was still like doing pain pills and
stuff or four months after the fact I

2322
02:13:22,371 --> 02:13:25,790
guess, cause they're in September. Um,
but looking back like that was the best,

2323
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:28,520
the best thing for me to get me past the,
you know,

2324
02:13:28,521 --> 02:13:32,070
the pain part and then onto my
recovery was a second person that ever

2325
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:35,760
had that done, I guess in the
nation. That's crazy. Yeah. Um,

2326
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:40,200
either there's a great talking about your
kind of transition mentally going back

2327
02:13:40,201 --> 02:13:42,660
to the book back in normal days.
I love the challenge.

2328
02:13:42,661 --> 02:13:45,270
The quest to succeed in the army
has always been a challenge for me.

2329
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:49,860
My situation now as a quadruple amputee
held out the same sort of dare to

2330
02:13:49,861 --> 02:13:52,620
succeed. Sure. If I could
have changed things,

2331
02:13:52,740 --> 02:13:56,220
I wouldn't have been in this situation,
but I couldn't change things.

2332
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:59,520
Being a quadruple amputee
was my new reality.

2333
02:14:00,690 --> 02:14:04,020
I could quit for good.
I could shut myself off from the world.

2334
02:14:04,830 --> 02:14:06,240
I could will myself to die,

2335
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:11,910
or I could fight forward
and keep on living legit.

2336
02:14:12,390 --> 02:14:15,900
Well, I mean, it came down to a
choice at the end of the day. Um,

2337
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:18,060
I was still here and my wife's
gonna say by my side, my daughter,

2338
02:14:18,061 --> 02:14:19,860
who I think's gonna think I'm a monster,
still laughs.

2339
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:23,340
The snuggles up with me and you know, I
mean, when she first saw me, I thought,

2340
02:14:23,341 --> 02:14:26,110
she's gonna be really afraid. But then
short arms, short legs, fuzzy chest,

2341
02:14:26,111 --> 02:14:28,800
I looked like a teddy bear. He's
like, oh no, we're totally, you know,

2342
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:32,640
but this one can talk.
Yeah, cool. In their active,

2343
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:35,400
I've never been stern with my mom.
I did write my mom's nose one time,

2344
02:14:35,670 --> 02:14:38,100
the whole different story.
Karate.

2345
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:40,020
I know my dad and me were
slap boxing in the kitchen,

2346
02:14:40,021 --> 02:14:43,080
which meant I was 17 my dad was trying
to mess with me, but if I slapped back,

2347
02:14:43,081 --> 02:14:45,660
you'd be like, Dude, you can
take me. And I'm like, no,
brother. We were just playing.

2348
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:47,410
But he slapped me.
My Mom's behind me.

2349
02:14:47,411 --> 02:14:51,450
And I caught the back of my head
and the scariest day of my life, um,

2350
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:56,220
you don't make her mad and, but anyway,
so I was only started one time, my mom,

2351
02:14:56,221 --> 02:14:58,800
I woke up, you know, and I suppose to
get all the rest I could and I said,

2352
02:14:58,801 --> 02:15:00,570
where's Chloe at? She was like,
oh, they already came to visit,

2353
02:15:00,571 --> 02:15:03,330
but you were sleeping. I was like, don't
ever let me sleep through that again.

2354
02:15:03,331 --> 02:15:05,700
That's the whole reason that I'm
able to still keep functioning.

2355
02:15:05,701 --> 02:15:09,060
It's because of my daughter and you
know, uh, being there and my wife.

2356
02:15:09,061 --> 02:15:10,270
But you know,

2357
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:13,770
the mental part was the worst at four
o'clock to eight o'clock at night,

2358
02:15:13,771 --> 02:15:17,020
I can have the lights on in my, in
my apartment, something to do with,

2359
02:15:17,021 --> 02:15:20,100
I thought it was like the operating
table. I start sweating real bad. I just,

2360
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:22,620
I mean now I'm fine, but it
was the first, I don't know,

2361
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:25,410
probably five to six months. I was
just like, no lights at this time.

2362
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,410
It's quiet out work and things like that.
And Man,

2363
02:15:28,411 --> 02:15:31,620
I started watching like I watched
a video of you as you are training,

2364
02:15:31,621 --> 02:15:35,670
as you are now relearning everything.
I never really understood when people say,

2365
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:38,620
Oh, you got to read, you got to relearn
to walk and you've got to realize,

2366
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:40,500
and I didn't really make sense of it,

2367
02:15:40,501 --> 02:15:43,350
but it's really clear to see
when you watch your progression,

2368
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:45,120
what that looked like.

2369
02:15:45,121 --> 02:15:49,980
Like how you are clearly relearning how
to walk. Like I never understood that.

2370
02:15:49,981 --> 02:15:52,950
But when you watch the videos and
the progression that you made,

2371
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:57,540
you can see that that's what it looks
like when you first stood up. I'm like,

2372
02:15:57,780 --> 02:15:59,340
Oh yeah,
it looks like he's learning how to Walker.

2373
02:15:59,350 --> 02:16:03,420
And sure enough you got better and better
and it's pretty amazing. And, and uh,

2374
02:16:03,421 --> 02:16:06,540
two things you're going to find out. When
I was going through my, uh, recovery,

2375
02:16:06,541 --> 02:16:09,240
the first thing I learned how to walk
with my daughter. We're just kind of cool.

2376
02:16:09,241 --> 02:16:11,670
They got me little short legs and I was
stumbling around and she was stumbling

2377
02:16:11,671 --> 02:16:13,980
around and we're holding hands.
And the next thing you found out,

2378
02:16:13,981 --> 02:16:18,260
my love for Philly cheese steaks because
I do less workouts and stuff like that.

2379
02:16:18,270 --> 02:16:19,560
The Gym, you know, as you go.

2380
02:16:19,561 --> 02:16:23,400
But I went from two 50 to one 40 and I
was real skinny and then all of a sudden

2381
02:16:23,401 --> 02:16:26,130
I started getting fatter and fatter
and fatter because the Lyrica and the

2382
02:16:26,131 --> 02:16:28,800
medication and I was just like,
oh, I love Philly cheese steaks.

2383
02:16:28,801 --> 02:16:30,010
So I'm trying to work on that

2384
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:34,030
now. But my progression as I got
better, I got fat or too embarrassing.

2385
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:39,130
And you got a visit from a guy named Todd
nicely [inaudible] and that must have

2386
02:16:39,131 --> 02:16:41,560
helped out a lot. Uh,
my competitive edge did.

2387
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:45,280
He walked in and on his fake legs and to
fake arms and he first thing out of his

2388
02:16:45,281 --> 02:16:48,160
mouth was, hey man, welcome to the club.
I was like, I don't be in your club.

2389
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,550
Is it kind of late now, don't you think?
And I looked at myself and I said, right,

2390
02:16:51,590 --> 02:16:54,600
you got me there? And uh,
as you walked over and said,

2391
02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:57,040
you want a ginger ale
and you heard me wrong.

2392
02:16:57,070 --> 02:17:01,180
And he went over to the counter or
the sink in our neath. The sink was,

2393
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:04,900
was a 12 pack of Ginger Ale. I got
hooked on it, like crack at the hospital.

2394
02:17:05,290 --> 02:17:08,590
I got off it now, but either
way, he bends down on one knee,

2395
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:12,460
bends down on his other knee, reaches
out with his fake hand, gets it out,

2396
02:17:12,670 --> 02:17:15,550
pops the top, his other arm and walks
over and hands and he goes, here you go.

2397
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:17,500
I'm like, oh no. I was
asking if you wanted one,

2398
02:17:17,501 --> 02:17:20,860
but before I had the full sentence out,
I said, how'd you do that? He's like,

2399
02:17:20,861 --> 02:17:23,770
Hey man, I'm Todd and I'm the second ever
welcomed the club. You're the fourth,

2400
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:27,310
a quadruple amputee to make it back home.
You're going to be fine.

2401
02:17:27,550 --> 02:17:31,120
I live in Missouri with my wife. I drive,
I have a boat, I do whatever I want.

2402
02:17:31,121 --> 02:17:35,050
I walk. It just takes
time. And uh, he's like,

2403
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:37,300
I'll even work out with you
tomorrow. You know, this is like,

2404
02:17:37,630 --> 02:17:41,380
I'm still thinking I'm an hallucination
mode. This is like maybe eight,

2405
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:44,980
nine days after my elders, my,
uh, ketamine coma, and he's like,

2406
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:47,470
I'll work out with you tomorrow. So
the doctors come in and I'm like, Hey,

2407
02:17:47,471 --> 02:17:50,530
I got to work out today. And they're like,
you can't work out. Yeah. And I was like,

2408
02:17:50,531 --> 02:17:53,290
no, no, seriously, I've been in, I'm going
to work out with Todd nicely. He said,

2409
02:17:53,291 --> 02:17:55,180
I can work out at one o'clock. And
they're like, well, you're not ready.

2410
02:17:55,690 --> 02:17:57,880
And I had to let him know, I was like,
I don't know what you don't get, buddy.

2411
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:01,120
I'm working out today. And
he said, I'll think about it.

2412
02:18:01,121 --> 02:18:04,030
So I call them every half hour, four
hour straight to find set. I could.

2413
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:07,500
And I went and met Todd and Todd did a
workout and I laid on my stomach with the

2414
02:18:07,510 --> 02:18:10,510
pelvis, a pat [inaudible] are
under my stomach or whatever.

2415
02:18:10,511 --> 02:18:13,810
So that stretched my pelvis muscle back
out and he'd pat on the back and I fell

2416
02:18:13,811 --> 02:18:16,870
asleep. 20 minutes. Best
workout I've ever done. But, um,

2417
02:18:16,900 --> 02:18:21,680
I started my recovery that day. And
then as far as the physical, as easy as,

2418
02:18:21,790 --> 02:18:25,510
you know, I like the physical challenge.
The mental was the hardest part for me.

2419
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:27,940
I mean, bar none. It was,
it was the worst. You know,

2420
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:30,220
I couldn't look at myself in the mirror
for a while there because I didn't like

2421
02:18:30,221 --> 02:18:34,360
what I saw. You don't see, you
might, my arm's gone. The scars, um,

2422
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:39,250
just the overall message that I was and
I'm thinking now is going to be a burden

2423
02:18:39,251 --> 02:18:43,120
and all that. So it just, that's just
how it went. So the more capable you got,

2424
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:47,470
the more comfortable you got
in your new skin. Yeah. Well,

2425
02:18:47,471 --> 02:18:51,170
I've found out that they let you go for
one hour and then a physical therapy in

2426
02:18:51,171 --> 02:18:54,010
the one hour of occupational therapy
and then they let me do another one and

2427
02:18:54,011 --> 02:18:57,400
another one. It turned into
four hours of, of each.

2428
02:18:57,430 --> 02:19:00,220
So eight hours put in eight hours
a day at the gym in my recovery.

2429
02:19:00,850 --> 02:19:03,820
Well at the gym and occupational therapy,
learning how to use my hands,

2430
02:19:03,821 --> 02:19:07,890
how to wash myself again, how to dress
myself again, uh, learn how to drive,

2431
02:19:07,910 --> 02:19:12,100
learned how to do all that stuff.
But it took 19 months of at Walter Reed,

2432
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:16,330
13 months in paperwork was after
that to get out. But government,

2433
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:22,250
uh, and you, you, um,

2434
02:19:25,110 --> 02:19:30,080
you eventually went and met your guys
when they came though. That's awesome.

2435
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:34,370
I did, I set some goals. Um, when
I was in the hospital, my birthday,

2436
02:19:34,371 --> 02:19:37,370
I called my life, my mom and dad
and I was basically really short.

2437
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:39,950
Hey guys was up and find love you.
Bye. That's all I wanted to say.

2438
02:19:39,951 --> 02:19:42,410
I didn't want to talk and
have a conversation and go
over what happened to me.

2439
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:45,920
Um, I kept it very short, but
I told my brother and I said,

2440
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:47,750
I have to call my guys in my unit.

2441
02:19:47,810 --> 02:19:50,690
You need to find the number to my
strong point and let me talk to them.

2442
02:19:51,320 --> 02:19:55,160
So there's a pitcher going around
where I had a baseball cap or no,

2443
02:19:55,161 --> 02:19:59,630
I was out on patrol and I had sleeves
rolled up. And a helmet off. Sunglasses.

2444
02:19:59,631 --> 02:20:01,750
I mean everything out of
standards as they, as you know,

2445
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:05,060
they have standards or whatever. And I
got ahold of my sergeant major, I said,

2446
02:20:05,061 --> 02:20:07,400
sergeant major, I'm so sorry. I
understand if you had to take my rank,

2447
02:20:07,770 --> 02:20:09,770
I should have been out of uniform.
I do apologize.

2448
02:20:09,771 --> 02:20:12,380
And now the pictures go in public
and he's like, you're crazy dude.

2449
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:13,910
Like just to get better.
You're fine.

2450
02:20:14,510 --> 02:20:17,510
And then I got ahold of my guys
and I told them guys, I'm fine.

2451
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:20,630
I'll be okay and I'll be there
when you get back from Afghanistan.

2452
02:20:20,631 --> 02:20:24,800
I'll be there at the, you know, the ramp
to give you guys a hug on my tall legs.

2453
02:20:24,950 --> 02:20:28,240
And it took me a while. I got my tall
legs that morning when they got back.

2454
02:20:28,241 --> 02:20:31,310
I had to work out three hours today
and then the tall legs don't bend,

2455
02:20:31,311 --> 02:20:34,190
but like that wasn't wearing now, but
there they make me at least six foot tall.

2456
02:20:34,191 --> 02:20:37,640
Well you can't take those legs. Homeless.
She can stand up when you fall down.

2457
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,850
So the whole day the therapist's walks
up and says stressful and they knock you

2458
02:20:40,851 --> 02:20:44,120
down and you're like, what the
hell? That's not a trustful
I supposed to catch me.

2459
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:46,430
I supposed to close my eyes and trust
you're gonna catch it. And they're like,

2460
02:20:46,431 --> 02:20:49,900
that's the catch. You've
got to get yourself back up.
Therapists are great. No,

2461
02:20:49,910 --> 02:20:53,170
I had, I had two of the best therapists,
uh, that, that you could ask for.

2462
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:55,970
Now I'm carrying and Joe and that
got me back to where I was at,

2463
02:20:55,971 --> 02:20:59,220
but I did meet my guys and the first,
one of the first people I got to hug us,

2464
02:20:59,230 --> 02:21:02,030
doc Bateson, you know, and say,
hey man, thanks for all you did.

2465
02:21:02,210 --> 02:21:06,200
And then you end up doing a five k
five k run.

2466
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:11,280
So [inaudible] got another goal. Yeah. So
Todd nicely came in and when he met me,

2467
02:21:11,281 --> 02:21:13,500
he had four firefighters
also for telling the towers,

2468
02:21:13,501 --> 02:21:16,080
five k to do in New York City.
And they also,

2469
02:21:16,170 --> 02:21:19,080
they partner with Gary Sneeze and they
build houses and things like that for

2470
02:21:19,081 --> 02:21:21,870
guys that have been through traumatic
injuries. And they were like, hey,

2471
02:21:21,871 --> 02:21:23,850
we're going to have a five k in
September where we're going and I'll,

2472
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:27,600
we'll push you. I'm like,
I'll walk it. They're like,
wow, yeah, but we'll push you.

2473
02:21:27,601 --> 02:21:29,140
It's no big deal. And I was
like, no, you don't understand.

2474
02:21:29,141 --> 02:21:31,680
Like I'm just gonna walk it. And
like, well you don't have legs yet,

2475
02:21:31,681 --> 02:21:32,820
but if you do walk it,
that's cool.

2476
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:36,630
So I went up to New York City after my
daughter's birthday the day after and

2477
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:40,680
walk the five k, uh, I came out of the
Brooklyn Battery Tunnel Thinking, okay,

2478
02:21:40,681 --> 02:21:43,730
I'm going to sit down now.
Like, I'm tired, my back hurts.
I've got a mile, you know,

2479
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:46,050
1.2 miles or something to go my right leg.

2480
02:21:46,051 --> 02:21:49,860
I had completely rubbed raw
bleeding inside my socket
and I was like, it's good.

2481
02:21:49,890 --> 02:21:54,690
I've, I've met a goal, I've walked
over to, you know, two miles now. And,

2482
02:21:54,691 --> 02:21:56,820
uh,
I came out of the tunnel there,

2483
02:21:56,870 --> 02:22:00,600
343 firefighters with banners around their
neck for nine 11. I thought, Jeez, okay,

2484
02:22:00,601 --> 02:22:03,210
well if those guys and gals can go up
down this flight of stairs and then

2485
02:22:03,330 --> 02:22:06,900
ultimately die, um, you know, trying to
save lives, I can finish this. So I did,

2486
02:22:07,230 --> 02:22:10,590
I was sore, it was bad,
but I didn't finish it.

2487
02:22:11,570 --> 02:22:12,403
And then,
um,

2488
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:17,660
eventually you're like you said you're
driving now you went out and did like

2489
02:22:17,661 --> 02:22:22,661
mountain biking and skiing and all this
other kind of just getting after it

2490
02:22:23,001 --> 02:22:26,220
basically for better or
for of a better term.

2491
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:29,940
Um, and then you, and then you
retire, you retire from the,

2492
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,880
from the army and,
and what's your next move?

2493
02:22:32,881 --> 02:22:35,940
Your next move is you figured out you're
going to get a house and you're gonna

2494
02:22:35,941 --> 02:22:40,450
move to, I had to move to Maine. My
wife is from Maine originally. Uh,

2495
02:22:40,470 --> 02:22:43,850
the heat doesn't do well with amputees
cause your blood circulates faster. You,

2496
02:22:43,880 --> 02:22:46,800
it comes back warmer when you
really see it from your body's head,

2497
02:22:46,801 --> 02:22:48,250
hands and feet. So I'm missing, you know,

2498
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:50,610
four of the five and then
my legs are capped off.

2499
02:22:50,611 --> 02:22:52,920
So if I wear pants or for wear shorts,
it's the same.

2500
02:22:53,010 --> 02:22:56,860
There's no air hitting a third
of my body. And uh, yeah. So we,

2501
02:22:56,900 --> 02:22:58,980
we decided we're going to move to Maine.
Um,

2502
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:03,510
we didn't start a nonprofit to help with
care packages at first and then we grew

2503
02:23:03,511 --> 02:23:07,380
it to the retreat center that
we have here in Maine. And, um,

2504
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:10,680
really through my work at Walter Reed,
when I was at Walter Reed,

2505
02:23:10,681 --> 02:23:13,590
I was such an upbeat person as the
same person as before the blast.

2506
02:23:13,591 --> 02:23:16,920
I was still going in and having Casha
Fridays cause it made people annoyed,

2507
02:23:16,921 --> 02:23:21,410
but other people loved it. Having watched
Friday Kesha Fridays I'd go put my,

2508
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:25,650
take my phone, I turn on cash
on Pandora and we just rock out.

2509
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:29,610
And uh, the reason I unfortunately
saw videos of youth like dancing,

2510
02:23:29,670 --> 02:23:33,810
which cannot be on scene, apparently
burned into your retina. You're welcome.

2511
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:36,540
But, uh, you know,

2512
02:23:36,570 --> 02:23:39,420
they started to asked me if I'd meet
people upstairs and it started out, hey,

2513
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:41,220
you know, Travis, we have a guy upstairs,

2514
02:23:41,221 --> 02:23:43,440
I can't tell you his name or his room
number, but if you could talk to them,

2515
02:23:43,441 --> 02:23:47,630
really help, he's not in 41 and he's not
in 43, but if you can find him, you know,

2516
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:48,960
and I'm not a marine, so, you know,

2517
02:23:48,961 --> 02:23:53,580
obviously I'm smart enough to find that
there's number 42, I don't eat crayons.

2518
02:23:53,640 --> 02:23:58,020
Um, but anyways, so I, uh, would go up and
talk to him. Then that turned into like,

2519
02:23:58,021 --> 02:24:01,050
hey, we have PFC Johnson, he's
missing two legs. Um, his mom,

2520
02:24:01,051 --> 02:24:03,510
his mother in law and his two
kids are here. Can you go see him?

2521
02:24:03,570 --> 02:24:06,040
I told him you'd be up
around this time. And, uh,

2522
02:24:06,070 --> 02:24:09,270
that's how the book got started
and my documentary got started.

2523
02:24:09,330 --> 02:24:12,180
And then the foundation was just cause
all the nonprofits at Walter Reed doing

2524
02:24:12,181 --> 02:24:14,970
great things. Kelsey and I wanted to
give back some way, shape or form.

2525
02:24:14,971 --> 02:24:19,950
And this is how we've decided that
we can get back the best. Yeah. So,

2526
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:23,910
um, what, tell tell us
more about the foundation.

2527
02:24:24,690 --> 02:24:27,690
So the Travis Mills Foundation was
started really just for care packages

2528
02:24:27,691 --> 02:24:31,110
overseas and then I went out to Colorado
or how to go downhill mountain biking

2529
02:24:31,111 --> 02:24:31,950
and doing things.

2530
02:24:32,010 --> 02:24:35,040
And then I realized that Walter Reed
does a great job of taking the service

2531
02:24:35,041 --> 02:24:39,240
member out there. The only thing that
the government, uh, doesn't lack,

2532
02:24:39,241 --> 02:24:41,880
but because of the funds
have to go to the soldiers.

2533
02:24:41,970 --> 02:24:45,090
They don't get to bring all the families
like my wife got to go cause I needed

2534
02:24:45,091 --> 02:24:46,680
assistance and things.

2535
02:24:46,681 --> 02:24:49,050
But a lot of the guys that could take
care of themselves couldn't bring their

2536
02:24:49,051 --> 02:24:51,240
loved ones and that's fine.
That's okay.

2537
02:24:51,750 --> 02:24:55,140
But we thought we could do
something in that, in that space.

2538
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:58,320
My whole reason for getting better,
it was my wife and my daughter easily.

2539
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,660
So we started bringing families out.

2540
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:04,170
We did it for one week of a year and we
brought families out and show them how

2541
02:25:04,171 --> 02:25:06,270
to do things,
adaptively Kayak and canoe and things.

2542
02:25:06,470 --> 02:25:08,760
And then we did another one and
it went so well. We thought, well,

2543
02:25:08,761 --> 02:25:10,620
we should buy a property.
So we bought a property,

2544
02:25:10,900 --> 02:25:14,570
it's supposed to be a $500,000 project.
Now it's a $3 million project. Uh,

2545
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:17,070
we did our first week of program,
or I mean your first year programs.

2546
02:25:17,071 --> 02:25:21,270
This year we did seven weeks, 56
families and we bring them up. Uh,

2547
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:24,610
we host eight families per week up to
40 people and we show them how to do

2548
02:25:24,611 --> 02:25:24,911
things.

2549
02:25:24,911 --> 02:25:28,480
We have a place on the water for kayaking
and canoeing and tubing and boating

2550
02:25:28,570 --> 02:25:29,890
and we just,
um,

2551
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:33,160
the horseback riding and archery and
there's all these activities of ropes

2552
02:25:33,161 --> 02:25:36,580
course and we just say, you know what?
I understand what you're going through.

2553
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:39,670
I understand it can get tough. Here's a
network of people that are just like you.

2554
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:41,620
Whether you live in Chicago,
in the inner city,

2555
02:25:41,830 --> 02:25:44,470
or you live in the plains and Montana,
reach out,

2556
02:25:44,750 --> 02:25:47,110
understand that these families are
going through the same thing. Um,

2557
02:25:47,140 --> 02:25:50,650
feel comfortable when you come here
that you can fall out of a kayak and

2558
02:25:50,651 --> 02:25:51,700
nobody's going to freak out.

2559
02:25:51,700 --> 02:25:52,960
They're going to understand
what you're going through.

2560
02:25:53,350 --> 02:25:58,150
And it's just as much of a,
a place for the loved ones.

2561
02:25:58,240 --> 02:25:58,481
You know,

2562
02:25:58,481 --> 02:26:02,080
the wives that can talk to other wives
or our spouses and the kids can run

2563
02:26:02,081 --> 02:26:05,740
around and see the, you know, what my
dad has one leg missing and one arm,

2564
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:07,360
but this dad has two legs missing.

2565
02:26:07,361 --> 02:26:09,820
And that's pretty cool because
they know what we're going through.

2566
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:13,390
And after our first year of operations
and running, it was such a great success.

2567
02:26:13,391 --> 02:26:16,030
We're going to do strategic partnerships
with other nonprofits that share our

2568
02:26:16,031 --> 02:26:20,470
mission and they'll donate what it costs
for a week and they'll run their own uh,

2569
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:21,490
retreats up here as well.

2570
02:26:21,491 --> 02:26:26,320
So we're talking to with gold star
member families as well as PTSD and Tbi.

2571
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:30,040
Cause right now I focus on
limb loss or parallelization,

2572
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:34,270
but this hopefully will run 40 45 weeks
out of the year. It's all donation based.

2573
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:37,990
And the cool thing is like
as the president and the
six other board members I do

2574
02:26:37,991 --> 02:26:41,710
have, we don't take a dime, we never
will. We're auditing ourselves right now.

2575
02:26:41,711 --> 02:26:42,820
So we got on the CFC,

2576
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:45,910
the combined federal campaign
and it's all about giving back.

2577
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:48,680
So it's been really rewarding
and fulfilling and I'm,

2578
02:26:48,681 --> 02:26:53,380
I'm glad to be out there helping these
families cope with their situation and

2579
02:26:53,381 --> 02:26:56,170
tell them that there's other people
out there like you keep going,

2580
02:26:56,171 --> 02:26:59,130
never lived life on the sidelines and
it most importantly never give up and

2581
02:26:59,131 --> 02:26:59,964
never quit.

2582
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:03,050
If people want to help this organization,

2583
02:27:03,350 --> 02:27:04,730
what's the best way for them to do that?

2584
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:06,580
Visit the website,
Travis mills.org.

2585
02:27:06,700 --> 02:27:10,480
It has all the information on the
foundation is wasted. Donate online.

2586
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:12,550
There's ways to do volunteer options.

2587
02:27:12,650 --> 02:27:15,970
We had people fly in just to volunteer
for the week and help us out.

2588
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:20,500
And there's also ways to do corporate
sponsorships. We had Wayfair come in,

2589
02:27:20,501 --> 02:27:24,580
donate all the furniture, new balance came
in donated to us and things like that.

2590
02:27:24,581 --> 02:27:27,730
So we're growing, um, we
believe in our mission.

2591
02:27:27,731 --> 02:27:31,000
We know we can do this and there's other
things we want to get accomplished out

2592
02:27:31,001 --> 02:27:33,640
here. We need to build a
multipurpose center. Uh,

2593
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:36,850
we have a pool going in and things like
that, but it's all about giving back and,

2594
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:37,301
and,
uh,

2595
02:27:37,301 --> 02:27:40,630
the mindset of the service member that
we're trying to host and the family,

2596
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:47,780
the book tough as they come.
That's what we read today. It's a,

2597
02:27:47,790 --> 02:27:51,980
it's a great book. I read was
small chunks of it. Um, yeah,

2598
02:27:51,981 --> 02:27:55,850
you can pick that up, uh,
anywhere where they sell books.

2599
02:27:56,480 --> 02:27:57,650
And what about the documentary?

2600
02:27:58,050 --> 02:28:00,840
So the documentary, it's called
Travis, a soldier's story.

2601
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:05,370
It was done in 2014 and it was actually
a unveiled the Gi film festival.

2602
02:28:05,610 --> 02:28:09,120
And um, we took first place
and 55 short films. Uh,

2603
02:28:09,121 --> 02:28:11,520
I got to meet Marcus and Melanie and
the trail at night. It was really,

2604
02:28:11,550 --> 02:28:15,900
really great to meet them. And now Netflix
is signed to on for a two year run.

2605
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:19,440
So we got on Netflix in May, so if anyone
wants to watch that, it's on Netflix.

2606
02:28:19,470 --> 02:28:23,150
It's called Travis soldier story. Um,
and it just tells the whole story.

2607
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:26,570
It just has iPhone footage of everything
that Kelsey and I went through. Yes.

2608
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:29,180
And the two medics. Cool.
The two Max saved my life.

2609
02:28:29,181 --> 02:28:32,270
I actually are reenacting you getting
blown up and the two guys get hurt are in

2610
02:28:32,271 --> 02:28:33,600
the documentary as well.
Yeah.

2611
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:36,140
And my brother in law saw people that
were there or in the documentary?

2612
02:28:36,230 --> 02:28:36,501
No,

2613
02:28:36,501 --> 02:28:40,010
between the book and watching
the documentary and you
get to see the faces and

2614
02:28:40,011 --> 02:28:44,420
everything. It's really, uh, it's
really cool to real powerful. And, um,

2615
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:50,180
what about social media? How's your
social media presence? Mister popular?

2616
02:28:50,181 --> 02:28:51,014
It's not yours

2617
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:52,190
by any means.
Uh,

2618
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:56,280
W we're about 60,000 in some
strong on our Facebook page.

2619
02:28:56,340 --> 02:28:59,940
I do little videos. Uh, my
daughter learned how to tie
her shoes the other day.

2620
02:28:59,970 --> 02:29:01,410
We taught her in the morning and you know,

2621
02:29:01,411 --> 02:29:04,230
by like we talked at like 7:00 AM by
nine o'clock. She's tying it by herself,

2622
02:29:04,231 --> 02:29:09,120
giving an intro to tying
your shoes online. But just
SSG, Travis mills is my page.

2623
02:29:09,121 --> 02:29:11,910
If you want to check it out, share my
story that, that really helps us out.

2624
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:15,920
And it's Twitter, Instagram, and
Facebook. You're on all three. S S,

2625
02:29:15,921 --> 02:29:20,000
g Travis mills. That's, that's
where you can find it. Um,

2626
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:24,910
yeah. You know, you,

2627
02:29:24,970 --> 02:29:28,130
you put the, the last thing in the
book, like the last line in the book,

2628
02:29:29,030 --> 02:29:32,510
you say to live in freedom, to
go forward, to love your family,

2629
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:37,310
to make something of your life, to
never ever give up, to never quit.

2630
02:29:38,470 --> 02:29:38,630
Yeah.

2631
02:29:38,630 --> 02:29:43,630
That's success. And Yeah,

2632
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:46,280
obviously I'm, in my opinion, if,

2633
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:51,410
if never giving up and never quitting is
the definition of success that I think

2634
02:29:51,411 --> 02:29:54,950
you're the most successful person I've
ever met in my life, brother for real.

2635
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:56,660
Well, I appreciate that. I just,

2636
02:29:57,740 --> 02:29:59,060
we realized that people
that depend on you,

2637
02:29:59,061 --> 02:30:02,120
the people that went into all this
and the lives that are lost. I mean,

2638
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:05,330
you've had a lot of buddies. I'm sure
they didn't make it back home. Um,

2639
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:09,500
my situation is not, not life
ending. My situation is just,

2640
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:11,450
I got a couple more steps in the morning,

2641
02:30:11,451 --> 02:30:13,940
put my legs on Palmyra
Amman and take my daughter.

2642
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,490
Tomorrow is actually my daughter's
orientation at school. I get to take her,

2643
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:19,250
my wife and I just had
a baby. Um, and I named,

2644
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:23,180
I named our little boy after my
two medics, his named Dax, Dax,

2645
02:30:23,181 --> 02:30:25,760
after Daniel Alexander for
the medics that saved my life.

2646
02:30:25,761 --> 02:30:29,990
So thankful to still be here, uh, through
all the smoke in the dirt and the dust.

2647
02:30:30,310 --> 02:30:31,640
Uh, it's all settled now and, um,

2648
02:30:31,700 --> 02:30:34,670
I'm living life to the fullest and doing
the best I can to make sure that people

2649
02:30:34,671 --> 02:30:38,300
understand life goes on and to
never ever give up and never quit.

2650
02:30:40,130 --> 02:30:42,620
Anything else? Any
closing thoughts? I mean,

2651
02:30:42,621 --> 02:30:45,140
I just obviously want to thank
everybody went into this. I mean,

2652
02:30:45,141 --> 02:30:48,070
from my unit on the ground, I know I
was a heavy guy, you know, walk around,

2653
02:30:48,071 --> 02:30:49,470
wait was 400 pounds. So I'd get, you know,

2654
02:30:49,490 --> 02:30:52,430
with all my gear on and all that to
get me out of there was great. Uh,

2655
02:30:52,431 --> 02:30:56,090
this medical staff, doctors,
nurses, um, physical therapists,

2656
02:30:56,091 --> 02:30:59,570
occupational therapists, everybody, uh,
obviously my family that went into it.

2657
02:30:59,571 --> 02:31:01,010
I want to say thanks for
being there with my side,

2658
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:04,970
my beautiful wife and my wonderful
children, um, for, you know,

2659
02:31:04,971 --> 02:31:08,420
really accepting what happened and moving
forward in life and just, uh, you know,

2660
02:31:08,421 --> 02:31:10,880
thereby no, you know, you
can't always affect your,

2661
02:31:10,940 --> 02:31:13,370
your situation you find yourself in,
but you always can affect your attitude.

2662
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:15,410
And that's, that's where
I find the most, uh,

2663
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:19,070
I guess the most realization in
my situation. I can't always,

2664
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:21,360
if I drop something on my hand,
you know,

2665
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:24,660
I can't pick it up right away or I have
to do something weird and get mad about

2666
02:31:24,661 --> 02:31:27,750
it because getting mad doesn't, I'm
getting mad, doesn't do anything.

2667
02:31:27,751 --> 02:31:30,420
So I always try to keep my head two
positive and keep pushing forward.

2668
02:31:31,230 --> 02:31:33,660
But thanks for having me. Also, I want
to thank you for having me on here.

2669
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:36,120
Both the gentleman, I didn't
look at you very much. Oh, sorry.

2670
02:31:36,121 --> 02:31:38,700
I know we talked about this earlier,
but he said not, you said not to.

2671
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:42,420
Yeah. Try not to, that's it's
at your discretion for sure.

2672
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:47,520
I've got to Redo this then so I can look
at you more than you. Okay. But perfect.

2673
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:51,060
Perfect. Yeah. Hey man,
thanks for coming on. Um,

2674
02:31:51,870 --> 02:31:56,430
of course. Thank you for your
service to this great nation,

2675
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:59,700
not only as a soldier and a
leader on the battlefield,

2676
02:32:00,990 --> 02:32:05,990
but for your continued service that you're
doing today for veterans and also for

2677
02:32:08,671 --> 02:32:13,350
the, the gift that I think
you give everybody that
hears about you or comes and

2678
02:32:13,351 --> 02:32:16,230
contacts you with you in any way.
And that is

2679
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:23,120
just a living example of grit
and of determination and of will.

2680
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:27,523
And

2681
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:29,090
I,

2682
02:32:29,090 --> 02:32:34,090
I just think you're the absolute model
of what it means and what people can

2683
02:32:37,011 --> 02:32:37,940
accomplish.

2684
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:39,680
Yeah.

2685
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:42,110
If we do, as you say, and
that is to go forward,

2686
02:32:42,620 --> 02:32:45,830
never give up and never ever quit.

2687
02:32:47,650 --> 02:32:50,140
Thanks for coming on,
Brian. Thanks for having me.

2688
02:32:52,530 --> 02:32:56,500
And after a little administrative break,

2689
02:32:57,400 --> 02:33:00,070
Travis has left the building

2690
02:33:02,650 --> 02:33:07,540
pretty damn awesome.
Yeah. To have him on, man.

2691
02:33:07,720 --> 02:33:10,780
Yeah. Um, yeah.

2692
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:16,140
Any and every excuse that a person
might have as a human being just got

2693
02:33:18,431 --> 02:33:23,230
destroyed. Yeah. Yeah.

2694
02:33:23,270 --> 02:33:28,270
And he really kind of illustrated how
hard it got spread the time when you,

2695
02:33:30,050 --> 02:33:34,690
like when he said, oh, I quit in the
hospital. Yeah. And it's Kinda like,

2696
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:39,250
it makes just kind of when you're around
them now and you see just how he is,

2697
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:44,310
it kind of really brings to
light how good he is now. Yeah.

2698
02:33:44,390 --> 02:33:46,120
You know,
and,

2699
02:33:47,350 --> 02:33:50,560
and he couldn't at that moment in time.

2700
02:33:52,340 --> 02:33:57,010
And when people get into that
darkness, they don't see, they,

2701
02:33:57,390 --> 02:33:58,780
they can't,
they can't see the future.

2702
02:33:59,020 --> 02:34:01,030
They can't see that things are going to
get better. They can't see, you know,

2703
02:34:01,031 --> 02:34:04,780
for him at that point in time, there's
no way it was going to get good. Yeah.

2704
02:34:05,080 --> 02:34:08,890
You know, so yeah. That's
very true. Very true. Yeah.

2705
02:34:08,891 --> 02:34:13,810
Another interesting things that when
you see again where he's like concerned

2706
02:34:13,811 --> 02:34:18,270
about his men and even
when he said I quit, he was
concerned about his wife. Yeah.

2707
02:34:18,290 --> 02:34:22,960
And like that was the significant element,
just totally selfless person.

2708
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:28,540
Awesome. Um, well

2709
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:32,110
speaking of

2710
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:42,820
being awesome. Yeah. Echo Charles,

2711
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:47,440
you're awesome. We think we can talk
about some awesome American made stuff.

2712
02:34:47,650 --> 02:34:50,830
That's a good idea.
I like where you're going with this origin

2713
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:56,290
origin mean.com but yeah,
origin, that's the brand.

2714
02:34:56,350 --> 02:34:59,530
So what is origin were
in league with origin?

2715
02:34:59,531 --> 02:35:02,110
I liked the expression in league with,
by the way,

2716
02:35:03,550 --> 02:35:07,000
I might've told you that before. Yeah,
it's a good way of putting it. Yeah.

2717
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:10,180
So this is straight up.

2718
02:35:10,210 --> 02:35:14,280
The Best American made
apparel in the world. You can,

2719
02:35:14,281 --> 02:35:17,170
you don't have to say the
best American made apparel.

2720
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:20,830
You can say it's the best apparel in
the world and it's American made. Yeah.

2721
02:35:22,090 --> 02:35:24,670
Is that subjective?
I guess it's kind of subjective,

2722
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:27,970
but if you say it's
the best American made,

2723
02:35:28,030 --> 02:35:32,440
well I guess it all technically might
be on a, no. Either way is dope.

2724
02:35:33,060 --> 02:35:36,850
Yeah. And it's all made in America. But
here's the thing about made in America,

2725
02:35:37,060 --> 02:35:39,490
I guess, I don't know, I could
be wrong about this part,

2726
02:35:39,491 --> 02:35:44,050
but technically you could be like, yeah,
they, they sewed these, I don't know,

2727
02:35:44,051 --> 02:35:47,260
pants or whatever, you know,
in America and be like, Hey,

2728
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:51,280
where'd you get the material? Oh, well,
you know, we got it from somewhere else,

2729
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:55,150
not in America, which I guess
is cool. Technically was made.

2730
02:35:55,151 --> 02:35:56,860
It was crafted but not here.

2731
02:35:58,510 --> 02:36:03,070
So you figure what like let's
say a cotton pants, right?

2732
02:36:03,700 --> 02:36:08,170
You get the material from America,

2733
02:36:09,100 --> 02:36:13,120
but how do you make the material, the
actual cotton where it's cotton come from?

2734
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:17,740
You grow it. I used to have a cotton like
trees, like a bunch of them by the way.

2735
02:36:17,741 --> 02:36:22,360
I'm quiet nonetheless. So where do
they get, where does origin get that?

2736
02:36:22,361 --> 02:36:24,190
Cotton America.

2737
02:36:26,260 --> 02:36:29,890
What about the seeds to plant the cotton?
They're from America for sure.

2738
02:36:30,520 --> 02:36:34,030
So straight up from the ground.
The earth.

2739
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:39,090
From the seeds to the pants that you
get in the event of you getting pants.

2740
02:36:40,450 --> 02:36:45,040
Yeah, the way there's other stuff.
There's geese and now owns a good one.

2741
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:49,630
The geese, if you're into
Jujitsu. Nonetheless, the
pants that I got, the joggers,

2742
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:54,190
he was asking me, how do you like
those? And you know the new joggers,

2743
02:36:54,191 --> 02:36:57,760
they're kind of like, they
have a different shape than
the old school sweatpants.

2744
02:36:58,300 --> 02:37:01,210
So I was like, okay. You
know, and I looked into those.

2745
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:06,220
I was telling Pete this story where I
ordered some ironically from overseas,

2746
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:11,170
I ordered them from overseas. They
looked pretty good, so I ordered them.

2747
02:37:11,290 --> 02:37:13,960
Didn't come in. By the way, this
was about a year and a half ago.

2748
02:37:13,961 --> 02:37:17,690
Still didn't come in by the
way, but I looked into it.
I was like, whatever. It is,

2749
02:37:17,691 --> 02:37:21,110
probably not for me. Small Attic, you
know, it's a sign one of those deals.

2750
02:37:21,350 --> 02:37:24,590
Either way I get pizza once. I'm like,
all right, cool. I'm going to try these.

2751
02:37:24,591 --> 02:37:25,424
I put them on

2752
02:37:27,230 --> 02:37:31,850
surprisingly legitimate as far as the look
goes. Cool. It's me pee even said that.

2753
02:37:31,860 --> 02:37:33,410
I'm like,
I look good in them,

2754
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:37,040
which is a lot cause I just kind of
met Pete in person over the past week.

2755
02:37:37,270 --> 02:37:41,990
Anyway, good stuff. Just
saying it's good stuff.

2756
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:45,740
And again, all made in America.
All of it. Uh, some geese on there,

2757
02:37:45,770 --> 02:37:49,550
some cool rash guards,
the George Washington Rash Garden.

2758
02:37:49,610 --> 02:37:54,360
Then I feel like we're ready for that one
to come back. So yeah. So Pete should,

2759
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:57,580
yeah, Jude have that
one. Yeah. Nonetheless.

2760
02:37:57,680 --> 02:38:01,640
Origin main.com and when I say main,

2761
02:38:01,641 --> 02:38:06,260
it's the state Maine. So origin m m
m e, I n e.com. That's a good one.

2762
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:11,300
The best one really when it comes down
to it. Also Jocko has some supplements,

2763
02:38:13,990 --> 02:38:16,360
Krill oil,
which we need

2764
02:38:18,450 --> 02:38:19,480
and joint warfare.

2765
02:38:20,260 --> 02:38:24,880
So really this is like a full
on like joint cause Krill oil,

2766
02:38:24,881 --> 02:38:28,120
Omega threes four. You're going first of
all, yeah. Then join warfare. It's like,

2767
02:38:28,180 --> 02:38:30,610
cause there's a bunch of things
regardless of what you, you think. Yeah.

2768
02:38:30,611 --> 02:38:34,810
Crew oil joints, boom. Good. It's, there's
more to it than that. Just like wow.

2769
02:38:34,870 --> 02:38:36,160
Like glucosomine could.

2770
02:38:36,161 --> 02:38:40,360
It was all like basically all the stuff
that you have been taking for years.

2771
02:38:40,780 --> 02:38:43,390
You said, you know what, let me
come over with my own Jocko formula.

2772
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:47,710
Then we have it now. Boom. Have
it now. Two products, right.

2773
02:38:47,711 --> 02:38:51,850
Super curled joint warfare.
That's the one that's the kit.

2774
02:38:52,190 --> 02:38:56,440
That's the new kit.
As far as kids go also,

2775
02:38:56,980 --> 02:39:00,700
those are also an origin
main.com by the way. Yeah. Yeah.

2776
02:39:00,730 --> 02:39:04,360
Origin main.com also on it,

2777
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:07,720
so you know,
we've been,

2778
02:39:07,721 --> 02:39:11,350
we're on a trip right now in the event
of people not knowing that we're on a

2779
02:39:11,351 --> 02:39:13,390
trip to Maine.
I didn't bring the kettlebells.

2780
02:39:14,450 --> 02:39:15,283
Okay.

2781
02:39:15,490 --> 02:39:18,580
I thought that that, that
might've been too much. Plus,
you know, to check on Kelly,

2782
02:39:18,581 --> 02:39:20,650
they give you 50 pounds,
right in your luggage.

2783
02:39:20,670 --> 02:39:24,970
My kettle bells one you hit a bump more
than 50 pounds nonetheless. 88 pounds.

2784
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:28,840
Yeah. In your case, minus 62. Okay.

2785
02:39:29,140 --> 02:39:33,250
The Werewolf Times 224.
Boom. Math on point.

2786
02:39:34,300 --> 02:39:38,710
There was a guy at the camp that we
went to that brought the kettle bells,

2787
02:39:38,711 --> 02:39:43,480
the 70, whatever one. The guerilla
one from on it. The cool one.

2788
02:39:44,140 --> 02:39:46,660
I didn't, I didn't work out with them
though. I was gonna I want to do,

2789
02:39:46,661 --> 02:39:51,190
I intended to
anyway,

2790
02:39:51,610 --> 02:39:55,720
those gorilla and Werewolf
kettlebells that I'm talking about,

2791
02:39:55,721 --> 02:39:58,990
these are the cool kettlebells
there from on it. Those are

2792
02:40:01,450 --> 02:40:06,090
all kettlebells are good really. But if
you want that level up of coolness, um,

2793
02:40:06,130 --> 02:40:10,120
yeah, I get those ones on it.com/jocko.
Get it jump ropes on there.

2794
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:13,060
The bunch of cool fitness stuff.
If you're lagging in your,

2795
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:18,630
which I do. Sometimes I lag in my
work. Not In lag like physically,

2796
02:40:18,631 --> 02:40:23,160
but um, interest wise, you know
you get kind of bored, not you.

2797
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:26,870
You don't get bored, Huh? No. You just
like go out. Doesn't matter. Right.

2798
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:28,850
It doesn't even register board or not.
Yeah.

2799
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:31,440
Execution is happening to
know what it's about. Yeah.

2800
02:40:31,470 --> 02:40:34,530
Well some of us we get kind of bored
and it's not that we're getting bored so

2801
02:40:34,531 --> 02:40:39,450
we're not going to do it. We're
looking for something like, Oh yeah,

2802
02:40:39,451 --> 02:40:42,960
let me try this new thing,
some new hotness in regards to workouts.

2803
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:48,030
Can you not say new hotness anymore? This
podcast will Smith's it and one of the,

2804
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:51,340
one of them I thought it was cool. It
doesn't like certify it for the podcast.

2805
02:40:51,710 --> 02:40:55,680
I know Bri. I figured I'd try it out
though. Just know that it's been tried.

2806
02:40:55,681 --> 02:40:58,670
It failed next and rejected, huh? Gotcha.

2807
02:40:58,700 --> 02:41:03,180
If you want some new cool stuff to do
in regards to a workout. Hey Man, look,

2808
02:41:03,181 --> 02:41:04,110
audit has all these one,

2809
02:41:04,111 --> 02:41:08,160
they have battle ropes in Macy's in cool
set and they have cool videos on there.

2810
02:41:08,161 --> 02:41:10,350
By the way,
don't get addicted to the website.

2811
02:41:10,890 --> 02:41:14,790
Spin appropriate amounts of time
on the website. Not Too much.

2812
02:41:15,090 --> 02:41:17,820
Remember how you're talking about like
you know when you watch a video on

2813
02:41:17,821 --> 02:41:21,700
youtube and then another one pops up?
Yeah, no, six of them pop up. Yeah.

2814
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:23,420
All all formulated for you.

2815
02:41:23,820 --> 02:41:27,900
Especially picked watch out for that
Weird Youtube Munchkins that are like

2816
02:41:27,901 --> 02:41:30,030
saying, I know what talent
likes. Yeah, that's actually,

2817
02:41:30,031 --> 02:41:34,800
you want to see another street fight
to octa psycho.

2818
02:41:34,980 --> 02:41:36,360
Anyway,
just watch out for that.

2819
02:41:36,370 --> 02:41:40,650
Aren't on the website on the Onnit
website because they videos are real

2820
02:41:40,651 --> 02:41:44,100
interesting. But they're about workouts
though. A lot of them. So it's kind of,

2821
02:41:44,101 --> 02:41:46,980
it's kind of a catch 22
video about working out.

2822
02:41:46,981 --> 02:41:49,660
Does not replace working out
though. No, no, not at all.

2823
02:41:49,690 --> 02:41:51,210
Check and you got to
get after it for sure,

2824
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:55,290
but a lot of options on there anyway on
it.com/chocolate that's the one right

2825
02:41:55,291 --> 02:41:59,400
there. Also. You know what
though? In this camp. So

2826
02:42:01,440 --> 02:42:02,670
some guys came to the camp,

2827
02:42:02,671 --> 02:42:07,671
they brought this 200 pound bag bag of,

2828
02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:10,740
he said it was a sandbag,
but it's like gravel and essentially,

2829
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:13,890
and the challenge is

2830
02:42:15,690 --> 02:42:20,310
to pick it up over your shoulder, 200
pounds. So even that really, I mean,

2831
02:42:21,060 --> 02:42:24,900
that's not that easy. 200 by the way,
when they're explaining it to me,

2832
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:31,830
it was Mike Gerard,
Brian Victor,

2833
02:42:32,330 --> 02:42:35,580
they were exploring, explain it to me.
Well, while they're explaining it to me,

2834
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:37,230
I'm thinking,
okay,

2835
02:42:37,231 --> 02:42:41,400
I know what 150 pound dumbbell
feels like when you lift it up.

2836
02:42:44,410 --> 02:42:48,360
And I'm thinking, could I get that? And
that has a handle and balanced by the way.

2837
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:52,080
So I'm like, shoot, do I though, man, I
don't know if I could do that. Could I?

2838
02:42:52,170 --> 02:42:56,220
Could I do that? And then they're like,
oh yeah, you know, like I've done it.

2839
02:42:56,221 --> 02:42:58,070
And it's like, okay, so
he can be done. Like it's,

2840
02:42:58,120 --> 02:43:01,650
it's obviously not like this thing,
you need years of practice or whatever.

2841
02:43:01,950 --> 02:43:06,510
So I was like, but man, I don't know.
And then sure enough. So it's, yeah.

2842
02:43:06,511 --> 02:43:08,310
When I went and did it,
it was like it was hard.

2843
02:43:08,311 --> 02:43:10,740
I failed the first one I
brought you bring it up,

2844
02:43:10,770 --> 02:43:14,320
you kind bring it onto your lap.
200 pounds, man. That's not like,

2845
02:43:14,650 --> 02:43:15,910
it's like you know how you say when you,

2846
02:43:15,911 --> 02:43:20,911
when you pick up a a a person and
they're just dead weight similar to that.

2847
02:43:23,230 --> 02:43:25,600
Anyway, boom. Failed the first
time they're cheering me on.

2848
02:43:25,660 --> 02:43:27,610
Thanks for that by the way guys.

2849
02:43:27,730 --> 02:43:30,940
That helped me and then the second
time I did it it was, it was good.

2850
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:34,990
One of the high points. Anyway,
that was just a side note. Also,

2851
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:38,080
just a bunch of people
don't have to ask me. Yeah,

2852
02:43:38,470 --> 02:43:42,100
I did not participate in the challenge. I
have an injured rib. That was that. Yeah.

2853
02:43:42,101 --> 02:43:45,130
You've been real happy about that are
still not out of the sheet on your face

2854
02:43:45,131 --> 02:43:49,890
man. Yeah, the ribs almost healed.

2855
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:55,480
Thanks Andy. That was Andy. Andy.
Andy did that to my ribs in a way,

2856
02:43:55,540 --> 02:43:58,060
and this is,
I think you paid a bigger price than me,

2857
02:43:58,061 --> 02:44:03,010
but you messed up my ribbon in
identical way a few months ago. Oh,

2858
02:44:03,011 --> 02:44:07,600
you were gonna get a submission on
me and then you hurt yourself. No,

2859
02:44:07,601 --> 02:44:12,520
I was trying, I was escaping a submission.
So essentially the same situation,

2860
02:44:12,521 --> 02:44:16,190
but instead this time you got the rib
injury instead of the guy that you're

2861
02:44:16,210 --> 02:44:19,510
trying to tap out. So yeah, that's
really in a way, good for you. You know,

2862
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:23,620
and I hope we've all learned something
from this whole thing today anyway,

2863
02:44:25,210 --> 02:44:30,210
also when you buy this book and you
will and should tough as they come,

2864
02:44:32,950 --> 02:44:35,860
tough as they come.
Travis Mills,

2865
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:40,870
get it through our website. That's a good
way to support. I have a little section,

2866
02:44:40,900 --> 02:44:43,870
we have a little section
books from the podcast.

2867
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:47,910
Click on there and it'll be by
episode. This is, um, you know,

2868
02:44:48,540 --> 02:44:51,340
this is a good way to support click
through there at bringing to Amazon.

2869
02:44:51,370 --> 02:44:53,380
Even if you're going to do
any other shopping. Boom.

2870
02:44:53,381 --> 02:44:58,120
Even just as good a way to support
that way. Just click through,

2871
02:44:58,690 --> 02:45:03,550
get the book. That's a good
way. Small action, big reaction.
Small Click, click one,

2872
02:45:03,551 --> 02:45:08,020
two. It's like two more
clicks. Super Swell. Actually
somebody asked me, they said,

2873
02:45:08,021 --> 02:45:11,680
hey, does it really help the podcast
to like do the Amazon Click through?

2874
02:45:12,070 --> 02:45:15,550
And I said, absolutely, it
really does. And I said, well,
like how much? And I said,

2875
02:45:15,610 --> 02:45:17,680
well, it's basically the
way I could describe it.

2876
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:23,120
It's basically the way I could describe
it. Small action, big reaction.

2877
02:45:23,121 --> 02:45:27,840
So Yup. You're very right on
that one. Yes. Yep. You know,

2878
02:45:27,841 --> 02:45:30,370
I just had a feeling from
the beginning that that was,

2879
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:31,690
that's a good way to put it.

2880
02:45:31,810 --> 02:45:35,950
And it is really also
subscribe to the podcast.

2881
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:40,720
It's a good way to support stitcher,
iTunes,

2882
02:45:41,380 --> 02:45:45,880
Google play, all these ones that
provide plot, uh, podcasts, um,

2883
02:45:45,970 --> 02:45:46,870
just seems,
you know,

2884
02:45:46,890 --> 02:45:50,720
it seemed like something that everyone
probably has done already, but you know,

2885
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:53,260
if you haven't subscribed to that one,
that's a good one. If you're in the mood,

2886
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:55,120
leave a review.
That's a good one.

2887
02:45:56,410 --> 02:45:59,530
Some good reviews on there already
and thank you guys for doing that.

2888
02:45:59,531 --> 02:46:04,480
Very colorful. Would you say colorful?
Is that a good, colorful, creative,

2889
02:46:04,580 --> 02:46:08,650
creative? Yeah, that's good. They're
fun to read from time to time.

2890
02:46:08,900 --> 02:46:10,130
Also Youtube,

see what I look like if you're into
that. Um, yeah. Subscribe to the Youtube,

2894
02:46:22,370 --> 02:46:26,960
get up and get a little alert when we
upload a video and just watching what we

2895
02:46:26,961 --> 02:46:27,590
look like.

2896
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:32,570
There's other things that come from the
youtube channel yet that are not on the

2897
02:46:32,571 --> 02:46:34,500
podcast. Subscribe. Yes.

2898
02:46:34,780 --> 02:46:39,770
Whether it's a little augmented videos
that you make with your creative, um,

2899
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:44,630
spin on them. Yeah. There's
just straight excerpts. Right.

2900
02:46:44,840 --> 02:46:47,900
And then there's deleted
scenes. Yeah. Deleted scenes.

2901
02:46:47,960 --> 02:46:51,090
I think I'll put some more on there.
I, there's a few, you know what,

2902
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:54,700
when you kind of go through and I, and I
want, you know, when I edited it right,

2903
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:57,800
so really the edit, the audio
editing process is pretty simple.

2904
02:46:57,801 --> 02:47:02,390
You cut off the beginning, you'll cut
off the end, you faded in, you faded out,

2905
02:47:02,630 --> 02:47:05,540
done. That's it. Easy. Yeah.

2906
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:10,610
But the parts of that I cut off.
There's some, some nuggets in there.

2907
02:47:10,611 --> 02:47:12,740
Interesting stuff.
And you know when you're in the,

2908
02:47:12,741 --> 02:47:14,810
in the moment I'm talking to you,
it's just regular.

2909
02:47:14,811 --> 02:47:17,330
We're just talking and whatever.
Maybe we're laughing, maybe not.

2910
02:47:17,510 --> 02:47:21,980
But when you kind of go back and listen
to it, it's kind of funny. Anyway,

2911
02:47:22,010 --> 02:47:23,870
I'll put some on some of
those on there too. So yeah,

2912
02:47:23,871 --> 02:47:26,690
if you subscribe to the Youtube Channel
you can watch those. Those are cool.

2913
02:47:27,020 --> 02:47:29,540
The excerpts or just kinda
like, um, you know, sharable,

2914
02:47:29,570 --> 02:47:34,460
smaller nuggets of Jocko
wisdom, which is cool. I mean,

2915
02:47:34,461 --> 02:47:37,130
you know, if you don't want to listen
to the whole podcast just for the thing.

2916
02:47:37,590 --> 02:47:39,800
In fact, in fact there was a couple
of people where they're like, yeah,

2917
02:47:39,801 --> 02:47:42,530
I listened to those. They, the guy
at the camp, he was like, yeah,

2918
02:47:42,531 --> 02:47:46,310
I listen to those excerpts like almost
every day. Yeah. Cause they're like, yeah,

2919
02:47:46,430 --> 02:47:48,560
there's a lot of them in there now too.
By the way.

2920
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:53,000
Also Jocko has a store,
it's called Jocko store,

2921
02:47:54,500 --> 02:47:58,790
Jocko store.com. There's some shirts
on there if you want to support.

2922
02:47:58,790 --> 02:48:03,530
So I'm not saying by shirt, I'm
not saying buy a hat. Got Hats on.

2923
02:48:03,531 --> 02:48:06,440
They're now snap back.
Snapped back. My bad.

2924
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:09,410
I thought they were affected was wrong.
You know what the Echo thought it was?

2925
02:48:09,411 --> 02:48:11,720
Flex fit.
Trucker hats don't exist yet.

2926
02:48:11,810 --> 02:48:14,750
They don't listen to have those in
the world doesn't need them. Yeah,

2927
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:18,380
it almost doesn't make sense.
Yeah. Well maybe, I dunno.

2928
02:48:18,410 --> 02:48:20,330
I for real thought they're flexible.
But you know what?

2929
02:48:20,340 --> 02:48:23,840
I looked into it and I
realized that the um,

2930
02:48:24,230 --> 02:48:28,010
the reason that I thought they're flexible
is because some new hats I'm coming

2931
02:48:28,011 --> 02:48:31,940
out with, oh, maybe in a
few weeks they're like,

2932
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:35,420
there are different style of hat and
their flex fit. They look dope too,

2933
02:48:35,421 --> 02:48:40,010
by the way. I'll show them to you one day.
Cool. Um, so yeah, I'm not saying, Hey,

2934
02:48:40,011 --> 02:48:43,640
I'm not saying, Hey, buy my shirt, my
rash guard or whatever. I'm saying,

2935
02:48:43,641 --> 02:48:46,640
go in the store,
Jocko store,

2936
02:48:47,900 --> 02:48:51,740
look on their, so check out the
items and if you like something,

2937
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:56,720
get something from hoodies on there.
Some women's stuff, some patches,

2938
02:48:56,780 --> 02:49:00,080
which are cool. I've seen a few of
those on people's backpacks. Actually.

2939
02:49:00,081 --> 02:49:04,130
They look on a dope. I'm going to, I'm
probably pulling on my backpack. Um,

2940
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:08,010
and you know from others
letting us all know, sometimes

2941
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:10,830
you just think about loud.
Yeah. I'm curious about that.

2942
02:49:11,560 --> 02:49:13,020
We will all be looking for,

2943
02:49:14,140 --> 02:49:18,370
I'll show it to you when it's
done. Anyway, Jocko. store.com.

2944
02:49:18,371 --> 02:49:22,300
That's a good way. Also psychological
warfare who we just talking to them.

2945
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:26,110
Oh Pete? Yeah. Where? Okay.

2946
02:49:26,111 --> 02:49:28,570
Basically psycholo psychological warfare.
What is that?

2947
02:49:28,750 --> 02:49:33,750
It is an album with tracks Jocko checks
where in your campaign against weakness

2948
02:49:36,581 --> 02:49:39,490
meanings. If you're, if
you have goals, like, okay,

2949
02:49:39,491 --> 02:49:44,491
so I listen to Jordan
Peterson and he kind of,

2950
02:49:46,181 --> 02:49:48,430
he has this thing,
I'm not gonna go like too much into it,

2951
02:49:48,431 --> 02:49:50,320
but he has this thing where
it's like, okay, why I don't,

2952
02:49:50,321 --> 02:49:52,660
why don't people get what they want?
And so because,

2953
02:49:52,661 --> 02:49:55,300
and one of the reasons it's because
they just don't know what that is.

2954
02:49:55,390 --> 02:49:57,850
And we kind of don't even if you say,
I want to get better,

2955
02:49:57,851 --> 02:49:59,470
better in what Jujitsu?

2956
02:49:59,530 --> 02:50:04,000
Cause you can do one pushup a day and
you're technically better technically.

2957
02:50:04,480 --> 02:50:07,780
So it's like what do you
mean better and better? How?
Whatever, whatever. So anyway,

2958
02:50:08,110 --> 02:50:11,620
back to this psychological, if you
want to, I don't know, lose weight.

2959
02:50:11,650 --> 02:50:14,920
You want to wake up earlier and be more
disciplined in these specific ways and

2960
02:50:14,921 --> 02:50:17,920
all this stuff. You want to clean
up your diet to clean up your diet.

2961
02:50:17,921 --> 02:50:19,960
You've got to avoid junk food.
All this stuff. Junk food.

2962
02:50:19,961 --> 02:50:23,920
You get distracted by short term payoffs,
right?

2963
02:50:23,921 --> 02:50:26,140
With junk food because junk,

2964
02:50:26,141 --> 02:50:29,160
the whole idea of junk food is short
term pay off over longterm payoff,

2965
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:34,000
good diet, longterm payoff, bad
diet, short term path. Anyway,

2966
02:50:35,050 --> 02:50:38,020
if you get tempted by weakness,

2967
02:50:38,410 --> 02:50:42,250
you listened to the psychological warfare
album or just a track or whatever.

2968
02:50:42,251 --> 02:50:46,090
So look, you waking up early in
the morning to four 30 every day.

2969
02:50:46,091 --> 02:50:51,091
That's what I'm doing from now on that
one day when you're kind of tired and the

2970
02:50:51,191 --> 02:50:56,191
alarm goes off and you're tempted or
compelled to press the snooze it or just

2971
02:50:56,771 --> 02:51:00,040
stay in bed, I'll wake up
later, I'll wake up at at noon

2972
02:51:01,750 --> 02:51:03,160
just saying some people wake up at noon,

2973
02:51:03,161 --> 02:51:07,600
sometimes play this track
called get up and get after it.

2974
02:51:07,630 --> 02:51:09,610
I guarantee you won't wake up at noon.

2975
02:51:09,640 --> 02:51:13,330
You'll wake up at the assigned time
assigned by yourself. By the way,

2976
02:51:13,910 --> 02:51:18,370
100% success rate on that.
If you fail,

2977
02:51:18,371 --> 02:51:22,210
if you listen to this and you fail at
your little thing. Yeah, I don't know.

2978
02:51:22,300 --> 02:51:25,390
I don't know what to say, but that's
a good one. Psychological warfare.

2979
02:51:25,540 --> 02:51:28,800
Jocko Willink. Look for
it. Look into it. Also

2980
02:51:28,940 --> 02:51:31,720
get some Jocko white tea.
You can get that on Amazon.

2981
02:51:31,900 --> 02:51:36,070
It'll make you be able to um, do
amazing feats of strengths. Sure.

2982
02:51:36,140 --> 02:51:39,820
We're with no effort. Barely at
all. Yeah, like the rock bag. Yeah,

2983
02:51:40,010 --> 02:51:44,370
the Jocko white tea. Boom. You
nailed it. Easy money. One Hand. Uh,

2984
02:51:44,770 --> 02:51:49,600
books, like Echo said, tough as they
come by. Travis Mills, you can get that.

2985
02:51:49,660 --> 02:51:52,690
You can also get a book called extreme
ownership that I wrote with my brother

2986
02:51:52,691 --> 02:51:53,524
Leif Babin.

2987
02:51:53,800 --> 02:51:58,090
It's about combat leadership way of the
warrior can if you want your kid or a

2988
02:51:58,091 --> 02:52:01,600
kid that you know to be
stronger, smarter, healthier,

2989
02:52:02,680 --> 02:52:06,010
and therefore because they're smarter and

2990
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:10,660
healthier, they're also more confident.
If you want to do that for a kid,

2991
02:52:11,230 --> 02:52:13,300
get him a book called
way of the Warrior Kid,

2992
02:52:15,720 --> 02:52:20,460
then you can also get the discipline
equals freedom field manual.

2993
02:52:21,780 --> 02:52:26,560
Um, it got a little bump the other
day. I don't know. I think, uh,

2994
02:52:26,590 --> 02:52:29,320
like in social media I put something out
and it got a little bump and all of a

2995
02:52:29,321 --> 02:52:33,190
sudden the delivery dates of people
that just ordered it got pushed back.

2996
02:52:34,120 --> 02:52:38,350
So I don't know. I don't know
specifically like what that means,

2997
02:52:38,351 --> 02:52:39,250
but I'll tell you this,

2998
02:52:40,090 --> 02:52:43,150
it means your daughter now if you want
to get it when it comes out, order it.

2999
02:52:43,240 --> 02:52:47,110
If you want that first edition copy,
which is pretty much what you want.

3000
02:52:48,070 --> 02:52:50,560
If you need leadership in your world,

3001
02:52:50,620 --> 02:52:54,730
which you probably do because that's
the way things get done is through

3002
02:52:54,731 --> 02:52:58,030
leadership.
And you need help in that department.

3003
02:52:58,270 --> 02:53:02,980
You can contact our leadership consulting
company Echelon Front. It's me,

3004

3007
02:53:15,790 --> 02:53:18,260
and this is the muster,

3008
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:21,910
we are close to selling it out right now.

3009
02:53:22,900 --> 02:53:27,610

Get registered,
do it now before it sells out.

3012
02:53:36,160 --> 02:53:40,150
It might even be sold out by the time
this podcast comes out, but check it out,

3013
02:53:40,180 --> 02:53:41,800
see if you can find it.
Um,

3014
02:53:41,860 --> 02:53:45,040
see if you can get their extreme
ownership.com and until the monster.

3015
02:53:45,700 --> 02:53:48,250
If you do need to communicate with us,

3016
02:53:49,090 --> 02:53:53,050
we're actually cruising
on the Inter webs Twitter,

3017
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:54,753
Instagram,

3018
02:53:56,260 --> 02:53:59,010
and also do Boccie ball.

3019
02:54:00,670 --> 02:54:04,180
Echo is adequate.
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink

3020
02:54:05,950 --> 02:54:10,950
and to all the military members out
there that are holding the line.

3021
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:17,020
Thank you. And to those
veterans that stood the watch,

3022
02:54:17,530 --> 02:54:21,010
especially those that were wounded.

3023
02:54:23,180 --> 02:54:26,270
Thank you for giving us our freedom

3024
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:33,040
and two police, law enforcement,
firefighters, EMT tees,

3025
02:54:33,240 --> 02:54:35,100
and other first responders.

3026
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Thank you for your service and thank you
for keeping us protected from man and

3027
02:54:42,691 --> 02:54:44,880
from nature here at home

3028
02:54:47,160 --> 02:54:52,160
and to everyone else out there facing
struggles and facing hard times.

3029
02:54:54,390 --> 02:54:55,223
Remember,

3030
02:54:57,840 --> 02:55:02,840
remember the challenge is that Travis
mills faced and still faces and he faces

3031
02:55:06,231 --> 02:55:10,550
those incredible challenges
every minute of every day.

3032
02:55:13,990 --> 02:55:18,990
And he does that with tenacity and
positivity and proves without question

3033
02:55:26,030 --> 02:55:29,960
that if you never quit
and you never give up,

3034
02:55:30,200 --> 02:55:34,430
and you keep moving forward,
the nothing can stop you

3035
02:55:36,180 --> 02:55:37,620
from getting after it.

3036
02:55:39,880 --> 02:55:41,440
So until next time,

3037
02:55:42,520 --> 02:55:46,360
this is echo and Jocko out.
