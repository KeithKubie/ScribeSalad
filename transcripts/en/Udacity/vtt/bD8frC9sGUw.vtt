Do you guys know who Ariel Parson is?

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.110
&gt;&gt; I think it's my dermatologist.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.731
&gt;&gt; Wait?

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.720
No.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.655
&gt;&gt; No.
No idea.

00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:10.430
No.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.100
&gt;&gt; No one I know.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.140
&gt;&gt; That's great,
do you know what this means?

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.270
This means that there is somebody out
there that is not either a direct

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.500
friend, family member,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.842
or pet of someone in this room
that's using Shopping List++.

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:24.500
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.357
&gt;&gt; I know, high fives all around,
high fives, high fives.

00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:29.807
High fives, JP!

00:00:29.807 --> 00:00:32.164
&gt;&gt; You seem a lot more energetic.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:37.218
Yeah, I don't know if it's that red
black caffeinated insta I had or

00:00:37.218 --> 00:00:42.458
the fact that I've finally been able to
get some sleep, but man, I feel great.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:43.961
That's good to hear.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:44.461
That's good to hear.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.757
&gt;&gt; This is a real person.

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:49.530
&gt;&gt; I know a real person.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.490
&gt;&gt; No, that's not what I meant.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.540
This is a spambot or a malicious user.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.326
&gt;&gt; Nah.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:56.403
I mean, come on JP.

00:00:56.403 --> 00:00:58.980
It's not like somebody's trying
to hack into our system.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.309
&gt;&gt; Well, I hate to burst your bubble but
now the app is released,

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.816
aren't you at all
concerned about security?

00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:06.035
&gt;&gt; Not now JP.

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:07.681
Tonight, we dance.
