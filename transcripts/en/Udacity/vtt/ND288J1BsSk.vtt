00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.340
&gt;&gt; Okay. So we've done a little bit of moving,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.390
moving stuff around, and kept the same equation of before. Remember,

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.160
our goal is to use quadratic programming to maximize this

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.370
equation. So let me talk a little bit about the properties

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.240
of the solution for this equation. So here's the first

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.910
one. It turns out that once you find the alphas that

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.730
maximize this equation, you can actually recover the W, which

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.040
was the whole point of this exercise in the first place

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.110
&gt;&gt; that's the little W,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.400
not the big W

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.570
&gt;&gt; That's the little W, not the big W. That's right, okay?

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.330
&gt;&gt; Neat.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is kind of neat. So it's

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.760
really easy to do. And of course once you

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.480
know W it's easy to recover B. You just find the value of X, you stick it into

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.230
W, you, that you know is equal to plus 1, and then poof, you, you can find out

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.250
B. So you can recover W directly from this and you can recover B from it in sort

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.580
of the obvious way. But here are some other properties

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.400
that are a little bit, little bit more interesting for

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.010
you. So I want you to pay attention to two

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.940
things. One I am just going to have to tell

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.500
you, and the other I want you to think about.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.420
So here's the one that I'm going to tell you.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.840
It turns out, okay, that alpha, each of those

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.290
alphas are mostly zero, usually. So if I told you that in

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.740
the solution to this, most of the alphas that you come back

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.480
are going to be zero, what does that tell you about W?

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.000
&gt;&gt; So W is the sum of the data points times their labels

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.600
times alpha. And if the alpha is zero, that the corresponding data point

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.360
isn't really going to come into play in the definition of W at

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.160
all. So a bunch of the data just don't really factor into W.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.820
&gt;&gt; That is exactly right. So basically,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.170
some of the vectors matter for finding the solution to this, and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.050
some do not. So it turns out, each of those points are

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.970
vectors. But you can find all of the support that you need

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.320
for finding the optimal W in just using a few of those vectors.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.180
&gt;&gt; The non-zero alphas.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well the ones with non-zero

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.350
alphas. So you basically built a machine that

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.500
only needs a few support vectors.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.380
&gt;&gt; Oh. So the, the data points for which

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.460
the corresponding alpha is non-zero, those are the support vectors?

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.630
&gt;&gt; Yes, those are the ones that provide all the support

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.330
for W. So knowing that W is the sum over a

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.270
lot of these different data points, and their labels, and the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.560
corresponding alphas, and that most of those are zeroes, that implies,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.530
that only a few of the X's matter. Now Michael, let me let me do a quick quiz.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.190
&gt;&gt; Yea, yea!
