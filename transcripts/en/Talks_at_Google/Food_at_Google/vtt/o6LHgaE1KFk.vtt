FEMALE SPEAKER: Please
join me in welcoming Nancy.

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:08.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.270
NANCY HACHISU: So I just
took one little, small swath

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.120
off the top of
Japanese pickling.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.930
We have pickling, and
we have preserving,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.956
but those words don't actually
represent the true meaning.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.930
"Tsukemono" equals "pickling,"
but it's not really equal.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.090
"Tsukemono" means putting
something on-- "tsukeru"--

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.040
and so, putting on
something that--

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.270
things that have had
something put onto them.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.220
And those can often be,
like, a really quick pickle,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.460
30 minutes.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.620
And that's what
we're doing today.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.880
Preserving typically
is-- I mean,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.803
it does involve some fruits.

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:53.610
But like a Western
idea of preserves,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.400
you start thinking
the jam thing.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.040
I think more of the preserving
in Japan is done with fish,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.290
but then, also, some
vegetables and fruits.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.770
But we can't do that today.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.020
We're going to do some quick
pickles, just super easy.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.880
They're incredibly delicious.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.080
I will say they're most
delicious if you use

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.160
the best ingredients possible.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.310
And I think that's
kind of a no-brainer.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.334
They're using preserved
foods to quick pickle,

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:28.000
so that's where the
preserving comes in.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.610
Of course, salt's not preserved.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.790
But this was made slowly
by a guy I know in Wajima.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.310
And the sweetness of
the salt comes out

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.006
when you take the
crystals off slowly.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.130
And all this stuff is
going to get passed around.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.410
You can taste it.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.756
So the salt is sweet and salty.

00:01:51.756 --> 00:01:53.130
And so it makes
it really gentle.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.630
We used Maldon today, in the
stuff that you're going to eat.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.182
So we have four salts in Japan,
salt-- these other things all

00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:06.390
have salt in them, of course.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:15.790
Oops, I lost my top to the
miso-- soy sauce-- this soy

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.440
sauce is made in our town.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.100
It's organic, made
from Japanese beans

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.210
and aged two years, cedar
barrels, all organic.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.270
And mostly, I know a lot of the
people that grow the soybeans

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.270
for these, and the wheat.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.676
You can buy this soy sauce here,
in this bottle, Nama Shoyu.

00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:40.780
I bought it in Tokyo
Fish in Berkeley.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.070
It's not always taken
care of very well.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.540
Like, some of the bottles
at Tokyo fish were weeping.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.330
I didn't tell them yet.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.830
What can you do?

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.060
So I bought the non-weepy
one, just because I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.320
wanted to compare it and see.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.778
And I was wondering--
I was worried

00:02:55.778 --> 00:02:57.090
I was going to use it all up.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.590
I was at Stanford
a couple days ago,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.680
and I almost the whole bottle.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.415
But we are bringing this in.

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:05.760
I'm involved in a project,
the Japan Brand Project.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.610
The Japanese government's
trying to better the ingredients

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.367
that you can get here, and
then also, of course, EU

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:12.450
and the rest of the world.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.740
But the US is the first target.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.160
OK?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.650
And then, miso, you
guys all know miso.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.860
Sadly, we still are not
getting good miso here.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.050
I don't know why.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.610
This is also coming.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.800
This is sold by the
same people that sell

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.420
this, Gold Mine Natural Foods.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.050
Your best source
for Japanese foods

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.620
is macrobiotic
sites, because they

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.380
came in the early '70s, George
Ohsawa and Kushi, those people,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.080
MUSO, and they brought
in the best products.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.650
And unfortunately, the
Japanese grocery stores sort of

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.890
missed the boat on that.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.980
And so their products
are-- they didn't

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.410
get-- the artisanal
products were not really

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.110
so much available at the time.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.160
And then, they're so many
generations off they've-- they

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.310
haven't really added
artisanal products very much,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.810
in my viewpoint.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.200
So the miso around,
that you get,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.770
has some additives,
like alcohol.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.710
The Gold Mine one, it's the
same thing, but it's oxidized,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.190
so it's super dark.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.440
Doesn't mean it's bad.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.790
These things never go
bad, they just darken.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.640
Even if they have a date, a
sell date or best by date,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.430
forget about it.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.570
It's good for 100 years.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.580
Then, this is fish sauce.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.870
Japanese fish sauce is the
best in the world, hands down.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.870
I've tasted it against the
really good Italian colatura,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.392
and it's better.

00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:41.725
You'll got to taste this around.

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:47.590
And we're putting it-- but
the ones you're tasting,

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.490
it's things that you
can taste at Google.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.980
And so you're going to try to
compare what you're getting,

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.580
and then, also, what
could be you getting.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.120
So that's a little
intellectual exercise for you.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.430
It's not to say
you can't have it.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.350
And I'll introduce
those products after.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.020
OK.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.730
So salt's here.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.190
The first thing we're
going to do is dashi.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.980
I will tell you,
the sad story is

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.710
that I don't use
induction very much,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.980
but I think I can handle this.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.580
The sad story is
that-- I got it.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.150
I got it.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.960
I got it.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.960
I'm on top of it.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.170
I have a Stanford
degree, B.A. It's OK.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.790
I can do it.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.560
Can't do my taxes,
but I can do this.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.790
OK.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.590
We're going to put
a piece of kombu

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.780
in-- how many cups
of water did I put?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.350
I can't remember--
four cups of water.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.880
And you bring it
to almost simmer.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.320
Then you're going to
take the kombu out.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.000
And then you're going to put a
couple handfuls of katsuobushi

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.830
in.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.300
Katsuobushi's dried,
smoked-- smoked-- smoked,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.740
dried, fermented skipjack tuna.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.490
Unfortunately, what
you get here has never

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.850
been the six-month
period of smoking

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.650
and drying-- no, no,
drying and fermenting.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.710
They're all smoked, but the
drying, fermenting extra six

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.690
months is only from the whole
ones, which is in my bag.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.280
We'll jump it out later, OK?

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.840
And you'll get to
taste this too.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.673
I'll pass it around.

00:06:27.673 --> 00:06:30.490
And I'll pass the whole
one too, but it's in there.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.500
And it's a 16-minute process,
but 60% of the Japanese

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.380
do actually make dashi--
you've got to factor that in.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.670
60% percent of the ones that
actually make dashi-- they

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.700
use powdered.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.410
So food traditions
are eroding rapidly.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.090
And that's part of why the
Japanese government is trying

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.740
to get better Japanese
products out to the other areas

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.031
to make Japanese feel like
maybe it's a reverse exportation

00:07:03.031 --> 00:07:03.530
thing.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.045
That happens commonly in Japan.

00:07:06.045 --> 00:07:11.080
The kombu, again, there's
all sorts of levels of kombu.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.710
This one I got from
a friend who got it.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.810
He's a restaurant friend.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.350
And so it's even
better than what

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.750
I can get at the fish market.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.920
And you have pretty good
kombu here too, at Google.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.090
So good for that.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.470
This is going right now.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.238
I'm going to make the
little broccoli pickle.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.500
Everything you make
for Japanese food

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.750
is-- you want it to be
bite-sized for chopsticks.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.230
And we use these
very-- I say we,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.235
but not many people in Japan are
actually using these anymore.

00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:53.740
The modernization of the
knives has happened as well.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.620
This is a $25 knife that
my local knife maker makes.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.100
I bring them for-- I
bring a lot of them

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.990
for doing demo-- for doing
cooking classes with students,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.661
because I want them to
pick them up and feel them.

00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:09.660
I'll leave it over here.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.868
Maybe I won't pass it around.

00:08:10.868 --> 00:08:13.990
But you can just
feel how light it is.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.420
And so you don't get tired.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.980
You can use it as
a paring knife.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.260
And also, what's the
point of it is it

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.640
has a very sharp, thin blade.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.550
And so you're not cutting
the cells of the-- you're

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.330
not smashing the cells
of the vegetable,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.320
it's just cutting down.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.410
We cut down straight,
down like that.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.100
And so you're not
bruising the cells.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.669
And because we have
a farm, we want

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.720
to be nice to the
vegetables and honor them.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.230
So typically, I would
use some of this.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.002
I don't know this
broccoli as well,

00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:49.460
so I don't know
where it came from.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.280
So I'm going to use part
of it and leave this here.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.110
And then we're going
to boil that for-- I

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.962
just, because I grew
up in California, boil

00:08:58.962 --> 00:09:00.170
everything for three minutes.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.460
That's just the way we do it.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.960
I think the grandmas in--
all the grandmas in Japan,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.320
they're going to be
doing it way longer.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.860
Three minutes, Noel?

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.540
Can you go?

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.810
Oh, actually, I'm
not timing this yet.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.275
So I got it on my iPhone.

00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:16.450
No problem.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.120
That's what it's good for.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.420
OK.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.550
So that's boiling.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:28.050
This is almost-- what I chose
was a representational-- we've

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.790
got a miso thing, a fish sauce
thing, a soy sauce thing,

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:36.363
and an umeboshi salt thing.

00:09:36.363 --> 00:09:40.408
So the broccoli is cooking.

00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:43.140
The dashi's almost going.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.190
The next thing-- we're
sort of jumping around,

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.220
because that's what you
do when you're cooking.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.660
Turnips, the tops at
this time of year,

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.040
they're not so pretty
because of the weather.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.770
And I often use them.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.410
This time, we're not
going to use them.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.000
If you use them, salt
massaging them is good.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.670
So I trim off the--
for this case,

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.150
I'm going to trim off the tops.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:17.700
And again, the pretty
ones, I would use.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.540
Today, just not
to confuse things,

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.640
because it wasn't used in
the main recipe, I won't.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.400
And then, we have a little
brush called a tawashi.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.850
It's made from coconut fibers.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.150
And again, I usually bring them.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.820
But I really pared
down on this trip,

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.550
because I tend to
have too many things.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.800
And then, all of a sudden,
I don't have enough.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.210
But the tawashi is a little--
you've probably seen them.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.410
But the Turtle brand is the
only one that's actually

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.230
made with natural fibers.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.980
And you can find them, I
think, on Amazon, actually.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.470
And then, you scrub the
turnips with that brush.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.530
We don't peel turnips, daikon.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.670
Oh, city people peel.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.050
But farmer people are
not going to peel,

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:03.133
because they've picked
them just recently.

00:11:03.133 --> 00:11:04.490
Broccoli's done?

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.978
Yes.

00:11:05.978 --> 00:11:07.470
Katsuobushi next.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.458
Dashi.

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:11.210
This thing--

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.266
Now, we don't have
a drought in Japan.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.610
It's a water country, yeah.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:30.620
So I sometimes forget
about the drought situation

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.424
in California.

00:11:32.424 --> 00:11:38.060
But we would normally run
cold water over these.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.860
But since-- I'm
going to actually

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.340
probably use about the
same amount of water

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.410
in this little ice bath.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:45.970
It's a kind of huge ice bath.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.808
So I'm just going to chill
them down in the ice bath.

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:51.250
Turn this off.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.680
All right.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.130
And the kombu, the point
of not boiling it--

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.110
like, we're not
the kombu police--

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.220
the boiling it brings out
the neba neba, the sliminess,

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.300
which is-- it's not a big deal.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.150
Just try not to boil it.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.229
But there are some soups,
some nabe that we do just

00:12:15.229 --> 00:12:16.020
leave the kombu in.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.670
So it's not set in stone.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.090
Minus.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.840
So you can see how
simple this dashi is.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.360
And you just kind of wonder,
why would people use powder.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.160
Because powdered, as
you, I'm sure, know,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.540
has the obligatory MSG in
it, like all Japanese food

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.980
in the supermarket.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.480
I think every single one that
has salt in it contains MSG.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.520
They haven't gotten
the memo about that.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.830
But anyway--

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:44.380
OK.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.660
So dashi's happening
for-- the dashi's

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:54.360
going to mitigate the fish
sauce and the soy sauce.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.420
OK.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.520
So I've already prepared
dashi, so it's here.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.180
So we're going to
do the celery first.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.480
Now, celery is not
really Japanese,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.890
but I do have-- my husband
sometimes grows it,

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.480
and my friends grow it.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.950
Not all Japanese like it.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.660
You know, what we don't
have is a little strainer.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.700
Do you have one more strainer,
Noel, for the broccoli?

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.750
Or, you know what, I can
just put it in a towel.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.780
That's fine.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.345
I got it.

00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:32.968
Am I out of camera?

00:13:32.968 --> 00:13:35.308
Am I all right?

00:13:35.308 --> 00:13:39.250
Am I screwing it all up?

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.485
Sorry it's all-- it's cold.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.170
OK.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.660
So we have a thing called udo.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.190
And udo is something
we typically do, like,

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.240
as kinpira, with soy sauce.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.870
So I developed a recipe using
celery for my first book,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.405
and it was absolutely delicious.

00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:14.720
And so when my friend
told me-- my friend

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.050
in Noto, which is on the--
is a peninsula to the left.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.100
So what's that?

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.360
West?

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.670
West of Tokyo,
really amazing place.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.230
Anyway, he told me
about this recipe

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.630
for making little morning
pickles with daikon.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.520
And I made it with celery,
because I had some really great

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.690
celery, and it was so amazing.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.680
So that's what we're
going to make today.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.690
And anything crunchy like
this-- so daikon, celery,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:54.990
turnips, that kind of thing--
we use these little chili

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.780
Japonesa.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:01.410
It's in between, like,
a Thai chili or arbol.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:06.280
It's not as dark as
the arbol, not as big.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.910
And we break them into--
and arbols are a little bit

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.320
thicker-walled.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.340
So can you see?

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.300
Where can they see?

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:21.280
You break them into pieces
so that you don't-- largish

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.660
pieces, and not too much, so
you don't-- if you break--

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.700
if they're chopped too finely,
then it's going to infuse all

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.014
in the celery.

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:32.930
And there might be a
little-- there is, maybe,

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:41.180
a little more hot heat
to the celery pickles

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.270
than I would have
put in, but I think

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.660
they're still really delicious.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.970
And the fish sauce was--
the best Vietnamese one

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:54.720
you can get is the crab, Three
Crabs, according to Bruce Cost.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.760
I still-- sorry, Japanese
is the way to go.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.950
And so we don't really
have a measuring thing.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.700
So I suppose I could
use this tablespoon.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.650
It's one to one
dashi and fish sauce.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:14.430
So I'll just, like-- one, two.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.190
This kind of thing,
I don't wing it.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:21.180
I do, so it's a little
bit hard to measure.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.570
But I'm up to the task.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.290
One, two-- I used
to be a bartender.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.420
I can figure it out.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.480
OK.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.310
I'm going to put this back
in the mix of tasters.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.040
OK.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.389
And then, you put
it in a Ziploc.

00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:43.430
Whenever you put something
in a Ziploc, remember,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.320
the zip is-- you don't
want to get that wet.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.660
And you just stick it in
the Ziploc for 30 minutes,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.790
and it's good to go.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.290
You don't want it longer than
30 minutes unless you taste it

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.070
and you feel like it
needs more fish sauce.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.653
Also, if you have a
strong fish sauce,

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:05.599
we did one part fish
sauce to two parts dashi,

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.220
because the fish
sauce was strong.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.720
So the whole point of the dashi
is to mitigate the fish sauce.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.300
So if you're going to
do-- like, somehow, you

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.119
wanted to leave it for
a really long time,

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.420
I would either take
off the soaking

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.700
or you add a lot more dashi.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.200
OK?

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.650
They can also taste
that, too, I think.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.730
But if we stick it in the
fridge for now-- yeah.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.431
This is done.

00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:33.850
I don't know what we do
with the dirty dishes.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.481
Pass it to you?

00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:36.180
No.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.620
OK, I won't do that.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.120
All right.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.150
This is not boiling either.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.950
There is no sweet spot on these.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.330
It's either too "boily"
or not boiling enough.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:45.830
All right.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.350
Then, the broccoli also needs
to go for about 30 minutes.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.250
So we're going to have
you taste it, maybe,

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.360
before the 30 minute mark.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.300
But I think it's
a good idea to try

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.783
to taste some of this
with the official stuff.

00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:04.561
Bowl.

00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:07.310
Ice, we don't want ice.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:12.020
Oh, yeah, and these, I might
use, so I'll hold on to them

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.150
just in case.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.540
Yeah, thanks.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.040
All right.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:27.720
This one is three parts dashi
to four parts soy sauce,

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:33.590
and some more of these
little Japonesa chili.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.640
Again, I don't
want to go too far.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.428
That's done.

00:18:40.428 --> 00:18:40.928
OK.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.980
I'll go-- whoa-- one.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.980
But you can see how
simple this is, and really

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.870
good with Western food too.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:19:00.690
One-- But also, it's the--

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.722
So this soy sauce, obviously,
it's more expensive.

00:19:06.722 --> 00:19:08.930
And I'm going to show you--
I think I priced it out--

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:15.320
that it's three times as
expensive as the least

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.230
expensive Kikkoman.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.971
Now Kikkoman does
not do a bad job,

00:19:19.971 --> 00:19:25.460
but they definitely are
not using non-GMO soybeans.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.870
It'd be kind of impossible-- OK.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:34.370
Here's another zip
locker-- because there

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.490
aren't enough non-GMO
soybeans in the United States

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.870
to supply Kikkoman.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.986
But does anybody
have any Kikkoman?

00:19:41.986 --> 00:19:43.360
My brother-in-law
works for them,

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.810
so I shouldn't say
that, actually.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.230
But it's a little
bit of a gray area.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:53.410
But they at least do ferment
their soy sauce for six months.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.020
And they have an accelerated
fermentation process,

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.820
so they put it in a room.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.220
The whole point of
the fermentation

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.150
is that it needs to go
through-- we talk about-- ooh,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.462
water on the iPhone.

00:20:06.462 --> 00:20:17.920
Don't want that-- needs to go
through-- sorry-- two summers.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.190
Because the fermentation
arc happens in the summer,

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.000
because that's when
all the activity comes.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.520
OK?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.300
So what Kikkoman or Oriyama--
so, those kind of companies--

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.820
do is they leave
the-- oh, thanks.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:39.250
OK-- they leave the soy sauce
in a summer-like environment

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.390
for six months.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.193
And they use a super koji.

00:20:43.193 --> 00:20:51.390
Koji is the fermentation
element material.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.725
So they kind of speed it along.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.170
So it's not as bad
as one would think.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.960
Actually, they do
a fairly good job.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.195
But for three times the
money, this is way worth it

00:21:07.195 --> 00:21:08.630
in my mind.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:09.550
OK.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.290
So those two are done,
just a little waiting game.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:18.140
And then, this is kind
of an instant pickle,

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:26.390
because the turnip, you're
going to salt it a little bit.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.330
And again, if you a table salt
thing or a really fine sea

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.810
salt, the salt's going to
get into the vegetables

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:34.590
immediately.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.660
And so you really want
to back off on it.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.370
There's nothing to
squeeze out, really.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:43.310
It's just getting off
the residual salt.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.200
And so this kind of salt,
unfortunately, we're

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.100
going to not use it.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.330
You could use it
for something else.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:55.040
Then, this umeboshi is one
that I made from our ume

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:55.970
on the tree.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:01.300
It's "sour plum" in
English, but it's actually

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.601
in an apricot family.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.570
And you brine it.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:08.530
You salt them.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.040
And then, the brine comes up.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:18.490
Then, you dry them
outside three days.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.440
You wait for the warm weather--
the hot weather, sorry-- sunny

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.200
weather.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:28.390
And then, they stay,
again, for a long time.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.510
So commercial umeboshi
are much stronger.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.640
They have a little more vinegar
element for preservation.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.900
We don't put shiso
in our umeboshi,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:45.220
because shiso makes
the ume quite hot pink.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.280
And that color sort
of puts me off.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.620
I mean, I like it in
clothes, but not in my food.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.430
But the ume, naturally, it
starts green, but then ends up

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.365
this color, which is sort
of a softy, "pinky" mauve.

00:22:58.365 --> 00:22:59.990
And I think it's a
really pretty color.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.710
So I didn't really feel
like I needed the shiso.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.770
So again, this is like one of
those, how much umeboshi you

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.520
put in depends on your mood.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.350
That's maybe too much.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:15.250
But maybe some people
can taste this too.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.740
And this is the katsuobushi,
the real deal katsuobushi.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.870
Again, if you're feeling it,
put lots of katsuobushi in.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.815
My son shaved it for
me at the restaurant.

00:23:25.815 --> 00:23:26.440
He was working.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.523
They have shaving machine.

00:23:27.523 --> 00:23:30.370
So it was shaved right
before New Year's.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:35.130
So it's lost some of
its oomph, but still--

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.500
oh, let's put it all in.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.670
Why not?

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:39.570
Because it's so good.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.759
And then, a little bit of
soy sauce for roundness.

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:45.300
I really don't like
the word "umami,"

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.670
because it was
developed-- it was made up

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:55.030
by Ajinamoto to promote
their lovely MSG product.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.810
But it does really
add-- there is

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.290
sort of a real phenomenon
of what it does.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.800
So this is done.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.820
I didn't taste it.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.210
I bet I should taste it, right?

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:09.450
I think it's good.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.230
OK.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:11.306
That's done.

00:24:11.306 --> 00:24:13.040
Those two are done.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.770
The last thing is,
these are kind of magic.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.296
Just a second.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.300
These are all done.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.450
This, I'll just consolidate.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.490
Yep.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:34.520
That's done.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.600
Good.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.100
All right.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.414
Oh, this is done.

00:24:44.318 --> 00:24:51.380
And the miso eggs came from a--
my husband put the soy sauce

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.060
eggs in the first book.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.580
And I followed my
husband's method.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:07.770
He marinates hard-boiled eggs in
soy sauce, in the refrigerator,

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.520
for his little road trips.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.310
And he does it
for days and days.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.600
And they start
becoming almost cheesy.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.610
But I discovered that, actually,
I liked it for four hours only.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.372
And then I did it with
miso, and it was so amazing.

00:25:23.372 --> 00:25:27.600
And it's been the most
popular little appetizer

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.200
on all of the tourists.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.461
So basically, you
just take the miso.

00:25:33.461 --> 00:25:34.940
You flatten in your hand.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.650
You don't need this whole--
oh, it's too late now.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.490
It was completely
encased in miso.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.190
On these restaurant
things, we never

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.820
have quite enough
miso to do that.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.190
I mean, I have access to
lots and lots of miso,

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.581
because I also make it.

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:51.580
And because the egg has
weeped out a little bit,

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.621
it's a little bit softer.

00:25:52.621 --> 00:25:55.730
The miso you have
access to, some

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.610
of the better misos,
their flavor is excellent,

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:00.611
but they're super stiff.

00:26:00.611 --> 00:26:03.110
And so they're going to be a
little bit harder to deal with,

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.090
but their flavor is really good,
like Mr. Miso Master, whatever

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:07.140
his name is.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.690
South River is, maybe,
medium consistency.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.510
Anyway, you just
smooth around the egg,

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.240
and even if it's
not all touching.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.580
Because it is a lot of miso.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.200
And you guys, it's more
expensive than for me.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.390
But you can reuse it
a number of times.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.250
It's better to--
we have farm eggs.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:31.930
And so the eggs,
the pieces come off.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.100
You could also reuse it
for soup if you need to.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.260
It's better with just the eggs.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.272
Anyway, you take off the
miso after four hours.

00:26:40.272 --> 00:26:41.230
And then, they'll hold.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:54.450
And you never, never wash,
of course, the miso off.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.240
Save this in a
Tupperware or a Ziploc.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.120
Just a second here.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:05.935
Washing hands.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.430
Thank you, Didi.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.495
Making a mess here.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.660
And then, you slice it.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.108
Can I have a little
plate, maybe?

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:32.100
You want to get
the egg-- thanks.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.830
You want to get the egg
done, but not overdone.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:40.990
It's a very hard-- in our
house, it's nine minutes.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.210
Here, the eggs were cold.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:45.060
So I think I went to 11.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.800
So typically, for
cooking, you want

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.460
to use room temperature eggs.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.130
Of course, we have our own eggs,
so we never refrigerate them

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.755
from the get-go.

00:27:55.755 --> 00:27:59.140
And it's not good to put them
in and out and in and out.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.610
So when you want
to use them, just

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.010
return to room temperature.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:08.870
They should have a
little center of wetness.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.410
And then, I didn't
put this in the book,

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:19.680
but-- oops, cancel-- a
little bit of seven spice

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.830
powder, shichimi togarashi,
is really pretty and delicious

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:24.472
on the eggs.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.870
So if we cut these
a little bit more,

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.895
people could also
taste this one.

00:28:32.895 --> 00:28:35.760
I don't know if that
tastes different.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.628
Dashi's done.

00:28:45.152 --> 00:28:46.610
I'll use this for
the chefs' class.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.240
And then, you can reuse this
kombu and the katsuobushi

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.610
for-- this one, you
can dry up in a pan

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.400
and use it for a little
sprinkles on rice, add some soy

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.418
sauce, some aromatics.

00:29:06.226 --> 00:29:07.750
Kombu, you can add to miso soup.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:11.010
You can add it--
again, you can saute it

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.680
with-- you could simmer it
with soy sauce and mirin.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.186
There's various methods.

00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:21.950
But those are the
four things you're

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:25.840
going to taste with slightly
different ingredients--

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.562
the caveat.

00:29:26.562 --> 00:29:29.020
AUDIENCE: I'm so confused about
the difference between koji

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.800
and miso.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.230
Is koji the thing that starts
the miso [INAUDIBLE] thing?

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.063
NANCY HACHISU: Yeah.

00:29:34.063 --> 00:29:35.440
Koji is a spore.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.760
The confusion comes
that koji is a spore,

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.080
but it's also typically--
it's a spore that

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:47.390
inoculates rice, or wheat,
or barley to make miso.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:51.510
For soy sauce, it's inoculated
on a wheat and soybeans.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.790
For sake, it
inoculates on the rice.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.980
It's a spore that
inoculates a grain.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.580
OK?

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.460
But then, the confusion
comes, when we often

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.701
talk about the
inoculated grain as koji.

00:30:02.701 --> 00:30:03.950
Well, it's actually rice koji.

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.740
It's actually barley koji.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.760
It's actually something,
something koji.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.615
But that's where
the confusion comes.

00:30:10.615 --> 00:30:11.990
AUDIENCE: When I
go to the store,

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.332
if it says koji miso,
that's just miso?

00:30:15.332 --> 00:30:17.290
NANCY HACHISU: It means
miso that is just miso.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:21.030
It means it, maybe, has a
higher concentration of koji.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.580
So white miso has
more koji in it.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:30.860
The problem is the
labeling becomes perverted,

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.770
or "something-verted"
when it comes here,

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.710
and for various reasons--
Japanese thinking

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.360
they're making it more
understandable or Americans

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.318
thinking they're making
it more understandable.

00:30:42.318 --> 00:30:46.340
And somehow, it's not at
all understandable, I agree,

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.750
which is a big problem about--

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.250
OK.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.490
I'll ask you guys.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.700
So some of us think that this
is a really super cool label,

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.960
and we want to send
the ingredients as is.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.860
My branding friend says,
no, all the products

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.920
should look like the yuzu bottle
so that they're all like Thai

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.410
Kitchen, all discernible.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.250
It's was such a conundrum.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.920
But anyway, if you have
any thoughts on that,

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.540
just email me.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.690
AUDIENCE: But when you do
some of the preserving,

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.600
do you do anything
beforehand to balance out

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.120
the sour that happens
in the process or any

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.897
of the fermentation that
happens in the process?

00:31:21.897 --> 00:31:23.480
NANCY HACHISU: Kind
of a big question.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.620
So he's wondering-- OK.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.600
If you're doing-- so
you want the sourness

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.350
for the lacto-fermentation.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.360
And so that's what
you're looking for.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.859
And if you put too much salt
on, you don't get the sourness.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:46.760
So in process, there's
always a percentage of salt

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:53.260
you put in for, like, the
napa cabbage pickles, hakusai,

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.440
and/or takuan.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.010
But takuan has rice bran
raw, non-toasted rice bran.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:04.390
And so it's a little bit
harder to get the brine up.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:08.400
Fish is just heavily,
heavily salted.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.900
And then, the adjustment
comes after the thing is done.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.230
So if your thing came
out, whether it's

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.650
nukazuke pickles, or takuan,
or hokusai, it came out

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.390
and it's not as
salty as you wish,

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:22.040
then, you drizzle soy sauce on.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.810
If it's too salty,
you might leach it out

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.630
with a little water, but it's a
little bit difficult with some

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:29.300
of these things.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.860
With fish, totally, you're going
to leach it out with water.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.455
Or you're going to soak it
in sake leaves to suck up.

00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:39.250
Sake leaves suck
up the salt. That's

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:43.552
a pretty common thing for
fish or a vegetable thing.

00:32:43.552 --> 00:32:46.010
AUDIENCE: Do you give a good
source for umeboshi paste in--

00:32:48.359 --> 00:32:49.900
NANCY HACHISU: I
think that Gold Mine

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.210
is where you really want to go.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.340
There's a woman in San
Francisco who's selling it.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.180
And I bought it for a friend,
because I couldn't find mine.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.440
He's looking for umeboshi paste.

00:33:03.215 --> 00:33:05.090
You're not going to want
me to tell you this,

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.550
but it's actually not so
hard to make them yourself

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.250
if you catch the season in June.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:18.080
And I don't know how easy
it is to get organic ume.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.680
There's a lot of
people in the area.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.700
Like, I keep hearing
about somebody.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.940
There was a lot of
Japanese farmers.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.510
In the 1900s, the Japanese came.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.030
They planted all these.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.320
There's a lot of trees that
are not being harvested.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.520
But you know, you have
just by word of mouth.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.320
But frankly, in Japan, I make
apricot or a raspberry jam

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.300
from-- oh, sorry--
from non-organic fruit,

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:44.559
because my tree's
not fruiting enough.

00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:45.600
And I really want to jam.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.641
And I have organic sugar.

00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:49.030
So it's a trade-off.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.844
But otherwise, Gold Mine.

00:33:51.844 --> 00:33:53.760
The one in San Francisco
was really expensive,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.860
but umeboshi will be expensive.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.674
It will be, because it's
kind of precious in a way.

00:34:00.674 --> 00:34:02.090
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you so much.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.830
Everyone, please--

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.130
NANCY HACHISU: You're welcome.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:03.220
Thank you for coming.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:03.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: --join me.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.511
And thank you for coming.

00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:06.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.288
NANCY HACHISU: Thank
you. [INAUDIBLE].
