FELICE FRANKEL: Hey, everyone.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.310
This is our first video update.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.770
We are now starting
week one of the course.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.860
I think that what we'll
probably say now more than

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.670
anything else is a
quick conversation

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.310
about the equipment.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.840
Many of you are concerned that
I'm being a little too picky

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.190
in what I'm requiring of you.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.540
Now, first of all, I am not
requiring anything of you.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.420
What I'm doing is showing you
what I do and my technique.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.940
My hope is that you'll like
what I make-- the images that I

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.220
make-- and follow my lead.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.920
And for the most
part the exercises

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.790
that we've developed
really are intended

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.800
to be used with a 105
macro lens on a camera that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.820
can take lenses.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.620
It is not going to
work for you if you

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.960
are going to just
use a snap and shoot,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.670
or whatever you
call it these days.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.865
You really want to meet the
standards, if I could say that,

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:13.440
that we are suggesting
you pay attention to.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.860
It is true that you
can, on occasion, use

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.380
extension tubes instead
of-- for example,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.480
let's say you don't have as much
of a macro lens as you'd like.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.950
And so you can use
tube extensions as long

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.420
as they don't have any glass.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.480
But you'll be losing
f-stops in the process,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.740
and you'll find out more
about aperture and f-stops

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.790
in the oncoming weeks.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.140
So those of you
who are technically

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.890
savvy, I hope that you'll find
what our exercises have become

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.150
developed into.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.930
And the ideas in the course will
be appropriate for your needs

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.680
as well.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.680
But just getting back
to the equipment,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.610
for example, when we get up
to using a camera and a lens,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.550
which is in a week
two, you're going

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.830
to see that I'm going to
suggest using software.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.940
And you'll probably say,
why is she doing that?

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.230
Well I'd like to
hope that I'm going

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.490
to be making a case for that.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.280
So in the end, please
consider following

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.790
what we're suggesting.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.100
It works for me.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.520
And my hope is that
what works for me

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.140
is going to work for you.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.840
But this coming
week, we're going

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.480
to have more fun in the
sense that you're not aware

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.710
that hard, because you're going
to be using a flatbed scanner

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.600
and you're going
to be a bit shocked

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.830
at some of the wonderful
images you can get from that.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.200
So in any event, we hope
we're going to create

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.840
something wonderful for you.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.908
Have fun this week.
