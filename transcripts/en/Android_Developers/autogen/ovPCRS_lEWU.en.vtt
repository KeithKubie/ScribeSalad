the Play Developer console and look at
 

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:19.570
the Play Developer console and look at
this data now we're going to making a

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:19.580
this data now we're going to making a
 

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.950
this data now we're going to making a
lot of data available here for the first

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:20.960
lot of data available here for the first
 

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.120
lot of data available here for the first
time and we think this is going to

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.130
time and we think this is going to
 

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.310
time and we think this is going to
change the dynamics within companies in

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.590
if you're in the bottom 25% for any one
of these metrics we will flag that to

00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600
of these metrics we will flag that to
 

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.420
of these metrics we will flag that to
you and put a red exclamation mark on

you and put a red exclamation mark on
 

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.090
you and put a red exclamation mark on
your application this alerts you that

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:04.100
your application this alerts you that
 

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.710
your application this alerts you that
this is an area where you should really

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720
this is an area where you should really
 

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.600
this is an area where you should really
invest in because you're underperforming

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:07.610
invest in because you're underperforming
 

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:12.230
invest in because you're underperforming
compared to your peers

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240
 

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.929
so this talk is about user retention and

00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:14.939
so this talk is about user retention and
 

00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:18.199
so this talk is about user retention and
here's a quote from the Kabam team of

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:18.209
here's a quote from the Kabam team of
 

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:21.179
here's a quote from the Kabam team of
how much they user retention has

00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:21.189
how much they user retention has
 

00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:23.100
how much they user retention has
improved as a result of their focusing

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:23.110
improved as a result of their focusing
 

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.380
improved as a result of their focusing
on performance and so we hope that all

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:25.390
on performance and so we hope that all
 

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.049
on performance and so we hope that all
of you will make performance a big part

00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:28.059
of you will make performance a big part
 

00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:29.639
of you will make performance a big part
of your culture and your app development

00:17:29.639 --> 00:17:29.649
of your culture and your app development
 

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:31.820
of your culture and your app development
for us in the future

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:31.830
for us in the future
 

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.470
for us in the future
great so now we're going to jump into

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480
great so now we're going to jump into
 

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.649
great so now we're going to jump into
three other secrets that are all tied

00:17:37.649 --> 00:17:37.659
three other secrets that are all tied
 

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:39.180
three other secrets that are all tied
together and I'm going to draw an

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.190
together and I'm going to draw an
 

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.159
together and I'm going to draw an
analogy here to at triathlons I

00:17:41.159 --> 00:17:41.169
analogy here to at triathlons I
 

00:17:41.169 --> 00:17:42.539
analogy here to at triathlons I
completed a couple of triathlons myself

00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:42.549
completed a couple of triathlons myself
 

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:45.509
completed a couple of triathlons myself
and when you are training for a

00:17:45.509 --> 00:17:45.519
and when you are training for a
 

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:47.850
and when you are training for a
triathlon and you improve in one sport

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:47.860
triathlon and you improve in one sport
 

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.620
triathlon and you improve in one sport
you increase your fitness you increase

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:49.630
you increase your fitness you increase
 

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.810
you increase your fitness you increase
your performance into other sports as

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:51.820
your performance into other sports as
 

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.299
your performance into other sports as
well and that's where by improving in

00:17:54.299 --> 00:17:54.309
well and that's where by improving in
 

00:17:54.309 --> 00:17:56.070
well and that's where by improving in
one performance area you'll probably see

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080
one performance area you'll probably see
 

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.019
one performance area you'll probably see
input informants improvements into other

00:17:58.019 --> 00:17:58.029
input informants improvements into other
 

00:17:58.029 --> 00:18:00.450
input informants improvements into other
areas but you still need the knowledge

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:00.460
areas but you still need the knowledge
 

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.879
areas but you still need the knowledge
and equipment to be successful in each

00:18:02.879 --> 00:18:02.889
and equipment to be successful in each
 

00:18:02.889 --> 00:18:07.080
and equipment to be successful in each
one individually so I hope you connect

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.090
one individually so I hope you connect
 

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.700
one individually so I hope you connect
with the analogy so let's jump into the

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:08.710
with the analogy so let's jump into the
 

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.190
with the analogy so let's jump into the
first sport only joking the first bad

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200
first sport only joking the first bad
 

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.539
first sport only joking the first bad
performance area here so stability so

00:18:14.539 --> 00:18:14.549
performance area here so stability so
 

00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:16.740
performance area here so stability so
stability is all about providing a

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:16.750
stability is all about providing a
 

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.399
stability is all about providing a
reliable experience your users and we

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:20.409
reliable experience your users and we
 

00:18:20.409 --> 00:18:22.350
reliable experience your users and we
are providing a lot of insights here

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360
are providing a lot of insights here
 

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.480
are providing a lot of insights here
that you might not have been able to get

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:24.490
that you might not have been able to get
 

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:29.430
that you might not have been able to get
from other crash reporting tools and why

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440
from other crash reporting tools and why
 

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.560
from other crash reporting tools and why
would you care about this area so what

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:31.570
would you care about this area so what
 

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.600
would you care about this area so what
we found is that making a first

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:33.610
we found is that making a first
 

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.820
we found is that making a first
impression on users is critical as we

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:35.830
impression on users is critical as we
 

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.490
impression on users is critical as we
all know and that the data shows that if

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:38.500
all know and that the data shows that if
 

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.620
all know and that the data shows that if
your app crashes loss on the first day
