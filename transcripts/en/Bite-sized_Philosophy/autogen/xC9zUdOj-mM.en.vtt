00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
isn't anything you can do about it so
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
isn't anything you can do about it so
that<00:00:59.010><c> has</c><00:00:59.190><c> to</c><00:00:59.399><c> happen</c><00:00:59.550><c> between</c><00:00:59.879><c> two</c><00:01:00.149><c> and</c><00:01:00.359><c> four</c>
