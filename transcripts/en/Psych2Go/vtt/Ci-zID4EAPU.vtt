*Intro music*

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.100
Hello psyc2go'ers!  We just want to take the time to thank you for all your kind support.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.940
We are a team of dedicated, passionate and hardworking individuals who come together every day with one goal in mind.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.960
We want to make psychology come alive for you.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.380
Psychologists have reported that within the past 10 years,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.700
There has been a rise in mistrust between partners and romantic relationships.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.340
With the wide spread of Technology, it makes it easy to connect and reconnect with others.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.100
But technology can cause people to feel isolated -- just as much as it expands our world of networking.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.660
As a result, social connection is stifled from the challenges of being vulnerable.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.580
Here are six ways. You can break free from your trust issues

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.780
1. Ask yourself how your reactions line up with reality.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.420
Our motions exist to tell us when something is or isn't working.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.900
But sometimes they can get the best of us

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.500
and distract us from problem solving when we're being rash, angry, or defensive.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.860
As a result, the thoughts we have may not always be an honest perception of what is happening.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.540
Self-evaluation is key.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.760
It's important to recognize when you're quick to close yourself up from someone because you're expecting the worst

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.700
even if it hasn't happened.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.900
2. Learn to be non defensive when you communicate.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.200
People like consistency.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.380
Even if a life situation is toxic,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.860
we may be hesitant to embrace change because familiarity is more important to us.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.360
That's why old habits are hard to break.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.920
This includes our communication patterns.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.600
Learn to be non defensive by trying to understand where the other person is coming from.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.500
Ask yourself if they're an actual threat or if that's what you've been training yourself to believe.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.800
Chances are,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.720
people take the time to talk to you because they care about you -- not because they want to hurt you.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.260
3. Let people know what you need and be direct about it.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.680
Communication is a two-way street.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.460
People aren't mind reader's.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.640
Dropping hints and expecting people to play detective is only going to set you up for disappointment.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.600
In order to build trust, you have to be open and honest.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.360
People often have trust issues because they are afraid of getting hurt.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.320
This is why we build walls to protect ourselves.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.460
But getting hurt is part of the process of growing and cultivating deep relationships.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.280
Trust issues are developed when too much focus is concentrated on the pain,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.620
but not enough on overcoming the pain.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.700
4. Give people a chance to show you who they are.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.200
We live in an era of instant gratification.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.880
We want relationships to be easy and immediate.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.460
But people aren't vending machines and building trust doesn't just happen when we want it to.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.440
We must learn to be patient and spend time with others to get to know them.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.400
People often try to look for perfection when they have trust issues.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.980
As a result, they may seek perfection in others in order to avoid conflict.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.760
But superficial relationships aren't fulfilling nor healthy for making social connections.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.840
Give people time to show you their true colors,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.000
and you may be surprised that you can go through challenges well together.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.180
5. Practice open-ended conversations that allow disagreements.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.080
It's easy to fall into the trap of anger or bottling our thoughts because we don't want to rock the boat.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.400
Rather than holding on to insecure thinking, practice having open-ended conversations and debates.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.680
It's healthy to sometimes disagree,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.340
and it's important to understand that others can view things differently--without feeling a need to control belittle or mold them.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.080
6. Confront your fears and don't allow them to hold control over you.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.800
Letting go is a scary thing, and that fear sometimes never goes away.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.240
But you need to decide if it's holding you back.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.040
Remember, you have the power to work through your struggles openly and honestly.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.600
Don't allow self doubt to bring you down. You have it in you to connect and build trust with others.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.700
