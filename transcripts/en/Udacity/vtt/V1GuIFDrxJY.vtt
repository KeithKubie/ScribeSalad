00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.540
This first answer is simply false. 
Both objects are translated by some

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.810
amount from the origin. 
The second answer is true.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.890
If you scale by the same scaling matrix, 
the objects are the same size.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.800
They may be in different positions, but 
they'll have the same dimensions.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.974
The objects is not in the same position. 
If you scale up by a million, then move a

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:20.838
foot, you've moved a foot for case A. 
If you move a foot, then scale it up by a

00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:24.270
million, its origin will essentially move 
a million feet, for case B.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.860
This next one could be true or false. 
It depends on the scale factor.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.460
If the object is growing larger, then 
it's true, B would move farther than A.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.203
If the object is shrinking, A would move 
farther than B.
