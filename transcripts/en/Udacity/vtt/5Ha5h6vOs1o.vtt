Hey Georgia,
what kind of phone do you have?

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.059
&gt;&gt; I have an iPhone.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.210
Why do you ask?

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.800
&gt;&gt; Well I'm trying to decide if i should
make Project Compass an iOS app or

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.370
an Android app.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.250
And, I don't know how to choose.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.670
&gt;&gt; Well depending on your users,
you may eventually need both.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.570
However, we can evaluate the different
pop forms to see what your next step is.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.799
&gt;&gt; Sounds like a good idea.

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:24.322
There are many things to consider
when deciding between Android and

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:29.050
iOS development such as user base,
revenue models or development speed.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.750
For example, if you want to release
your mobile app immediately,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.360
you may want to start
with an Android app.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.260
Google's app review process
has automated elements, so

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.420
you could see your app on the Google
Play Store sooner than you may see

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.240
your iOS app published to the app store.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.840
But Android is on
a broader range of devices.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.710
So it may be harder to program for

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.520
it because your app may function
differently depending on the device.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.130
iOS apps are only program for

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.610
iPhones so there are less hardware
differences to account for.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.230
That's kind of a lot to think about.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.170
There are a lot of factors to evaluate.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.640
But there are also a ton of resources
to help you make this decision.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.640
Okay, thanks Georgia.
