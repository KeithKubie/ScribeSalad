00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.438
- She had a part time job
and didn't have enough money

00:00:02.438 --> 00:00:04.731
to support her young children,

00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:07.450
so she had turned at
times to prostitution.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.931
And he had sent food down through Caritas,

00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:11.575
you know, Catholic charity organization,

00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:14.264
to feed the kids and the woman.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:17.115
And she came around
Christmas and asked for him.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:18.228
he came down and said,

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:20.649
"Oh, I glad you got the food."

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.570
And she said, "Well
thank you for the food,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.862
"but I really wanted to thank you

00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:27.029
"because you always called me Senora."

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:29.287
And, um--

00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:30.287
- [Woman] The respect.

00:00:30.287 --> 00:00:34.264
- It's respect and it's like
seeing into that person's soul

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:36.749
and figuring out that
what they really needed

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:38.032
was the food, of course.

00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:40.239
But what they really, really needed was

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.532
to be treated with respect

00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:43.104
and to be treated as a human being.

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:46.035
You know, it's these little
gestures that he does

00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:48.635
when he invites homeless
people to the Vatican

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:49.573
for his birthday.

00:00:49.573 --> 00:00:52.035
When he goes and visits prisoners.

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.725
When he comes to America
and he gets in a Fiat,

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:57.515
and all the big leadership
in America gets in those--

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.481
- I love that.
- huge SUVs,

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:02.531
and a 78 year-old man
gets in the back seat

00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:03.825
of a little Fiat?

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:06.188
I mean, he's sending a message to us.

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:07.695
And I think that's a huge challenge.
