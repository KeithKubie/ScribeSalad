00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.730
When little kids say they want to
grow up to be a scientist,

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.029
here's what they actually mean:

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:05.339
a. They want to blow things
up in a laboratory setting.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.270
b. They want to get bitten by a
radioactive monkey which will

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.840
turn them into a terrifying
humanoid battle monkey.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.410
c. They want to make a fly with
eyeballs on its butt,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.790
or like, chickens with fangs.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.320
Most of the time, scientists don't
get to do that stuff.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.100
Like, you may blow something up,
but it's either going to be in a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.820
really controlled setting or it
will be an accident, in which case,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.810
it's BAD.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.880
Like, the lab where
I first worked-

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.250
The first lab I ever worked in
had a blood stain on the ceiling.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.669
BUT, if you're a scientist
specializing in the amazing new

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.440
discipline of evolutionary
developmental biology,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.170
you might just get to make a fly
with eyeballs on its butt,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.059
or even a chicken with teeth.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:41.690
But no battle-monkeys!

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.690
So evolutionary developmental
biology, or Evo/Devo for all of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.420
us cool kids, is a new science
that looks deep into our genes

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.399
to figure out how exactly they
give instructions to make

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.629
different parts of our bodies.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.079
And as the name suggests,
it's giving us some hot leads

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.350
into the nature of,
and mechanisms behind, evolution.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.759
One big thing it's showing
us is that animals,

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.210
all animals, are way more
similar than we ever even imagined.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.380
You know how you always hear about
how humans and chimps are 98.6%

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.030
genetically similar?

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.189
It kind of makes sense, right?

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.939
Because chimps and humans you can
see that we kind of look alike.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.630
Like if you walk into a
coffee shop and there's

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.109
a chimp sitting in a chair,
and it's like,

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.380
maybe wearing a fedora
or something, you might

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.969
briefly mistake that
chimp for a human.

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.140
You might not even notice it's
sitting there. It could happen!

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.759
But what about a mouse? You are
not going to mistake a mouse

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:37.759
for a person.

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.259
How genetically similar do
you think we are with mice?

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.670
How about 85% similar?

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.240
OFF SCREEN: Shut up!

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.070
HANK: No, I won't shut up.
Humans and mice are 85%

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.229
genetically identical!

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.840
So why then are mice little and
skittery, covered in white fur

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.179
and have beady little eyes,
while I can walk upright

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.969
in a non-skittery way
and have beautiful,

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.670
deep, mysterious eyes?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.539
I'll give you the long answer
in a minute. But for now

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.039
the short answer is:
It's all because of

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.729
incredibly weird and amazingly
powerful genes called

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.780
developmental regulatory genes.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.630
Mostly when we're thinking of
genes we think of the things

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.800
that code for some useful enzyme
or protein, like the ones that

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.820
determine what our ankles are
going to look like.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.810
But those ankle genes don't just
come on and off at random,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.970
they have to be turned on and off.
That's what these developmental

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.630
regulatory genes do:
they activate the genes

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.570
that put the body parts together.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.630
They don't tell them how to do it,
mind you, they just tell them when,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.450
or if, it's time to get to work.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.140
And since they're the ones pretty
much calling the plays, regulatory

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.390
genes start working rather early
in embryonic development.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.800
For instance, a kind of regulatory
gene called gap genes are

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.660
responsible for telling the
blastula, that little hollow

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.680
ball of cells that forms during
the early stages of development,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.050
"make a mouth here and let's put
an anus over on this other end."

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.870
But probably the most amazing kind
of regulatory genes are the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.300
homeobox genes, or hox genes,
which kick into gear after

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.760
the embryo is more developed.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.690
Hox genes literally control the
identity of body parts,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.720
setting up how an animal's
body is organized.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.460
Like, here's where you put the leg
and here's where you put the tail.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.010
And like I said, these hox genes
don't give instructions for how

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.430
to create legs and tails, there
are a bunch of other genes that

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.750
are in charge of the actual
craftsmanship of the body parts.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.330
You can think of the hox genes as
the head architects in the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.010
construction of a building:
they've got the master plan,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.470
but they don't actually do any of
the construction themselves,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.290
that's WAY beneath them.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.570
And under this top tier of
regulatory genes, there are scads

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.740
of other genes that act as
subcontractors. If a hox gene

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.360
tells its direct subordinates to
"make an eye here" and the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.220
subordinates then turn around and
activate other regulatory genes

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.800
that give more specific
instructions, like

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.080
"This is where to put the collagen
for the outer shell of the eyeball"

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.840
and "make some nerve tissue
for a retina right here."

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.260
Again, these second-tier genes,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.590
and third tier and fourth tier
and on down the line

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.410
don't actually do any of the work,
they just send instructions

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.340
down the chain of command,
adding more specific information

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.460
to the instructions as they go.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.160
It's a really rigid hierarchy:

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.980
No gene in your body, aside from
that very first one, does anything

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.460
until it's told when and
how much to do it.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.820
So, because I know that you're
such an intelligent

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.470
and curious student,
I know what you're

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.860
wondering right now.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.470
What activates that first
regulatory gene? And how in the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.600
name of Bill McGinnis do they
tell each other to do stuff?!

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.079
Well, since Evo-Devo is a
relatively new discipline,

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.820
we don't really know all
of the stuff that I wish we knew.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.460
That's for YOU to figure out
when you become a biologist.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.100
But scientists are starting to
think that a lot of the human

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.530
genome that has until recently
been considered "junk DNA,"

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.660
because it apparently doesn't code
for anything, might actually be

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.260
regulatory genes. For instance,
just in the past few years we've

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.300
learned that humans have about 230
separate hox genes in our genome,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.880
and they appear on every one
of our chromosomes,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.750
even the sex chromosomes.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.210
How regulatory genes are inherited
is also still being studied.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.790
From what scientists have been
able to deduce so far,

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.760
most regulatory genes are
inherited in very much

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.680
the same way as all
your other genes.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.220
But for some really early-stage
regulatory genes, the proteins

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.920
that they're coded to produce,
called gene products,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.100
have already been made and are
sitting in the egg before

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.240
it's fertilized, waiting to tell
the embryonic cells what to do to

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.389
get the ball rolling.
Another thing that your

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.670
mom did for you that you
probably never thanked her for.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.420
So here's the really cool thing:
Even though most regulatory genes

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.150
are inherited, each individual
within a species tends to have

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.880
the exact same DNA
sequence in those genes.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.210
There aren't even
different alleles.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.340
And when you think about it,
they kind of have to be the same,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.520
since all individuals of a
species should be built from the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.389
same basic blueprint. Like,
you don't want people walking

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.160
around with thumbs sticking
out of their heads.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.990
Now, this gets me back to me
and my beady-eyed friend the mouse.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.670
Hox genes and other regulatory
genes that are at the

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.030
very highest tier,
the ones that say "head here"

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.020
and "eye here,"

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.480
not only tend to be the same
within a species, they're also

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.720
very similar across
different animal groups.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.910
Like between all mammals
or even all vertebrates.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.120
The differences between my
regulatory genes and a mouse's

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.780
regulatory genes are way down
the chain of commands,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.380
where the instructions
are the most specific.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.990
But the big-picture stuff,
like you're a vertebrate,

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.330
you have four limbs,
you have hair and breast tissue

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.760
and ear bones and all that
stuff that all mammals have,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.120
all of those general
instructions are the same.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.310
And that's why 85% of humans'
genetic makeup is the same as mice.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.530
Mice's.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.270
Mouse-mice-meese's?

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.270
OK, you've been very patient,
my students, so I've got

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.710
a surprise for you.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.530
We're gonna make

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.960
some BUTT EYEBALLS!

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.120
In 1995, in a very cool and also
totally messed up experiment,

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.620
a team of researchers in
Switzerland took a hox gene

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.580
from a mouse embryo, one that
said "EYE GOES HERE,"

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.669
and inserted it into the DNA of a
developing fruit fly embryo.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.060
BUT, they activated the
mouse-eyeball gene in a region

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.060
of the fly that would
become the fly's back leg.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.160
And so what do you think happened?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.740
I'm not going to tell you yet
because I want you to guess.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.960
WRONG! The fruit fly DID NOT
grow a mouse eyeball

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.760
next to its back leg!
It actually developed a

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.570
fruit fly eye next
to its back leg.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.900
Remember, the gene didn't say
how to make an eye,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.370
it just gave the
instruction to make an eye.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.990
If it had said how to make it,
you'd get a mouse eye on the

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.940
fruit fly's butt.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.870
Instead it told the fruit fly
cells "make an eye here!"

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.310
and those fruit fly cells had
their own instructions,

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.389
regulated by another whole set
of regulatory genes.

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:21.370
And once they got the order to
make the eye, they made it in the

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.870
only way they knew how.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.050
That is pretty freakin' messed up,
but also FREAKING AWESOME!

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.270
Now, in addition to getting me in
touch with my inner

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.949
mentally-unstable child scientist,
this kind of experiment is where

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:38.010
Evo-Devo has begun to revolutionize
our understanding of evolution.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.240
Because we've known that evolution
can take place over a

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.669
really long time, but we haven't
really been able to figure out

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.389
how it sometimes happens
really fast.

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:47.639
Traditionally one of the main
ways scientists have explained

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:50.389
evolution is through
genetic mutations.

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:54.840
But an organism would have to do
a lot of mutating to evolve from,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.949
say, a dinosaur into a bird.

00:07:56.949 --> 00:07:59.479
It used to be thought that a 50%
change in form would require

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.979
a 50% mutation in genes.

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:04.870
Which would take a long time,
way longer than the pace at

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.940
which we see things
actually evolving.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.000
But it turns out that a small
change in a regulatory genes up

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.210
at the top of the chain of
command can have huge effects

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.110
on how an organism is
actually assembled.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.630
To understand how this works,
let's look at why birds

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.419
don't have teeth.

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:22.110
So, birds evolved from
theropod dinosaurs, which are

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.440
these freakin' sweet dinosaurs
like velociraptors,

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.660
which look a lot like birds,
but way more awesome and

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.930
with big, razor-sharp teeth.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.990
But you may have noticed that
birds don't have razor-sharp teeth.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.389
They have beaks. Under the old
way of thinking about evolution,

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:40.659
the loss of the teeth would have
had to happen very slowly as the

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:44.779
genes that make enamel and dentin
gradually mutated to make less

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:47.779
and less of each of those things
until they made none at all.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:50.839
And for a long time, that's just
how we thought dinosaurs evolved

00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:54.160
into birds. But there was
one problem: It would've taken

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.139
way longer for all of those
mutations to occur than it

00:08:57.139 --> 00:08:59.569
actually took for the dinosaurs
to evolve into birds,

00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:00.879
based on the fossil record.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:03.639
Fortunately, Evo-Devo is
offering us an explanation.

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:06.639
A single mutation in the
regulatory genes could have shut

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:08.050
off the enamel and dentin

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.319
production, and another mutation
in another regulatory gene could

00:09:11.319 --> 00:09:13.869
have upped the keratin production
from the level of

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:16.329
"make some scales" to the level
of "make a beak".

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:20.199
So birds actually still do have
genes for teeth from their

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:24.389
dinosaurian ancestors, they're
just not expressed, because the

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:25.899
regulators don't turn them on.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:29.610
How do we know? Well, in 2006,
a biologist at the University

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.869
of Wisconsin named John Fallon,
who studies birth defects,

00:09:32.869 --> 00:09:36.569
was looking at some mutant chicken
embryos and noticed that they

00:09:36.569 --> 00:09:40.490
had formed little teeth,
little baby reptile teeth.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.610
It turns out that mutations
affected the chickens' gene

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.199
regulation, allowing the teeth,
a feature lost to birds around

00:09:46.199 --> 00:09:49.879
60 million years ago, to
just pop back up again.

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:52.059
The same sort of crazy throwback
features have been observed in

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:56.050
snakes born with legs like their
ancestors once had, or blind cave

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.079
fish suddenly born with eyes.

00:09:58.079 --> 00:10:00.869
If you turn those genes on,
those ancient, repressed

00:10:00.869 --> 00:10:02.420
features come back.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.139
CRAZY!

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:04.429
I know!

00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:08.300
That's so cool!

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.819
It's all fairly new science so
this is still in my head

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:12.569
just really fantascinating.

00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:15.110
That's a word I made up!

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.379
