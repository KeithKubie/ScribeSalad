[mwah] Kiss [mwah]

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.080
Can I have a kiss Mommy?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.110
[mwah] All right. Bye everybody.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.160
 Love you too.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.170
[fast-forwarding tape]

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.240
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.250
I'm at YouTube headquarters here in San Bruno California and we're gonna learn about two things today.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.250
First, last week's video. I gave you some explosive high-speed video

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.250
and I asked you to analyze it. A French-speaking guy named Mr DuPont did it, he created a

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.260
simulation and you can actually see that the blast waves bounce off the bottle on the inside

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.280
and they coalesce to create a region of low pressure, and if you overlay the high-speed

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.320
imagery it perfectly matches, and you can see that that's where the low-pressure

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.360
is created and that's where you get cavitation. So if you want to see his model and his math,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.400
go look at the link in the description, he actually did all the work, it's amazing. I've been invited to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.420
YouTube headquarters today for You Tube EDU. They have all these great educators

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.460
from all over YouTube and they invited me as well. We gonna take a behind-the-scenes tour of what

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.470
it's like here at YouTube headquarters, with Brady, 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
and also we're gonna go introduce you to a lot of really cool people. Alright let's check it out.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.520
(Man speaking in noisy room) So the thing is, I need to check

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.530
the number of electrons, that's my fault, I may have typed in the wrong number of electrons.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.540
This is who?
 -- I'm Hank.
 Who are you?
- Hi I'm Hank.
 Never heard of you.
- Aah well.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.590
Yeah. Hank does a video show called SciShow.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.630
(Destin) This.
- Ooh what is that?
This is a shape memory alloy. There you go. Pull.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.690
[ groans]
Okay now we going to bend it. And then, just wad it up.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.720
(Desetin) We've ruined our spring.
- Oh why did you do that?
 If we only had another science

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.760
Youtuber. Well that's a math one, that's Vihart.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.810
Oop, hey! Check it out! It's Henry, MinutePhysics. If we only had somebody that had like

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.850
five channels... Oh! It's Brady!
- Destin! What are you doing here?

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.890
- Oh I don't know. Take this matchbook if you would. You know what? There's a grill over there, is it...

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.910
- That's amazing. I've never seen anything like it.
[laughs]

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.950
- That's incredible! How did you do that?! (sarcastically)
(Destin) There's some things to keep this hot?

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.990
 Pull that up. Okay.
(Woman) Yeah. I used to work in hotels.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.040
(Destin) Okay there. I need that. Will you hold that?
- I can't believe you actually stole some sterno.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.120
(Destin) So it takes a little bit, but just watch.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.220
[gasps]
- It's alive
- That's witchcraft!

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.230
So this is Mike Rugnetta. PBS idea channel. Pretty awesome. Even has the...

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.290
Would you say that's a Norm Abrams beard?
- Oh man, you know... Norm Abrams' a little bit...

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.310
and I think I would need a hat too.
- Group six but that's your own group.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.360
Hey this is Destin with group 6. We're making a collaboration video before Veritasium.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.390
[laughs]
 We're going to a special place with Brady.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.430
[shh]
(Destin) [whispers] This is not happening.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.460
 It's against the rules. Can we do it? Are we going?
- Yeah
 Okay.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.510
 There's a slide at the YouTube office and it's about to happen. This is Angela, and we're about to race.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.550
 Angela put on the whole EDU thing, but right now we're just racing.
(Angela) [whispered] I'm totally gonna win.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.590
 I don't take stairs I just take the slide.
(Destin) all the time?
 - All the time.
- All right are we gonna race or how're we gonna do this?

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.620
- Yeah. You go on count?
(Destin) Yeah. 123.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.660
[laughs]

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.690
That's her job! That's her job! It's crazy!
- He cheated.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.730
(Destin) Brady you doing it? Do it with a camera.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.770
So we got Logan from TED Ed.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.800
He's going to make some videos soon where you have questions for Smarter Every Day videos.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.830
All that really matters right now is he's about to get beat on a slide.
- This is uncool runnings.
[laughs]

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.870
Einz.. Zwei.. Drei..

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.900
[laughs]

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.510
- Champion.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.960
(Destin) So you can have,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.980
 you can have your pet here with you.
- You can have your dog here with you. They even have shuttles

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.010
 where people get a ride with their dogs to work.
- Are you serious?

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.020
- Yeah. So that other people who are allergic don't have to ride with them.
- That's amazing!

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.100
- Oh my god it's a [Japanese type of wimpy dog]

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.110
(Destin) What are you doing?
[dog barks]

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.980
(Brady) I come in peace.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.980
(Destin) There's even a Tiki Bar. Oh man, snacks.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.220
That's nice.
- How's that baby?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.260
That's good, that's really good. Get that out of here! Get! [laughs]

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.280
- Actually I stand most of the time. I have a standing desk.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.310
- Why is that? Is it for your abs?
- It's better for you.
- I know. I stand a lot too.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.370
[laughs]
(Destin) I like trinkets on desks.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.430
- You know what? I'll take it.
[laughs]

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.480
- You guys are cool with face first right?

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.500
- But I have the cards to build the settlement now.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.540
- You're deep in thought Ray.
- I am. Settlers of Catan is intense.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.540
(Destin) Oh, oh.. There we go.
(Vihart) Ok - Again.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.560
Oh nice.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.580
(CGP Grey) I don't think you understand what's happening here.
(Hank) No I don't.
(Grey) No you really don't.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.600
I want two ore or nothing, and you have nothing.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.650
[laughs]

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.720
(Grey) Again, this is not my problem.
(Hank) You said "do you have a brick?".

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.760
- Okay, big thanks to Angela who put everything on. Howdy.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.780
Thank you so much.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.780
