00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.290
The answer is that it does not.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.880
You can see that it doesn't
satisfy that last clause here.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.660
A is false, B bar is false,
and C bar is false.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.770
Therefore this clause is false.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.490
And because it's anded with the rest,
the whole expression is false.
