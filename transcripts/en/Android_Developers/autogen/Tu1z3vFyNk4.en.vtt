to play the thing about it on a tablet
you notice immediately is that the

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910
you notice immediately is that the
 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.170
you notice immediately is that the
controls are not actually scaled at all

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180
controls are not actually scaled at all
 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.270
controls are not actually scaled at all
to reflect a tablet surface so it's

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280
to reflect a tablet surface so it's
 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.770
to reflect a tablet surface so it's
actually this d-pad that you see here on

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780
actually this d-pad that you see here on
 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.140
actually this d-pad that you see here on
the left is actually kind of difficult

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150
the left is actually kind of difficult
 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.610
the left is actually kind of difficult
to use on a tablet you see I've really

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620
to use on a tablet you see I've really
 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.710
to use on a tablet you see I've really
got to move my finger an enormous amount

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720
got to move my finger an enormous amount
 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.420
got to move my finger an enormous amount
of distance the other thing to note of

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430
of distance the other thing to note of
 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.650
of distance the other thing to note of
course is it it's just kind of a low

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660
course is it it's just kind of a low
 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.070
course is it it's just kind of a low
resolution HUD and you know we don't

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080
resolution HUD and you know we don't
 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.450
resolution HUD and you know we don't
really expect someone to go through and

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460
really expect someone to go through and
 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.030
really expect someone to go through and
redo all of the graphics of the game you

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040
redo all of the graphics of the game you

HD but it would be great to have at

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980
HD but it would be great to have at
 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.070
HD but it would be great to have at
least the the heads up display part that

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080
least the the heads up display part that
 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.500
least the the heads up display part that
users using interact with the title be

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510
users using interact with the title be
 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.780
users using interact with the title be
higher resolution so you know I think if

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790
higher resolution so you know I think if
 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.820
higher resolution so you know I think if
we looked at this game today we would

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830
we looked at this game today we would
 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.930
we looked at this game today we would
probably come you know the team would

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940
probably come you know the team would
 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.970
probably come you know the team would
probably contact them and say hey really

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980
probably contact them and say hey really
 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.160
probably contact them and say hey really
great beautiful-looking art but we

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170
great beautiful-looking art but we
 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.600
great beautiful-looking art but we
really want to see the HUD work better

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610
really want to see the HUD work better
 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.310

on tablets we really want to to see it

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320
on tablets we really want to to see it
 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.470
on tablets we really want to to see it
be higher resolution so anything

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480
be higher resolution so anything
 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.900
be higher resolution so anything
anything else I want to add there no but

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910
anything else I want to add there no but
 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.160

and and it looks pretty crisp and clear
 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.510
and and it looks pretty crisp and clear
but once you get it up to 10 inch

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520
but once you get it up to 10 inch
 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.790

you're going to see this blurriness and
 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.050
you're going to see this blurriness and
that doesn't really affect the gameplay

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060
that doesn't really affect the gameplay
 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.670
that doesn't really affect the gameplay
and I'm not going to say that it makes

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680
and I'm not going to say that it makes
 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.339
and I'm not going to say that it makes
the game any better or worse but it does

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349
the game any better or worse but it does
 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.990

because the Android featuring committee
 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.360
because the Android featuring committee
takes tablets very seriously and we

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370
takes tablets very seriously and we
 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.770
takes tablets very seriously and we
definitely want to see things that are

it would also be great to see it
actually getting a well while is it

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880
actually getting a well while is it
 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.189

information so you'll see that as i move

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199
information so you'll see that as i move
 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.330

pick things up with an action button and
 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.909
pick things up with an action button and
all of this is kind of unintuitive if

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919
all of this is kind of unintuitive if
 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:25.589
all of this is kind of unintuitive if
i'm used to using everything else on the

pick it up but is that I have to walk
 

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:34.559
pick it up but is that I have to walk
over to it and hit the action button so

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:34.569
over to it and hit the action button so
 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:35.820
over to it and hit the action button so
there's a lot of things that could be

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830
there's a lot of things that could be
 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.350
there's a lot of things that could be
done with a little bit more work and I'd

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360
done with a little bit more work and I'd
 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.119
done with a little bit more work and I'd
love to see some of that happen because

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:39.129
love to see some of that happen because
 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:40.770
love to see some of that happen because

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:51.209
turn from being something that is
appealing to kind of a nice genre to

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:51.219
appealing to kind of a nice genre to
 

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:53.129
appealing to kind of a nice genre to
something that has wider appeal and I

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:53.139
something that has wider appeal and I

something probably yeah there's it I

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:06.580
something probably yeah there's it I

suspect that reindeer two are not in

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:08.889
suspect that reindeer two are not in
 

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:10.800
suspect that reindeer two are not in
fact I know from experience reindeer are

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:10.810
fact I know from experience reindeer are
 

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.860

certainly not the most tenacious enemy
 

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.390
certainly not the most tenacious enemy
you will face but I do think it's kind

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400
you will face but I do think it's kind
 

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.620
you will face but I do think it's kind
of a funny thing that the game begins

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:16.630
of a funny thing that the game begins
 

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.120
of a funny thing that the game begins
with that with you having to battle

actually the goal of the early or the
 

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.629
actually the goal of the early or the
game also this is another thing that we

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639
game also this is another thing that we
 

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:27.769
game also this is another thing that we
noticed is it when the game has an ad

00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:27.779
noticed is it when the game has an ad
 

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:30.990
noticed is it when the game has an ad
obviously it's not really taking the the

the tablet ad be really really small
 

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:45.610
the tablet ad be really really small
because it's the same size that's

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:45.620

okay let's go ahead and launch this so

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:03.220
okay let's go ahead and launch this so
 

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.380
okay let's go ahead and launch this so
you'll see when we launched it you'll

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:04.390
you'll see when we launched it you'll
 

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.440
you'll see when we launched it you'll
see that it has this screen and actually

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:07.450
see that it has this screen and actually
 

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.970

this was a bug in an older version of

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:08.980
this was a bug in an older version of
 

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.880
this was a bug in an older version of
the unity and it was and it simply you

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:11.890
the unity and it was and it simply you
 

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.830
the unity and it was and it simply you
made the the reason why unity had this

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840
made the the reason why unity had this
 

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.450
made the the reason why unity had this
problem was they made the assumption

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:15.460
problem was they made the assumption
 

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.640
problem was they made the assumption
that if you loaded a PNG it would

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:17.650
that if you loaded a PNG it would
 

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.550
that if you loaded a PNG it would
actually load into a 16-bit bitmap and

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:20.560
actually load into a 16-bit bitmap and
 

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.740
actually load into a 16-bit bitmap and
the reality is if you're using bitmap

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:22.750
the reality is if you're using bitmap
 

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.420
the reality is if you're using bitmap
factory and you're loading a PNG it's

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:24.430
factory and you're loading a PNG it's
 

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.070
factory and you're loading a PNG it's
actually going to load into whatever the

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080
actually going to load into whatever the
 

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.900
actually going to load into whatever the
operating system feels like if you don't

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:27.910
operating system feels like if you don't
 

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.080
operating system feels like if you don't
actually set some parameters on that and

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:31.090
actually set some parameters on that and
 

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.550
actually set some parameters on that and
so what ended up happening is it when we

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:32.560
so what ended up happening is it when we
 

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.250
so what ended up happening is it when we
went to ice cream sandwich we actually

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:35.260
went to ice cream sandwich we actually
 

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.020
went to ice cream sandwich we actually
made it always load 32-bit for the

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:37.030
made it always load 32-bit for the
 

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.450
made it always load 32-bit for the
highest possible rendering quality so

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:39.460
highest possible rendering quality so
 

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.310
highest possible rendering quality so
unfortunately he was there like a

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320
unfortunately he was there like a
 

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.690
unfortunately he was there like a
Russian dude making this decision

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:42.700
Russian dude making this decision
 

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.430
Russian dude making this decision
actually he was friends yeah I thought

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:44.440
actually he was friends yeah I thought
 

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.480
actually he was friends yeah I thought
you're the highest

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:45.490
you're the highest
 

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.780
you're the highest
is possible entry question so uh so in

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:48.790
is possible entry question so uh so in
 

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.960
is possible entry question so uh so in
any case and so so yeah so we actually

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:51.970
any case and so so yeah so we actually
 

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.250
any case and so so yeah so we actually
worked this bug out with unity and they

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:53.260
worked this bug out with unity and they
 

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.010
worked this bug out with unity and they
they did update it and so my you know my

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:56.020
they did update it and so my you know my
 

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.020
they did update it and so my you know my
general guideline is with unity you know

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:58.030
general guideline is with unity you know
 

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.910
general guideline is with unity you know

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480
and and that and and the revenue shares
 

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.419
and and that and and the revenue shares
were actually not nearly as generous for

00:31:32.419 --> 00:31:32.429
were actually not nearly as generous for
 

00:31:32.429 --> 00:31:34.250

for multi-threading so we actually had

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:49.110
for multi-threading so we actually had
 

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.720
for multi-threading so we actually had
to use cooperative multitasking in our

it's a pretty fun game it has all the
elements of a fun game and I really

elements of a fun game and I really
 

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.200
elements of a fun game and I really
enjoyed playing it it it definitely

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.210
enjoyed playing it it it definitely

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:09.500
other ones we've seen mm-hmm well you
 

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.560
other ones we've seen mm-hmm well you
know any anytime you actually see a game

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:11.570
know any anytime you actually see a game
 

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.600
know any anytime you actually see a game
with an FPS counter on it you know that

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:13.610
with an FPS counter on it you know that
 

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.250
with an FPS counter on it you know that
it sort of feels like the little bit in

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:15.260
it sort of feels like the little bit in
 

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.620
it sort of feels like the little bit in
development you know that yeah this is

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:17.630
development you know that yeah this is
 

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.370
development you know that yeah this is
definitely a hacker game and and

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:21.380
definitely a hacker game and and
 

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.930
definitely a hacker game and and
indefinitely that's one thing I've

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:22.940
indefinitely that's one thing I've
 

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.640
indefinitely that's one thing I've
noticed is that the framerate does tend

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:24.650
noticed is that the framerate does tend
 

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.350
noticed is that the framerate does tend
to slow down on my device so you're

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:26.360
to slow down on my device so you're
 

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.550
to slow down on my device so you're
you're controlling it in a completely

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:27.560
you're controlling it in a completely
 

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.740
you're controlling it in a completely
different way than I did oh really yeah

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:29.750
different way than I did oh really yeah
 

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.890
different way than I did oh really yeah
so let me try so the way I controlled it

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:32.900
so let me try so the way I controlled it
 

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.570
so let me try so the way I controlled it
was by just compass points yes but you

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:37.580
was by just compass points yes but you
 

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.400
was by just compass points yes but you
were kind of like going all over the

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:39.410
were kind of like going all over the
 

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.430
were kind of like going all over the
place but it actually I was just I was

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440
place but it actually I was just I was
 

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.840
place but it actually I was just I was
just using that to steer because you can

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:43.850
just using that to steer because you can
 

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:45.190
just using that to steer because you can
steer from all different positions of

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200
steer from all different positions of
 

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.260
steer from all different positions of
the joystick that's a good point so if

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:47.270
the joystick that's a good point so if
 

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.850
the joystick that's a good point so if
you if you put your joystick on the

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:48.860
you if you put your joystick on the
 

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.140
you if you put your joystick on the
plane then you can just say this is

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:50.150
plane then you can just say this is
 

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:52.150
plane then you can just say this is
where I want to go but it hides my plane

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:52.160
where I want to go but it hides my plane
 

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.610
where I want to go but it hides my plane
I can't watch it being shot repeatedly

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:54.620
I can't watch it being shot repeatedly
 

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.120
I can't watch it being shot repeatedly
by everything that we shot these people

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:58.130
by everything that we shot these people
 

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.250
by everything that we shot these people
suck actually yeah I would say their aim

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:00.260
suck actually yeah I would say their aim
 

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.870
suck actually yeah I would say their aim

the bullet pass would suggest although
it's possible that i'm indy i'm in the

real version of the game you're you're
 

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.000
real version of the game you're you're
playing the helper burden i think so

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.010
playing the helper burden i think so
 

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.760
playing the helper burden i think so
yeah okay so well but yeah but what you

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:15.770
yeah okay so well but yeah but what you
 

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.409
yeah okay so well but yeah but what you
want to do is fly to your carrier and

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:17.419
want to do is fly to your carrier and
 

00:34:17.419 --> 00:34:20.220
want to do is fly to your carrier and
then you can pick up some speed and some

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:20.230
then you can pick up some speed and some
 

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.580
then you can pick up some speed and some
range and other things that you know as

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:24.590
range and other things that you know as
 

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.940

you did in World War two you had to buy

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:27.950
you did in World War two you had to buy
 

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:29.770
you did in World War two you had to buy
everything for your plane no I will you

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:29.780
everything for your plane no I will you
 

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.710
everything for your plane no I will you
know he'll nights did used to use the

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720
know he'll nights did used to use the

more popular current term

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:33.990

more popular current term
a time of austerity and we work and we

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:36.810
a time of austerity and we work and we
 

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.990
a time of austerity and we work and we
were conserving everywhere we could and

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000
were conserving everywhere we could and
 

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.940
were conserving everywhere we could and
so obviously you wouldn't be very well

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:40.950
so obviously you wouldn't be very well
 

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:42.500
so obviously you wouldn't be very well
equipped you have that you'd have to get

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:42.510
equipped you have that you'd have to get
 

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.419
equipped you have that you'd have to get
scrap from other planes bring that back

00:34:44.419 --> 00:34:44.429
scrap from other planes bring that back
 

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:46.070
scrap from other planes bring that back
and then they would melt that down and

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080
and then they would melt that down and
 

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.690
and then they would melt that down and
turn that into weapons for you so

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:47.700
turn that into weapons for you so
 

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.970
turn that into weapons for you so
clearly obviously we've we have time

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980
clearly obviously we've we have time
 

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.379
clearly obviously we've we have time

and and so let's just let's just get
into the game the goal is you have to

00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800
into the game the goal is you have to
 

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.560
into the game the goal is you have to
you have to click on blocks that are

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:00.570
you have to click on blocks that are
 

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.740
you have to click on blocks that are
that more than three so there we are and

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:03.750
that more than three so there we are and
 

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.780
that more than three so there we are and
and and you try to find combination

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:05.790
and and you try to find combination
 

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.670

is not going to help me at all what does
that look to that will break everything

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780
that look to that will break everything
 

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.050

know this game obviously has like a
whole bunch of classic things that you

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:28.190
whole bunch of classic things that you
 

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:29.740
whole bunch of classic things that you
know that we've talked about in the past

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:29.750
know that we've talked about in the past
 

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.440
know that we've talked about in the past
one of them is obviously it has giant

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:32.450
one of them is obviously it has giant
 

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:34.030
one of them is obviously it has giant
black borders on either side yeah

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040
black borders on either side yeah
 

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.980
black borders on either side yeah
Blissett is a letterbox aspect ratio she

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:35.990
Blissett is a letterbox aspect ratio she
 

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.630
Blissett is a letterbox aspect ratio she
also has the Zoom button I want to press

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640
also has the Zoom button I want to press
 

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.700
also has the Zoom button I want to press
this just to see what happens let's zoom

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:39.710
this just to see what happens let's zoom
 

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.460
this just to see what happens let's zoom
to fill screen I and of course the game

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:42.470
to fill screen I and of course the game
 

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.770
to fill screen I and of course the game
closes that's not surprising Burt

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:44.780
closes that's not surprising Burt
 

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.870
closes that's not surprising Burt
village yeah those what's going on most

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880
village yeah those what's going on most
 

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.490
village yeah those what's going on most
games actually don't have the ability to

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:48.500
games actually don't have the ability to
 

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.710
games actually don't have the ability to
handle screen sizes that change they all

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720
handle screen sizes that change they all
 

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.720
handle screen sizes that change they all
should now what the hell you're actually

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:52.730
should now what the hell you're actually
 

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.339
should now what the hell you're actually
seeing is that the graphics are totally

00:44:54.339 --> 00:44:54.349
seeing is that the graphics are totally
 

00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:56.680
seeing is that the graphics are totally
unchanged when we zoom in and the reason

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:56.690
unchanged when we zoom in and the reason
 

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:58.780
unchanged when we zoom in and the reason
why is they're very very low quality in

00:44:58.780 --> 00:44:58.790
why is they're very very low quality in
 

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:00.250
why is they're very very low quality in
fact it's possible the graphics are

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:00.260
fact it's possible the graphics are
 

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.140
fact it's possible the graphics are
actually higher quality now when we're

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:02.150
actually higher quality now when we're
 

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.609
actually higher quality now when we're
zoomed in this way well that does

00:45:03.609 --> 00:45:03.619
zoomed in this way well that does
 

00:45:03.619 --> 00:45:06.420
zoomed in this way well that does
sometimes happen and the reason is that

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:06.430
sometimes happen and the reason is that
 

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:10.950
sometimes happen and the reason is that
the full screen is an mdpi whereas the

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960
the full screen is an mdpi whereas the
 

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.870
the full screen is an mdpi whereas the
compatibility mode emulates an HTTP I

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880
compatibility mode emulates an HTTP I
 

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.520
compatibility mode emulates an HTTP I
device or a different DPI device

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:15.530
device or a different DPI device
 

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:16.720
device or a different DPI device
actually I'm not really sure which one

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:16.730
actually I'm not really sure which one
 

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.960
actually I'm not really sure which one
it is and then zooms you out and so

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:18.970
it is and then zooms you out and so
 

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:21.430
it is and then zooms you out and so
sometimes the game will select different

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440
sometimes the game will select different
 

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.650
sometimes the game will select different
resources based on that and they'll

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:23.660
resources based on that and they'll
 

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.450
resources based on that and they'll
actually be higher quality yeah

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:25.460
actually be higher quality yeah
 

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:26.750
actually be higher quality yeah
sometimes its interests

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760
sometimes its interests
 

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.780
sometimes its interests
usually it's just because the game is is

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:28.790
usually it's just because the game is is
 

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:31.670
usually it's just because the game is is
stretching in different ways but but but

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680
stretching in different ways but but but
 

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.490
stretching in different ways but but but
so this game is an example of also

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:34.500
so this game is an example of also
 

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.680
so this game is an example of also
having the menu button of shame and it's

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:36.690
having the menu button of shame and it's
 

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.870
having the menu button of shame and it's
actually important for papaya so this is

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880
actually important for papaya so this is
 

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.510
actually important for papaya so this is
once again a case in which having a

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520
once again a case in which having a
 

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.370
once again a case in which having a
third party libraries preventing you

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380
third party libraries preventing you
 

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.080
third party libraries preventing you
from really doing the right thing

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:45.090
from really doing the right thing
 

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:47.090
from really doing the right thing
however the zoom buttons easy to prevent

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:47.100
however the zoom buttons easy to prevent
 

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.830
however the zoom buttons easy to prevent
and you don't need to do that you don't

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:48.840
and you don't need to do that you don't
 

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.330
and you don't need to do that you don't
actually need to have papaya to do that

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:50.340
actually need to have papaya to do that
 

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.470
actually need to have papaya to do that
this you just need to target a

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480
this you just need to target a
 

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.810
this you just need to target a
reasonably high SDK version or to get

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:53.820
reasonably high SDK version or to get
 

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.240
reasonably high SDK version or to get
rid of there as well and and or make

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:56.250
rid of there as well and and or make
 

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:58.220
rid of there as well and and or make
sure you support recent you know

00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:58.230
sure you support recent you know
 

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.940
sure you support recent you know
multiple screen sizes so I'm talk about

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:01.950
multiple screen sizes so I'm talk about
 

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.820
multiple screen sizes so I'm talk about
a pie in this game this is uh this is

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:04.830
a pie in this game this is uh this is
 

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:07.280
a pie in this game this is uh this is
also one of these cases in which papaya

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:07.290
also one of these cases in which papaya
 

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:08.660
also one of these cases in which papaya
actually does a bunch of stuff in this

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:08.670
actually does a bunch of stuff in this
 

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:09.860
actually does a bunch of stuff in this
game that just cause the game to not

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:09.870
game that just cause the game to not
 

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.740
game that just cause the game to not
work very well and so it's really

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:12.750
work very well and so it's really
 

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:13.790
work very well and so it's really
important when you integrate these

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800
important when you integrate these
 

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.290
important when you integrate these
third-party libraries to try to make

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300
third-party libraries to try to make
 

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.820
third-party libraries to try to make
sure that they're actually they're

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:16.830
sure that they're actually they're
 

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:18.350
sure that they're actually they're
actually doing something right like I've

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:18.360
actually doing something right like I've
 

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.880
actually doing something right like I've
had papaya pop up something in the

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:19.890
had papaya pop up something in the
 

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.200
had papaya pop up something in the
screening that I couldn't get rid of and

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:21.210
screening that I couldn't get rid of and
 

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:23.240
screening that I couldn't get rid of and
I had to close the game and all sorts of

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:23.250
I had to close the game and all sorts of
 

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:25.040
I had to close the game and all sorts of
stuff so it's very very you know i think

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.050
stuff so it's very very you know i think
 

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.840
stuff so it's very very you know i think
that i know it's tricky to write a

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:26.850
that i know it's tricky to write a
 

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.930
that i know it's tricky to write a
third-party library but it's very very

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:29.940
third-party library but it's very very
 

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.670
third-party library but it's very very
important to test all those

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680
important to test all those
 

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.620
important to test all those
functionalities and now let's let's be

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:33.630
functionalities and now let's let's be
 

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:35.600
functionalities and now let's let's be
really clear about one thing we really

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:35.610
really clear about one thing we really
 

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.730
really clear about one thing we really
enjoy third-party library we think that

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740
enjoy third-party library we think that
 

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.730
enjoy third-party library we think that
it's very important they have a vibrant

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:40.740
it's very important they have a vibrant
 

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:46.010
it's very important they have a vibrant
ecosystem system of social gaming I you

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:46.020
ecosystem system of social gaming I you
 

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.110
ecosystem system of social gaming I you
know it's great to see games forming

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:48.120
know it's great to see games forming
 

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.880
know it's great to see games forming
networks it's great to see people

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:49.890
networks it's great to see people
 

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:52.490
networks it's great to see people
playing with each other it's just a

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500
playing with each other it's just a
 

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.140
playing with each other it's just a
matter of making sure that these things

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:54.150
matter of making sure that these things
 

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.300
matter of making sure that these things
actually work on the Android platform in

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:56.310
actually work on the Android platform in
 

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.490
actually work on the Android platform in
the way that users are going to expect

00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500
the way that users are going to expect
 

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.820
the way that users are going to expect
and want and if the game doesn't work

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:01.830
and want and if the game doesn't work
 

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:04.970
and want and if the game doesn't work
well or if it pops up things at

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:04.980
well or if it pops up things at
 

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.190
well or if it pops up things at
inappropriate times maybe your game

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200
inappropriate times maybe your game
 

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.800
inappropriate times maybe your game
wakes up at some random time and covers

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:09.810
wakes up at some random time and covers
 

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:12.200
wakes up at some random time and covers
up your phone call or cover up your your

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:12.210
up your phone call or cover up your your

web browser your email these are all
things that make users upset it's it's

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:17.430
things that make users upset it's it's
 

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:19.460
things that make users upset it's it's
not it's not about us and what we think

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:19.470
not it's not about us and what we think
 

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.440
not it's not about us and what we think
it's that the users are not going to

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:21.450
it's that the users are not going to
 

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:25.130
it's that the users are not going to
like it and that's a problem with a lot

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140
like it and that's a problem with a lot
 

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.410
like it and that's a problem with a lot
of middleware as Dan said it's very very

of middleware as Dan said it's very very
 

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.820
of middleware as Dan said it's very very
difficult and you would know right i

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:28.830
difficult and you would know right i

difficult and you would know right i
mean you wrote a library that is now

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:31.830
mean you wrote a library that is now

have that done in a week and I had told
some people haven't done in a week and

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:42.170
some people haven't done in a week and
 

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:43.479
some people haven't done in a week and
then they came back and they wanted to

00:47:43.479 --> 00:47:43.489
then they came back and they wanted to
 

00:47:43.489 --> 00:47:45.609
then they came back and they wanted to
lynch me and I'm like Dan still working

00:47:45.609 --> 00:47:45.619
lynch me and I'm like Dan still working
 

00:47:45.619 --> 00:47:47.739
lynch me and I'm like Dan still working
on it but the truth is it was just

00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:47.749
on it but the truth is it was just
 

00:47:47.749 --> 00:47:49.390

you know I have a under version 2 using
 

00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:14.620
you know I have a under version 2 using
closed source libraries as much as

closed source libraries as much as
 

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.999
closed source libraries as much as
possible just because I feel like I'm

possible just because I feel like I'm
 

00:48:16.009 --> 00:48:17.650
possible just because I feel like I'm
stuck you know I like I'm trap and I

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:17.660
stuck you know I like I'm trap and I
 

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.870
stuck you know I like I'm trap and I
can't fix things and I feel like you're

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:19.880
can't fix things and I feel like you're
 

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.089
can't fix things and I feel like you're
a Windows developer at that point yes

00:48:22.089 --> 00:48:22.099
a Windows developer at that point yes
 

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:23.859
a Windows developer at that point yes
that's exactly what it would say that's

00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:23.869
that's exactly what it would say that's
 

00:48:23.869 --> 00:48:25.599
that's exactly what it would say that's
what is worried about working on windows

00:48:25.599 --> 00:48:25.609
what is worried about working on windows
 

00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:28.390
what is worried about working on windows
like it just wasn't my fault man that's

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400
like it just wasn't my fault man that's
 

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.519

on inch right than I did when I had it's
 

00:48:34.339 --> 00:48:36.219
on inch right than I did when I had it's
true that I can always go fix the source

00:48:36.219 --> 00:48:36.229
true that I can always go fix the source
 

00:48:36.229 --> 00:48:39.609
true that I can always go fix the source
man yeah exactly so in any case uh so

00:48:39.609 --> 00:48:39.619
man yeah exactly so in any case uh so

yeah that's just one thing to note about
 

00:48:40.759 --> 00:48:43.509
yeah that's just one thing to note about
this game but you know it's a cute

this game but you know it's a cute
 

00:48:43.519 --> 00:48:44.769
this game but you know it's a cute
concept I would love to see higher

00:48:44.769 --> 00:48:44.779
concept I would love to see higher
 

00:48:44.779 --> 00:48:46.089

honestly if you're coming out over a
year after angry bird shipped you should

00:48:52.569 --> 00:48:52.579
year after angry bird shipped you should
 

00:48:52.579 --> 00:48:54.249
year after angry bird shipped you should
use that as your bar you know that's you

00:48:54.249 --> 00:48:54.259
use that as your bar you know that's you
 

00:48:54.259 --> 00:48:55.029
use that as your bar you know that's you
know when you're when you're putting

know when you're when you're putting
 

00:48:55.039 --> 00:48:56.949
know when you're when you're putting
together any kind of physics puzzler you

00:48:56.949 --> 00:48:56.959
together any kind of physics puzzler you
 

00:48:56.959 --> 00:48:58.029
together any kind of physics puzzler you
know say look it's got to look at least

00:48:58.029 --> 00:48:58.039
know say look it's got to look at least
 

00:48:58.039 --> 00:48:59.439
know say look it's got to look at least
as good as angry birds it's got to have

00:48:59.439 --> 00:48:59.449
as good as angry birds it's got to have
 

00:48:59.449 --> 00:49:01.029
as good as angry birds it's got to have
at least as high resolution graphics as

00:49:01.029 --> 00:49:01.039
at least as high resolution graphics as
 

00:49:01.039 --> 00:49:07.199
at least as high resolution graphics as
something like zeptolab amazing game of

00:49:07.199 --> 00:49:07.209
something like zeptolab amazing game of

Rope cut the rope thank you you know

00:49:11.289 --> 00:49:11.299
Rope cut the rope thank you you know
 

00:49:11.299 --> 00:49:12.549
Rope cut the rope thank you you know
like you know those are that's kind of

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559
like you know those are that's kind of
 

00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:14.469
like you know those are that's kind of
that's kind of the bar now and I'm going

00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:14.479
that's kind of the bar now and I'm going
 

00:49:14.479 --> 00:49:15.729
that's kind of the bar now and I'm going
to me if you're trying to if you want to

compete in the big leagues those are the
 

00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:19.239
compete in the big leagues those are the
games to shoot at least in terms of

00:49:19.239 --> 00:49:19.249
games to shoot at least in terms of
 

00:49:19.249 --> 00:49:21.910
games to shoot at least in terms of
graphical fidelity against and I feel

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920
graphical fidelity against and I feel
 

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.709
graphical fidelity against and I feel
like these people did a pretty good job

00:49:23.709 --> 00:49:23.719
like these people did a pretty good job
 

00:49:23.719 --> 00:49:25.779
like these people did a pretty good job
i mean there's the RCB definitely

00:49:25.779 --> 00:49:25.789
i mean there's the RCB definitely
 

00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:27.309
i mean there's the RCB definitely
there's a few points where I'm like wow

00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319
there's a few points where I'm like wow
 

00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:28.989
there's a few points where I'm like wow
that's a really stellar animation or

00:49:28.989 --> 00:49:28.999
that's a really stellar animation or
 

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.729
that's a really stellar animation or
that's really stellar artwork but in

00:49:30.729 --> 00:49:30.739
that's really stellar artwork but in
 

00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:32.589
that's really stellar artwork but in
general you know especially I think part

00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599
general you know especially I think part
 

00:49:32.599 --> 00:49:34.239
general you know especially I think part
of it was the pentagonal sheep that does

00:49:34.239 --> 00:49:34.249
of it was the pentagonal sheep that does
 

00:49:34.249 --> 00:49:36.130
of it was the pentagonal sheep that does
nothing I don't think he even blinks

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:36.140
nothing I don't think he even blinks
 

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.929
nothing I don't think he even blinks
yeah and i think i think you know part

00:49:37.929 --> 00:49:37.939
yeah and i think i think you know part
 

00:49:37.939 --> 00:49:39.699
yeah and i think i think you know part
of part of that is like i should get the

00:49:39.699 --> 00:49:39.709
of part of that is like i should get the
 

00:49:39.709 --> 00:49:41.559
of part of that is like i should get the
feeling that he's afraid you know

00:49:41.559 --> 00:49:41.569
feeling that he's afraid you know
 

00:49:41.569 --> 00:49:43.299
feeling that he's afraid you know
obviously he's a pentagonal sheep you

00:49:43.299 --> 00:49:43.309
obviously he's a pentagonal sheep you
 

00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:44.620
obviously he's a pentagonal sheep you
know they should have some character and

00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:44.630
know they should have some character and
 

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:46.540
know they should have some character and
also though just just like the

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:46.550
also though just just like the
 

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.970
also though just just like the
text is really low resolution you know a

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:48.980
text is really low resolution you know a
 

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.590
text is really low resolution you know a
lot of the graphics are really low

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:50.600
lot of the graphics are really low
 

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.330
lot of the graphics are really low
resolution you know it's like this looks

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:52.340
resolution you know it's like this looks
 

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.770
resolution you know it's like this looks
like it was designed for a phone of two

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:53.780
like it was designed for a phone of two
 

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.960
like it was designed for a phone of two
years ago and yeah honestly we're no

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:55.970
years ago and yeah honestly we're no
 

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.030
years ago and yeah honestly we're no
longer there that is a really big

00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040
longer there that is a really big
 

00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.830
longer there that is a really big
problem in all the devices this year

00:49:59.830 --> 00:49:59.840
problem in all the devices this year
 

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.720

asus announced a 1080p tablet you know

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:05.150
asus announced a 1080p tablet you know
 

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:07.510

it's just gonna get worse yeah that in

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520
it's just gonna get worse yeah that in
 

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.280
it's just gonna get worse yeah that in
that sense and I mean I mean the thing

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:09.290
that sense and I mean I mean the thing
 

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.750
that sense and I mean I mean the thing
is is it you know this game really has H

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760
is is it you know this game really has H
 

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.700
is is it you know this game really has H
vga graphics this is not even designed

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:12.710
vga graphics this is not even designed
 

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:14.830
vga graphics this is not even designed
for apples but this is sign for the

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:14.840
for apples but this is sign for the
 

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.690
for apples but this is sign for the
phone what's really tough about it too

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:16.700
phone what's really tough about it too
 

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.120
phone what's really tough about it too
is that I believe these graphics were

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:19.130
is that I believe these graphics were
 

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:21.640
is that I believe these graphics were
originally sourced as vectors yeah if

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:21.650
originally sourced as vectors yeah if
 

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:23.170
originally sourced as vectors yeah if
you look at Italy's look like they were

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:23.180
you look at Italy's look like they were
 

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.730
you look at Italy's look like they were
come they came out of illustrator or a

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:24.740
come they came out of illustrator or a
 

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.350
come they came out of illustrator or a
similar vector program a lot of them do

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:26.360
similar vector program a lot of them do
 

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.600
similar vector program a lot of them do
at least um yeah and and that's where

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:28.610
at least um yeah and and that's where
 

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:31.930
at least um yeah and and that's where
you want to probably actually keep the

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:31.940
you want to probably actually keep the
 

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.940
you want to probably actually keep the
vector artwork and bring it so you know

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:33.950
vector artwork and bring it so you know
 

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.470
vector artwork and bring it so you know
for instance bouncy mouse did this and I

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480
for instance bouncy mouse did this and I
 

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.540
for instance bouncy mouse did this and I
think baguette did it to where you you

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:37.550
think baguette did it to where you you
 

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:40.960
think baguette did it to where you you
actually keep the artwork in illustrator

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:40.970
actually keep the artwork in illustrator
 

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.060
actually keep the artwork in illustrator
or an SVG or one of these other vector

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:43.070
or an SVG or one of these other vector
 

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:46.060
or an SVG or one of these other vector
format and then render it out for the

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:46.070
format and then render it out for the
 

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:47.950
format and then render it out for the
appropriate display size when you bring

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960
appropriate display size when you bring
 

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.810
appropriate display size when you bring
in it or even use the Android vector

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:49.820
in it or even use the Android vector
 

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.150
in it or even use the Android vector
engine if that works for you yeah I what

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160
engine if that works for you yeah I what
 

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.590
engine if that works for you yeah I what
I mean I definitely this would be a good

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:53.600
I mean I definitely this would be a good
 

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.170
I mean I definitely this would be a good
target for doing something in OpenGL you

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:56.180
target for doing something in OpenGL you
 

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.250
target for doing something in OpenGL you
know you could certainly do that the

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:57.260
know you could certainly do that the
 

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.390
know you could certainly do that the
problem with OpenGL is that you're going

00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400
problem with OpenGL is that you're going
 

00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.710
problem with OpenGL is that you're going
to want to take advantage of

00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720
to want to take advantage of
 

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.420
to want to take advantage of
anti-aliasing so you want your if you

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:01.430
anti-aliasing so you want your if you
 

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.190
anti-aliasing so you want your if you
use up opengl to render you're going to

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200
use up opengl to render you're going to
 

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.020
use up opengl to render you're going to
want to render to a surface and then and

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.030
want to render to a surface and then and
 

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.610
want to render to a surface and then and
then rescale it so it's not a perfect

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:06.620
then rescale it so it's not a perfect
 

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:10.210
then rescale it so it's not a perfect
solution for opengl but definitely you

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:10.220
solution for opengl but definitely you
 

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.380
solution for opengl but definitely you
know and there's even little things like

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:11.390
know and there's even little things like
 

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:12.520
know and there's even little things like
i love the fact that he's actually

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:12.530
i love the fact that he's actually
 

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:14.860
i love the fact that he's actually

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:15.910
balancing on this on this tower here but
I'd kind of love to be able to kind of

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920
I'd kind of love to be able to kind of
 

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.230
I'd kind of love to be able to kind of
mess with him like and I definitely

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240
mess with him like and I definitely
 

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.150
mess with him like and I definitely

yeah both words but I think I think that
really if this actually sweated money

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:25.460
really if this actually sweated money
 

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.950
really if this actually sweated money
every now and then but i but i think

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960
every now and then but i but i think
 

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.960
every now and then but i but i think

that in terms of like the level when we
 

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.490
that in terms of like the level when we
get to these puzzlers the level that

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:30.500
get to these puzzlers the level that
 

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.980
