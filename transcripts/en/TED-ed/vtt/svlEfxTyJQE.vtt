00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.820
Sharks have been celebrated
as powerful gods

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.619
by some native cultures.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:17.049
For example, Fijians believe
the shark god Dakuwaqa,

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:19.879
could protect fisherman
from the dangers at sea.

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:24.249
And today, sharks are recognized
as apex predators of the world's ocean

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.489
and include some of the Earth's
longest living vertebrates.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.659
What is it that makes these fish
worthy of our ancient legends

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.162
and so successful in the seas?

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:36.730
Much of their hunting prowess stems
from a unique set of biological traits

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.070
honed for more than 400 million years.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.421
Their cartilaginous skeletons
are less dense than bony ones

00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.030
and require less energy to move.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.121
Large oily livers lend buoyancy
to their streamlined bodies,

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:56.061
and while trunk muscles of bony fishes
attach directly to their skeletons,

00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:58.830
those of sharks also join to their skin.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.101
This special design transforms them
into pressurized tubes

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:07.320
whose springy skin can efficiently
transmit muscular forces to the tail.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.392
Shark skin has additional 
remarkable features.

00:01:10.392 --> 00:01:12.460
Despite its smooth external appearance,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.661
at the micro level, 
it has a coarse texture

00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:18.291
thanks to thousands 
of tiny teeth-like scales

00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:20.370
called dermal denticles.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.021
Each denticle is coated in a substance
called enameloid,

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.524
which turns the skin into a tough shield.

00:01:26.524 --> 00:01:29.472
Plus the structure of denticles varies
across the body

00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:32.251
in such a way as to reduce noise
and drag

00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.421
when the shark moves through water.

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:36.031
As for the teeth in their mouths,

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:39.672
sharks can produce up to 50,000
in a lifetime.

00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:42.351
On average, they can lose 
one tooth a week,

00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:43.822
and each time that happens,

00:01:43.822 --> 00:01:45.531
it's rapidly replaced.

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:47.941
Thanks to a layer of fluoride 
coating their teeth,

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.101
sharks also avoid cavities.

00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:52.442
But teeth aren't the same in all sharks.

00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:55.302
They can vary across species and by diet.

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:56.842
Some are dense and flattened,

00:01:56.842 --> 00:01:59.182
useful for crushing mollusks.

00:01:59.182 --> 00:02:02.082
Others are needle-like
for gripping fish.

00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:06.552
The mouths of Great Whites contain
pointy lower teeth for holding prey

00:02:06.552 --> 00:02:10.212
and triangular serrated upper teeth
for slicing.

00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:16.442
This variety enables sharks to target
prey in a diversity of ocean environments.

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:19.586
Many species also 
have another peculiar trait -

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:22.302
the ability to launch their jaws
out of their mouths,

00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:23.842
open them extra wide,

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.072
and grab prey by surprise.

00:02:26.072 --> 00:02:27.552
Over the course of evolution,

00:02:27.552 --> 00:02:29.402
shark brains have expanded,

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:32.162
coupled with the growth 
of their sensory organs.

00:02:32.162 --> 00:02:34.743
Modern-day sharks can smell
a few drops of blood

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:39.052
and hear sounds underwater
from 800 meters away.

00:02:39.052 --> 00:02:41.663
They're particularly well-tuned
to low frequencies,

00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:44.203
including those emitted by dying fish.

00:02:44.203 --> 00:02:48.553
And like cats, they have reflective
membranes called tapeta lucida

00:02:48.553 --> 00:02:49.973
at the backs of their eyes

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:52.873
that dramatically improve 
their vision in low light.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.174
As if these heightened abilities
weren't enough,

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.864
sharks have even honed a sixth sense.

00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:01.303
They're able to hunt using a network
of electrosensory cells

00:03:01.303 --> 00:03:04.184
called ampullae of Lorenzini.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.528
These cells are filled 
with hypersensitive jelly

00:03:06.528 --> 00:03:09.773
which allows them to detect electrical
signals from prey,

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:12.173
including the slightest twitch
of a muscle.

00:03:12.173 --> 00:03:14.164
Some of the most iconic shark species,

00:03:14.164 --> 00:03:19.076
like Great Whites, Makos, 
Porbeagles, and Salmon Sharks

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:21.873
owe their success 
to another surprising trait:

00:03:21.873 --> 00:03:25.164
warm blood inside 
a cold-blooded creature.

00:03:25.164 --> 00:03:26.300
Inside their bodies,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.224
they have bundles of arteries
and veins

00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:30.557
called rete mirabile.

00:03:30.557 --> 00:03:33.516
Here, venous blood warmed up
by the shark's working muscles

00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:38.116
passes right next to arteries carrying
cold, oxygen-rich blood from the gills.

00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:40.536
This arrangement transfers heat 
to the blood

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:43.465
that gets cycled back to the body's
vital organs.

00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:46.065
Warmer muscles enable faster,
more powerful swimming,

00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:48.316
while warmer bellies aid digestion,

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:51.654
and the more rapid development
of young in utero.

00:03:51.654 --> 00:03:55.705
And warmer eyes and brains
keep the sharks alert in cold waters.

00:03:55.705 --> 00:04:00.274
With these amazing adaptations,
there's more to revere than fear

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:03.487
from the 500 shark species
roaming our oceans.

00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:06.554
Unfortunately, one-third of these
species are threatened

00:04:06.554 --> 00:04:08.454
due to overfishing.

00:04:08.454 --> 00:04:10.336
After millions of years in the making,

00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:13.686
these apex predators may be meeting
their greatest challenge yet.
