trying to put together a research group

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
trying to put together a research group
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.580
trying to put together a research group
to work on economics and he would like

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
to work on economics and he would like
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.839
to work on economics and he would like
me to be involved I said I don't know

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
me to be involved I said I don't know
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240
me to be involved I said I don't know
anything about economics he said that's

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
anything about economics he said that's
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.160
anything about economics he said that's
ok because nobody does and the whole

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170

being very struck by this because this

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
being very struck by this because this
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.450
being very struck by this because this
is before anybody was talking about this

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
is before anybody was talking about this
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.900
is before anybody was talking about this
and so I start to meet with a group of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
and so I start to meet with a group of
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.139
and so I start to meet with a group of
people that he was pulling together to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
people that he was pulling together to
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.510
people that he was pulling together to
understand what was going to happen and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
understand what was going to happen and
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.950
understand what was going to happen and
to understand if there was any way to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
to understand if there was any way to
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930
to understand if there was any way to
save the situation it was a very

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
save the situation it was a very
 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.549
save the situation it was a very
ambitious thing and of course we failed

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
ambitious thing and of course we failed
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069
ambitious thing and of course we failed
but along the way I was motivated as a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
but along the way I was motivated as a
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.229
but along the way I was motivated as a
kind of public service to get interested

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
kind of public service to get interested
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.700
kind of public service to get interested
in economics and what I found economics

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
in economics and what I found economics
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.620
in economics and what I found economics
in a way is very easy for physicists to

in a way is very easy for physicists to
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.149
in a way is very easy for physicists to
understand because it's very

mathematical and the mathematical models

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
mathematical and the mathematical models
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.249
mathematical and the mathematical models
if they use are very clean they're based

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
if they use are very clean they're based
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.100
if they use are very clean they're based
on assumptions hypotheses and you can

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
on assumptions hypotheses and you can
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.920
on assumptions hypotheses and you can
study them and then as I studied it I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
study them and then as I studied it I
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.010
study them and then as I studied it I
began to understand some for myself and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
began to understand some for myself and
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570
began to understand some for myself and
more from just reading around because

standard model of economics is called
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.870
standard model of economics is called
the neoclassical model and it assumes

the neoclassical model and it assumes

the physical sense but in special
economic sense in which you reach a

economic sense in which you reach a
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.209
economic sense in which you reach a
point at which the prices are fixed such

point at which the prices are fixed such
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.490
point at which the prices are fixed such
that market forces fix the prices such

that market forces fix the prices such
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.249
that market forces fix the prices such
that you maximize the happiness of the

that you maximize the happiness of the

that you maximize the happiness of the
consumers and maximize the profits of

made from this model is that markets

made from this model is that markets
don't need regulation because they have
