in criminal activity on the Internet and
 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.010
in criminal activity on the Internet and
that central challenge is how can you do

about computers write about the people
 

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.930
about computers write about the people
behind the computers so that's why I

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:02.940
behind the computers so that's why I
 

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.200
behind the computers so that's why I
tracked down the hackers the cops and

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:06.210
tracked down the hackers the cops and
 

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.200

that is usually the same is the fact

all sorts of ways so that's how you try
 

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.680
all sorts of ways so that's how you try
and start to make computers interesting

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:30.690
and start to make computers interesting
 

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:31.970

don't know just how dependent we are on

don't know just how dependent we are on
 

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.830
don't know just how dependent we are on
network systems now and how easily if a

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:06.840
network systems now and how easily if a
 

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.490

network system goes down then the supply

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500

very quickly the supply of water and so

very quickly the supply of water and so
on and so forth we are hugely dependent

the last time anyone remembered a
telephone number for example now you

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:28.950
telephone number for example now you
 

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:32.150
telephone number for example now you
lose your mobile phone and you can't

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160
lose your mobile phone and you can't
 

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.950
lose your mobile phone and you can't
remember anyone's numbers to ring up

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960
remember anyone's numbers to ring up
 

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.230

group of the internet is a very
 

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:28.200
group of the internet is a very
interesting phenomenon but one with a

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:28.210

real again with an Achilles heel if
you're attacked by anonymous do you know

00:46:33.059 --> 00:46:33.069
you're attacked by anonymous do you know
 

00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:34.589
you're attacked by anonymous do you know
that you're being attacked by anonymous

00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:34.599
that you're being attacked by anonymous
 

00:46:34.599 --> 00:46:38.730
that you're being attacked by anonymous
or are you being attacked by I don't

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:38.740
or are you being attacked by I don't
 

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.789
or are you being attacked by I don't
know if French intelligence or are you

00:46:41.789 --> 00:46:41.799
know if French intelligence or are you
 

00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:45.450
know if French intelligence or are you
being attacked by a criminal group and

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:45.460
being attacked by a criminal group and
 

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.030
being attacked by a criminal group and
so what I'm saying is is that this

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040
so what I'm saying is is that this
 

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.099
so what I'm saying is is that this
technology as opposed to technology in

00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:50.109
technology as opposed to technology in
 

00:46:50.109 --> 00:46:53.460
technology as opposed to technology in
the past is both immensely powerful but

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:53.470
the past is both immensely powerful but
 

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.980
the past is both immensely powerful but
it's also accessed by everyone on a

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:55.990
it's also accessed by everyone on a
 

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:59.370
it's also accessed by everyone on a
daily basis in much of their lives and

00:46:59.370 --> 00:46:59.380
daily basis in much of their lives and
 

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.000
daily basis in much of their lives and
that means that in terms of the problems

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.010
that means that in terms of the problems
 

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:06.000
that means that in terms of the problems
that it causes obviously the convenience

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:06.010
that it causes obviously the convenience
 

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:08.180
that it causes obviously the convenience
and the fantastic things that it does

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:08.190
and the fantastic things that it does
 

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.859
and the fantastic things that it does
goes without saying but the problems it

00:47:10.859 --> 00:47:10.869
goes without saying but the problems it
 

00:47:10.869 --> 00:47:12.900
goes without saying but the problems it
causes are actually of a different

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:12.910
causes are actually of a different
 

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:15.150
causes are actually of a different
nature than the problems caused by

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:15.160
nature than the problems caused by
 

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:22.079
nature than the problems caused by
telephones or by the book and so I I

00:47:22.079 --> 00:47:22.089
telephones or by the book and so I I
 

00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:24.299
telephones or by the book and so I I
mean what I say to people is is that

00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:24.309
mean what I say to people is is that
 

00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:26.660
mean what I say to people is is that

see states with abandoned now developing

surveillance and control techniques

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:40.210
surveillance and control techniques
 

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:43.589
surveillance and control techniques
which it is very easy for them to deploy

00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599
which it is very easy for them to deploy
 

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:47.099
which it is very easy for them to deploy
without without proper oversight from

without without proper oversight from
 

00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:52.109
without without proper oversight from
from the criminal justice system and so

00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119
from the criminal justice system and so
 

00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:54.720
from the criminal justice system and so
be wound is all I say but enjoy the
