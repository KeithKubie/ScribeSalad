00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.639
I think people have the misconception

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:04.649
I think people have the misconception
 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.879
I think people have the misconception
that the Big Bang is universe starting

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889
that the Big Bang is universe starting
 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.060
that the Big Bang is universe starting
from a point in fact it's very different

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070
from a point in fact it's very different
 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.560
from a point in fact it's very different
from that it probably you know that you

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570
from that it probably you know that you
 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.109
from that it probably you know that you
the universe is expanding but so if we

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119
the universe is expanding but so if we
 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.490
the universe is expanding but so if we
go backwards in time then you can watch

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500
go backwards in time then you can watch
 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.019
go backwards in time then you can watch
the universe contract as you go

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029
the universe contract as you go
 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.840
the universe contract as you go
backwards in time so for example if you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850
backwards in time so for example if you
 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.750
backwards in time so for example if you
took a tabletop then any two points

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760
took a tabletop then any two points
 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.869
took a tabletop then any two points
would be get closer together but the

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879
would be get closer together but the
 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.620
would be get closer together but the
points that are way far apart if you had

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630
points that are way far apart if you had
 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.540
points that are way far apart if you had
let's say it's an infinite tabletop so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550
let's say it's an infinite tabletop so
 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.010
let's say it's an infinite tabletop so
as these points get closer and closer

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020
as these points get closer and closer
 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.979
as these points get closer and closer
together you still have a tabletop

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989
together you still have a tabletop
 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.110
together you still have a tabletop
that's infinite in extent it's not like

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120
that's infinite in extent it's not like
 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.069
that's infinite in extent it's not like
everything comes into one point but

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
everything comes into one point but
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.029
everything comes into one point but
eventually you reach such a high density

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039
eventually you reach such a high density
 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.060
eventually you reach such a high density
things are so compact and sand right on

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070
things are so compact and sand right on
 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.350
things are so compact and sand right on
top of each other that we lose our

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
top of each other that we lose our
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.689
top of each other that we lose our
description physics fails that's what

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699
description physics fails that's what
 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.290
description physics fails that's what
the Big Bang is so it's actually we

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300
the Big Bang is so it's actually we
 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.310
the Big Bang is so it's actually we
would need to have a theory of quantum

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320
would need to have a theory of quantum
 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.350
would need to have a theory of quantum
mechanics and gravity simultaneously to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360
mechanics and gravity simultaneously to
 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.940
mechanics and gravity simultaneously to
be able to discuss physics going

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950
be able to discuss physics going
 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.670
be able to discuss physics going
backwards in time any further so it's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680
backwards in time any further so it's
 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.179
backwards in time any further so it's
really a high density situation that we

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189
really a high density situation that we
 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.620
really a high density situation that we
call a Big Bang but there's really no

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630
call a Big Bang but there's really no
 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.060
call a Big Bang but there's really no
explosion there's no bang there's no

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070
explosion there's no bang there's no
 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.700
explosion there's no bang there's no
single singular point but so yes it does

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710
single singular point but so yes it does
 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.740
single singular point but so yes it does
make sense to ask well what happens when

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750
make sense to ask well what happens when
 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.480
make sense to ask well what happens when
you reach that density and that's what

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490
you reach that density and that's what
 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.219
you reach that density and that's what
people are trying to do in in theories

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229
people are trying to do in in theories
 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.440
people are trying to do in in theories
of quantum gravity such as string theory

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450
of quantum gravity such as string theory
 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.770
of quantum gravity such as string theory

done also is in the context of of brains

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799
done also is in the context of of brains
 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.330
done also is in the context of of brains
where our observable universe is living

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340
where our observable universe is living
 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.399
where our observable universe is living
on a three-dimensional surface in a

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409
on a three-dimensional surface in a
 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.289
on a three-dimensional surface in a
higher dimensional universe and there

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299
higher dimensional universe and there
 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.889
higher dimensional universe and there
could be other brains out there and how

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899
could be other brains out there and how
 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.569
could be other brains out there and how
these brains intersect one another and

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579
these brains intersect one another and
 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.609
these brains intersect one another and
they're their emotions and so on has

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619
they're their emotions and so on has
 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.039
they're their emotions and so on has
been has been so there are different

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049
been has been so there are different
 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.649
been has been so there are different
avenues to try to push it push back our

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659
avenues to try to push it push back our
 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.060
avenues to try to push it push back our
level of knowledge and they're very

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070
level of knowledge and they're very
 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.940
level of knowledge and they're very
active but very difficult everything was

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950
active but very difficult everything was
 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.709
active but very difficult everything was
more dense and then there's a certain

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719
more dense and then there's a certain
 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.310
more dense and then there's a certain
point where which we which we call the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320
point where which we which we call the
 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.050
point where which we which we call the
Big Bang and it's from that point

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060
Big Bang and it's from that point
 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.139
Big Bang and it's from that point
forward that we we start our clocks so

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149
forward that we we start our clocks so
 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.600
forward that we we start our clocks so
that's and then so when we say the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610
that's and then so when we say the
 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.059
that's and then so when we say the
universe is 13.7 billion years old is

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069
universe is 13.7 billion years old is
 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.290
universe is 13.7 billion years old is
relative to that

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300
relative to that
 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.770
relative to that
very high density situation
