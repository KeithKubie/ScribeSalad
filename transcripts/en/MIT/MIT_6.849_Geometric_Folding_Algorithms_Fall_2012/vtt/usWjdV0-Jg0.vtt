00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.370
PROFESSOR: Today we begin the
third major part of the class.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.130
We've done paper
folding, linkage folding,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.380
and now we're going to
do polyhedron folding.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.220
The very last topic we
did was hinged dissection,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.184
which is somewhere in the
middle of all these things.

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:32.600
But with polyhedron
folding, we're

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.650
thinking about a two
dimensional surface

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.760
in 3D, something like
a cube, and we're

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:51.290
interested in cutting along
the edges of that shape

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.470
or somehow cutting along
the surface-- that's

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:03.490
a good cutting-- and then
unfolding into some flat shape.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.920
So this is a standard cross
unfolding of the cube.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.310
This is the unfolding process,
and of course the reverse

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.090
is the folding process, and
both of them are interesting.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.350
We're going to start
thinking about unfolding.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.190
That's one of the most
practical problems here.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.860
You really want to build some
3D shape out of sheet material.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.930
What shape do you
cut out in order

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.301
to bend it into that surface?

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.550
So you start with the surface.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.110
You need to figure out where
to cut so that when you unfold,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.287
you get something
that has no overlap.

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:49.870
If you want to make
it from one sheet,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.410
it shouldn't have any overlap,
and ideally just one piece

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.970
because then you have to do
less welding or edge joining

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.230
to make that surface.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.996
So today and the
next couple lectures

00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:05.120
will be all about unfolding,
and then eventually we

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.380
will turn to the reverse
problem, folding problem.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.440
And there are two
kinds of unfolding.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.480
The one that I just
drew is an edge

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.010
unfolding because it
only cuts along edges.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:33.970
Edge unfolding only cut
along edges of the surface.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.010
This property is nice.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.080
If you're building
something, you

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.090
don't want to have
visible seems.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.850
You have to be
bent at the edges,

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.070
so it's not such a big
deal if you're also

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.967
fusing along an edge.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.050
But in general, you could
imagine cutting anywhere

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.340
on the surface, and
this is an example

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.060
where the solid red
lines are cutting

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.000
on what you see and the
dotted red lines were

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.510
cutting on the backside.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.150
And when you unfold that thing,
you get this stoplight polygon,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.620
and this is what we call a
general unfolding, or just

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.290
unfolding.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.010
There you can cut anywhere.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.810
In both cases, we want
one piece, no overlap,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.740
but you can change where
you're allowed to cut.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.120
So those are the
rules of the game,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.580
or two possible
rules of the game.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.350
And let me tell you what's
known about these kinds

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.930
of unfoldings.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.060
I've mentioned it way
back in lecture one.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:28.370
so we can think
about edge unfolding,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.911
we can think about
general unfolding,

00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:32.340
and we can think about
them for convex polyhedra--

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.580
simple things like the
cube have no dents--

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.350
or general polyhedra,
non-convex polyhedra.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.760
And status is these
two corners are open.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.655
This one is solved.

00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:53.960
It can always be done.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.300
You can always generally
unfold a convex polyhedron,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.080
but we don't know about
general polyhedra.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.810
Edge unfolding of
convex polyhedra,

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.319
we don't know whether
it's possible,

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.860
but for non-convex
polyhedra, we know

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.444
that's too much to hope for.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.390
Not always possible.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.400
Both of these questions
could go either way,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.320
but we know in various
generalizations, easy case

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.450
of convex polyhedra general
unfolding, we can do it.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.260
The most restrictive,
hardest situation

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.470
is edge unfolding
non-convex polyhedra.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.680
That's too much.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.981
But each of these
things, we don't know.

00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:35.980
And these are some of the
biggest open questions

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.330
remaining in geometric folding
algorithms, this field.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.470
I'm going to talk mostly
about these three things

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.580
today, so this open problem
and these two results.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.920
And then this topic will
essentially be next lecture.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.165
Obviously it's not solved, but
we still have a lot to say.

00:06:00.165 --> 00:06:01.540
There are various
partial results

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.640
toward solving both
of those problems,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.590
I would say more on this one.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.780
This one is five centuries old.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.758
This one is one
decade old or so.

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:28.050
So I need to set the stage
a little bit before I

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.400
can talk about any
of these things,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.680
so let me start with a
little bit of terminology.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.060
We've in some sense talked
about curvature before.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.810
I don't think I gave
it this name, though,

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.893
in the context of origami.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.990
And I use it almost
subconsciously

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.560
so it's good for
me to define it.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.740
If you have some vertex
on your polyhedron.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.070
Let's say we're looking
at a corner of a cube,

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.660
so this has three 90 degree
angles coming together.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.200
You sum those
angles, we get 270,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.110
and then you take
360 minus that sum,

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.875
and that is your curvature.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:26.180
This is going to be 90.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.550
And what I really care about
is whether the curvature

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.590
is positive, 0, or negative.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.250
Positive curvature, which
is what we got here--

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.720
this is plus 90-- is
like a convex cone.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.360
So if you're thinking about
convex polyhedra, which

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.370
is one of the situations
we care about,

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:02.180
you'll always get positive or
0, maybe, curvature vertices,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.120
depending on what
you're thinking about.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.250
Zero, this is like
a piece of paper,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.680
so this is what you might call
flat, but it's locally flat.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.200
It could be drawn
flat or we know

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.790
how to fold pieces of paper.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.380
You never change the curvature.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.200
The sum of the
instant face angles

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.730
will always stay the same, no
matter how you fold this thing.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.813
Curvature is an invariant.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.020
If you just think locally and
forget about the actual folding

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.169
of the thing, it's kind of flat.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:34.360
So you can think of this
as a piece of paper.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.960
We talked about
these two situations

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.711
in the context of Kawasaki's
theorem way back when.

00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:40.169
Kawasaki's theorem
applied for both

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.530
of these for the negative
curvature case, which

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.220
is when you have lots
of material all joined

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.540
at a single point,
something like this.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.700
Then Kawasaki's theorem
changed a little bit.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.394
There were some other
cases that could happen.

00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:02.810
So when you have
tons of material,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.769
this can only happen in
a non-convex polyhedron.

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:06.810
That's sort of the point.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.395
If you're a convex
polyhedron, you

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:11.370
know you have to have
only these two situations.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.760
Where do you get flat vertices?

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.490
Well, if you think of
this point as a vertex

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.880
and you add up all the angles
around it, well, that's 360.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.220
360 minus 360 is 0.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.600
So you have zero curvature on
all the faces and on the edges.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.330
Also, if you look here,
you have 180 and other 180.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.540
That adds to 360.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.530
And then at the actual
vertices, that's

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.340
where you have positive
curvature for a convex

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.820
polyhedron.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.340
So just some terminology.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.840
Get used to the idea of positive
curvature, zero curvature,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.798
and negative curvature.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.680
Then we have the
idea of a cutting.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.400
So cutting is just,
what edges do you cut?

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.740
It's the red stuff
in this picture.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.860
What edges do you cut
in order to unfold?

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:02.730
So this is an unfolding, the
mapping here, but the red part,

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.769
I'll call it cutting.

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.435
Sometimes it's also
called an unfolding,

00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:06.893
but that can be a
little confusing.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.130
The main point here is I want
to talk about what constraints

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.150
cutting must satisfy in order
to be valid so we can just

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.880
get a sense of what
is happening here.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:34.930
If you look at these pictures,
you can see two properties.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.320
One is that the cuttings
visit all the vertices

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.890
of the polyhedron.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.610
So there's this red stuff.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.740
The red stuff is connected.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.350
It's acyclic, so it's actually
a tree in these pictures,

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.880
and it's visiting
all the corners.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.330
Even back here, it's
visited on the back.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.550
Is that always true?

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.660
Most of those properties
are mostly true,

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.150
but it depends a little bit.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.580
One thing that is
sure is the cutting

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:12.015
must span all non-zero
curvature vertices.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:22.060
But I do have to say
"non-zero curvature." "Spans"

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.060
just means visits.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.330
You have to hit all the
vertices of non-zero curvature

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.550
because anything of
non-zero curvature

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.360
can't be flattened by itself.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.250
It needs to be cut.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.640
At that point, the cutting has
to have degree at least one.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.090
With zero curvature
vertices, even if they're not

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.495
flat in three dimensions,
you could flatten them

00:11:47.495 --> 00:11:49.620
because we know locally,
it really is a flat thing.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.984
So there may not be any cuts
at zero curvature vertices.

00:11:51.984 --> 00:11:54.150
Most of the time, we won't
have to worry about them,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.700
but something to think about.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.440
Everybody else you have to span.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.020
You can say even more.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.680
If you have very
negative curvature,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.260
if the curvature of a vertex
is less than some integer,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:24.020
k times 360 with a minus
sign in front, then cutting

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:32.760
must have degree strictly
more than k plus 1.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.680
So if you have
negative curvature,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.264
you know you have to
have at least two cuts

00:12:39.264 --> 00:12:41.180
for a negative curvature
vertex because if you

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.270
had negative curvature--
one of these things--

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.380
you made a single cut.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.070
Then all that material
is still there.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.490
If you then flattened it,
it's going to overlap itself

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.365
because you're trying
to flatten it into 360.

00:12:51.365 --> 00:12:54.080
There's more than
360 material there.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.590
So negative curvature already,
you need two vertices.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.130
That's the plus 1 here.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:06.610
And as soon as you get to
smaller than negative 360,

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.360
then you have to have at least
three cuts and so on, just

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.925
to partition up into
at most 360 groups.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.920
This is useful.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.170
Negative curvature is basically
really tough to unfold

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.320
and we'll use that to make
counter examples here.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:22.890
What else?

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:48.165
your polyhedron has no handles,
then cutting has no cycles.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.400
A handle is something
of higher genus.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.116
If this is your polyhedron,
we call this a handle.

00:14:04.116 --> 00:14:05.490
You have sort of
a blob down here

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.730
and you have a connection
from one place to the other.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.600
If you have a
handle, you can have

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.780
a cycle of cuts like this
that does not disconnect

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.550
the surface, but we
basically never think

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.355
about that situation.

00:14:18.355 --> 00:14:20.480
Whenever we're thinking of
something of genus zero,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.739
like a convex polyhedron or a
regular, non-convex polyhedron,

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:27.780
you really shouldn't have
a cycle in your cutting

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.250
because if you
had a cycle, you'd

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.920
disconnect your
surface into two parts

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.400
normally, if you're like
a sphere or like a disk.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.910
That's the acyclic
condition and when it holds.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.060
Some other good things.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:08.560
If a polyhedron has no
boundary and no handles,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:25.280
and the unfolding has
no holes, then cutting

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.710
is a spanning tree.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.530
Spanning tree, it's a concept
we've used a few times.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.380
It's just a tree.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.600
In this case, it's got
to visit all the vertices

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.130
of non-zero curvature and
it's a tree, so it's connected

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.450
and it's acyclic.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.410
The main new thing here
is that it's connected.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.270
We've already said
that it should

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.370
be acyclic with no
handles, we've already

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.030
said that it should
span everybody,

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.330
so it's sort of a
summary theorem,

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.520
but we have a whole
bunch of conditions here.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:02.160
In particular, this will hold
if your polyhedron is convex.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.450
So for convex polyhedra,
you have a spanning tree,

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.782
and that's what's going
on in this picture even

00:16:12.782 --> 00:16:13.740
for general unfoldings.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.940
That's the interesting case.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.690
Here, it's maybe more
obvious, here it's

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.160
a little less obvious.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.550
And to sort of see what could go
wrong here, I have an example.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.210
This is a non-convex polyhedron.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.270
There's a whole
bunch of views of it

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.330
up here, and in
particular this top view.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.710
What we're doing is slicing
along just those two

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.182
edges and some other
stuff around the outside,

00:16:39.182 --> 00:16:40.890
but in particular, we
cut those two edges

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:46.060
and there aren't any
other cuts around there.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.610
A polyhedron is set up so
that when you open it up,

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.100
this works out.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.170
It's nice and flat.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.280
This is extremely rare.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.750
If you perturbed this
example, it wouldn't hold.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.280
But you can set things up
so that, in fact, what's

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.320
happening is that the total
curvature-- this vertex has

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.150
positive curvature, this has
negative, this has positive,

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.300
and the sum of those
three curvatures is zero,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.680
and that's what
allows this to be flat

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.550
because the total curvature
in that little region is zero,

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.750
and that's when things
are allowed to be flat.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.990
So you can cut here and make
a separate collection of cuts

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.880
on the outside, but
it's disconnected,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.780
so this is kind of weird.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:25.020
Most of the time, things
will be connected,

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.602
and as long as your
unfolding has no holes--

00:17:28.602 --> 00:17:30.060
and for an unfolding
to have holes,

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.643
you'd have to have
this weird property

00:17:31.643 --> 00:17:34.270
that a bunch of curvatures sum
to zero like in that picture--

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.910
as long as you don't
have that, you're OK.

00:17:42.434 --> 00:17:43.600
Let's get to these theorems.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:52.310
Actually, one thing
related to this problem,

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.420
general unfolding of
arbitrary polyhedra,

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.120
is you can't be too
general what you

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.500
mean by non-convex polyhedra.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.670
So we have this example.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.330
It's the simplest nasty
polyhedron there is this.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.705
It has one vertex at the
top there with a big dot

00:18:08.705 --> 00:18:10.660
that has negative curvature.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.990
There's more than 360
degrees of material

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.182
from all these triangles.

00:18:15.182 --> 00:18:16.640
And that's sort of
all that it has.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.930
This is the polyhedron.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.860
This is what we call
boundary of the polyhedron.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.360
So far, all the polyhedra
I've done haven't had that,

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.430
and you may have
seen that I assumed

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.608
that it wasn't there
for that last lemma.

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:34.660
This polyhedron can't
be unfolded at all

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.740
in one piece, no overlap.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.940
Why?

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.309
Because it has one vertex.

00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:41.850
You could think of
these as vertices,

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:42.984
but they're kind of flat.

00:18:42.984 --> 00:18:44.650
Everything's flat
except that one point.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.000
It has negative curvature.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.900
Negative curvature,
we said you have

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.900
to have at least two
cuts coming in there.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.380
If you just made one cut, then
when you flatten this thing,

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.450
it'll overlap itself locally.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.940
So there's got to be at least
two cuts coming in there.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.910
I don't think that
even matters much.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.850
I mean, there's at
least one, certainly.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.890
Where could those
guys go, those cuts?

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.810
They have to wander
around the surface.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.220
If they just stop in
the middle of nowhere,

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.429
then you're sort of doing
nothing because a cut that just

00:19:14.429 --> 00:19:15.970
stops in the middle
of a flat vertex,

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.020
well, you might as well
not have done that cut,

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.234
so you could erase it.

00:19:19.234 --> 00:19:20.400
So it's got to go somewhere.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.900
They could go to each other, in
which case you've made a cycle

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.150
and then you've disconnected
your surface because this

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.070
is like a disk, or they
could go to the boundary.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.650
And if they both
go to the boundary,

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.640
again, you disconnect
your surface, two pieces.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.120
So this is kind of pathetic,
but you can't unfold this

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.240
with one piece, no overlap.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.120
So when I say, in
this picture, and I

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.800
say that it's open whether
non-convex polyhedra can

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.020
be generally unfolded, I
mean non-convex polyhedra

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.770
without boundary.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.955
I'll even give you
handles if you want.

00:19:51.955 --> 00:19:54.780
I'm not sure that
it matters too much,

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.870
but boundary seems to
make a big difference.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.340
So what's wrong
is this polyhedron

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.210
is kind of incomplete,
and as long

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.380
as you close it up somehow
and don't have these boundary

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.560
effects, then maybe you can
generally unfold everything.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.600
That's this question.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.250
That was a little bit on this.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.940
We'll come back to
it more next lecture.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:29.360
Next, I want to do this one,
general unfolding of convex

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:29.870
polyhedra.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.110
This is really the most
positive news I could give you.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.540
All this unfolding stuff,
it's the one good result.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.257
We know several good results,
but in terms of that table,

00:20:42.257 --> 00:20:43.340
it's our only good result.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.530
And to do that, there's a bunch
of solutions to this problem.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.595
They all use the idea
of shortest paths.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.210
The shortest path is a
path that's shortest.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:19.140
So you have some surface,
you have some points.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.640
You do this all the
time when you're

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.240
flying between two cities.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.870
You follow a shortest
path on a sphere.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.620
It's not straight
in three dimensions.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.890
It's the shortest thing subject
to lying on that surface, what

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.310
is the shortest path you can do?

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.717
So you're used to
it on a sphere.

00:21:33.717 --> 00:21:35.300
It's a little weirder
on a polyhedron,

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.520
but it's just the same idea.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.570
Take all the possible paths you
could, find the shortest one.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.000
You fix the two
endpoints, x and y,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.260
and you get to optimize this.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.860
Whatever is shortest
is the right thing.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:52.660
I have some pictures of
what they look like here.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.240
So these are some
convex polyhedra.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.050
They're probably random
points on a sphere,

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.650
take the convex hull.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.810
And then we pick some vertex,
or some point x in the corner

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.810
there, and this is
computing the shortest paths

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.360
from x to every other
vertex on the polyhedron.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.680
So they look very
straight in this case

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.430
because the polyhedron
is almost a sphere.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.020
They look kind of like great
circular arcs on a sphere,

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.130
but they're not quite.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.210
You can look carefully
at an edge here,

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.470
this does bend a little bit.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.190
It's a bit subtle.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.030
It bends only a little bit
because the property you want

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.130
is if you look at this
triangle and this triangle

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.060
and you unfold
them-- so right now,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.110
they have some dihedral
angle between them,

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.180
and if you open it out
so that they're flat,

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.150
then this line
should be straight.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.260
Still the case that shortest
paths are straight lines,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.410
but only when you unfold.

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:46.262
That's the idea.

00:22:46.262 --> 00:22:48.220
So if you look at all
the triangles are visited

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.206
by a path, and you unfold them
to be a straight thing-- this

00:22:51.206 --> 00:22:54.670
is called developing, you
flatten it out-- then actually,

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.420
the shortest path will
be a straight line,

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.690
so that makes it really
easy to draw these things.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.250
There still might be multiple
candidates, like to get here,

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.610
should I go this way or
the other way around,

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:07.465
but each of those will
be locally straight,

00:23:07.465 --> 00:23:09.090
and this is a property
called geodesic.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:17.342
Shortest paths always
unfold straight.

00:23:17.342 --> 00:23:19.300
And in general, anything
that unfolds straight,

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.700
it might not even be
shortest, is a geodesic.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.590
These are like locally shortest.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.910
Locally, you can't
make them any shorter,

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.270
but they might have
made the wrong choice.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.020
They might have gone
around the wrong way.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.525
Geodesic means going
straight for a long time.

00:23:37.525 --> 00:23:39.150
You could actually
spiral around and do

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.610
all sorts of crazy things.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:50.440
But shortest paths
never cross themselves

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.966
because if you had the shortest
path that crossed itself,

00:23:52.966 --> 00:23:53.840
that wasn't shortest.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.980
You should have just
gotten rid of this part

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.830
and gone straight
through the crossing.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.560
That's sort of trivial.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.875
And there's another
good, fun property

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:07.330
that you may not have
noticed in those figures,

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:14.865
but they never pass through
positive curvature vertex.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.060
So if you look at
these pictures,

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.630
they might end at a
positive curvature vertex

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.960
because that's where we told
the shortest path to go,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.050
but in the middle, they're
always crossing edges.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.920
This is a convex polyhedron so
everything's positive curvature

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.810
or zero.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.390
In that case, the
paths can really only

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.800
go through zero
curvature points.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.010
They might start
and end wherever,

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.010
but in between, they
never hit a corner.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.980
Why?

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.200
Because if you have a
positive curvature vertex--

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.700
I'm just going to sketch this
idea-- if you went up here

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.550
in order to go back down
somewhere like there,

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.680
it's always better to
shortcut a little bit

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.730
and not go through the vertex.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.276
It's better to go around
one way or the other.

00:25:08.276 --> 00:25:10.880
I'm just going to wave my
hands at that, but it's true.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.482
So what?

00:25:14.482 --> 00:25:16.690
Shortest paths are going to
be a really powerful tool

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:17.648
for finding unfoldings.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:32.640
In particular, I want to
define the star, that picture,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.400
of all shortest
paths from one point.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.770
And do I want points here?

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:53.960
I think I want vertices.

00:25:57.907 --> 00:25:59.240
That's the picture that we drew.

00:26:03.931 --> 00:26:06.430
The interesting thing about all
the shortest paths, they all

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.304
start from the same point,
they never hit each other.

00:26:10.304 --> 00:26:11.970
So not only does a
shortest path not hit

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.530
itself, but if you take many
shortest paths, or even two

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.950
shortest paths from a
common starting point,

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.800
they can't hit each other.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.790
It could be one is
a subset of another.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.859
For example, if I took
the shortest path to here

00:26:27.859 --> 00:26:29.900
and then I also took the
shortest path to a point

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.080
just beyond it,
well, one's going

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.380
to be a prefix of the other.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.860
Other than that, they will
never cross each other.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.930
I'm going to just assert
that, not prove it here.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.650
So really, it does
look like a star.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.960
In fact, you could fill
in more shortest paths.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.430
You could take the shortest
path to here, for example,

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:51.210
and it'll fit in nicely, kind
of bisect that angle in there.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.150
It's a very simple
kind of structure.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.120
It's just from a point, you
have all this stuff going out.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:05.650
They never hit each
other except at something

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:12.412
called the cut locus, also
called the ridge tree.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:27.675
And these are points with
non-unique shortest paths to x.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.915
So we're fixing some point, x.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.160
So here's a simpler polyhedron.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.110
It's just a
square-based pyramid.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.060
We're picking x to be in
the middle of this face,

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.110
and drawn in these black
lines are the shortest paths

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.180
from x to all the vertices.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.440
Here, that's a straight line.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.620
This one, if you unfolded
it, it would be straight,

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.750
and there's some similar
ones on the back.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:10.060
And I think this is the back
in case you want to see.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.870
There's one back face that you
can't see at all, C, behind B

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:20.977
here, and that's
what it looks like.

00:28:20.977 --> 00:28:22.310
There's no shortest paths there.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.810
Now, there's these dashed lines.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:25.640
That's the ridge tree.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.000
That's the cut locus.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.330
And these are points on the
backside with respect to x.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:37.260
If you're going from x,
you go around behind to C,

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:42.330
or you could go from x around
behind to D and then to C.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:47.040
At some point, those things meet
and are still of equal length.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.970
So here, if you're
trying to go to x,

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.800
you could go around this way or
you could go around this way.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.230
They will be the same
length, and all the points

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.686
with that property
are the dashed lines.

00:28:58.686 --> 00:29:00.810
Now, if you're familiar
with [? Vornar ?] diagrams,

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:05.700
this is the [? Vornar ?]
diagram of one point, x.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.160
Imagine you plant grass over
your polyhedron, you light

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.250
a fire here, it burns at
uniform speed in all directions.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.710
Where the fire meets
itself on the backside,

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.540
that is the ridge tree.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.030
That is the
[? Vornar ?] diagram.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.410
So it's kind of intuitive
that it's there.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.580
Maybe less obvious
is that it's a tree

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.650
and it's a spanning tree.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:28.691
It hits all the vertices.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.390
So it's a natural cutting.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.330
That's why it's
called the cut locus,

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.620
and it works really well.

00:29:58.359 --> 00:29:59.900
And it's called the
source unfolding.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.730
Source unfolding goes
back to the mid '80s.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.530
A bunch of people
discovered it for

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.010
various computational
geometry applications.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.630
They didn't care about
unfolding at the time.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:25.640
And it's kind of obvious after
you think about it for a while,

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.280
trying to solve this
general unfolding problem.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:36.970
Once you have this structure,
cut along the cut locus,

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:43.105
unfold the star of
shortest paths from x.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.200
So let's do it for this example.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.860
It's the same
example on the left.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.150
This is the star unfolding.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.890
I've just splayed out
everything, so at the boundary,

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.570
I'm cutting at the dashed part.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.820
That's the cut locus.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.320
Ignore these little
dashed lines.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.280
Those are just edges, unfolded.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.490
And what's happening is that
all the shortest paths are all

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.200
here.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.490
If I look at any shortest path
from x on the left diagram,

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:20.830
I can map it to a line
segment starting from x.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.100
x was a flat vertex.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.450
It has 360 degrees of
material around it.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.900
I just chose it to be somewhere
in the middle somewhere.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.590
Doesn't matter other than that.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:32.100
And now there's 360 degrees of
material on the flat unfolding.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.120
That's great.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.340
And you pick any
direction here, you

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.620
can map it to a corresponding
direction over there

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.780
on the surface, see where
that shortest path would

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.850
go if you kept going until
you were no longer shortest.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.700
When you stop being shortest,
the edge of that place

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.630
is the ridge tree, and
that's where you cut.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.584
You stop your segment there.

00:31:54.584 --> 00:31:57.000
So it's actually pretty obvious
this thing doesn't overlap

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.620
because all of
these shortest paths

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.940
are going in different
directions from x.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.450
What you have is what we call
a star shaped polygon around x.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.060
Every point on the
surface is visible from x

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:12.090
because we just sort of
unrolled it to be right there.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.550
That's the source unfolding.

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.350
It's a little hard to
see the 3D diagrams,

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.585
but it's actually really easy
once you draw those shortest

00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:21.085
paths.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.984
So the source unfolding
is star shaped.

00:32:29.984 --> 00:32:32.150
We have another unfolding
called the star unfolding,

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.661
which is not star shaped.

00:32:33.661 --> 00:32:34.285
Very confusing.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.710
I mean, what you call one
doesn't matter too much.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.120
This unfolding was
mentioned in 1948

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.740
by Alexandrov, who
we'll be hearing

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.270
about more in the
future, but wasn't

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.770
improved to
non-overlap until '92.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.570
So this one is much less
obvious that it doesn't overlap,

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.560
and I'm not going
to prove it here.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.470
But it goes back to
this idea of star.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.950
Say, OK, this cut locus
is nice, but let's

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.050
focus on the star
of shortest paths

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.750
from one point to all
the other vertices.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:14.600
Instead of keeping those paths
as the things that you unroll,

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.700
what if we cut along them?

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.430
It's another natural thing to
try and it turns out to work.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.650
So here, we cut along the star.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.930
We've already
proved this result,

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.040
every convex polyhedron
is generally unfoldable.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.590
Just with that picture,
it's very easy.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.990
But hey, it's fun to have more.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.770
And this is what the
star unfolding looks

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.990
like for the same example.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:49.075
This is a little less obvious,
but if you think about it,

00:33:49.075 --> 00:33:50.450
the star, the set
of all shortest

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.500
paths to all the vertices,
is a spanning tree.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.280
It hits all the vertices
because we told it to,

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.060
and it's a tree
because it's just

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.960
all these edges coming
together at a point.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.320
So it's a natural cutting also.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.850
And magically it works.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.260
How it works is a
little less obvious.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.650
You see here the ridge tree
drawn on the unfolding,

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.310
and you can see all the
parts and map the letter E,

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.409
this is the bottom square,
and stays connected.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:22.510
It's just like you
reattach everything

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:26.510
around the ridge tree
and it doesn't overlap.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.639
It's quite difficult, I think,
to give intuition why this

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:37.024
doesn't overlap, but it doesn't.

00:34:43.178 --> 00:34:44.719
I'll wave my hands
at some point when

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.690
we have the necessary
tools to prove it,

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.574
I can mention how it's done.

00:34:49.574 --> 00:34:50.699
But we don't have them yet.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:52.698
We'll get them in a couple
of lectures, I think.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:02.260
These results can be extended
also in various directions.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.985
Let me tell you briefly
about some extensions.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.370
For a long time, these
were the two ways

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.380
to solve that problem
and that was sort of it.

00:35:17.564 --> 00:35:19.980
It would be nice, for example,
to have some general family

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.521
of unfoldings that includes the
star unfolding and the source

00:35:22.521 --> 00:35:24.489
unfolding and there's
something in the middle,

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:26.280
but we don't necessarily
know what that is.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.292
Do you have a question?

00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:28.208
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:33.307 --> 00:35:35.640
PROFESSOR: How do you find
the creases is your question?

00:35:40.002 --> 00:35:42.210
You find the creases because
you know for every point

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.370
here where it was
on the surface,

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.700
and if it was on an edge,
then it's a crease point.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.950
That's the easy way to do it.

00:35:50.845 --> 00:35:52.720
I don't know if that's
a satisfactory answer,

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.061
but it can be done.

00:35:55.061 --> 00:35:57.770
AUDIENCE: Does it matter
where you choose x to be?

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.660
PROFESSOR: Does it matter
where you choose x to be?

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.560
It will change the unfolding.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.411
It will never overlap,
but in that sense

00:36:06.411 --> 00:36:08.160
there's a whole family
of star unfoldings,

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.270
depending on where you move x.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.800
There's a whole family
of source unfoldings

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.049
depending on where you move x.

00:36:12.049 --> 00:36:15.740
AUDIENCE: Does it make it
more efficient, any choice?

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.340
PROFESSOR: I mean,
some of the unfoldings

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.134
might have more cuts,
some might have less cuts.

00:36:21.134 --> 00:36:22.550
You're going to
get more cuts when

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.760
you have-- depends
how you count.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.760
In some sense, there's only
n cuts, n shortest paths.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.960
But a shortest path
might cut over many faces

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.140
or it might just
cut over one face.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:37.947
Depends where x is.

00:36:37.947 --> 00:36:39.530
If you choose x to
be in a nice place,

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.450
maybe you could get
away with fewer cuts

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:46.540
and have to do less welding, but
there's no theory about that.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.222
More questions.

00:36:48.222 --> 00:36:51.020
AUDIENCE: So it doesn't
matter where you put x.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.966
If it works at one spot, it
basically works at every spot.

00:36:54.966 --> 00:36:56.122
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:56.122 --> 00:36:57.580
PROFESSOR: For
convex polyhedra, it

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.150
works no matter where you put x.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.730
For non-convex polyhedra, some
x's might work, some might not.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.874
Here, let me show you.

00:37:08.874 --> 00:37:10.040
Here's more star unfoldings.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.030
Cool.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:15.320
They're really crazy looking
and not really star shaped.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.410
There isn't one point
that can see everything.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.620
They look kind of spiky like a
star, but it's quite different.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.790
These are random
points on a sphere,

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.736
like take 42 random points on
a sphere, take the convex hull,

00:37:26.736 --> 00:37:27.860
then take a star unfolding.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.060
Here's an example with
a non-convex polyhedron.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:39.170
So one thing we hoped for
for a little while briefly

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.940
was that if you only had one
vertex of negative curvature,

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.574
which is this one, maybe if
you choose x to be right there

00:37:46.574 --> 00:37:48.240
and did the star
unfolding, because that

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.860
cuts x into lots of
little tiny pieces, then

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.710
maybe it would unfold about
overlap, but it doesn't work.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:56.805
We were destroyed.

00:37:59.649 --> 00:38:01.190
In fact, you can
show neither of them

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.700
will work in general for
a non-convex polyhedra,

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.020
so there's no hope of
solving this problem

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:10.430
with these techniques, at least
with these exact algorithms.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.500
You might get lucky,
but most of the time,

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.880
I think they won't work.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.410
Currently, x is a point.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:36.371
You can actually
let x be-- I guess

00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:37.870
I'm not going to
be safe-- I'm going

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.750
to call it a geodesic path.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:43.370
There's some restrictions
on when this is allowed,

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.930
but the idea is you
have your surface,

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.067
you take some straight
path on the surface,

00:38:49.067 --> 00:38:50.900
and then you take
shortest paths from there.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.550
And if you just think
about the source unfolding

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:02.304
where you keep x intact
and unfold from there,

00:39:02.304 --> 00:39:03.720
the picture is
going to look like,

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.840
well, you have
this straight line

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.660
when you unfold that
thing, and then you

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.560
have this nice star
of stuff around it.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.050
And under some
simple conditions,

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.430
that will work without overlap.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.530
What's more impressive is
that the star unfolding

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.984
works from a source like that.

00:39:20.984 --> 00:39:22.400
Again, there are
some restrictions

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.249
on x that I'm not
going to define here,

00:39:24.249 --> 00:39:25.040
but it can be done.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.120
These are two very recent
papers by O'Rourke and Itoh

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.209
and Vilku from the
last two years.

00:39:33.209 --> 00:39:34.000
So that's exciting.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.811
We now have four general methods
for unfolding convex polyhedra.

00:39:37.811 --> 00:39:39.060
Again, these are big families.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.450
You can choose
any geodesic path.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.940
Maybe some are
nicer than others.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:46.860
You can do higher dimensions.

00:39:55.275 --> 00:39:57.405
Star unfolding doesn't
really make sense

00:39:57.405 --> 00:39:58.280
in higher dimensions.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.988
I don't think I've
thought about it much,

00:39:59.988 --> 00:40:02.300
but source unfolding
makes sense.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.420
So you have some four polytopes,
a little hard to imagine.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.150
You take some point and
just radiate out from there,

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:12.440
unfold like that until you hit
yourself, and then you stop,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.510
and that works in any dimension.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.240
Source unfolding works
in any dimension.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:22.870
That's fairly recent,
2003, Miller and Pak.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:27.765
Another thing you can do
is continuous blooming.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.810
This is an idea posed by
Connolly several years

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:39.017
back and then solved
last year, I guess.

00:40:39.017 --> 00:40:40.100
It was presented in Japan.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:46.242
This is about folded states
versus folding motions,

00:40:46.242 --> 00:40:48.450
an issue we have thought
about many times in origami.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:51.050
It was easy for any
polygonal piece of paper.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.120
We could go from
unfolded to folded state

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.450
by a continuous motion
without self intersection.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.400
For linkages, it
was the big deal.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.030
It was all about, can
we get from a to b?

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:06.590
For convex polyhedra, you can
do it, continuous blooming.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.670
This is in the middle of an
algorithm of continuously

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.970
blooming the source unfolding.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.380
So here's our point x.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.930
This is the cube, and
the source unfolding

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:19.990
of a cube for this
point x in the center

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:23.530
of a face, these four vertical
lines and then a little x

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.370
on the top side.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.500
The algorithm unfolds
one edge at a time

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.040
but in a very specific order.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.124
So it ends up unfolding this
entire house shape first,

00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:35.790
and then it's done
one edge of this one,

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.081
and then it's going to fold
the other one down and then

00:41:38.081 --> 00:41:41.180
unfold one, two for the
backside, and then one,

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.670
two for the left side.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.670
And you can show that
will not self intersect

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.060
as long as you had
a convex polyhedron.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.564
It's not obvious but it's true.

00:41:50.564 --> 00:41:52.230
There are some other
results that if you

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:57.280
have any unfolding that doesn't
self intersect at the end,

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.805
you can add some cuts and make
it actually continuously bloom.

00:42:01.805 --> 00:42:03.365
It's kind of like
hinged dissections.

00:42:03.365 --> 00:42:05.220
It may not work by
itself, but you'd

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:09.450
cut the pieces into smaller
pieces and then it will work.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.750
That's pretty good news,
and source unfolding just

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:12.620
works as is.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.420
I might talk about that
some future lecture.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.370
Not known, for example, whether
the star unfolding continuously

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:27.305
blooms.

00:42:27.305 --> 00:42:30.750
That sounds a
little scary to me.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.490
We don't actually have
an unfolding of a convex

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:36.940
polyhedron that does
not continuously bloom.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:40.460
I think there should be one,
but that's an open problem.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.560
Is this always possible, or
is there some crazy collection

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.650
of cuts that you cannot escape?

00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:54.050
That's that, general
unfolding of convex polyhedra.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:58.900
Let's turn to the--
it's not the last topic.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.710
We still want to
cover both of these.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:05.320
Next topic is edge unfolding
of convex polyhedra.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.260
Now, this problem,
as I said, goes

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:13.090
back to 1525,
implicitly at least,

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:20.445
by this guy, Albrecht
Durer, who was a cool guy.

00:43:20.445 --> 00:43:22.240
This is Renaissance time.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.730
He did many different things.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.159
I guess painter is maybe
his primary profession,

00:43:26.159 --> 00:43:27.700
but he did a lot of
different things.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:32.300
He studied early perspective,
all that good stuff.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.700
This is one of
his famous prints.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.860
It was actually on display
at the MFA last year,

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.580
I got to see it, and it
has a little polyhedron

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.260
thrown in there.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.700
It's a nice polyhedron.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.600
How did he draw them?

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.151
Well, he probably built
models out of some material.

00:43:48.151 --> 00:43:49.650
And he was just
generally interested

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.720
in the third dimension
and understanding

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.640
how all these things worked, and
so he made a lot of unfoldings

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.080
in this book.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.290
This is the original title.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:00.900
Here's a translation.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.140
Titles were a lot
longer in those days.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.967
The Painter's Manual
is what I usually

00:44:04.967 --> 00:44:07.050
call it, "A Manual of
Measurement of Lines, Areas,

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:08.716
and Solids by Means
of Compass and Ruler

00:44:08.716 --> 00:44:11.280
Assembled by Albrecht Durer for
the Use of all Lovers of Art

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.905
with Appropriate
Illustrations Arranged

00:44:12.905 --> 00:44:16.320
to be Printed in
the Year MDXXV."

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.360
And I don't even know what the
subtitle is, but there you go.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.210
If you read German,
I'm told this

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.240
is a challenge because
of the old script.

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.620
So unfoldings like this.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.410
He did mostly Archimedian
solids in this book.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.840
This book is several
hundred pages long.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.790
I have a copy.

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:41.380
This is a
cuboctahedron unfolded.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:45.290
He is only cutting along edges,
and he liked this, I presume,

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:47.290
for building models.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.896
Here's a fancy
one, the snub cube.

00:44:48.896 --> 00:44:50.520
This one, I think,
might have an error.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.380
A couple of them have very small
errors, but for the most part,

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.030
he was the inventor
of edge unfolding.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:03.230
Now, he didn't ask, is this
always possible, but we did.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:15.370
Mathematicians did in
1976, I believe, or '85.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:22.230
'75, G. C. Shephard, geometer.

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:24.830
He was the first one
to write it in a paper,

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:27.390
does every convex polyhedron
have an edge unfolding?

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:36.000
So what can I tell you
about this problem?

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.460
It's hard.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:41.035
Many people have
thought about it.

00:45:41.035 --> 00:45:42.660
I'm not really sure
that it's possible.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.770
A lot of people do, though.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.780
It's possible for
a lot of polyhedra.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.020
In fact, every polyhedron
we've tried to unfold we

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.100
have eventually unfolded--
convex polyhedron.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.680
Simple set of examples are
the Archimedian solids.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.440
Doesn't take that much effort to
find unfoldings of all of them.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.310
You can do this with exhaustive
search or just playing around.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:28.020
A lot of people have
done this over the years.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.550
This is all the
unfoldings of those guys.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:33.370
There's a lot of
heuristic software

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.680
for actually doing this.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.020
I think the coolest one
right now is Pepakura.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.020
If you want to build a
paper model of something,

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.319
you have a 3D model
thrown into Pepakura

00:46:43.319 --> 00:46:45.610
and it'll probably give you
a one piece unfolding, even

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:46.690
for non-convex shapes.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.740
Even though it's
not always possible,

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.480
it'll do edge
cuttings, it'll try

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.540
to do some exhaustive search,
and usually does pretty well.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.310
Sometimes it'll use
multiple pieces.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:58.350
That's the catch.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:00.670
There's a link in
the lecture notes.

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:03.710
The most thorough
mathematical search

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:09.310
is by this guy, Wolfram
Schlickenrieder,

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:13.040
who wrote the equivalent
of a master's thesis

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:19.556
in Berlin 13 years ago.

00:47:19.556 --> 00:47:21.180
I just wrote to him
about it yesterday.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.434
I was like, hey,
this is cool stuff.

00:47:23.434 --> 00:47:24.600
Can I show it in my lecture?

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.900
He was like, yeah, it lives on.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.170
He had a class of 10
different algorithms,

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:36.750
around that many,
possible algorithms

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:38.640
for unfolding all
convex polyhedra,

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.110
and then he came up with
a dozen different families

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:41.750
of polyhedra.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.208
I don't have the polyhedra
drawn here, just the unfoldings.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:51.160
They're generators of
big classes of polyhedra.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.440
He applied every
algorithm to every class.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.900
Ideally, you get an algorithm
that works for all classes

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.620
or you find a class that
foils all algorithms.

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.080
Sadly, he found neither.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.190
Every algorithm was
foiled by some example,

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:09.935
yet every example was
foiled by some algorithm.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.960
It's really annoying, but here's
some examples where they fail.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.710
They just barely fail, just a
couple triangles are messed up.

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:22.280
Little squares are messed up.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.320
I think these are called
the turtle polyhedra.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:29.080
It's like a big, flat thing
and then a dome on top.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.960
So inconclusive, I
guess, is the answer.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.970
There was one algorithm that
had a degree of freedom.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.830
You had to choose
a direction, then

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.600
you cut along all the edges
that are most in that direction.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.980
And there was a conjecture
on the table from this thesis

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.570
that maybe for every
polyhedron, there

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:46.520
is a direction that
works, but then

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.950
that was destroyed
four years ago.

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:53.514
Brendan Lucier from Waterloo
proved that that's not true.

00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:54.930
He found a polyhedron
that doesn't

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.777
work from any direction.

00:48:56.777 --> 00:48:58.860
So at the moment, we have
no candidate algorithms,

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.440
which makes me worry whether
this could possibly be true.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.750
We have some more bad examples.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:11.086
Here are some annoying things,
like a cube with a corner

00:49:11.086 --> 00:49:11.585
cut off.

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:17.030
It's a very local thing, but
you can mess up really easily.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:19.674
It's actually quite common
to mess up, I would say,

00:49:19.674 --> 00:49:21.340
even though for things
like Archimedian,

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.470
it's much harder to mess up.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:28.340
Simplest polyhedron that messes
up is this sliver tetrahedron.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.800
So the polyhedron
is drawn at the top.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:39.650
It's a little hard to
see, but on the backside,

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:47.250
there's an edge like
that, if you can imagine.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.050
So it's almost
flat, so that's why

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.330
it's drawn flat, and
the four corners,

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.574
like a tetrahedron
should have, four faces,

00:49:55.574 --> 00:49:57.240
the front two triangles
and the back two

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.580
triangles with the
line that I drew.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:03.085
And if you unfold it in a simple
way, you just cut from a to b,

00:50:03.085 --> 00:50:05.240
it unfolds like
this, no problem.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.340
But if you unfold
the wrong way, which

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.820
is to cut both of
the diagonal lines,

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.990
then you end up with the
spears that cross each other,

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.590
so you really have
to be careful.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:21.660
In fact, if you take
a random polyhedron--

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:25.370
I choose 80 points on a
sphere, I take the convex hull.

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:28.600
It's a very nice, round
sphere-like polyhedron.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.954
And I look at all
the unfoldings--

00:50:30.954 --> 00:50:32.620
this is probably not
all the unfoldings,

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:37.750
but I randomly generate
unfoldings, and I evaluate,

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:42.870
what is the observed
probability that I get overlap?

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:46.700
And it's very close to 100%.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.650
The conjecture is that
as n goes to infinity,

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.560
the probability of
overlap goes to 1.

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.810
We don't have a proof of that.

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:55.456
That would be nice to prove.

00:50:55.456 --> 00:50:57.580
There's good reason to
believe that's easy to prove

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.291
or that it's true, let's
say, that there is a proof.

00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:02.040
I don't know how to
actually formalize it.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:07.450
This is some work
from the late '80s.

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.380
Just because most
unfoldings fail

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.280
doesn't mean there isn't
one unfolding that works.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.280
If I were to try to prove that
there is an unfolding that

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.520
works, here's my best hope,
and it ties into some things

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:31.420
that we've seen
with tensegrities.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:35.840
If you take a really big
polyhedron, which is the case

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:40.150
you worry about, and you look
at a small portion of it,

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:43.810
that portion will be
almost completely flat.

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:48.450
Locally, this thing
is mostly flat.

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:50.350
Instead of thinking
about the big polyhedron,

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:54.350
if we at least wanted to
get it to work in any patch,

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:59.820
think about the case of
an almost flat polyhedron.

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.050
So it's like a little dome.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.462
It has boundary now.

00:52:02.462 --> 00:52:04.170
Makes life a little
harder, but let's say

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:05.430
it's a nice, convex boundary.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:07.309
This is a convex dome.

00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:08.350
It's actually polyhedral.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.170
Well, let's make it
super, super flat.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.480
So we have this z-coordinate.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.864
Scale z to squash it
down into the plane.

00:52:20.864 --> 00:52:22.280
What's nice about
this is then you

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.240
can think of your
convex polyhedron

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:28.830
just as some drawing
in the plane.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:31.220
So here maybe is my
convex polyhedron.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.740
Now, in fact, each
of these vertices

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.180
is lifted a tiny amount,
some infinitesimal amount,

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:38.570
but you can think
of it in the plane.

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:40.157
These are convex faces.

00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:42.490
We know this thing can be
lifted to a convex polyhedron.

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:45.840
That lifting is
a positive stress

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.380
on all the edges except
the boundary edges.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:51.650
Maybe that stress gives
you some useful structure.

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:53.430
If there's any hope
of this working,

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:56.680
that structure better be useful,
but I don't know how to use it.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.640
But in particular,
open question.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.430
If I give you a super
shallow, arbitrarily

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:06.540
shallow, convex polyhedral
dome, can it be unfolded?

00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.270
I don't know.

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:13.670
Maybe we'll work on it
in the problem session.

00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:17.925
Haven't thought
about it for awhile.

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.840
That's if you want
to solve everything.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.580
What if you just want to
solve some special cases?

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:31.900
That is a special case
motivated by the general case.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.920
Well, you can solve the
case of a polyhedron

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.130
with at most six vertices.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.950
That's as far as we've gotten.

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:42.210
You can solve some simple
examples like pyramids

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:46.380
if you take any convex
polygon, doesn't

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.909
have to be irregular
or anything,

00:53:47.909 --> 00:53:50.200
and then you take a point
and you take the convex hull.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.360
So that's a polyhedron
and it unfolds.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.580
How does it unfold?

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.850
Any suggestions where to cut?

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.954
How?

00:54:05.954 --> 00:54:07.430
AUDIENCE: From the top?

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:08.870
PROFESSOR: From the top.

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:10.500
Yeah, just cut here.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.680
Here, we're only allowed
to cut along edges.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:17.021
This is called the
volcano unfolding.

00:54:17.021 --> 00:54:18.010
What do we have?

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:23.310
Like that, and then there's
just a bunch of triangles.

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.340
What's nice about
the volcano unfolding

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:31.370
is if you look at these
perpendicular strips here,

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:34.600
those triangles will fit inside
those perpendicular strips,

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.370
and therefore they won't
intersect each other

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:39.370
because these strips don't
intersect each other.

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:41.120
You could probably
even continuously bloom

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:41.940
this, no problem.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.997
So a very simple example,
easy to do with volcanoes.

00:54:45.997 --> 00:54:47.205
That's the so-called pyramid.

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:56.240
Prism, a little bit more
interesting, but not by much.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.791
You take some polygon.

00:54:59.791 --> 00:55:02.010
Again, doesn't
have to be regular,

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:05.304
but you take two copies of
it vertically offset, take

00:55:05.304 --> 00:55:05.970
the convex hull.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:14.510
This one you can
cut in two ways.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:15.920
You could do a
volcano-like thing

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.350
where you cut all
the vertical edges

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:24.860
and then you cut all but
one of the bottom edges.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:30.280
Then you'll have basically a
volcano with little rectangles

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.420
hanging off all the sides.

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:37.654
And then there's another copy,
the bottom copy of this face,

00:55:37.654 --> 00:55:39.320
and it just hangs out
over here, and you

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.090
could prove that that
won't hit anybody

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:43.250
in this very simple situation.

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:46.260
There's another unfolding,
though, that I mention

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:50.080
because it's useful
for other things,

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.905
and it's so-called
band unfolding.

00:55:51.905 --> 00:55:58.220
Band unfolding, I
want to keep intact

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:04.266
the radial band around the
thing, maybe like this.

00:56:04.266 --> 00:56:07.600
What do I want to do
to keep that edge?

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.450
Cut, cut.

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.600
So I cut on all the
top edges except one,

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.700
I cut on all the bottom
edges except the same one,

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.110
and then I also cut
this vertical edge.

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:21.560
So what I should get
is I get my top face,

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:24.020
then I get a
rectangle, then I get

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:27.020
the band that goes
around the outside,

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:32.486
and then I get another copy
of my shape, the bottom side.

00:56:32.486 --> 00:56:33.985
This is what we
call band unfolding.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:40.100
There's some nice theorems about
band unfoldings working out.

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.690
Let me get to more
interesting polyhedra.

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.650
These are some
pretty simple cases,

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:55.180
but we don't know very
much on the positive side.

00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:05.730
Prismoid.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:20.480
Suppose you take a polygon,
and you basically inset it.

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.400
So I want to make a new
version of the polygon

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:32.100
where all of the angles match,
so these edges are parallel

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:32.760
to each other.

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.170
I think, actually, the
lengths can change.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:37.935
And then you take
the convex hull.

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:43.165
These unfold with the
volcano unfolding.

00:57:46.024 --> 00:57:47.440
It's a little more
subtle to prove

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.180
but it's proved in the textbook.

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.070
Edges have to stay parallel.

00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:59.576
I think that might
force something.

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:01.200
I'm not quite sure,
but the constraints

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.300
are that the edges
have to be parallel

00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:03.633
and the angles have to be equal.

00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:09.660
Dome.

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.160
Dome is actually in
some ways simpler.

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:20.720
You take some base, and then
I want a whole bunch of faces

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.500
that all touch the base.

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:26.610
So in general, it's going to be
like a tree of faces, something

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:28.710
like this.

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:31.840
Every face has to touch
an edge of the base.

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.405
These also unfold, and
also with a volcano.

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:40.490
This is proved also
in the textbook.

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:42.456
Both results are
by Joe O'Rourke.

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:47.380
Prismatoid.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.870
This is the coolest
special case I'm

00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:53.380
going to talk about,
the most interesting.

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:59.340
I take some convex polygon,
and then in a parallel offset,

00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:06.337
I take some other
convex polygon--

00:59:06.337 --> 00:59:08.212
no relation to each
other except that they're

00:59:08.212 --> 00:59:09.950
in parallel planes--
and then I take

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:15.640
the convex hull,
something like that.

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.595
This one, sadly, is open.

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:29.110
Now, what we do know,
and this is related

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:32.660
to the band
unfolding, if you look

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:38.650
at the band around the
sides of this prismatoid

00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:41.460
and just unfold
that by itself, that

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:45.160
will not self intersect,
and that's quite nontrivial,

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:45.820
the proof.

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:49.040
But if you just
unroll the side faces,

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.041
they will wander around but
they won't hit themselves.

00:59:53.041 --> 00:59:54.540
The only remaining
problem is, where

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:57.960
does the top and
the bottom face go?

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.920
I think I have an example
where that's a little dicey.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.060
Prism.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:04.860
Prismoid.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.120
That gives you an
answer to your offset.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.070
So they can be sheared
away from each other,

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:12.840
but this is a prismoid.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:17.420
All of the sides are parallel
and the angles match, a and b.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:22.900
Here is the volcano
unfolding of the prismoid,

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:26.580
and here's showing that it's
not so obvious that it always

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.080
works.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.330
If you're not careful where
you put the top face-- so this

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:34.230
is a on top of b
in plan-- you could

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.860
attach a to any of these faces.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.250
You have to choose
one that's not

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:41.420
so inside because
it's overlapping here.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.920
But if you choose
the outermost one,

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.890
it works and you can prove that.

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:51.490
This is the dome.

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:53.900
You can even have
overhang and they

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:57.190
will unfold, volcano style.

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:00.260
You no longer have those
nice perpendicular wedges

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.650
to say everything is disjoined.

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:02.719
But it still turns out.

01:01:02.719 --> 01:01:03.510
Nothing intersects.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:09.290
Here's the prismatoid
I wanted to show you.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.820
This one's actually almost flat.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:16.290
So a is this triangle right on
top of b, the triangle beneath.

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:17.790
You take the convex
hull and you get

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.970
all those edges on the outside.

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:23.710
And if you're not careful--
this is more volcano

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:26.745
style unfolding-- but
you can get overlap.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:36.910
One thing we do know,
this is kind of weird.

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:41.380
If you try to go more general,
and instead of taking a convex

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.970
polygon on the top and a
convex polygon on the bottom,

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:46.290
instead you take a
smooth convex curve

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:47.890
on the top and a
smooth convex curve

01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:50.594
on the bottom, which is getting
weird because now there's

01:01:50.594 --> 01:01:52.010
infinitely many
vertices and going

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:54.200
to be infinitely many cuts.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:58.440
But there is a natural
notion of unfolding

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.990
which sort of takes
the continuum.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.815
You take all those lines
that go from one side

01:02:02.815 --> 01:02:07.630
to the other, the rule
lines of the convex shape,

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:09.647
and you just unfold them.

01:02:09.647 --> 01:02:11.730
You don't actually preserve
area when you do this.

01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:14.580
It's not a valid unfolding
in the usual sense,

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.430
but it's a natural
generalization

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.756
of unfolding to smooth shapes.

01:02:18.756 --> 01:02:21.380
You can prove, well, that part's
going to work just fine if you

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.410
just volcano it, and
then you can actually

01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:26.420
find a place for the top face.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.420
Those are the special
cases we know,

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.780
and even some pretty simple
cases that we don't know,

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.480
although it's almost there.

01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:56.275
One more open problem.

01:03:21.716 --> 01:03:23.590
Just mention this because
it's a fun problem.

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:38.380
So again, I want to edge
unfold all convex polyhedra,

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.709
but I allow multiple
pieces to make

01:03:41.709 --> 01:03:42.875
the problem a little easier.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:53.690
So let's say I have a
polyhedron with f faces.

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:56.740
I want to know how few
pieces could I get away with?

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:59.836
The big open problem is, can
I get away with one piece?

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:00.960
What if you make it easier?

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:05.760
What if I just want, say,
little o of f pieces?

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.410
Smaller than any
constant times f.

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:09.290
This is open.

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:15.390
What we do know is
some constant times

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:19.710
f where the constant
is less than 1.

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:23.230
Best constant I have
written here is 1/2.

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:24.900
There is a better
bound, but I think

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.557
it's not so easy to
summarize in this form.

01:04:27.557 --> 01:04:29.140
So you can get a
little less than half

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.380
the faces' number of pieces,
but that's pretty pathetic.

01:04:35.507 --> 01:04:37.840
It's a problem that seemed
like it would be a good idea,

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.450
but so far it hasn't seemed to
make the problem much easier.

01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:46.810
What do I mean by pieces?

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:49.580
Well, we're all about
one piece unfolding,

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:53.170
so now your cutting
can have cycles in it

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:55.315
and disconnect the surface
into multiple parts.

01:04:55.315 --> 01:04:56.231
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:58.752 --> 01:05:00.460
PROFESSOR: Multiple
connected components.

01:05:15.426 --> 01:05:17.050
The tricky part is
to pair up the faces

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:20.050
so that everybody has a mate.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.510
That's not always possible.

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:24.134
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:05:24.134 --> 01:05:24.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.880
You would hope that one
third, but-- I mean,

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.700
you can do lots of
little local arguments

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.799
and prove this constant,
but the big question

01:05:33.799 --> 01:05:35.340
is, can you get less
than a constant?

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:50.615
So last topic for today is edge
unfolding non-convex polyhedra.

01:05:56.970 --> 01:06:00.210
Sort of did that
problem addressed,

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:03.330
and now this is not
always possible.

01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:06.200
So I want to give you a
polyhedron where you cannot

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:06.910
edge unfold it.

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:10.510
This is actually pretty easy,
and we did it way back in '98

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:12.340
when we started
working on folding,

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.810
but it's kind of cheating.

01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:18.630
This is a box on a box,
and the only edges here

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:20.790
are the edges of the two boxes.

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:23.460
There's no edges connecting
the outside of this face

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.670
to the inside of that face.

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:28.930
That face here is a donut.

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:29.840
It's a square donut.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:37.590
So if you're only cutting along
edges, that face is intact.

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:43.100
Now I ask you, where
does the top box go?

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.660
The top box has five
square faces, not six.

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.490
There's nothing on the bottom.

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:49.920
And somehow, it has to
be attached to the rest

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.810
if I want one piece.

01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:54.170
That means that all
five faces fit in here,

01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:56.990
but there's only room
for one in terms of area

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:59.050
so you're screwed.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:03.290
But this is cheating because
what I really wanted to do

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:05.920
was generalize this
problem, edge unfolding

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.080
of convex polyhedra.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.000
Now, I know they're not
going to look convex,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.240
but that thing is
really not convex.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.740
It's really not
convex in the sense

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:18.500
that you have this face that is
not even topologically a disk.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.750
It has a hole in it.

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:22.160
Convex polyhedra
don't have that.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.210
So in some sense, this
is a topological problem,

01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:27.500
you might say.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.800
And you might hope that if
I looked at polyhedra that

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.000
are topologically
convex, maybe those

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.020
would unfold by edge cuts.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.920
"Topologically convex"
means that if you just

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.570
move the vertices around but
preserve the edge structure,

01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:46.509
then it becomes a
convex polyhedron.

01:07:46.509 --> 01:07:48.550
In other words, I take a
convex polyhedron, which

01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:50.664
we think maybe has
an edge unfolding,

01:07:50.664 --> 01:07:52.330
and then I just pull
the vertices around

01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:55.150
but preserve all the faces.

01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:57.070
Then can you edge unfold those?

01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:59.470
And the answer is no.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:03.400
I have one more example
before we get there.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.160
This polyhedron, at least
all the faces are disks.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.600
There's no holes.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.560
So it's a cube with
little bites taken out

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.320
of all the edges, same paper.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.820
And this thing also
does not unfold.

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:14.945
It's a little less obvious.

01:08:17.622 --> 01:08:19.330
What's cheating about
this example is you

01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:22.090
have two faces, like this
purple one and the yellow one,

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:24.859
that share two different edges.

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:26.890
And for convex polyhedra,
two faces either

01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:29.649
share an edge or a
vertex or nothing,

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:34.300
but they can't reach
around and do to joins.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:40.390
Again, this is not topologically
convex, but this is.

01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:43.300
So this is two views
of the same thing,

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:46.640
and if I take these spikes and
I just push that vertex down

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.396
to be really close to this
triangle, this will be convex.

01:08:50.396 --> 01:08:52.020
So it's just a convex
polyhedron that I

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:55.060
pull on four of the points.

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.580
Same facial structure.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.899
This has no edge unfolding
and we're going to prove that.

01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:14.990
This example is even
stronger in that

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:16.200
all the faces are triangles.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.177
So what we're going to
do is take this thing.

01:09:30.177 --> 01:09:31.885
It's kind of appropriate
for this season.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.690
So I've got a
tetrahedral spike on top.

01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:05.830
Think of that as going
out of the board.

01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:10.041
And then in the plane of
the board is this triangle,

01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:11.540
and then I just add
in all the edges

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.480
to make it a triangulation.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.242
Adding edges is a
worry because that's

01:10:15.242 --> 01:10:16.950
where we're allowed
to cut, so you really

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:18.796
have to worry about
all those edges we add.

01:10:18.796 --> 01:10:21.720
If we add them in
that way, I claim,

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.950
you take this-- we call
it the witch's hat--

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:29.690
then you multiply, in some
sense, by a tetrahedron,

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:32.370
meaning I take four
copies of this hat,

01:10:32.370 --> 01:10:36.390
I put one on each face
of the tetrahedron,

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:39.470
and you get that example.

01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:43.050
Here's one witch's hat and
they're just joined along edges

01:10:43.050 --> 01:10:45.244
to make the tetrahedron.

01:10:45.244 --> 01:10:46.910
You could do this
with bigger polyhedra,

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.800
too, like octahedron, anything
with equilateral triangles,

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.410
but tetrahedron is the
smallest where it works.

01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:55.160
Just two of them glued face
to face would not work,

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.760
but this way does work.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:57.850
Is that true?

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:05.392
Now I've got to think about two
of them joined face to face.

01:11:05.392 --> 01:11:06.350
I don't think it works.

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:07.808
Otherwise, we would
have done that.

01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:12.000
Oh yes, I think I see why.

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.780
Why doesn't this work?

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:25.540
I should say it doesn't work
if the spikes are really tall

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:28.804
and the base is really flat.

01:11:28.804 --> 01:11:30.470
I'm going to define
what "really" means,

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:32.130
but we'll get there.

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:38.890
So here's our witch's hat.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.430
When this spike is really
tall, these angles, alpha,

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:50.600
are very close to 90,
a little bit under 90.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.880
This angle in the floor here--
well, this angle in the floor

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.850
is about 60, probably
actually is exactly 60.

01:11:57.850 --> 01:11:59.900
This is an equilateral triangle.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:04.720
So if this thing is very flat,
this angle will be almost 300

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.250
because it's 360 minus 60.

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:15.360
It'll be a little bit less
than 300 but almost 300.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.950
These matter.

01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:21.060
In particular, the
total sum of angles

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:26.210
here is 300 plus twice
90, which is big.

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:28.170
It's bigger than 360.

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:28.960
That's the point.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.420
In fact, 300 plus one
of these angles, 90,

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:38.260
would be almost 390,
which is way above 360.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.991
So this has negative curvature,
and even if you cut out

01:12:40.991 --> 01:12:42.740
one of the spike
triangles, it would still

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.480
have negative curvature.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.032
That's going to be bad
news because let's just

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:49.990
imagine for the moment.

01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:51.605
We know unfolding
things with boundary

01:12:51.605 --> 01:12:54.960
is hard, but let's pretend
for now that you wanted

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.340
to unfold a hat in isolation.

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:01.610
You wanted to unfold it into
one piece without overlap.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:04.480
Think about what you could do.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.110
I have to cut with
a spanning forest,

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:12.260
I guess, meaning
it's acyclic, it's

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.030
got to hit all the vertices.

01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:16.410
There's only four vertices here.

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:19.500
How could I hit all the
vertices with a forest?

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.420
You may recall from way back
when that trees have leaves.

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:25.460
Every tree has at
least two leaves.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:28.337
Here I might have multiple
trees, maybe, but unlikely,

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.920
and I have to have
at least to leaves.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.150
Where could those two leaves be?

01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:35.500
Could they be at any leaves
or vertices at degree one?

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.472
Could they be at any of
these three vertices?

01:13:38.472 --> 01:13:40.180
No, because they have
negative curvature.

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.905
We know a vertex with
negative curvature

01:13:41.905 --> 01:13:43.780
has to have at least
two cuts incident to it.

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:46.960
You can't stop at
these three vertices.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.030
That only leaves one
vertex and the boundary.

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:53.510
So the only thing
you can do if you

01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:56.050
want to visit all the
vertices and start somewhere

01:13:56.050 --> 01:13:58.640
on the boundary and get
to the x, get to the peak.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.350
That's all you can do.

01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:08.600
You couldn't have multiple
connections to the boundary

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.780
because then you
would disconnect.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.340
Then there's really
only two choices

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:16.480
and they're
reflectionally symmetric.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.310
And we're only allowed
to go along edges.

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:19.760
It's super constrained.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.870
You can go here, walk
around, and go up,

01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:24.309
or you can walk around
the other way and go up.

01:14:24.309 --> 01:14:26.350
Those are actually slightly
different because you

01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:29.280
have two choices of which
edge to follow here.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.240
They're both screwed
because if you

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.540
look at this point, the
white dot, or the white dot

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.610
up there, what remains
here on the outside

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:44.230
is almost 300 degrees
of material on the base

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.840
plus one of the 90 degree
faces, the back one

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.910
that you can't see.

01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:49.320
It's easier to see here.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.200
You have the 300
degrees on the bottom

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.630
and then the white face
is still attached to it,

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:57.415
and that's almost 390.

01:14:57.415 --> 01:14:58.790
When you flatten
that thing, it's

01:14:58.790 --> 01:15:01.650
going to overlap
itself at that point.

01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:03.020
Bad news.

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:05.810
So this just says, if I
look at a hat in isolation,

01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:08.510
it can't unfold, but that's
not what I care about.

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:10.720
I care about four of
them joined together.

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:19.550
Suppose you had some
unfolding of the whole thing,

01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:21.290
and then I look
at, well, what cuts

01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:27.090
happen within the witch's hat?

01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:29.364
I know the witch's hat
cannot remain in one piece.

01:15:29.364 --> 01:15:30.780
Therefore, it must
be disconnected

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:35.100
into multiple pieces,
something like this.

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:45.050
Again, the cuts have to visit
all the vertices somehow,

01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:48.320
but we know from the
perspective of a single hat,

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.590
that hat must split
into two parts.

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:54.430
There are lots of things
you could consider.

01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:57.300
Let's suppose this is
possible, not even worry

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.540
about these kinds of pictures.

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:02.255
Well, I claim we have a problem.

01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:28.395
Here's a tetrahedron.

01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:34.394
These vertices are all
the same point, actually.

01:16:34.394 --> 01:16:35.810
I've just unfolded
the tetrahedron

01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:37.893
because it's way easier
to draw in two dimensions.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:46.670
So if I look at the hat
that is on this triangle,

01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:49.070
this hat gets disconnected
into two parts.

01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:51.090
There's only three
connection points

01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:52.300
to the rest of the world.

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.890
So what these pictures
have to look like is they

01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:59.266
connect two of the vertices
by a collection of cuts.

01:16:59.266 --> 01:17:00.890
If you're going to
cut into two halves,

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:03.380
you've got to have
a path across,

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:08.150
and there's only three
vertices to visit.

01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:10.026
There's some collection
of cuts that go from,

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:11.608
let's say, this
vertex to this vertex.

01:17:11.608 --> 01:17:13.440
At this point,
everything's symmetric.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.689
Maybe it would be more obvious
if I started the center.

01:17:16.689 --> 01:17:18.230
It could be from
here to there, could

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:20.771
be from here to there or from
here to there, but at least one

01:17:20.771 --> 01:17:23.880
of those things exist,
and by rotational symmetry

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:27.990
of this diagram,
say it's that one.

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:30.540
Well, what happens to this face?

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.780
Could there be
something like this?

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:36.170
No, because then this
would be disconnected

01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:38.480
from the rest of the world.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.720
So suddenly, this
hat is constrained.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.890
Maybe it could look like this.

01:17:43.890 --> 01:17:44.640
You have a choice.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.392
It could look like
that or like that,

01:17:46.392 --> 01:17:48.100
but by reflectional
symmetry, same thing.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.740
So let's say this one.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:53.100
Remember, x is the
same everywhere.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:56.280
Well, that means
this is impossible

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.420
because this edge is
actually glued to this edge,

01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:01.440
and so then this thing
would be disconnected

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.220
from the rest of the world.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.280
So there's a couple
of possibilities.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.880
It could look like this,
or it could look like this.

01:18:12.417 --> 01:18:14.000
It was one of those
two for this face.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
We've got one face left.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:23.190
This is impossible because
this edge glues to this one,

01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:26.070
so imagine this thing being
picked up and moved over here.

01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:28.615
So we have a wiggly line
here and then this stuff,

01:18:28.615 --> 01:18:29.990
and so that would
be disconnected

01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:33.660
from the rest of the world,
so that can't happen.

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.660
What about this one?

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:38.340
Is that the harder one?

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.322
I don't know.

01:18:41.322 --> 01:18:43.280
It's been a while since
I've used the argument.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.200
If we have this
together with this,

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.010
that's clearly bad because
that forms a cycle.

01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:50.290
No good.

01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:52.430
But what if I have this
together with this one?

01:18:57.377 --> 01:18:58.210
It gets hard to see.

01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:03.110
It's bad.

01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.990
It's a cycle.

01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:08.370
It starts and ends at x,
and if you fold it up right,

01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:10.470
you'll see there's really
two sides to that cycle.

01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:13.550
It's actually forced,
so that's bad.

01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:19.380
All right, one more
choice, this one.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.394
If I do this together
with this one,

01:19:22.394 --> 01:19:24.310
that's going to be bad
because that's a cycle.

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:27.360
We start and end at x.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.930
What if I do this
one and that one?

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.430
Well, that's also
bad because here's

01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:33.880
a cycle that starts
at x, ends at x.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.540
This and this form the
inner of the cycle.

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:42.595
All cases are bad,
so no edge unfolding.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.910
Tragic.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.680
We can think briefly about
the case-- do I have time?

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.720
I have 10 seconds.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.960
About the case where
there are two triangles.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.960
I guess I should
draw them like this.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.276
So this point is the
same as this point.

01:20:05.276 --> 01:20:07.650
So if I try to simplify this,
instead of using four hats,

01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:10.220
I just use two hats,
put one here, one here.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:16.060
Then I could do something
like this, I think,

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:20.530
and maybe that's OK if
there's no cycle formed there.

01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:23.240
So we really needed the
tetrahedron somehow.

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.080
I think it does work for
octahedron and larger also,

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.610
but just two triangles
is not enough.

01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:32.875
And that is unfolding.

01:20:32.875 --> 01:20:37.080
We did not always edge foldable
for general polyhedra, even

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.127
topologically convex polyhedra.

01:20:39.127 --> 01:20:41.210
Next time, we'll talk more
about general unfolding

01:20:41.210 --> 01:20:43.440
of arbitrary polyhedra.
