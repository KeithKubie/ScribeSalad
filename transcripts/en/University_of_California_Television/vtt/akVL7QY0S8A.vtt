00:00:01.494 --> 00:00:04.244
(dramatic music)

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.050
- I'm Mary Ann Mason,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.568
I'm the Dean of the Graduate Division,

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:39.010
and I'm pleased, along
with the Graduate Council,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.740
to present Elizabeth Warren,
who is this year's speaker

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.810
in the Jefferson Memorial Lecture series.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.990
As a condition of this bequest,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.460
we're obligated to tell
you how the endowment

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.830
supporting the lectures
came to UC Berkeley.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.500
The Jefferson Memorial Lectures
were established in 1944

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.580
through a bequest from
Elizabeth Bonestell,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.200
and her husband, Cutler L. Bonestell.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.300
A prominent San Francisco couple,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.820
the Bonestells cared deeply for history,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.670
and had hoped that the lectures
would encourage students,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.275
faculty, visiting scholars and others

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:16.610
to study the legacy of Thomas Jefferson

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.960
and to explore the values
inherent in American democracy.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.700
Past lecturers, Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.560
Senator Alan Simpson,
Representative Thomas Foley,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.710
Walter LaFeber and
Archibald Cox have delivered

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.840
Jefferson Memorial Lectures
on early American history

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.310
about Jefferson himself and
on American institutions

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.880
and policies in economics,
education and the law.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.260
And now a few words
about Elizabeth Warren.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.650
One of America's leading
commentators on consumer issues

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.630
and the law, Elizabeth Warren
has been an outspoken critic

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.870
of America's credit economy,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.580
which she has linked to the
continuing rise in bankruptcy

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.160
among the middle class.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.930
No one in the audience, I'm sure.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.770
Her critical analysis of
Congress's latest revision

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.040
of America's national bankruptcy law

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.530
has received wide attention in the media

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.440
as well as in academic and policy circles.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.260
At Harvard Law School,
Warren's courses include

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.730
contract law, bankruptcy
and commercial law.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.240
She said recently that
she has spent decades

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.430
writing in academic books and
teaching an entire generation

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.130
of law students about the rules of money.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.960
Those rules include the formal
statutes of commercial law,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.560
the policies inherent in them,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.500
and the ethical problems
that they can produce.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.630
Warren is a frequent
contributor to articles in

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.828
The New York Times, The Washington Post,

00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:41.500
and Women's eNews, and her
commentary appears regularly

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.840
on National Public Radio's news program,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.390
All Things Considered,

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.320
and on the internet forum,
The Huffington Post.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.580
After earning a BS from the
University of Houston in 1970,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.990
Warren was awarded a J.D.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.660
from Rutgers University-Newark in 1976.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.130
She joined the faculty of
Harvard University in 1992

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.330
and has served as the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.680
Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law since 1995.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.530
Prior to Harvard, Warren taught at

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.370
the University of Pennsylvania Law School,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.770
the University of Texas Law School,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.560
the University of Houston Law Center,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.150
the University of Michigan,
and Rutgers School of Law.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.830
Warren has channeled her
expertise in commercial law

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.100
into numerous other
professional activities.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.510
She acted as chief adviser

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.610
to the National Bankruptcy
Review Commission

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.160
from 1995 to '97.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.760
She served three terms on

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.600
the Federal Judicial Center Committee

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.190
on Judicial Education, 1990 to '99,

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.680
and since 1995, Warren has
been the United States advisor

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.260
to the Transnational Insolvency Project.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.120
In presenting its nomination
of Professor Warren

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.370
for the lectureship,
the selection committee

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.930
spoke of Warren's
prominence as a commentator

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.520
in public discourse on bankruptcy
and other consumer issues.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.920
A scholar of great originality

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.870
and insight into commercial
law and a law teacher

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.520
and lecturer of exceptional distinction.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.550
According to committee
chair Harry N. Scheiber,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.837
the Riesenfeld Professor
of Law and History,

00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:07.037
"At a time when the social safety net

00:04:07.037 --> 00:04:09.787
"is no longer taken for
granted by Americans,

00:04:09.787 --> 00:04:11.727
"its unremitting attack in Washington

00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:13.637
"and many state capitals,

00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:15.687
"Elizabeth Warren's unique importance

00:04:15.687 --> 00:04:17.717
"as a researcher and writer,

00:04:17.717 --> 00:04:19.947
"concerned with changing
income distribution

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:22.977
"and the imperiled condition
of the nation's social welfare

00:04:22.977 --> 00:04:25.337
"makes this lecture one
of special importance

00:04:25.337 --> 00:04:27.220
"to the campus community."

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.847
I should say personally that
I read her book last year,

00:04:29.847 --> 00:04:31.440
"The Two-Income Trap",

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.580
and I would put it among my very favorites

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.410
of policy books that both made sense

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.100
and are going to change policy.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.710
So it gives me very great pleasure

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.647
to welcome Elizabeth Warren.

00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:44.814
(audience applauding)

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.300
- Thank you, Dean Mason.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.920
Thank you, members of
the Berkeley faculty,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.240
Berkeley students and Berkeley friends.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.890
It's an honor to be invited
to give the Jefferson Lecture,

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.580
especially following the footsteps

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.136
of such esteemed people.

00:05:12.136 --> 00:05:15.020
And it's also a particular
pleasure to be here.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.480
I appreciate the hospitality,
it has been extraordinary,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.010
and the good weather,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.900
since I was on a plane
that had to be de-iced

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.443
before it could take off,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.580
it really does seem that
I've landed in heaven.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.150
So it's a special treat to be here today.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.480
I want to say,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.497
I like to talk about the
things that I care about

00:05:37.497 --> 00:05:39.620
and that I'm passionate about,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.820
and I only get nervous about the fact that

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.420
I may not tell you all the
things that I want to make sure

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.803
that you know and I may
not be able to say it

00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:50.020
as clearly or distinctly,

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.216
because I want you to hear these things,

00:05:52.216 --> 00:05:55.590
but today, I feel a special anxiety

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.630
as I get ready to do this because
the only two conversations

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.420
that I have had running
throughout the day today

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.463
have been how appalling
it is to use PowerPoints,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.700
and about boring lectures and
falling asleep during them.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.700
So having my confidence
boosted before I came in here,

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:19.823
I will approach this somewhat gingerly.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.213
What I wanted to talk about
today is I wanted to start

00:06:25.213 --> 00:06:30.213
by talking about what I
think is the single most

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:35.060
important economic
shift of the second half

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.170
of the 20th century in the United States,

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.700
and that is that millions of mothers

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.103
poured into the full-time paid workforce.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.817
A woman in 1970

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.850
who had a 16 year old child

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.110
was less likely to be in the workforce

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.340
than a woman in 2003

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.810
who had a six month old child at home.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.600
It was a profound shift in America.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.500
The median family in America,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.600
a married couple family in America,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.450
went over a 30-year
period, median, middle,

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.600
from being a one-income household
to a two-income household,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.780
a significant shift.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.600
And so if we had known,
let's say, 30 years ago,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.710
35 years ago, we've been
sitting here in 1970,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.330
and as part of the Jefferson Lecture,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.107
I'd had my crystal ball and I'd said,

00:07:44.107 --> 00:07:48.067
"Here's what's going to
happen over the next 30 years.

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.077
"Mothers are going to
pour into the workforce,

00:07:50.077 --> 00:07:51.637
"take on full-time work,

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.127
"they're gonna get better education,

00:07:53.127 --> 00:07:54.407
"they're gonna have more work experience,

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:55.757
"their incomes are going to rise.

00:07:55.757 --> 00:07:57.717
"They won't get all the
way to where men are,

00:07:57.717 --> 00:08:00.090
"but they're gonna make
substantial advances."

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.050
Now let's speculate on what
the family will look like

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:08.050
30 years hence, that
is, in 2000, 2005, 2007.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.170
Well the first thing
I would have estimated

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.320
is that people would
stop living in suburbs

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.200
that are far out.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.680
I would have guessed
everyone would live close in,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.110
that no mother of a six month old child

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.120
would commute an hour
and 40 minutes to work.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.690
I would have been, of course,

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.730
very wrong in that first estimate.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.360
The second thing I would
have guessed is that families

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.933
will be very wealthy.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.563
They're going to have
lots of savings, no debt,

00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:40.710
and plenty of vacations, right?

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.369
If you've got two people in the workforce,

00:08:42.369 --> 00:08:44.410
there's gonna be a lot of extra income.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.280
They're gonna be secure,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.270
there won't be a lot of bankruptcy,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.210
there won't be a lot of default,

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.100
nobody's gonna be dealing
with debt collectors,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.340
that's what it's gonna
look like come the new era.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.800
So let's see what happened.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.210
This is all inflation adjusted,

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.043
everything I'm gonna do today

00:08:59.043 --> 00:09:00.620
is gonna be inflation adjusted,

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.700
so we can just make that
assumption as we go forward.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.900
This is what happened to median
income for married families

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.600
and this is gonna be my period

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.590
to the extent the data permitted.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.887
It's basically gonna be one
generation, 1970 to 1971,

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.054
to 2005, 2006.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.810
What happened in a single generation,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.320
from your mom and dad to you, okay,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.970
is what we're talking about here.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.870
And you see how income
goes up for families.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.500
But there was an underlying message

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.260
that was not nearly so good,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.410
and that is income went
up for married couples,

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.540
but the green line, the one underneath,

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.210
you notice that income for
males, fully employed males,

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.250
in fact, didn't rise at all.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.960
And if you actually look at the numbers,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.690
a fully employed male today,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.910
once we had adjusted for inflation,

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.910
makes about $800 less than his
father made a generation ago,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.290
talking about median earners here.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.040
Okay, so what that begins to tell us

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.070
is the first part of the
story, family income rose,

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.080
but as I said, it was rising only

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.030
because women were going
into the workforce.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:16.030
In other words, the bump
we got is not a bump

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.820
on top of the bump we were getting

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.210
because men were also earning
more over this period of time

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.790
as they had been in the
seven years that preceded,

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.250
but is a bump that comes only because

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.750
they put a second worker
into the workforce.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.110
All right, but my prediction
should still hold.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.410
After all, families are getting richer

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.923
in the sense of more income over time.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.480
What happened?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.800
Savings went down in
this same time period.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.180
So the one-income family
in 1970 was putting away

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.400
about 11% of their take-home pay.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.830
Think about it, week after
week, month after month,

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.060
they're putting away about 11%.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:59.060
By the year 2006, you notice
the line goes below zero.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.830
This is a concept only
Alan Greenspan would love,

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.340
negative savings.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.810
The American family
today puts away nothing,

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.950
and frankly has been putting away nothing

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.000
for the last five or six years.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.760
There's nothing there,
there is no savings.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.440
So savings didn't go
up the way I predicted.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.070
Oh, but something went up,
and that's revolving debt.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.040
I picked revolving debt,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.270
I could have picked any of them,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.850
revolving debt just
basically means credit cards

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.490
where you can carry a balance outstanding.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.700
We could have picked consumer debt,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.970
which would also include
car loans and payday loans

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.350
and a few other kinds of debt,

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.183
we could have included mortgage,

00:11:40.183 --> 00:11:43.040
and we would have gotten
much the same picture.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.460
Revolving debt is a
percentage of annual income.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.010
Notice there's supposed to be
some decimal points in there

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.000
that aren't showing up very well,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.400
I don't know what happened in
the translation of the program

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.020
but basically in 1970, the
median family in America

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:02.020
was carrying about 1.4%
of its annual income

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.280
in revolving debt, store charges.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.939
So there was a tiny little
fraction on average.

00:12:08.939 --> 00:12:13.939
By the year 2005, the median
family is carrying about 15%

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:18.750
of its annual income in revolving debt,

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.050
okay, just true there at the average.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:25.130
So savings have gone down,
revolving debt has gone up,

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.210
and it gives us this picture,

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.390
if we put the whole thing together here.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.070
And that is the left side, 1972,

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.270
the family, blue, is saving 11%

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.933
and carrying debt about 1.4%.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.360
By the year 2005, is
carrying credit card debt

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.040
equal to one in every seven
dollars that it earns, 15.6%,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.650
and its savings rate is negative,
eight tenths of a percent.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:55.650
So think about what that means.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.970
That means, over the last 30
years, in terms of a shift,

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.760
the family spent everything
that mom's income

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.060
added to the family fisc,

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.760
spent everything they used to save,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.000
that 11% that they used to put away,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.700
and went into debt another
15% of income on top of that.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.843
They spent it all.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.400
Now, whoops, I'll do it a little faster,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.460
what did they spend it on?

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.580
This was the question that really drove me

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.446
in my research over the last few years.

00:13:29.446 --> 00:13:30.980
Where do they spend the money?

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.040
Because what's interesting here is that

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.710
everybody has an answer on this one.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.080
People can tell me exactly
what they spent it on,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.080
people are sure, and so
I started to find out.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.490
The federal government has
actually been keeping data

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.540
on how Americans spend their money.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.480
This is done through
the Commerce Department,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.313
large parts of this,

00:13:52.313 --> 00:13:54.010
and some of it's due to
the Labor Department,

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.530
they've been keeping this
for more than a century

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:01.530
so that you can look at data
on canned meat consumption

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.520
going back to the late
1800s and early 1900s.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.830
You can check out alcohol consumption,

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.130
you can check out cracker consumption,

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.370
it's not all about food,

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.440
it's about cars and rugs and furniture

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.170
and all sorts of things
that the government has been

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.370
collecting data on.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.910
So I found this source for all the data,

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.710
right down the bottom in that list,

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.973
I don't know what the type
is called, like .01 type,

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.870
it tells what the government office is

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.780
that's responsible for this
and if you have any questions,

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.023
what you're looking for, so
glory be to the internet,

00:14:36.023 --> 00:14:40.080
found a phone number and
found a live human being who,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.560
and I started trying to ask about

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.950
how you could stabilize this stuff,

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:43.810
and look at it over time,

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.090
we all understand how you
could do inflation adjustment,

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.767
he said something about,
I said something that,

00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:51.987
"Can you disaggregate this so
that you can look at families

00:14:51.987 --> 00:14:54.470
"matched for family size?"

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.280
That's really the question here.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.897
And the guy said, "Well", he said,

00:14:59.897 --> 00:15:03.867
"I guess if you cared,
I could run the data."

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:09.310
And, all of a sudden, my little
heart starts beating faster

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.617
and I'm panting into the phone and I said,

00:15:11.617 --> 00:15:13.230
"You can actually run the data?"

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.063
And he said, "Yeah."

00:15:14.063 --> 00:15:16.120
He said, "What kind of family
do you want to look at?"

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.260
And I said, "I want to look
at a mom, dad and two kids",

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.640
because we have such variations,

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.643
there's so many more one
person family households now

00:15:23.643 --> 00:15:26.970
and variations, "I want to look
at a mom, dad and two kids."

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.049
That will help me stabilize both on age

00:15:29.049 --> 00:15:31.377
and family composition.

00:15:31.377 --> 00:15:34.957
"I want to look at a mom, dad
and two kids in the 1970s,

00:15:34.957 --> 00:15:39.827
"1970, 1971, and I want to
look at a mom, dad and two kids

00:15:39.827 --> 00:15:42.760
"in 2003", and I'm trying
to gather these data,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.760
and I want to compare them.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.670
We lump together some expenses,

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.120
and I want to be able to
compare them over time,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.220
we'll adjust for inflation,

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.040
and figure out how much
more people are spending.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.050
He said, "Great."

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.417
So he said, "What's the
first one you want to do?

00:15:53.417 --> 00:15:54.250
"What's the first run?"

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.110
Because you gotta test this stuff out see

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.517
to see if you're getting it
right, and I said, "Clothes,

00:15:57.517 --> 00:15:59.480
"how much money are people
spending on clothes today?"

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.603
Because all I ever hear about
our designer toddler outfits,

00:16:04.816 --> 00:16:09.598
the Gap, $200 sneakers,

00:16:09.598 --> 00:16:12.010
all of the fancy things that people are

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.910
spending on themselves and
their children in terms of,

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.230
we have a closet full, and look,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.730
I think this is probably why.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.710
I can't get a parking place at the mall.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.470
All the dressing rooms are always full.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.981
So it must be that we're
spending too much on clothing.

00:16:25.981 --> 00:16:29.880
So he calls me back when
he gets the first data runs

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.910
and emails them and he says, "Okay",

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.240
he said, "I've got your number."

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.350
And I said, "Good, what's the number?"

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.680
And he said, "32%."

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.800
And I said, "So they're
spending 32% more?"

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.857
And he said, "No, they're
spending 32% less today

00:16:42.857 --> 00:16:44.810
"than they spent a generation ago",

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.490
in inflation adjusted dollars.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.770
And of course, it's like
one of these things,

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.540
the first, I have to tell
you, this is really awful,

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.430
the first eight times I talked with him

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.270
after he gave me this one, I
knew he had the numbers wrong.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.720
Finally, we ran this six
different ways 'til Christmas,

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.180
I finally believe that
the numbers were right,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.550
and then we start to thinking,

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.940
well, you know, it makes sense.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.080
Everybody shops at discount today,

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.260
nobody pays full price
in a department store,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.080
we import a lot more of our
clothes than we used to,

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.780
men don't wear expensive
suits, except for my husband,

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.520
people don't wear leather shoes,

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.360
little children wear sandals
and go barefoot a lot,

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.870
on and on and on.

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:26.058
And so the numbers hold that
clothing expenses for a family

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:26.891
climbed up to 32%.

00:17:26.891 --> 00:17:29.120
So, okay, food, let's do food,

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.840
and let's be sure to put in eating out,

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.810
because we all know with
mom not at home anymore,

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.850
it's gotta be that families
are spending a fortune

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.690
on eating out, and besides that,

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.146
in 1972, nobody ate kiwis,

00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:43.830
and nobody paid for water, right?

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.248
And my grandparents would
be appalled by this, right?

00:17:47.248 --> 00:17:51.270
So how much more is today's
family spending on food

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.710
than they spent a generation ago?

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.700
Same sort of matching,
including eating out,

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.950
and the answer is they're
spending 18% less on food

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.253
than they spent a generation ago.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:07.183
And once again, welcome to
the world of big-box stores

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.010
where people are buying
on very thin margins,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.690
supermarkets, people eat a lot more pasta

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.410
and they eat a lot less
meat than they used to,

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.750
there are lots of reasons
that it's actually gone down

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.220
in terms of what we spend on food.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.570
Okay, so, I'm beginning
to get the hang of this,

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.357
I said, "Appliances, nobody
had an espresso machine

00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:28.817
"a generation ago, nobody had
a separate popcorn popper,

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:30.020
"no one had a microwave oven."

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.730
And by the way, for each of these,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.070
one of the fun parts of
being able to do research,

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.030
can't do this in a lecture,

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.810
you can't burden the lecture with this,

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.863
but it's to get all the quotes,

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.810
to get Robert Frank and Julie
Scherer and all these people

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.080
who are explaining why Americans

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.630
are in so much financial trouble,

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.390
and each time of course
they're explaining about

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.940
how much we spend on clothing,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.520
how much we're spending on food,

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.070
and how much we're spending on appliances.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.230
So yeah, just in your own
mind, pack all those in.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.050
And of course, you know where I'm going.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:03.050
52% less on appliances than
they spent a generation ago.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.700
And you get the rest of the pattern.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.778
Per car average, yeah,
we can talk about SUVs,

00:19:09.778 --> 00:19:14.580
the size of a living room
and Corinthian leather

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.237
or whatever it is you think,

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.160
with televisions in the back,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.810
the reality is the per car
cost of owning a car in America

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.660
has gone down 24% in 30 years.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.100
Principle reason for it,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.830
Americans today keep a car
more than two years longer

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.250
than they kept it 30 years ago,

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.000
and repair costs have
dropped significantly.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.320
So the per car, this is
what people really spend,

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.230
not what they projected might have spent,

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.800
have gone down dramatically.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.900
Whoop, I'm getting a little fast here.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.603
So the question is,

00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:49.670
it's a little trigger-happy
with this thing,

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.580
so the question is if all
those things went down,

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.000
if clothing and food and
appliances and cars went down,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.330
and by the way, I could and a lot of this

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.820
with a lot more consumer goods,

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.820
electronics went up, surprise,
surprise, 300 bucks, okay?

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.454
Dog food went up, baby food went down,

00:20:08.454 --> 00:20:12.860
cigarettes went down, liquor
went up, we should watch that,

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.480
dry cleaning went down.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.340
The point is there's
either wash or a negative

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.940
in terms of kind of ordinary consumption,

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.830
the idea that we are an
over-consuming society,

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.670
what most people talk about
when they're consuming.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.480
So where is the family spending more money

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.890
than they spent a generation ago?

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.200
Well, let's start with a
three-bedroom, one-bath house,

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.283
that the median income
family is paying for.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.300
And there it is, inflation
adjusted dollars,

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:48.300
a 76% increase in what a
family spends on a mortgage.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.577
That's the mortgage payment,
month in, month out.

00:20:51.577 --> 00:20:52.950
Now think about that.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:57.080
We have much lower mortgage
rates than we had 30 years ago,

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.140
for those of you who are
old enough to remember,

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.520
but the difference is when
you take out a mortgage

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.130
for much more money, the low interest rate

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.210
will not make up for that difference.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.610
And I want to emphasize here,

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.820
the median sized house that
we're talking about here

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.280
did grow slightly in this period.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.280
It grew from 5.8 rooms to 6.1 rooms.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.300
So this is not about, and on average,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.870
this family, this median family either

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.030
picked up a second bathroom
or a third bedroom,

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.113
but not both.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.487
So for those of you who want to say,

00:21:35.487 --> 00:21:38.200
"Oh but I've driven by the McMansions",

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.007
"everybody has to have granite
countertops and spa bathrooms

00:21:42.007 --> 00:21:43.547
"and media rooms, I've seen them,

00:21:43.547 --> 00:21:44.950
"I've seen them, I've seen them",

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.370
and compare that with Levittown,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.120
which is more than 30 years ago,

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.080
but to give the idea, all that tells us

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.130
is that the new housing market has shifted

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.000
from the entry level house,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.070
which is what was being built
in the 1950s and 1960s to,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.490
on average, when you
buy a new house today,

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.400
it is your third to fourth house purchase,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.080
that is, you've moved up and moved up

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.050
until you can afford this bigger house,

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.036
in other words, housing is not being built

00:22:12.036 --> 00:22:14.330
for 70% of American families,

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.200
it's being built for the top
20% of American families,

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.310
that's what we see when we see

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.320
the new construction that's underway.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.040
For the average family today,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.680
they are about 50% more
likely to be in a house

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.570
more than 25 years old

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.100
and have all of the attendant
expenses for maintenance,

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.650
but just looking at the
mortgage, 76% more for a mortgage

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.790
than they had a generation ago.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.650
Okay, well what's the next
one they spent money on?

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.040
Health insurance.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.133
This is my family that's healthy.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.160
And my family, because
I've loaded the dice here,

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.520
that's lucky enough to have an employer

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.250
who sponsors health insurance,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.220
so I'm gonna make an
apples-to-apples comparison

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.760
of employer-sponsored health insurance,

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.350
how much more two does today's family pay?

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:08.120
And the answer is they pay 74%
in inflation adjusted dollars

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.940
more than they did a generation ago.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.920
Third one, cars, increase of 52%.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.480
Okay, Warren, how did you get cars

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.120
both above the line and below the line?

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.033
Well, I teach commercial
law, but the answer is,

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:25.510
the median family with two
people in the workforce

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.400
has moved from being a one-car family

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.230
to being a two-car family.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.590
Families living out in the suburbs,

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.311
even if they keep a parent at home

00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:34.827
can't get by on one car much of the time,

00:23:34.827 --> 00:23:36.570
they've got to have two cars

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.580
in order to be able to get to the doctor,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.580
to be able to get to the grocery store.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.730
So families spend more
because they have more cars

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.640
than they used to have.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.020
Fourth-biggest, remember, I've
got my mom, dad and two kids

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.460
and of course the big difference was

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.070
mom was at home a generation ago,

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.100
today she is out in the
workforce is childcare.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.110
Now I put childcare at a 100% increase.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.920
In fact, you may remember from third grade

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.730
that you can't divide by zero,

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.390
so I could have picked 1,000% or 1%,

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.760
or whatever I wanted to pick here,

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.840
it is a new expense picked
up by the two-income family

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.710
that was simply not there
for the one-income family.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.890
And we have one more
expense, and it's taxes.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.990
What's happened with taxes is
that progressive tax system,

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.850
as mildly progressive as it is,

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.560
the first dollar that the
second earner earns is taxed

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.240
after the last dollar of the first earner,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.710
so it means that the tax
rate for this economic unit

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:39.380
has gone out by about 25%
in this period of time.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.040
Okay, so there it is, downs and ups.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.990
And I hope there are two
things you notice about

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.470
the downs and ups.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:50.950
The first one is the downs
frankly are all smaller purchases

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.090
than the ups are, and that's bad news.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:58.280
And the second is the downs
are all flexible purchases,

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.010
that is, lose your job, get sick,

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.476
have a tough month with various expenses,

00:25:04.476 --> 00:25:06.070
you cut back on the downs,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.851
don't buy appliances this month,

00:25:07.851 --> 00:25:10.470
cut back on food, it's
not that you quit eating,

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:11.740
but you know, there's a difference between

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.640
macaroni and cheese and steak.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.960
Families have flexibility in
all the things that shrunk,

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.900
they shrunk the things
where flexibility is,

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.220
but look at those other expenses,

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.600
those other expenses are big,
fixed, relentless expenses.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.240
And so this gets to what I think of

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.240
as the heart of what my research
is about up to this point

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.870
and that is what these families look like,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.365
and I do look at this the
way a commercial lawyer does,

00:25:38.365 --> 00:25:40.550
if this were a little business,

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.490
what these families look at.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:47.370
The single income family
back in the early 1970s

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:48.600
earned less money,

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.370
that's the first thing
you'll notice here, right?

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.813
They're making about $32,000.

00:25:52.813 --> 00:25:56.070
This is all inflation
adjusted dollars again.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.550
And you notice, of course,

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.430
they're making a whole lot more money,

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.702
making about $63,000,

00:26:01.702 --> 00:26:04.303
about $73,000 in the early 2000s.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.650
But notice those five
expenses that I gave you

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.560
on the preceding chart,
that's the part that's in red.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.540
The early family is spending
right at half its income

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.270
on these big fixed expenses,

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.350
these expenses that are
very difficult to cut down,

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.193
to trim back, to cope with.

00:26:26.035 --> 00:26:29.550
And that family, by the early 2000s,

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.500
has committed three
quarters of their income

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.500
in order to meet those
five basic expenses.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:43.530
In fact, you'll notice the math
we've done here, the family,

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.870
the two-income family,
the mom, dad and two kids,

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.670
the prototype of the family
that's supposed to be

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.330
working in America,

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.830
the one that's supposed
to be making it all,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.373
by the time they pay
their five basic expenses,

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:01.830
they have less money left
over, fewer total dollars,

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.073
than their one-income
parents had a generation ago.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.810
And now from the point of view
of a commercial law scholar,

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.140
if I were simply looking at
them and these were businesses,

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.830
this is, Business A is on the the far side

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.500
and Business B is on the
near side, I'd say, well,

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.050
Business B is gonna go
broke a lot more often

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.970
than Business A because they
have so much less flexibility,

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.495
so much more debt, they're
much more deeply leveraged,

00:27:28.495 --> 00:27:31.630
and they're gonna have more
of a harder time economically.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:36.630
And in fact, that's about what's
happened to these families.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:41.150
So there's the heart, now I
want to shift this a little bit

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.650
to say that's the economics
of what's happened.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:45.020
We've seen it on the income side,

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.447
we've seen what happened
on the expense side,

00:27:46.447 --> 00:27:49.280
and we've seen what it did
to the American budget,

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.710
how it changed and made this
a riskier economic unit,

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.420
but now what I want to do
is I want to press on how

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:01.420
this family in the 2000s
faces in fact even more risk

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.410
than these numbers suggest.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.100
All right, first part,
let's think about it

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.670
from the income side.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:12.670
The family of the early 2000s
now has to have two incomes

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.100
in order to keep its health insurance,

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.393
to make its house payment,
to keep its cars on the road.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.390
That means, just statistically speaking,

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:28.470
if the risk of losing your job
had stayed exactly the same

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.820
over the last generation,
the family on the right

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.230
has twice the risk of
the family on the left

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.540
of not being able to make
the mortgage payment.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.820
Yes, they've diversified,
they won't go to zero,

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.790
but the point is, they won't have enough

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.760
to make the mortgage payment.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.330
So what we've got now
is we've got families

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.210
who don't have to bring in 52 checks

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.450
in order to be able to make
the monthly mortgage payment,

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.730
they got to bring in 104.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:59.200
And if either of them loses their job,

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.430
they don't make the mortgage payment,

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.270
they're flat out of luck.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.610
Let me say this another way,

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.300
'cause I want to give it one more twist.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.310
The family on the left has
has a hidden resource here.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.740
They have another worker,
the added worker effect.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.420
If dad, and that's how it
usually was, loses his job

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.490
or has a heart attack and can't
go to work for three months,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.520
the family on the left has
somebody they can send in

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.670
to the workforce.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.500
Now she doesn't make as
much money as she does

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.710
by the year 2000,

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.890
she doesn't have as much education,

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.060
she doesn't have as much
on-the-job training,

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.440
but, and here's the key,

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.450
every dollar she earns is a new dollar.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.350
It's an unbudgeted
dollar that was not part

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.880
of what they originally had.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.680
So for example, the family on the left

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.910
that collects unemployment insurance,

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.060
combined with the additional
income that mom can bring in

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.340
for a temporary period of employment,

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.490
they got a chance, they'll go down some,

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.870
but they got a chance to pull through

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.360
and come back up on the other side.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.240
The family on the right,
if something goes wrong,

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.090
there's no place to go,

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.020
they've already got their
other person not only at work

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.330
but already fully budgeted,

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.940
they've already given up that income fully

00:30:07.226 --> 00:30:09.100
in order to survive.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.710
But the risk of losing your job,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.400
the risk of losing
income didn't stay steady

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.500
between the early 1970s and today.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.690
I draw here on Jacob Hacker's work,

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.680
some of you may be familiar
with it, "The Great Risk Shift".

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.080
What Jacob has done in this has looked at

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.080
a family's chance of a 20%
or greater drop in income.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.180
And he starts back in 1970,

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.560
Jacob is a good friend and
will stick with the same years

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.410
I want to go with, and he goes up to 2003,

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.080
and you notice how income volatility

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.140
has gone up in this period of time.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.186
So now we've got that family,

00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:56.890
not only struggling because
they got to have 104 paychecks,

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.830
struggling because the
odds that one of them

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.110
will be laid off has
gone up from where it was

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.040
a generation ago.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.120
Okay, so that's where they
are on the income side,

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.340
in terms of risk.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.960
This is risk this little unit has to bear.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.629
Let's think about health.

00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:13.430
Okay, same argument I
could make as before.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.750
They now have double the chance

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.390
that someone will be in a car accident,

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.520
one of their two workers,

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.020
and won't be able to go
to work and therefore

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.600
make enough money to
pay a mortgage payment,

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.870
but this family now faces additional risks

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:29.460
on the health side as well.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.990
What additional risks do they face?

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.670
Well, I'll pop forward to one,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.630
and that is the increased odds

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.693
that they won't have health insurance.

00:31:37.693 --> 00:31:41.300
Those odds have gone up
over the past 20 years,

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.970
but the ones I like to think about,

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:43.900
I keep coming back to this one

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.730
because it's my favorite slide,

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.000
the ones I like to think about

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.350
are that the world of healthcare
has changed in 30 years.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.720
So let me just give you an example.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.450
In 1971, a woman who was healthy

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.300
and gave birth to a healthy baby,

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.194
ordinary delivery, non-cesarean,

00:32:00.194 --> 00:32:02.986
stayed in the hospital for five days

00:32:02.986 --> 00:32:05.280
after the day the baby was born,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.410
that's what insurance paid for,

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.790
that's what the hospital expected.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:09.200
You could go home earlier if you wanted to

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.400
but you're entitled to
five days in the hospital.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.370
If you had a cesarean, 10,

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.063
that you got to stay in 1971.

00:32:15.063 --> 00:32:18.580
And you know what the numbers are in 2006?

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.372
24 hours, okay?

00:32:20.372 --> 00:32:23.260
24 hours, and keep in
mind, in some places,

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.070
that's by legislation,

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.170
because they were trying
to push them out faster.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:31.170
How have we made gains
in hospital efficiency

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:32.530
over the past 30 years?

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.030
You send home the sick people.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.340
It really works, there is a policy,

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.060
we never want to talk about
this in the United States,

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.400
it's known in the trade,
in the hospital trade,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.623
is send them home quicker and sicker.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:51.400
They save money by letting the
family provide nursing care

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.480
instead of having the hospital,

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.810
so you still have your
surgery done at the hospital,

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:59.550
but it's the family that will
take care of you post-surgery.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:04.550
And so today we witness the
spectacle of my mother-in-law,

00:33:06.395 --> 00:33:10.450
a woman in her 80s where
someone's trying to explain to her

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.490
how it is that she can wash a tube

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.270
and rinse things out and give injections,

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.860
my sister-in-law was just asked to do this

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.980
when my brother had some surgery,

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.160
we're gonna train the family to take care,

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.130
only they're both at work.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.830
And the consequence of this
means that for these families

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.280
with everybody in the
workforce, somebody gets sick,

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.290
you just take off work,

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:35.970
'cause somebody's gonna
have to take care of them,

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.490
somebody's gonna have to
'cause you're not gonna get

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.920
this extra period of nursing care.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.350
It's just another way
to give one more push.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.570
How about if a kid gets sick, a child?

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.460
I mean something really serious,

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.720
grandma falls and breaks a hip.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.120
A generation ago, there
was someone at home

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.640
to provide that nursing care,

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.580
for that extra eight
weeks that grandma needed

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.150
some extra help.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.820
Today, the illness of a family member

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.790
has a direct income impact for people

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.820
who aren't lucky enough
to have jobs that pay you

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.450
even when you're not at work.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:10.300
So the consequence is we
end up with these families,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.650
the child gets sick,

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:14.710
I read these stories over and
over in my bankruptcy files,

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.670
the child gets sick,

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.470
mom stays at the hospital with the child

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:19.713
until she loses her job.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:24.360
There are income effects
now from any illness

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.420
anywhere in the family.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.100
So we end up with a family
once again bearing more risk

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.491
that someone will get sick,

00:34:33.491 --> 00:34:36.051
and we can just keep multiplying this.

00:34:36.051 --> 00:34:38.520
What are the odds of spending $10,000

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.690
in an emergency room today

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.860
compared to spending
$10,000 in an emergency room

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.455
a generation ago?

00:34:43.455 --> 00:34:45.610
One more that I just have to mention

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.500
that we can't quantify
yet but I'm watching it

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.650
is that insurance itself has changed

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.372
in terms of how much of the medical cost

00:34:53.372 --> 00:34:55.660
is actually covered.

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.930
We now have floating around in America,

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.270
I just, I don't know what else to call it

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.010
except faux insurance,

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.470
people who think they're insured

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.890
until they actually get sick
and need their insurance

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.140
and it turns out that, well,

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.030
yeah, you have insurance,

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.400
I love the Utah policy that our

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.750
Secretary of Health Education and Welfare

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.797
comes out and says, "I got
everybody in Utah insured,

00:35:19.797 --> 00:35:22.922
"except it doesn't cover hospitalization.

00:35:22.922 --> 00:35:24.258
(audience laughing)

00:35:24.258 --> 00:35:26.008
"And it doesn't cover specialists."

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:27.967
And you call that,

00:35:27.967 --> 00:35:29.780
and of course, it doesn't
cover prescription drugs,

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.240
and it doesn't cover
supplies and it doesn't,

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.200
there's more than it doesn't
cover than it does cover.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.223
So all of this is being
pushed back on the family.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.010
So let me take one more twist on it,

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.350
so we've got changes in jobs,
changes in health insurance,

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:46.300
changes to healthcare,

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.000
what it cost to do health and care,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.260
and I just want to put
one more tweak into it

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.480
and that is to talk
about the special risks

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.570
facing families with children.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.583
I've made this my iconic family,

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.592
but I want to make two points
about the iconic family here,

00:36:02.592 --> 00:36:06.250
the mom, dad and two kids.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.930
This is how it works for
mom, dad and two kids.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:12.760
Think how it works for
either a mom and two kids

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.523
or a dad and two kids.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.480
They are now competing,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.563
I actually met a woman, it
was a wonderful exchange,

00:36:20.563 --> 00:36:23.677
I was sitting on an airplane
right after the book came out,

00:36:23.677 --> 00:36:25.470
"The Two-Income Trap"
and I had it on my lap

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.503
and this woman next to me said,
"Have you read that book?"

00:36:27.503 --> 00:36:30.500
(audience laughing)
And I said, "Mm-hmm."

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.820
And she said, "I'm a divorced mother",

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:34.880
and she said, "I'm an accountant."

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.337
She said, "I make a good income,

00:36:36.337 --> 00:36:39.240
"I make above a median income
in the United States today."

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.127
She said, "I could make it,
I could support my two kids

00:36:42.127 --> 00:36:44.273
"on what I get for child support.

00:36:45.517 --> 00:36:47.937
"I could do it if I were only competing

00:36:47.937 --> 00:36:50.477
"against other one-income households,

00:36:50.477 --> 00:36:53.647
"for the basics, for
housing, for healthcare,

00:36:53.647 --> 00:36:55.300
"for all the things we're buying."

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.570
But she said, "I'm competing
against two-income households."

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.680
And she said, "I just can't do it."

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.690
She said, "I can't hang
on, I can't make it."

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.560
So that's the first
part I want you to see,

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.290
the one-income family
gets the lower income,

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.120
still faces high expenses,
still wants the house

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.390
and so on and so forth, and
faces all the same risks

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:16.130
with no one to back up and
provide that second income,

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.930
but I want to step forward
to say something else

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.780
about families with children and that is

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.500
this goes back to Hacker's work,

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.820
percentage increase in
volatility by family type

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.940
from 1970 to 2003.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.650
And notice what Hacker points out here.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.180
For those of you can't read the wording

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.900
all the way over to the far side,

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.170
green is single without children,

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.620
that's how much income volatility,

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.600
and look, that's substantial
income volatility

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.410
that we've got there, in the high 30s.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:51.670
Single with children, a little above 40%.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:55.230
Married without children, you
get about a 70% volatility.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:59.400
And married with children
pushes up to about 95%

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.300
increase in volatility
over the past generation.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.400
Now, are families struggling with this?

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.300
Well, let me show you some of my data.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.260
Oh, not my data, government data,

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.146
I never know what the
next slide is going to be,

00:38:12.146 --> 00:38:14.250
keeps me on my toes.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.980
The next one is to disaggregate

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.500
a little bit more about housing,

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.490
we talked just a little
bit about it before.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:20.520
This is one of those charts,

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.290
it doesn't fit perfectly
with what I'm talking about

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:24.030
because the years aren't quite right,

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.360
this is some government data I found.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.600
Only goes back to 1983,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.500
but notice what it shows, that
increase in housing costs,

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.150
what families are paying for mortgages,

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.970
not my part in general,

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.640
they've done it the other way around,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.530
what they're paying for the house itself,

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.360
what the cost of the house is.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:47.180
We saw a 50% increase among
the families with no children,

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.870
inflation adjusted and what housing costs,

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:52.530
but you notice among
families with children,

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.230
it's 100% increase,

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.930
a full 100% increase in
inflation adjusted dollars

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.960
for what a home costs for
families with children.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.683
Now we're gonna save plenty
of time here for Q and A

00:39:02.683 --> 00:39:04.210
because I think that's more fun

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.780
than having to listen to a lecture,

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.930
but I'll tell you at least
how I read this chart.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:10.430
Families are going to schools.

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.860
People without children
don't have to buy schools,

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.330
and so they buy from
a wider pool of homes,

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.130
they can look at a lot of homes
in a lot of neighborhoods.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.100
Families with children are
buying what they believe

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.010
is a shrinking resource, that is,

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.120
places where you can have
decent public schools

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.850
and send your children to public schools.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.335
And in fact, we can triangulate
these data in other ways,

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:32.986
so that you'll love this.

00:39:32.986 --> 00:39:35.760
I wonder, I was gonna it's
gonna say it would happen

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.970
only outside Boston,

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:38.860
but I bet it also
happens outside Berkeley,

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.360
we just have the data outside Boston,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:46.360
a five point increase in
third grade reading scores

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.710
between two side-by-side municipalities

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:55.360
in the Boston suburbs that are
otherwise matched for access

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.230
to public transportation
and size of houses,

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:58.360
they've measured for everything,

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:02.410
sidewalks, crime rates,
racial composition,

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.440
everything you want to look at,

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.970
five points in third grade reading scores

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.350
translates into tens of thousands
of dollars of difference

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.760
in housing prices.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.053
Parents are buying schools.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.550
There was a great one out of San Diego,

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.050
study out of San Diego,

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:18.830
where they were having
parents do preferences

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:19.663
on where they buy,

00:40:19.663 --> 00:40:23.393
parents would rather
live near a toxic dump

00:40:23.393 --> 00:40:25.700
than live in a place where they thought

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.240
the schools were underperforming,

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.640
where they thought their
children would not have

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.250
as good a chance in school,
and I think that's what we're,

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.240
that's a large part of
what we're seeing here.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.647
So parents say, "I've gotta
have those good schools,

00:40:35.647 --> 00:40:40.517
"I gotta get out there, I gotta
push, I gotta get forward."

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.920
They're spending more
as we've talked about,

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.590
so what happens to them
when they push this hard?

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.560
Well, there comes in
just a little touch of

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.990
what I want to talk about
with the safety net.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.650
What's happened to the American safety net

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:59.340
for these families?

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.930
Well, the first part is
the personal safety net,

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.070
the part you build yourself.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.340
We've already looked at the data on that.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.670
Less savings, more debt,

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:09.830
more people without health insurance

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.489
than we've ever had before.

00:41:11.489 --> 00:41:13.460
And by the way, I should
make a point on this,

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.310
more people without health insurance,

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.840
it's really been important to see here

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.190
how much lack of health
insurance in the 1970s,

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:25.184
the typical modal uninsured person

00:41:25.184 --> 00:41:30.184
was an unmarried male, no
children, 23 years old.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.490
Today, modal is a 35
year old married person

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.600
with two children, has
no health insurance,

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.030
this is the largest group
when you start looking

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.810
at the groups who have
no health insurance.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.810
In 2001,

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.810
1.4 million people lost
their health insurance.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.760
Of those, 800,000 earned
more than $75,000 a year,

00:41:59.788 --> 00:42:03.980
that is moved from the
insured to the uninsured ranks

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.150
that we have data for.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.790
So what we're starting to see is

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.540
people who have no health insurance,

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.580
the people who've lost that
part of their safety net

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.816
are increasingly among
in the middle class.

00:42:13.816 --> 00:42:16.990
We could pick some
others that shift between

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:21.250
the defined benefit plan and
the defined contribution plan,

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:24.980
for those of you who who keep
up with the pension lingo.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.450
What it basically means is the shift

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:32.140
so that you put in money,
and you take the risk

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.780
of how long you'll live, that is,

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.320
whether or not you'll outlive your money

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.627
versus the defined benefit plan which is

00:42:38.627 --> 00:42:41.020
you get a certain amount until you die.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.860
We've moved very much to
the former from the latter,

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.430
so you have a real chance to outlive.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.770
Those are on the personal side.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:51.830
If you take a look on the public side,

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:55.630
we've had the same kind of
erosion of the safety net,

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:59.300
and that is unemployment benefits

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.870
no longer is a proportion of income,

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:05.240
are nearly as high as
they were 30 years ago,

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.690
so they're not providing
the same kind of safety.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:12.880
I would make a pitch that what
we pay for public education

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.360
to launch our children
into the middle class

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.080
has eroded sharply.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.870
And I'll make the pitch this way,

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:21.280
I'm giving you lots of different pieces

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.263
that we can talk about here,
but here's the way it goes.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.960
In 1970, it took 12
years to educate a child

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.820
to go forward into the middle class.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.653
How do I know that?

00:43:32.653 --> 00:43:35.870
I know that from looking
at Gallup polling data

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:38.190
about what parents
thought it took to make it

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:39.270
in the middle class.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:42.170
And the answer was a high school diploma,

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.270
a good work ethic,

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:45.360
there were parents who
believed in college,

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.380
but they believed that you could make it

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.510
in the middle class with
a high school diploma

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:51.890
and a willingness to work hard.

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.240
Roll that forward to the year 2002,

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:58.170
here's a great number for you,

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:02.160
twice as many people in America by 2002

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.093
believe that the moon
shot landing was faked,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.723
and they filmed in Burbank, California,

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.180
than believe you can make
it into the middle class

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.523
in America without a college diploma.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:24.420
Americans who differ on
everything have adopted wholesale

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:29.170
in a single generation that
there is a single ticket

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:32.940
to the middle class, and
that is a college diploma.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.390
Now, all by itself, would
I be opposed to this?

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.223
Are you kidding?

00:44:36.223 --> 00:44:39.840
I'm in the education biz,
I think this is fabulous.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.020
Everyone should go to college,

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.724
my dog should get a college education,

00:44:42.724 --> 00:44:46.890
I'm for college educations,
I think that's terrific.

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.900
The difference is when you
look at middle class families,

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:54.900
if you needed 12 years back
in 1970, taxpayer paid for it.

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:56.860
You got it all for free.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.833
All you had to do was show
up, live there and show up.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:04.700
By the year 2000, if you
need a college diploma,

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.190
you've gotta pay for it
yourself, by and short.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.320
Berkeley, other state supported schools,

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.013
I guess that means you guys
are not paying any tuition?

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.630
Room, board, books, right?

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:15.910
It's not very much,

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.030
I guess you borrowed maybe a dollar or two

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:20.280
in order to do this,

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.340
but notice what that means,

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.530
it means the launch, what
the parents have to do

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:29.850
to get this next generation in
the middle class has shifted

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.030
from being something
that everybody pays for,

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:33.800
the taxpayer pays for,

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.500
to something only the families
with children are paying for.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.950
I'll make the same point, by the way,

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:41.143
on the other end of
the education spectrum.

00:45:42.068 --> 00:45:44.280
In 1970, I actually went
back and looked at this data,

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.830
it surprised me, almost no one

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.213
sent their children to preschool.

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.180
And in fact, if you go
back and read the articles,

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.400
you read Dr. Spock from
the 1970s editions,

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.410
1960s, 1970s editions,

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:58.770
they can play with the
neighborhood children,

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:02.820
they'll be fine, and only a tiny fraction

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.300
of American children are in preschool.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.234
Today, it's totally flipped.

00:46:08.234 --> 00:46:12.340
Basically through all the education folks,

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.870
early childhood specialists,
they are completely in for

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:17.233
children under two years have preschool.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.610
And once again, who pays for
the two years of preschool?

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:24.600
It's paid for by the family.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.120
So one way you could look at this

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.900
is in the space of a generation,

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.280
we went from 12 years being
enough to push that kid forward

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.370
to adding two more years, that's 14,

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:37.820
and four more years, that's
18 years of education

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.870
in order to push those kids forward,

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:43.260
only the difference now
is the family privately

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.890
pays for a third of the
education themselves.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.620
And we could have some great fun

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.403
with what the education costs.

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.950
Recently, it's been about three years ago,

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:58.879
Chicago, city of Chicago
publicly supported

00:46:58.879 --> 00:47:03.745
preschool programs, there was
already some tax dollars in it

00:47:03.745 --> 00:47:05.000
but the parents had to pay tuition.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.900
I always loved this one,
the tuition was larger

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.691
than the tuition at the
University of Illinois.

00:47:10.691 --> 00:47:12.940
That's what the parents were
supposed to come up with

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.630
to put their three year
old into the system

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:18.240
that was gonna get them the education

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.140
that was gonna get them
ultimately launched

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.073
into the middle class.

00:47:22.073 --> 00:47:26.030
So in that sense, we shrink
part of what's available

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:27.960
to support families with children

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.360
so that they can move forward,

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.560
so they can launch this next generation.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.410
So how have families responded to this?

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:34.910
This is where I said I'll come to

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.930
at least a little bit of my data here.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.693
Let me tell you about bankruptcy.

00:47:39.615 --> 00:47:42.210
What's happened with bankruptcy?

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:43.150
What this one's about,

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.630
I'll tell you what the
bright colors on here,

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:49.390
this is about bankruptcy
filing rates per thousand

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:50.823
in the population.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:55.564
And this is in 200 and 2001,

00:47:55.564 --> 00:47:59.020
I love this data, it's
got 2003 on these data.

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.110
Married couples are the
far one in the light blue,

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:07.100
about 7.4 married couples
per 1,000 married couples,

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.403
so each is being within their own group,

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.040
filed for bankruptcy.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.300
Unmarried men, about 6.3 per 1,000.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:20.650
Unmarried women, about 7.2 per 1,000.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.740
But the trick here for
all three of these groups

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.240
is they are all childless groups.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.110
So I've got them, all you've
got them in their graphics,

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.850
they're couples, men,
men alone, women alone,

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.440
and none of them have children.

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.300
These are the bankruptcy filing
rates in the United States

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.220
in the early 2000s.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.593
Now let's add in children.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:47.020
Turquoise, again, is married couples,

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.080
only this time with children.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.793
It's jumped, the filing rate
has jumped to 15 per 1,000,

00:48:53.793 --> 00:48:57.410
and among women heads of household,

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.080
no husband in the household,

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.920
it has jumped to 23 per 1,000.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.880
You notice by the way,
unmarried men with children

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.140
fall out statistically
because there aren't enough

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.590
to be able to say something
that's statistically valid

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.540
about what's going on here.

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:16.540
So what this one tells me is
that families with children

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.720
are under enormous financial stress.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.790
I watch them, I study them
from the bankruptcy end

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:26.180
of the spectrum which
is where they end up,

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.880
and let me tell you a little bit about

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.240
why they file for bankruptcy.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:35.240
90% of those families file
for one of three reasons;

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:40.430
Job loss, medical problem in the family,

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.680
sometimes the wage
earner, sometimes a child,

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:46.270
or family breakup, either
a death in the family

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:47.790
or a divorce in the family.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:50.100
In fact, nearly half the families

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.820
have at least two of those three,

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:57.023
and about 20% have been
hit by three out of three.

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.860
That's how it is that
they end up in bankruptcy.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:05.050
Now let me give you an idea
of what these numbers mean

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.250
so I can put it in a little
bit different context.

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:10.160
These families that are
filing for bankruptcy,

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.160
families with children,
more children live in homes

00:50:15.217 --> 00:50:19.610
that will file for bankruptcy this year

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.623
than live in homes that
will file for divorce.

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:25.870
That is, there are more
children in America,

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:29.180
and this has been true by
the way since the late 1990s,

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.750
every year, more children
are going through

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:35.430
their parents' bankruptcy
than are going through

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:36.740
their parents' divorce.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.610
So let me say that to you a different way.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.300
You know anybody who
got divorced any time,

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.093
say in the last six or seven years,

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.880
you know some children who live in homes

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.733
where mom and dad have split up,

00:50:48.826 --> 00:50:52.510
then you, statistically
speaking, know more,

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:55.040
random cross-sections of America,

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.660
you know more who went bankrupt.

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.200
Why do you think you don't
know more that went bankrupt?

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.850
And that's because you can't hide divorce,

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.730
but you can sure hide bankruptcy.

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:05.653
And that's what people have done.

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:08.220
There's an enormous stigma

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.430
attached to filing for bankruptcy.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:13.070
When we interviewed the families

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.360
who had filed for
bankruptcy, quite frankly,

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:19.640
I was shameless about
this, we paid them $50

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.610
if they would take extensive
telephone surveys for us

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:27.530
about bankruptcy, and so we
got very high response rates,

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.000
but one of the key things
we learned early on

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.537
is that people would
say, "Don't use the word,

00:51:33.537 --> 00:51:35.677
"partly because I can't bear to hear it,

00:51:35.677 --> 00:51:37.737
"and partly because I'm
afraid the child will pick up

00:51:37.737 --> 00:51:40.487
"an extension phone, or
someone will walk into the room

00:51:40.487 --> 00:51:45.487
"and hear me say it, and we
don't want anyone to know."

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:49.530
About 85% of the families that
were filing for bankruptcy

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:54.100
were hiding it from their own
parents, from their siblings,

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.470
from their best friends,
and in some cases,

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:57.670
from their own children.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.950
Many of them said they had other stories.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:03.950
Yeah, they were giving up the house,

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:06.070
and moving in with Bob's mom

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:08.763
because Bob's mom's health was not good.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.337
Yeah, that's a story you can tell.

00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:13.617
"We're moving across country

00:52:13.617 --> 00:52:15.930
"because there are better
job opportunities."

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:18.260
Yeah, they're moving across country

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.500
hoping they can get a job,

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:24.380
but going to live in rather
reduced circumstances.

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.724
So those are the families who
are filing for bankruptcy,

00:52:27.724 --> 00:52:31.230
in part, the reflection of what's happened

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.920
to this safety net.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.261
So I just want to wrap this up

00:52:34.261 --> 00:52:36.910
and open it up for some
questions and answers

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:41.600
because I just want to make
three or four big points

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.180
at the end here about about
what we're talking about

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.700
with these families in financial trouble.

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:50.283
First I want to make is
a point about the poor.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:55.605
I've hammered on the middle
class over and over and over,

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:59.600
and I've done it because for
everybody who cares about

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.710
poor families in America,

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:04.580
you should be riveted on these data.

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:08.880
Middle class families under
enormous economic stress

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.583
have fewer resources to give

00:53:10.583 --> 00:53:12.380
when we talk about how it is

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.690
that we're going to help the poor.

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:18.580
More importantly, they frankly
have less appetite to give,

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.690
when they see themselves
as already stretched,

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:23.170
when they see themselves
facing foreclosure notices

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:26.670
and bill collectors, they back off.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:30.680
And more critically, a middle
class that looks like this,

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.460
a middle class where people are
falling out and into poverty

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:38.750
is a middle class that has
less room to bring the poor up

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:41.990
and provide them the opportunities
to join the middle class.

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:44.010
I think people who talk
about the intractability

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.870
of poverty now are absolutely right,

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:50.230
there are social issues
far beyond my expertise,

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:53.513
but this is an element of it
that no one's talking about.

00:53:53.513 --> 00:53:56.480
There's no place for the poor to go,

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.460
and not much help coming
from the middle class today

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.443
compared with even a generation ago.

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:03.713
The second point I want to make about

00:54:03.713 --> 00:54:06.163
what these data speak to me about

00:54:06.163 --> 00:54:10.190
is that I fear we're moving
from a three class society

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:11.813
to a two class society.

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:16.846
America has always been
sort of one of those

00:54:16.846 --> 00:54:20.900
perfect distributions,
some poor, some rich,

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:25.150
and a big, big solid middle class

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:27.660
stuck right there in the middle.

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.403
Americans identify with the middle class,

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.120
it affects our democracy,

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.300
it's part of what gives us
our political stability,

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.000
it's what affects our economy
and drives our economy,

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.670
it affects our self-identity,

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:41.738
it affects who we are in this world,

00:54:41.738 --> 00:54:43.500
but I fear that what's happening

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.470
and what these data are about

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:48.950
is that we actually are gonna
see a larger upper class.

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:53.900
We're seeing, not just the rich
rich, but the sort of rich,

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:57.840
the ones who have the same
jobs, bringing in two incomes,

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.270
who don't get sick, who don't lose a job,

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:03.037
who in that income volatility,

00:55:03.037 --> 00:55:05.130
and the things that go
wrong in the medical world,

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:07.940
who don't divorce, who don't
have a death in the family,

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.780
who don't hit any of life's bumps,

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:12.500
they stay with the upper group.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.840
They put away some savings,

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:17.122
they don't get deep in debt, they do okay,

00:55:17.122 --> 00:55:22.122
and then the rest is just
one long trail of underclass

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:25.610
that stays on a constant debt treadmill.

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:26.770
Sometimes it's a little more,

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.740
sometimes it's a little
less, but never out of debt,

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.050
never any real economic security.

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:33.660
I could change my metaphors,

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:35.230
people who are just costantly living

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:36.820
on the edge of a clif,

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:40.500
some falling over, some
scratching back up a little,

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:43.840
but never with the kind of security

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:47.560
that for the first three
quarters of a century,

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:51.280
were associated with being middle class.

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.570
I worry about what that means.

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:56.530
I worry that the middle class,

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:59.187
which used to mean solid and boring

00:55:59.187 --> 00:56:03.687
and not worth studying, only
worth making fun of, you know,

00:56:03.687 --> 00:56:07.373
"My parents were hopelessly
middle class", sort of remarks,

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:11.920
that that's kept us from seeing a problem

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.770
in the middle class that threatens

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:18.030
not just these families with
children that I've identified,

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:22.343
but really threatens the
fabric of our country.

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:26.393
We have a middle class today
that is newly weakened,

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:31.860
and I think what this means
is that it's time to realign

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:36.860
both our academic and our
political interests and alliances

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:40.390
to talk more about what's
happening to these families.

00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:41.610
So with that, I'm gonna quit,

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:44.485
and take as many questions as people have.

00:56:44.485 --> 00:56:47.617
(audience applauding)

00:56:47.617 --> 00:56:50.450
(dramatic music)
