COLIN LUALDI '17, Founder
of Princeton University ASL

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.090
Club (PUASL), voiced by
BRYON ROWE, Interpreter:

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.770
Honestly, when I was growing up,
I had no idea about Princeton.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.520
I remember, when I was
a junior in high school,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.430
I was making different trips.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.440
And we stopped to see Princeton
University for a visit.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.160
I really didn't know
anything about it.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.470
I looked around at
Princeton, and I said,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.480
I really love it here.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.000
It's really nice.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.090
BRIANA FREEMAN '16,
PUASL Member:

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.590
I became interested
in sign language

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.510
when I was like a little kid.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.210
My dad was a police officer,
and he had an ASL dictionary.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.330
Me and my sister found it,
and we were like, oh, we

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.250
should totally learn.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.150
This would be so cool.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.610
RAE PEREZ '19, PUASL Social
Chair: My mom is actually Deaf.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.080
And so I grew up with a
hearing dad and a Deaf mom.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.000
And that is somewhat
unusual in Deaf culture.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.220
DANIEL GIFT '17,
PUASL President:

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.520
So I think one of the things
that I didn't realize when

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.790
I first came here and first
started learning about sign

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.370
language was that it is a
distinct and unique language

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.840
with its own separate syntax
and grammar and all of that.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.510
EILEEN FORESTAL,
Lecturer in Linguistics

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.570
voiced by CRAIG
RIDGWAY, Interpreter:

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.010
I'm looking at the
students as ambassadors

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.850
for the Deaf community.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.390
ASL is a language, and they can
help to promote that concept.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.770
SARAH JANE LESLIE, Professor
and Director in Linguistics:

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.480
About a year ago,
I was approached,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.660
as the director of linguistics,
to consider putting together

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.640
a course on the
linguistics of ASL.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.480
The request came
through the Office

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.870
of the Dean of the College.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.240
But the impetus behind
it was, of course, Colin,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.900
who's been such a terrific
advocate for the Deaf community on campus.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.970
COLIN LUALDI, voiced by BRYON ROWE, Interpreter:
Deaf people tend to go to a new place --

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.100
the first thing that they do is
they look for a Deaf community

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.190
to get involved in
the Deaf community.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.610
They can develop
friends, and they

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.250
can socialize and communicate.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.710
That's how Deaf people do it.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.130
So if you went to
another country,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.670
you would meet Deaf
people, and you'd

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.130
begin communicating with
them as best you can.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.930
When I arrived here
at Princeton, there

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.370
was no Deaf community, so I
thought, what was I able to do?

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.080
So I would develop my
own community here.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.160
So I had think about how
I could actually do that.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.600
So I taught people
sign, established

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.600
an ASL club and different
activities and a social life.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.360
And this is my roommate.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.060
I remember how the
first day of school,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.280
when I actually met
Daniel, I looked at him

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.870
and I was like, wow, OK.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.350
He's a physics major as well.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.200
Cool. I'm a physics major.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.540
So that's great.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.910
And we didn't think anymore
about it after that.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.440
And then as things
went on, freshman year,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.950
he was learning to sign --
a little bit -- honestly,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.900
not so great.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.720
But then the second
year and the third year,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.370
living in the same room -- oh,
he has improved dramatically.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.740
His signing now is very fluent.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.520
It's very impressive.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.860
DANIEL GIFT: So in the
"Linguistics of ASL" class,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.280
we talked a bunch
about in some circles

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.030
today, sign languages are not
considered full languages,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.100
and that they have all
the aspects of a language.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.270
And so we've been
learning the details

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.940
of that, why that
is, how that is,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.360
in the "Linguistics of ASL" class.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.870
And it's been
really fascinating.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.140
EILEEN FORESTAL, voiced by
CRAIG RIDGWAY, Interpreter:

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.750
I was thrilled to
teach this course.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.710
It's really fascinating.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.320
It's a nice dynamic.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.500
And they're not
regular ASL users.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.210
Some know basic signs.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.900
 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.410
So I had to figure out
how to teach American Sign

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.140
Language and
linguistics to those

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.680
that aren't familiar with ASL.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.360
It is a challenge,
yet still fun.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.320
It's a great group.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.280
COLIN LUALDI voiced by
BRYON ROWE, Interpreter:

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.650
We have four or
five interpreters

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.100
that are very dedicated
in making sure

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.400
that I have full access here.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.110
And many of my classes, plus
also for other outside of class

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.070
activities, sometimes,
they're academically related.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.610
We have problem
solving meetings.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.790
Plus, there's also
social events.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.080
And they will interpret for me.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.640
Sometimes, interpreters are
there all day, sometimes

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.490
into the night.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.730
I have things that happen
later in the night.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.560
Even though the interpreters
are tired, they persevere.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.140
And I am very thankful for the
wonderful team of interpreters.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.640
ELIZABETH ERICKSON, Associate
Director, Disability Services:

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.300
We actually created a
SharePoint site on which Colin

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.090
is able to log in information
about the assignments,

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.980
when the dates are, how
many interpreters he needs,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.050
and everything pertaining to
that particular assignment.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.640
This then generates
an email that

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.620
goes out to select
interpreters, who

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.240
receive that invitation
for an assignment.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.330
And then they let me know
of their availability.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.770
RAE PEREZ: I met him
during Princeton Preview.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.460
And I remember being so
excited that there was a Deaf

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.730
person here and that I'd be able
to continue exploring the Deaf

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.830
identity through him and through
other students on campus.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.100
And going to the ASL
tables every Wednesday

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.520
and interacting with people
learning sign language, who

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.960
already know sign
language -- there's

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.080
a connection there, because
it's almost a part of back home

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.010
for me to talk to people
about Deaf culture

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.200
and in sign language.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.490
It's really interesting.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.100
BRIANA FREEMAN: So I think
learning ASL at Princeton

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.140
is completely independent of
how many Deaf students there

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.330
are at Princeton or if there are
any Deaf students at Princeton.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.970
I know I personally
am not learning

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.650
Japanese and Korean to
talk to fellow students

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.450
here necessarily,
though that is fun

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.430
and that's a great
way to learn more.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.390
COLIN LUALDI voiced by
BRYON ROWE, Interpreter:

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.220
Sometimes, people may
approach me and ask,

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.640
you're the only Deaf student
here at Princeton University,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.280
does that make you feel isolated
or a lack of language access

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.720
to communicate
with your friends?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.190
And I tell them, yes and no.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.080
Obviously, there is
a language barrier,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.610
because no one is able to
communicate in ASL fluently.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.730
So there's a little bit of
loneliness and isolation

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.880
with that, because it isn't
complete language access.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.230
I must admit that
it's not perfect.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.290
But at the same time,
I really feel satisfied

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.050
with my social life
here, because I've

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.230
met so many friends who
are really great people.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.410
And we've developed very
close friendships with them,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.660
and a really good connection.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.060
And that's very satisfying.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:07:08.950
