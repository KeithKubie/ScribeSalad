WOJTEK KALICINSKI: Choosing
the right tools for your app

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.010
development is more
important than ever.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.920
And as the Android
platform matured,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.640
so have our needs as developers.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.880
Making great apps
is so much easier

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.460
when you have a rich and
complete dev environment.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.100
And this was the driving
decision behind the creation

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.640
of Android Studio.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.620
I an Wojtek Kalicinski,
and I'm going

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.310
to show you why you should be
using this powerful new tool.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.740
Android Studio is
Google's official IDE

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.350
for Android development.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.400
We've combined a robust code
editor with an entirely new

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.640
build system based on Gradle.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.770
Let's talk about
the editor first.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.630
The Getting Started experience
is crucial for every app

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.660
developer.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.980
So in Android Studio,
we focus on making

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.180
it easy to create new projects,
as well as adding modules

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.770
to support Android TV,
Android Wear, Glass, and even

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.790
the Google Cloud backend.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.400
All you need this to use
one of the provided wizards,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.200
and the selected
modules will be added

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.640
to your project, along with
code templates that let you dive

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.500
into coding quickly.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.630
For those of you
coming from Eclipse,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.100
we've included a tool that lets
you import legacy projects.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.020
Not only will it create a new
Gradle build configuration

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.620
for your app and fix
your project structure

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.210
behind the scenes,
it also identifies

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.870
commonly used libraries and
brings them in as dependencies,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.320
eliminating the horrible process
of moving folders manually

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.260
and getting your build to work.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.660
If you just want to
check out our samples,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.570
there's now a one-click
solution to import them directly

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.590
from Google's
repository on GitHub

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.130
into a ready-to-build
and run project.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.940
One of my personal
favorites when

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.590
working with Android Studio
is the new Project View.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.250
It offers a flattened
representation of your project

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.350
structure, giving quick
access to code, resources,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.790
and build files.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.980
In fact, Android Studio will now
only list each resource once,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.790
regardless of which
configurations

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.970
like density or screen size
are included in your project.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.010
You can always expand
the resource node

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.060
and check out all its versions.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.040
When it comes to getting
things done and writing code,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.720
Android Studio helps
you to stay productive,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.860
while at the same time
making sure that you write

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.580
clean and error-free code.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.340
Apart from the usual
helpers you would

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.670
expect from your IDE, like
code completion and access

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.370
to documentation, we've added
powerful new code inspections

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.150
and refactorings, targeting
performance and compatibility.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.230
You can now easily extract
strings into resources,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.870
or even add right to left
support to all your layouts

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.080
with one click.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.950
To make sure you never again
press the wrong resource type

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.990
to a method, add one of these
annotations to its parameters.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.730
Many of the framework methods
are annotated as well,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.910
so Android Studio
will show an error

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.950
if it encounters, for
example, an RGB value where

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.660
a color resource is expected.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.330
Android Studio supports
your development flow,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.760
which includes working with
both Java and XML files.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.190
It's easy to switch between your
classes and relevant resources

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.470
by clicking this
icon, or Control

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.240
clicking any part of the
resource name in your code.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.470
You even got handy
previews of bitmaps

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.720
right there in
the Editor window.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.840
To get a quick look at
what your resource looks

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.850
like for different
configurations,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.480
or explore theme attributes
in the Layout Editor,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.530
use the Quick
Documentation View.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.570
You can access it by
pressing Control Q or F1,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.250
depending on your settings.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.220
For editing layouts,
there is the choice

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.540
of using the visual
design editor, where

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.800
you can drag and drop
views on to the Canvas

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.990
and manipulate their properties.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.390
Or if you prefer,
you can seamlessly

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.940
switch to editing XML files
directly and see the preview

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.240
update in real time.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.150
Android Studio will
alert you whenever

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.130
you forget to set the required
attribute on your views,

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.620
such as layout width or
height, and can even identify

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.790
common performance problems.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.840
If you want to see how
your layouts behave

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.410
on different screen sizes, or
if your translated strings fit

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.450
correctly in other
locales, you can

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.790
switch to multi-preview mode.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.910
This will show your
layout simultaneously,

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.330
side-by-side on multiple
device configurations.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.400
You can even look at how your
custom themes and styles behave

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.850
across Android versions,
which I have to say

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.150
is pretty useful when you're
targeting older devices.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.930
Oh, and by the way,
if you are thinking

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.100
of localizing your app, just
use the brand new translation

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.550
editor that we've created
to streamline this task.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.010
As always, our Android tools
are being built in the open.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.330
You can follow the progress
and get more information

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.630
at tools.android.com.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.520
If you haven't already done
so, download Android Studio

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.080
from the Android developer site.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.690
Also, be sure to follow
our Google + page,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.710
and join the Android
Tools community

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.120
for updates about new
features and releases.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.170
Tune into our next video in
the Android Studio DevBytes

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.530
series, where we'll take
a closer look at the new

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.210
build system based on Gradle.
