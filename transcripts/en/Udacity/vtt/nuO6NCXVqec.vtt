00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.148
So I already created our account
settings and created the campaign for

00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:06.477
customer acquisition: promo offer.

00:00:06.477 --> 00:00:10.986
And I started with our first ad group,
dog owners, because one of our main

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:14.625
goals was to increase traffic
of dog owners 5% monthly for

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.036
the next four months.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:19.121
You can see here in my AdWords
account we have dog owners,

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:22.608
which is under the customer
acquisition promo offer campaign.

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:24.268
So this is our first ad group.

00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:27.340
Then I want to create an ad, and
we need to enter in a headline.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.663
Let's talk about this.

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:32.268
For a headline, we're only going to have
25 characters to promote our product and

00:00:32.268 --> 00:00:34.728
service, so we really want to
grab people's attention.

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:38.310
And a good option here is to
include the keywords you've chosen.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.073
We're going to use luxury dog sitting.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.075
Next we have our display URL.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.769
Weâ€™re going to use abarkment.com.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.760
For the display URL, this is a web
address that will appear on your ad.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.963
This URL must match the domain people
will land on when they click on your ad.

00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:56.997
So if you want them to land on
a specific page of your website,

00:00:56.997 --> 00:01:00.506
you can still just use your homepage
like we did with aBARKment.com,

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:02.426
as long as it's the same domain name.

00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:04.043
Okay, let's go back to AdWords.

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:06.736
Next we're going to need to do
our description line one and

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:07.892
description line two.

00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:09.333
So let's talk about these.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.764
Description line one will be
below the display URL, or

00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:15.606
it will be displayed as
part of the headline.

00:01:15.606 --> 00:01:19.109
You have 35 characters to use
when attracting your customers.

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.223
Think about adding
a call to action here.

00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:23.806
And don't forget sometimes
the description line one and

00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:27.193
other parts of your ad can be seen along
with your headline if AdWords thinks

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:28.942
it's going to help you perform better.

00:01:28.942 --> 00:01:31.032
So don't just write this off.

00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:34.850
We're going to use get 15% off
your first booking as our first

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.107
description line.

00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:37.688
For description line two,

00:01:37.688 --> 00:01:41.963
the location of your ad dictates where
description line two will be seen.

00:01:41.963 --> 00:01:43.819
Let's look at the example they show us.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.125
So we're going to use your dog deserves
the best stay, and now we can see what

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:51.963
the ad will look like if it's a top or
bottom ad, or a side view ad.

00:01:51.963 --> 00:01:56.033
Now, I don't really like this top or
bottom view ad without any punctuation,

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.150
so I need to add that.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.313
Add a period here,

00:01:58.313 --> 00:02:02.396
and maybe get a little bit more
excited about our 15% off offer.

00:02:02.396 --> 00:02:04.330
Okay, so
that changes the layout of our ad.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.298
You can see the top and bottom ad,

00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:09.536
the description line one is
now equal to the headline.

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:12.195
And description line two is
at the bottom all by itself.

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:15.755
Now for a side ad, the description
line one is the first line.

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:17.582
And description line
two is the second line.

00:02:17.582 --> 00:02:20.496
So you can play around with this to
make sure you're happy with the way it

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:21.232
looks and feels.

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:24.796
And you can check out the sample
ads that Google offers to get some

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:25.664
inspiration.

00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:28.279
Now the fun part of this
is you really don't have to

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:32.028
kill yourself over finding the best
creative ad or wording for each ad.

00:02:32.028 --> 00:02:35.163
Yeah, you want to put some thought into
it, but each ad group is going to have

00:02:35.163 --> 00:02:37.813
a few different ads with a few
different versions of wording.

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:39.234
So you can launch your campaign and

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:41.491
start tracking the performance
of the different ads.

00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.479
This way, you'll be able to see which
messaging drove the most clicks and

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.875
had the most conversion
rates on your site.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:50.409
And you can always just delete
the least successful one.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.661
So we still need to
fill in our final URL.

00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:57.256
Our final URL is the website people
will reach when they click on your ad.

00:02:57.256 --> 00:02:58.993
So, this is your landing page.

00:02:58.993 --> 00:03:02.837
You're going to want to use a URL
that best matches the ad that

00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:04.287
you're promoting.

00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:07.935
So for us, we're going to use
a specific landing page for

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:12.554
our 15% off promo,
which is abarkment.com/welcome-promo.

00:03:12.554 --> 00:03:16.250
We can also see what our app will look
like on different mobile devices.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.286
Depending on the settings,
you chose for your ad group,

00:03:19.286 --> 00:03:22.588
if you have a mobile website you
can add in your url for mobile.

00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:25.020
It'll just take them to the mobile
version of your landing page.
