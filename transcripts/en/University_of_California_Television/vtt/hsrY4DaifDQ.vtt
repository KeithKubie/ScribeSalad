00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.500
- [Announcer] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large-brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.883
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.273
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.410
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.693
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
an exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.723
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.320
- I'd like to thank Tim and Pat

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.190
for inviting me to this
very interesting symposium,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.713
and of course, the entire
CARTA organization.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.710
Language coevolved with the human brain

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.310
throughout evolution of Homo sapiens.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.130
Writing, on the other hand,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520
which is actually what my topic is,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.450
is a relatively new technology
that was invented by humans

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.210
to translate spoken
language into a visual form

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.280
for the purpose of transmitting
verbal communication

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.093
broadly, to many people, over
large distances and time.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.720
As such, reading and writing can be

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.343
considered the first social media.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.140
Reading is an example of what's
called neuronal recycling,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.630
the recruitment of previously
evolved neural circuits

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.253
to accomplish cultural innovations.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.890
It's important to point out that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.220
while language develops
naturally in most humans,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.266
based on exposure rather
than explicit instruction,

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:48.710
reading and writing require
painstaking instruction

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.210
and years of practice
to reach proficiency.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.060
This slide shows the typical reading

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.300
brain network with its key components,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.210
as established initially in an older view

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.120
by studies of patients with
acquired brain lesions.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.920
And more recently, using modern
brain imaging technologies,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.653
we have a lot more information.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.230
This talk will trace the history

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.513
of the invention of writing,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.200
how English writing developed and ended up

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.120
with such a cockeyed spelling system,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.823
which leads in many cases to dyslexia,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.300
and discuss how modern technologies

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.123
are impacting reading and writing today.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.440
I'd like to begin with a brief overview

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.403
of the history of the
invention of writing.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.760
Writing is the physical
manifestation of a spoken language.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.660
It's thought that human beings
developed spoken language

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.487
about 35,000 BC, as evidenced by,

00:03:55.487 --> 00:03:56.850
(audible dissent from audience)

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.180
wow, yeah, by cave paintings

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.990
from the period of Cro-Magnon man.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.360
Writing numbers for the
purpose of record-keeping

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.240
began long before writing of language.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.540
Written language doesn't
emerge until the invention

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.540
in Sumer in Southern
Mesopotamia around 3500 BC.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.723
This writing system is
known as cuneiform writing.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.050
It's generally agreed that
true writing of language

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.990
was independently conceived and developed

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.020
by at least two ancient
civilizations, and possibly more.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.860
In Sumer, and also in Mesoamerica

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.423
by the Maya in 500 to 300 BC.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.950
Writing systems also arose
in Egypt around 3100 BC

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.750
and China around 1200 BC.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.340
But historians debate
whether these writing systems

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.880
were developed completely
independently of Sumerian writing,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.360
or whether either or both were inspired

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.993
by Sumerian writing by a
process of cultural diffusion.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.260
The Sumerian cuneiform writing system

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.790
was in use for more than three millennia,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.720
through several stages of development

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.700
as can be seen on this slide

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.460
by looking at the transformation

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.810
of the sign for head, SAG,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.623
beginning with pictograms in 3000 BC.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.550
Ultimately it was completely replaced

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.520
by alphabetic writing in the general sense

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.812
in the course of the Roman era.

00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:30.993
There are no cuneiform
writing systems in use today.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.260
While the development
of Phoenician alphabet

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.860
is often attributed to,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.561
of the phonetic alphabet is also

00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:42.350
often attributed to the Phoenicians,

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.600
they didn't actually
invent it or create it.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.820
Rather, they imported it
piecemeal from Egypt and Crete

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.510
and took it to every city
on the Mediterranean.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.010
By the time of Homer, the
Greeks were taking over

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.840
the Phoenician or Aramaic
alphabetic writing,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.030
and were calling it by the Semitic names

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.440
of the first two letter, alpha and beta.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.080
The Latin alphabet was established

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.483
by the Seventh Century BC.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.990
Before the invention of the printing press

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.990
in Europe around 1455, all books were

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.580
handwritten and usually highly decorated.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.130
Until about the 12th Century,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.710
the most elaborate and
beautiful illuminations

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.500
were devoted to religious works,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.210
and most manuscripts were
produced in monasteries.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.110
During the Middle Ages, the Latin alphabet

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.430
was used extensively
for writing in Europe.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.020
With the age of colonialism
and Christian evangelism,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.753
the Latin script spread
widely, well beyond Europe.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.230
I'd now like to change the focus

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.960
to the history of English writing,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.270
and explain how English writing ended up

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.440
with such a cockeyed spelling system

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.783
which leads in many cases to dyslexia.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.314
The English language
itself is a compilation

00:06:59.314 --> 00:07:01.800
of several different languages,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.740
mostly Anglo-Saxon, French, and Latin,

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.810
because England just kept getting invaded

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.500
by people who spoke different languages.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.260
The only thing we have in English

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.530
up until about 1400 are called patois.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.120
They're a clumsy peasant language

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.530
without any standardized writing system.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.320
There wasn't even a vocabulary

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.700
to carry on business in English.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.660
It was all done in French or Latin.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.110
However, when King Henry V took the throne

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.390
of England in 1412, he had
plans to invade France,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.760
so speaking French wasn't gonna work.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.590
He realized that if he wanted to get

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.580
support from the common people,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.680
they would have to change the language

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.693
of Parliament and business
from French to English.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.520
At this time the only people who could

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.170
write at all in England were just

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.140
a handful of men called chancery scribes,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.430
who wrote by hand and
almost exclusively in Latin.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.480
Latin has a transparent,
one-to-one correspondence

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.330
between the number of discreet
sounds, called phonemes,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.133
in spoken Latin, and how they're mapped

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:13.990
by the letters in the alphabet.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.980
As such, learning to read
Latin's a piece of cake.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.510
All you have to do is
learn the single letter

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.090
that goes with each phoneme in Latin,

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.333
and then just pronounce them
in order to produce words.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.034
King Henry V directed his chancery scribes

00:08:30.034 --> 00:08:32.771
to create a written version of English

00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:36.480
so that he could communicate
more broadly with his subjects.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.270
However, there was
little or no instruction

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.010
as to how they were supposed to do this.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.720
The problem they faced was that

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.470
the written Latin alphabet
was designed to represent

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:51.215
one-on-one each of the 23
phonemes in spoken Latin.

00:08:51.215 --> 00:08:56.215
It was never fit well for
English, which has 44 phonemes.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.740
For example, Latin didn't
have a SH, TH, or CH sound,

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.200
so with only 23 Latin letters,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.140
there was no letter to represent these

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.900
and many of the other 44 English phonemes.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.200
Faced with this problem,
the chancery scribes

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.820
just apparently made up
multiletter combinations

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.989
to represent these single phonemes.

00:09:19.989 --> 00:09:22.755
So, for example, on this slide,

00:09:22.755 --> 00:09:27.755
you could see that the letter string T-H-E

00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:31.810
pronounced phonetically should be te-hu-e.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.260
And S-H-E, sa-hu-e.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.660
So as many children are
told, just say those

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.260
and blend them together
quickly, and what do you get?

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.093
Sa-hu-e.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.490
In case you ever wondered how we

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.010
ended up with the nontransparent mapping

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.900
from spoken to written English

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.810
that leads so many children and people

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.010
learning English as a second language

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.480
to struggle to learn to read and spell,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.003
it all began here in the 15th Century.

00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:06.230
Nearly 600 years before Gutenberg,

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.260
Chinese monks were setting ink to paper

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.240
using a method known as block printing.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.400
What really set Gutenberg's
technology apart

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.150
from the Chinese was the development

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.950
of a press that could mechanize

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.563
the transfer of ink from
movable type to paper.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.830
For the first time in history
books could be mass-produced.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.270
Gutenberg's first major work, in 1454,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:36.270
was the 42-line Gutenberg
Bible, printed in Latin.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.990
With the invention of the printing press,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.150
printing soon became the first
means of mass communication.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.500
Really, the first social media.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.240
It put more knowledge in
the hands of more people,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.210
faster and more cheaply, than ever before.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.920
As a result, reading and writing,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.680
which up until that time was really

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.990
something done by a very
very small number of people,

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.983
spread widely and rapidly.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.590
Caxton brought the first printing press

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.590
from Bruges to London in 1476,
for the Canterbury Tales.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.100
With the advent of the printing press,

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.100
the complex and often cockeyed
spelling patterns for English

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.840
that remain to this day were solidified,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.250
giving rise to generation after generation

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.300
of children and adults
who struggled to learn

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.253
to read and write,
particularly in English.

00:11:29.184 --> 00:11:31.390
Let me acknowledge here that I'm

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.520
indebted to a wonderful website

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.840
which I highly recommend to you

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.723
called Children of the Code dot org.

00:11:38.623 --> 00:11:41.602
The website's creator, David Bolton,

00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:44.310
gained much of the
information by interviewing

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.570
scientists and anthropologists
for many years,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.420
and I've synthesized a
lot of that for this talk.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.180
I highly recommend that
you explore this website

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.660
for additional information on this

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.800
topic of reading and writing,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.800
the history of reading and
writing, and especially dyslexia.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.967
I quote from David Bolton,

00:12:02.967 --> 00:12:05.417
"There weren't any cognitive scientists

00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:07.577
"or neuroscientists or psychologists

00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:10.067
"or even child development
experts involved

00:12:10.067 --> 00:12:12.423
"in creating the English writing system.

00:12:13.487 --> 00:12:16.407
"There wasn't any concern for hundreds

00:12:16.407 --> 00:12:18.327
"of millions of children
who would struggle

00:12:18.327 --> 00:12:21.807
"since this code was
created in the 15th Century.

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:24.367
"There were just a small
number of chancery scribes

00:12:24.367 --> 00:12:26.117
"doing their very best to shove

00:12:26.117 --> 00:12:28.477
"a technology created for Latin

00:12:28.477 --> 00:12:32.670
"into a language it was
never designed for."

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.077
Those who eventually do manage
to overcome the confusion

00:12:36.077 --> 00:12:38.113
and learn how to break the code

00:12:38.113 --> 00:12:40.319
to become phonologically aware

00:12:40.319 --> 00:12:43.060
are able to use the areas of the brain

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.720
that reading has recycled
from speech and language,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.833
these areas here.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.773
Those who cannot break
this code become dyslexic.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.180
According to the United
States Department of Education

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.935
in 2017, more than 60 percent of U.S.

00:13:02.935 --> 00:13:06.850
K-12 schoolchildren are
reading below proficiency,

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.910
and more than 70 percent writing below

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.800
the level of proficiency
for that grade level.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.993
Let these stunning numbers sink in.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:22.440
Reading is a skill that matters
most to success in school,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.970
and children who fall behind in reading

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.610
are in great academic danger.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.180
But it's not just the
lack of reading skills

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.660
that most endanger these children.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.960
It's the collateral damage.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.170
It's their mind shame
that fates their future,

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.110
as seen on this video clip being shown

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.360
with permission of Children of the Code.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.397
- My teacher asked me to come

00:13:45.397 --> 00:13:47.710
to the front of the class and read a book,

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.300
and everybody was just staring at me

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.320
and I got real nervous

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.390
'cause I didn't wanna mess up or anything.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.690
And then when I started reading,

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.780
I started messing up, and
I should couldn't help it

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.540
and everybody started
laughing at me and stuff.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.980
- The teacher would ask
me to read something,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.610
and I would read it and
I would get a wrong word

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.860
or I would go too slow and
they would make fun of me.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.380
- I kept messing up on the words

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.053
and people kept laughing at me.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.150
- They said that you
don't know how to read,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.833
bet you won't be able to know
how to read when you grow up.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.403
- They always laugh at me if
I get too stuck with words.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.256
It makes my heart drop,

00:14:29.256 --> 00:14:32.493
'cause it seems like they
not my friend no more.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.770
- The collateral damage
caused by literacy problems

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.270
in the United States alone is immense.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.400
75 percent to 80 percent of students

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.540
identified as learning disabled

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.520
have their basic deficits
in language and reading.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.460
Academic success, as defined
by high school graduation,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.490
can be predicted by knowing
someone's reading skill

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.563
at the end of third grade.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.090
56 percent of students
with learning disabilities

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.763
will drop out of school and be arrested.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.850
60 percent of adolescents in treatment

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.993
for substance abuse have
learning disabilities.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.760
50 percent of females
with learning disabilities

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.570
will be mothers, many
of them single mothers,

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.053
within three to five years
of leaving high school.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.282
Learning disabilities and substance abuse

00:15:28.282 --> 00:15:30.375
are the number one reason

00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:33.870
for keeping welfare recipients

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.863
from becoming and remaining employed.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.960
Now I'm gonna turn to discussing

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.480
how modern technologies are impacting

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.353
reading and writing today.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.180
Least we forget, the human brain

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.560
is an exquisitely adaptable machine.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.480
Even though written language did not

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.130
evolve like spoken language did

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.380
over tens of millions of years ago,

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.180
since the invention of
writing and reading,

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.210
the remarkable neuroplasticity
of the human brain

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.560
has supported the rapid formation

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.270
of a highly elaborate
literacy brain circuit.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.728
Literacy is a unique
epigenetic achievement

00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:22.876
that changes what we perceive,

00:16:22.876 --> 00:16:26.340
how we think, and how we feel.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.980
That is, who we are.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.390
I think it's fair to say
that reading and writing,

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.100
perhaps more than any other technology,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.770
have had the greatest impact

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.223
on the advancement of Homo
sapiens brain and mind.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.000
As we gain proficiency
in reading and writing,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.026
the continual use of our
literacy brain circuit

00:16:46.026 --> 00:16:51.026
feeds back, elaborates,
and strengthens itself.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.680
But just as this brain circuit

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.393
developed very rapidly
in evolutionary terms,

00:16:56.393 --> 00:17:01.393
or perhaps because it was so rapid,

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.468
this circuit is also
more vulnerable to change

00:17:05.468 --> 00:17:10.468
if not continuously reinforced
by experience and use.

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.010
Only if we continuously
work to develop and use

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.340
the elaborated analytical, inferential,

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.610
and empathetic skills that have been

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.910
developed by literacy
will the neural networks

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.550
underlying these skills continue

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:30.750
to sustain our capacity to be attentive,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.210
thoughtful, critical thinkers,

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:38.210
rather than passive consumers
of facts, real or fake.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.920
Despite alphabetic writing not

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.747
changing much since the invention

00:17:45.747 --> 00:17:49.933
of the printing press in the 15th Century,

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.830
modern technologies, particularly
social media technologies,

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.300
are having a very rapid
and profound effect

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.700
on writing practices in the 21st Century.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.040
Interestingly, many of
these new technologies

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.970
are making less use of
alphabetic writing systems

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.280
and more use, once again, of pictographs,

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.270
as can be seen here, comparing
the Egyptian hieroglyphics

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.090
of 3100 BC to a thank you
note I recently received

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.620
from my niece that says

00:18:20.597 --> 00:18:25.597
"Dinner was awesome,
it was a gift, thanks."

00:18:31.227 --> 00:18:33.780
And another example, a Chinese pictograph

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.011
for medical marijuana,
originally from 10,000 years ago,

00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:42.643
and a clip art symbol for
medical marijuana from 2017.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.190
Since the 15th Century,
despite many changes

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.730
in spoken English, from Old
English to Middle English

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.010
to Early Modern and Late Modern English,

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.930
like here it says then she went

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.813
to speak the whatever English tongue,

00:19:03.259 --> 00:19:07.540
written English has
used the same 26 letters

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.633
to represent the 44 sounds
of English, until now.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.847
The bottom line reads

00:19:14.847 --> 00:19:19.847
"Then she went to speak this
digital age English tongue."

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.010
Neuroscientists like me,
who specialize in reading,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.960
are frequently asked these days,

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.770
how might these rapid
technological changes

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.253
in reading and writing
affect the human mind?

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.690
My colleague Dr. Maryanne Wolf focuses

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.010
on exactly this question in
her new book Reader, Come Home.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.340
I'd like to close with
some of the profound

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.453
insights from this timely book.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.650
As we move from a literary
and word-based culture

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:56.650
into a far faster paced
digital and screen-based one,

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.083
we face an existential dilemma
in this new millennium.

00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:04.440
There are many things that would be lost

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.460
if we slowly lose the cognitive patience

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.360
to immerse ourselves in the worlds

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.810
that are created by books, and the lives,

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.600
feelings, thoughts, and insights

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.010
of the characters who inhabit them.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.260
In a culture that increasingly rewards

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.200
immediacy, ease, and efficiency,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.640
the demanding time and effort involved

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.750
in what Dr. Wolf refers to as deep reading

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.310
make it an increasingly embattled entity.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.640
In closing I ask each of you
to consider this question.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.440
Will the very plasticity
of the literate brain

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.710
as it begins to reflect
the characteristics

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.300
of digital media that we and our children

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.563
are increasingly immersing ourselves in

00:20:45.563 --> 00:20:48.040
precipitate the atrophy of our

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.256
most essential thought processes,

00:20:51.256 --> 00:20:55.650
sustained attention, critical analysis,

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.810
empathy, and reflection, and indeed wisdom

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.700
to the detriment of democratic societies

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.730
that critically depend on these,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.780
the most essential characteristics

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.790
of the enlightened literate individual?

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:10.623
Thank you.
