00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:01.699
- [Instructor] What I would like to do

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:03.527
in this video is get some practice

00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:06.711
estimating the product
of multi-digit numbers

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:08.734
and there's no better way of getting

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.061
practice than just trying it ourselves.

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:12.385
And so right over here, it says

00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:14.385
estimate 29 times 3,198.

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:19.384
Why don't you pause this video
and try to estimate this?

00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:20.647
And of course you can do this by

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:23.014
multiplying this out on
paper or using a calculator,

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:25.696
but this is a useful skill,
try to do it in your head.

00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:28.010
See if you can estimate
what this is going to be.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.132
Well, before even
looking at these answers,

00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:33.913
I would say this is going to
be approximately equal to ...

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:37.618
Let's see, 29 is awfully close to 30,

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:39.636
and then I could multiply that times,

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:41.842
I could either multiply
that times 32 hundred,

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:44.367
which is awfully close to 3,198,

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:47.361
or if I wanted an even
more rough approximation,

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:48.831
I could say that's roughly equal

00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:51.524
to 30 times three thousand.

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:53.567
So if I did 30 times three thousand,

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:56.925
three times three is equal to nine,

00:00:56.925 --> 00:00:59.945
and then I have one,
two, three, four zeroes.

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:02.260
One, two, three, four zeroes.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.043
And actually my
approximation, it turns out,

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:06.509
is here, right over here, 90 thousand.

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.622
Now if I wanted a slightly
better approximation,

00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:09.976
I could have said this is approximately

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:11.976
equal to 30 times 3,200,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.498
and this you could also do in your head.

00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:20.255
You could say, well,
what is three times 32?

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:22.705
Well, that is gonna be 96, and then

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:24.892
you have one, two, three zeroes.

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:26.672
One, two, three zeroes, so this

00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:28.415
would be a slightly better approximation,

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:30.364
and if this is what you
got, the closest answer

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:33.742
here is still going to
be equal to 90 thousand.

00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:35.668
Let's do another example.

00:01:35.668 --> 00:01:39.585
So here, we are asked to
estimate 137 times 18.

00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.281
So pause this video again and see

00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:44.464
if you can come up with an estimate.

00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:46.240
Try to do it in your head.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.999
Well, there's once again many
ways of trying to tackle it.

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.395
The way I would tackle it, I would say,

00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:54.476
well, that's pretty close to 140 times 20,

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:58.643
and then this would be
equal to 14 times two is 28,

00:01:59.608 --> 00:02:01.421
and then we have two zeroes here,

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.811
so that would be roughly 28 hundred,

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:07.578
but when I look over here,
there is no 28 hundred,

00:02:07.578 --> 00:02:11.075
and so maybe the closest
one right over here

00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:13.428
is two thousand, so that would be my,

00:02:13.428 --> 00:02:15.688
that could be an approximation.

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:17.191
Another way, it looks actually

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:18.569
the way that they did it, they even

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.089
did a coarser approximation,
they rounded this

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.309
to the nearest hundred, and so they said

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.510
this is approximately
equal to one hundred times

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.588
and they rounded this to the nearest ten,

00:02:27.588 --> 00:02:29.949
one hundred times 20
which is even easier to do

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.610
in your head, which is
equal to two thousand,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.777
which is this choice that
they got right over here.
