00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.870
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.780
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Lahore, Pakistan.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.950
And the plan for today, we
are driving from Lahore,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.340
to Gujranwala, which is a
city known for it's food.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.190
We're gonna be taking the GT Highway,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.390
which is also called
the Grand Trunk Highway,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.600
which is a very famous
road, and along the way,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.980
we're going to stop at
a couple places to eat.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.060
But, before we leave Lahore today,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.800
we have to stop for a breakfast.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.240
It's a dish, it's a must.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.330
You cannot leave Lahore
without trying this dish.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.810
So we're gonna have breakfast first,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.494
and then we're on our way to Gujranwala.

00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:34.161
(upbeat music )

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.390
And we've just arrived

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.360
at a restaurant called Waris Nihari.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.300
It's a stew, it's, it's,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.490
I've had it before, it's
incredibly delicious.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.580
We have a few different versions,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.870
the one with brain as well,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.680
and then one with meat.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.170
He takes a piece of the meat,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.180
then he grabs some of the actual stew,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.090
which is like a nutty color,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.040
he sticks that into your bowl,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.730
then he reaches back into the meat,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.680
and takes some of the oil,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.380
and pours some of the red
oil on top to finish it off.

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:13.725
(music)

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.606
- Spilled milk, and spilled yogurt.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.727
(sizzling food)

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.620
- He heated up a whole
pan full of desi ghee,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.360
and infused it with some ginger
until that came to a boil.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.373
Then he poured over a few
spoons on top of the nihari,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.130
then he heated each bowl of nihari

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.800
over the open flame as well.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.480
That's just finishing it off, okay.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.593
It's ready to go eat.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.750
We got a couple of different versions,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.640
one is just with the beef,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.350
one is with the beef and the brains.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.937
It comes with the fresh ***,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.300
and then you always have to season with

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.230
ginger, chilis, and lime.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.993
And then we also got the lassis as well.

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:24.455
- I can't.

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:27.150
Dude, this load, this is beautiful.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.127
So excited for this right now.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.740
That meat is so tender you can just

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.480
run a piece of bread over it,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.190
and it starts to just like tear apart.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.980
- And some of that sauce
without seasoning yet.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.813
- Oh wow.

00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:41.260
- And all of that desi ghee.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.460
- Dude, are you kidding?

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.873
- Wow.

00:02:58.317 --> 00:02:59.150
- That's awesome.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.408
- So good.

00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:02.158
- Yes, one more bite!

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:04.456
Thank you!

00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:05.340
One more bite!

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.290
- So good.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.358
- We will take another bite, okay?

00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:10.207
The meat is so tender.

00:03:10.207 --> 00:03:11.040
- And you've got like,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.230
the creamy, like stew of
the nihari underneath it.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.870
Very fragrant, very infused, desi ghee.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.660
- Yeah, its awesome,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.460
but it does need to be
seasoned with the ginger

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.113
and the chiles and lime.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.880
Making sure to grab
some of the chiles and,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.483
oh that meat just flakes apart!

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:34.383
Oh, the drip!

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.030
That meat, that meat is insanely tender.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.930
You actually don't need teeth to chew it.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.190
Then, with that ginger,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.040
with those thin slices of
chiles to bump up the heat,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.580
this one includes the same beef,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.233
but then also brains.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.740
Oh, it just sorta like, it sunk.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.680
- It's so gooey.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.850
- The brains just kinda like,
collapsed into the desi ghee

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.963
and they become one with the
desi ghee when you pick it up.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.423
The desi ghee just like, gives
it the lubrication factor.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.620
Then you've got the meat which
is so unbelievably tender.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.610
Then you've got the brains,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.510
which sorta like slide right in there.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.553
- Like, hard boiled egg yolk.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.023
- Add some chillies just to top it off.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.090
Hand squeeze on a little
lime for the finishing touch.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.370
It's among the richest dishes,

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.640
I think I've ever had in my life.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.090
This one is the nahli nihari,

00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:46.819
and this one is actually
the most famous version.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:47.652
With marrow inside.

00:04:47.652 --> 00:04:49.653
Those little white nuggets
are all marrow chunks.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.300
That probably is the best,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.782
because that marrow is,

00:04:56.782 --> 00:04:58.770
again, is just like,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.260
disintegrating into the desi ghee.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.510
Plus the meat.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.640
Plus the ginger.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.510
This is like, ultimate meatiness.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.743
And after that, I need to lean
back and sip on the lassi.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.080
Oh, the milk mustache!

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.830
Tastes kinda like melted ice cream.

00:05:16.684 --> 00:05:18.320
So nihari is not a dish I
could eat too frequently

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.923
because there's so much
desi ghee, its so heavy,

00:05:22.852 --> 00:05:23.685
it's so rich.

00:05:24.914 --> 00:05:26.993
But that was, it was a treat.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.529
What a way to begin this day.

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.612
(music )

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.290
On our way, heading towards,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.723
in the direction towards Gujranwala.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.971
And we're taking the GT Road,

00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:47.780
that's the abbreviation
for the Grand Trunk Road.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.830
Which connects central Asia to south Asia,

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.210
so it runs all the way
from Kabul, in Afghanistan,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.430
to Chittagong in Bangladesh,

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.070
passing through northern Pakistan.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.490
There's lots of traffic,

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.960
and people take this road
going short distances,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.060
from town to town.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.010
This is a very significant road,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.963
and we are traveling it today.

00:06:10.688 --> 00:06:13.271
(upbeat music)

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.530
It was only like an hour and half drive.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.940
We didn't actually end up
stopping along the way.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.070
But we made it to the city.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.370
This is where we are going
to do some more eating,

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.170
and walk around and explore for the day,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.373
for most of the day.

00:06:28.363 --> 00:06:29.306
And behind me right here,

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:31.865
this is the watch tower,
built by the British.

00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:34.448
(upbeat music)

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.890
We just walked down the
street a little bit,

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.220
and we're going to stop
somewhere to eat a massive,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.840
like, some massive
production of fried-ness.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.340
Mainly what they're serving is pakoras,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.700
which are little fried fritters.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.350
There's a potato in it,
there's some vegetables,

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.540
there's herbs, there's spices.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.190
The cauldron of oil is bubbling away,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.213
but they do have, like an entire,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.460
I think they have a
few different versions,

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.260
but we're gonna a plate of
the pakoras freshly fried.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.460
He just grabs like fist fulls
of the batter mixture potato.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.120
Just like, squeezes it into the oil,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.050
and then just like, when
they're done frying,

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.130
they're just fish.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.280
He just fishes it out.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.530
We gotta try some of
the hot, fresh, pakoras.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.393
Oh nice.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.970
Thank you!

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.140
You take a chunk, you
dip it into that little,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.533
I think its yogurt sauce.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.093
Oh, oh that's hot.

00:07:30.093 --> 00:07:30.926
Yeah that's great.

00:07:30.926 --> 00:07:32.220
That's freshly fried.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.570
There's potato in there.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.350
The green is actually spinach.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.320
It does have a little
bit of spiciness to it.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.113
A dream deep fried snack.

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:43.744
(upbeat music)

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.540
Ali said we need to try it with the rhoti.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.920
It's actually common, I didn't
know it was a thing ever

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.253
to eat pakora with the roti.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.520
Yeah, it does kinda work.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.730
Because you have the soft puffy roti,

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.900
and then the really crispy

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.302
pakora.

00:08:08.302 --> 00:08:10.151
The textures, its a textures thing.

00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:10.984
That's nice.

00:08:10.984 --> 00:08:12.500
- That's really nice

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.250
That's my comfort snack at home.

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:19.394
- As-Salaam-Alaikum.

00:08:19.394 --> 00:08:20.880
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.220
Thank you, very good.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.110
So Gujranwala is known for their food,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.010
and also known for their wrestlers.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.930
For having big guys that wrestle.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.260
So we have a surprise.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.320
I had no idea we were going
to have this opportunity.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.830
But we met up with one of Ali's friends,

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.310
who has arranged for us to see

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.650
some of the local, traditional wrestling.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.511
That's where we're on our way to next.

00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:45.094
(upbeat music)

00:08:56.352 --> 00:08:59.545
(car horns honking)

00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:00.378
Quite the fork lift.

00:09:00.378 --> 00:09:01.770
Quite the bustling area.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.050
And we're gonna go...

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.280
Oh, I forgot to mention that the wrestling

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.130
doesn't start for about 15 or 20 minutes,

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.670
so we're going to stop
quickly to eat something,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.263
before we go to the wrestling.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.580
We're just going to walk around
this area for a little bit.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.880
This is quite a street as well.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.803
That looks great.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.970
We're just walking down the road,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.431
and we saw a man who's just
making these little patties.

00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:30.790
Actually, we saw the sign over there.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.170
They're made from camel.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.440
They smell so good.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.580
They're sizzling in this like,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.240
fatty liquid that's just bubbling.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.930
He grabs a handful of the meat mixture,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.740
he just kinda flattens it on the hot plate

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.700
to create the burger patty shape,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.280
and then directly into that
bubbling oil as it fries.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.833
I'm pretty sure it's
frying in its own fat.

00:09:58.021 --> 00:09:58.854
Oh.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.017
Oh wow.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.313
That is so good.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.990
It's so rich.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.590
Oh it's really nicely spiced.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.680
It has this like, citrusy taste to it.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.380
Actually, you know what I really taste

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.910
is the coriander seed.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.860
It gives off that almost citrusy taste.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.233
That is flavorful.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.413
Camel sliders.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.690
That coriander seed.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.750
Oh man, above and beyond tasty.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.950
- The smell, from across the
street, we couldn't resist.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.930
And this guy's just making it so properly.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.263
- (mumbles)

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.033
- I would speak, but my mouth
is full of camel right now.

00:10:51.706 --> 00:10:52.556
- That is a line.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.570
- Dude, that was a treat.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.210
That was a treat.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.250
Proper street meat treat, right there.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.900
- I'm loving this city already.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.410
Its kinda relaxed, but like, bustling.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.283
So like, overly bustling at the same time.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.610
It's not an official game,
but it's gonna be a practice.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.443
Practice wrestling,

00:11:18.443 --> 00:11:21.680
and wrestling is a big part
of the culture in Gujranwala.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.500
This is gonna be a real honor that they

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.335
have invited us to watch them practice.

00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:27.860
(mumbles)

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.810
- Hello

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.700
- Hello, Nice to meet you,
very nice to meet you.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.930
- Thank you so much, thank you.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.382
- He said that he just
returned from Istanbul.

00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:36.215
- Yes.

00:11:36.215 --> 00:11:39.120
- Two days ago, where he won
one of the championships there.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.560
And it looks like they are
just now preparing the sand pit

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.174
for the wrestling.

00:11:45.174 --> 00:11:46.657
- Yes, for the wrestling.

00:11:46.657 --> 00:11:47.740
- Okay great.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.500
They just finished their warm ups,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.250
now they are gonna have the fights.

00:11:58.686 --> 00:12:01.269
(upbeat music)

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.440
- Back on sand, and will finish, okay?

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.130
- Okay. For three seconds?

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.963
Or just...

00:12:06.963 --> 00:12:07.960
- No, just touch.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.793
- Okay.

00:12:08.793 --> 00:12:10.770
- Just touch and it will be done.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.720
He is finished.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.810
- Ah, okay.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.852
- He is the winner.

00:12:14.852 --> 00:12:17.435
(upbeat music)

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.080
(clapping)

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.030
- We're gonna take a
quick photo with everyone.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.083
Well done man, thank you.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.590
Thank you so much for inviting us today.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.810
It was an honor to be here.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.760
(upbeat music)

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.593
(cheering)

00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:51.176
(upbeat music)

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
Let me just tell you,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.333
what the new definition
of meat dreams are.

00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:04.590
(upbeat music)

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.800
It is a massive bus length grill,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.650
that is just going up in a fire of smoke.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.990
You can smell the meat in the air.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.703
We've got a whole group with us.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:33.600
Look at that grill!

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.133
It's like the aftermath
of a fireworks display.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.880
The meaty, smokiness, it is unbelievable.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.715
Oh, and here is where they're
skewering up the meat.

00:13:49.715 --> 00:13:52.715
- They start from 6pm and go to 3am.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.710
- They have their own farm,
their own source of goats,

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.740
and they sell 35-40 goats per night.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.950
Goats of meat.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:04.273
Entire goats.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.443
Thank you.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.710
We just moved on to the karahi station,

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.810
where he's making the
pans full of the curry.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:29.703
Oh wow.

00:14:30.797 --> 00:14:33.380
(pan sizzling)

00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:40.110
And next station, to
see the naan being made.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.530
Or is it time to riroti?

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.764
I think maybe time to riroti.

00:14:43.764 --> 00:14:45.264
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.322
They have a really nice,
large indoor section,

00:15:04.322 --> 00:15:06.220
but they are so nice
to put out some tables

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.470
on the street for us.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.590
We got the mutton karahi, we
got an assorted mutton plate,

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.670
we got multiple kabobs.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.821
Time to eat.

00:15:14.821 --> 00:15:15.654
We gotta begin with the golakabaob,

00:15:15.654 --> 00:15:18.633
which is this round like, meatball kabob.

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:28.420
It's so like, flaky.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.100
You can taste the meatiness of it.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.740
The umami of the fat that's
burnt, from the charcoal fire.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.180
That is just...

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.723
That is meat at its finest.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.453
- These are the mutton chops.

00:15:42.928 --> 00:15:45.911
(mumbles)

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:47.393
- Okay time for the mutton chops.

00:15:55.143 --> 00:15:56.740
It's so soft and tender.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.980
The marinade of spices is almost sticky.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.290
It's caramelized onto the meat.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.573
The most meaty, dreamy
thing you have ever tasted.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.463
This is the karahi this is what

00:16:08.463 --> 00:16:10.150
he made over that just massive fire.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.750
Oh man, you just kinda mop it up.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.540
Mop up that ghee, that desi ghee,

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.563
and that sauce, and that mutton.

00:16:23.246 --> 00:16:24.420
Oh, that is...

00:16:26.025 --> 00:16:27.210
That is stunning.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.030
You've got like, that, sour richness

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.720
of that yogurt in there.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.920
The richness of the desi ghee.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.990
Then just the tender mutton.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.663
The slight ginger aroma.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.550
- How do you pack that
much flavor into a sauce?

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.250
Dude, it's like, spicy yogurt.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.083
Yeah,

00:16:52.557 --> 00:16:53.443
it's like cheese.

00:16:56.219 --> 00:16:57.403
That's insane.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.540
- I can safely say that's
one of the greatest

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.700
grilled meat dinners I've ever had.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.040
Unbelievably delicious.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:06.873
Thank you.

00:17:10.158 --> 00:17:11.850
Feels like I just took a bath in smoke.

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:12.863
I actually did.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.853
Oh, that was stunning.

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:21.710
(upbeat music)

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.746
We're stopping off at one
more place this evening.

00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:27.503
I think just one more place.

00:17:28.507 --> 00:17:30.136
Oh, nice.

00:17:30.136 --> 00:17:30.969
Oh, nice.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.360
- (mumbles)

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.450
- I had no idea we were
getting this but it's paan.

00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:48.968
- So this is called paan.

00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:52.640
It's common in India, Pakistan, Nepal.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.830
- Oh, thank you.

00:17:55.556 --> 00:17:56.923
That's delicious though.

00:17:56.923 --> 00:17:59.143
That is a mouthful of many, many things.

00:18:00.776 --> 00:18:03.563
It's so sweet and so juicy,

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.750
with so many textures.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.730
Then you've got the main leaf

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.083
which has like a chalkiness to it.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.090
There's so much going on, it's amazing.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.734
Thank you!

00:18:12.734 --> 00:18:13.900
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.733
- That was delicious.

00:18:14.733 --> 00:18:17.623
That was a mouthful of just excitement.

00:18:18.642 --> 00:18:21.225
(upbeat music)

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.500
Jalebi is like a fried,

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.430
batter, which is then submerged in syrup,

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.520
so it's like a sweet crispy donut.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.100
He just kept swirling the batter,

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.030
swirling the batter,

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.210
until its like a massive frisbee.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.743
That's a giant jalebi.

00:19:01.944 --> 00:19:03.750
That's really good.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:04.940
It's like,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.860
- Wow.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.860
- Deep fried crispiness just
saturated with florally syrup.

00:19:13.557 --> 00:19:15.100
We're on our way to this village for,

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.090
we're gonna spend the
night in this village.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.396
I think we might make one
more little snack stop,

00:19:19.396 --> 00:19:21.380
I'm not totally sure, but we'll see.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.283
And we're on our way again.

00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:26.562
(music)

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.410
I think its kulfi, a type of ice cream.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.580
And he must be the one who invented it.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.690
Who has the recipe.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.433
The secret recipe.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.143
Thank you.

00:19:54.269 --> 00:19:55.460
So cold.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.330
And it has that kinda, slightly,

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.820
to me, its almost like
a starchy texture to it.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.390
Very very milky.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.810
Again you can taste that
boiled down condensed milk.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.210
I think that's called khoya.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:11.970
It's been a fantastic day

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.240
traveling from Lahore to Gujranwala.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.690
Gujranwala, I've been
so impressed with it.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.010
It's such a friendly city.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.490
Such a hectic, busy city,

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.250
but so much character, so much good food.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.350
Also, I want to say a huge
thank you to Ali and Sayem,

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.420
for bringing us around Gujranwala today.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.570
I'll have all the links
and the information

00:20:35.403 --> 00:20:37.390
in the description box
of everything we did.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.820
Tomorrow we have another big day,

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.010
so I'm gonna end this video now.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.500
