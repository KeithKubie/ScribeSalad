00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.833
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.570
[ Applause ]

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.160
&gt;&gt; Diane, come on up.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.610


00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.190
She is not only your
favorite author,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.480
but she is the favorite author
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.176
[applause] In the straw vote
that the Library of Congress ran,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.723
Diana received the most votes

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.576
of all the authors appearing
today, close to 400,000.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.263
[applause] So, hearty
congratulations and hurray for her.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.416
Now I'm supposed to introduce her,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.583
but rather than be bum rushed off
the stage telling you things you

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.383
already know, I decided
to take another tack,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.610
and I went to Diana's
website and saw

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.843
that she had a whole
page devoted to "Answers

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.896
to the Questions that
Everybody Asks Me."

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.426
So I thought what we'd really like
to know are answers to the questions

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.506
that nobody asks her, so I
wrote to her ahead of time

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.493
and asked her a few of those
questions, and she gamely

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.846
and graciously and
hilariously, at times,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.613
wrote back the answers
to these questions.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.443
And I'm just going to share
a few of them with you,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.563
and maybe they'll prompt
some of your own,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.980
which Diana will take
questions at the end.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.306
I asked her what her
favorite word is,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.783
one that she loves to
see and say and use.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.266
Her answer: absquatulate, which
I looked up and found to mean,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.350
"to leave, especially in a hurry
or under suspicious circumstances,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.470
and sometimes taking along
something or someone."

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.530
Another question I asked: When did
you first see a real man in a kilt?

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.183
Answer: February 1989 at a
Highlands Games in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.570
Now, we notice it must
have been a fetching image

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.350
because it was just two years
later that the first book

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.250
in the Outlander series came
out full of kilted Scotchmen.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.690
Another question I asked: Have
your children read your books?

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.050
Answer: No, none of my kids reads
my books, as my eldest daughter said

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.116
to me, "I don't want to read sex
scenes written by my mother."

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.910


00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.053
[laughter] And the last
one I'll share with you:

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.590
Which of your characters
would you most like to play

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.250
in a movie version
of one of your books?

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.400
Answer: Black Jack Randall.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.916
So please join me in welcoming
this accidental novelist,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.813
this great imaginer, this
character all her own.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.510
[ Applause ]

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.173
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.573
It's awfully nice to see
so many of you here today.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.166
You know, I have hopes of eventually
appearing before an audience

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.343
in Washington, D.C. not
looking like a drowned rat,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.816
but today is not the day.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.336
I've done the Book
Festival three times before.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.070
The first time it rained all day;

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.023
the second time it was
96 degrees outside,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.830
and while today it's very
nice outside, it's beautiful,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.960
I spent the last half hour in
the book tent signing books,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.393
and with all the body heat in
there, it's pretty darn humid,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.366
so you'll have to pardon
the dripping.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900
It'll slow down after a while.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.233
Anyway, many thanks.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.630
It's, as you mentioned, that
I was an accidental novelist.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.503
That's not quite right.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.910
I've known since the age of 8
that I was meant to be a novelist,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.813
but I came from a very
conservative family background.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.560
My father was fond of saying to
me, "Well, you're such a poor judge

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.796
of character you're
bound to marry some bum,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.070
so be sure you get a good education
so you can support your children."

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.826
Well, with this going on at home, I
thought perhaps I wouldn't announce

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.490
that I wanted to write novels, it
being kind of an iffy profession,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.796
and instead I went into science
and I got assorted degrees,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.770
including a Ph.D. My dissertation
was "Nest Site Selection

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.063
in the Pinyon Jay,
Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.906
or as my husband says,
"Why birds build nest

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.100
where they do, and
who cares anyway?"

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.700


00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.503
[laughter] But I did still
want to write novels,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.626
and when I turned 35 I said
to myself, well you know,

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.156
Mozart was dead at 36, now
you'd better get a move on here.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.296
And so I said fine, I'm
going to write a novel.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.673
Okay, up to this point I had
written all kinds of things,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.123
include Walt Disney comic
books, which will come

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.880
into the conversation a
little later, and, you know,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.940
annual reports, and grant
proposals and textbooks

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.796
and Popular Science articles,
and all the stuff that you write

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.840
as an academic -- I was
a university professor --

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.123
and no one had ever shown
me how to write any of this.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.276
I just tried it and if it
didn't look quite right,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.690
I poked it until it did.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.756
And I said, well, okay, fine,
you've been reading novels

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.610
for 30 odd years, surely if you
write one you will recognize it.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.366
I said, okay, I'm going a
write a novel for practice,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.760
and only two rules:
I will keep doing it

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.163
until it's finished no
matter bad I think it is,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.210
because how else will I learn,

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.750
and the second rule is I will
do the absolute best that I can

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.400
with the writing every day,
because otherwise how will I know

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.006
if I'm any good, and how
will I get any better?

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.806
So those were my only rules.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.710
So the next question, of course,
was what I am going to write, and,

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.006
because I read everything and lots
of it, so I thought about that

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.646
and I said well, I may be read
more mysteries than anything else,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.620
perhaps I should write a mystery.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.686
And I said, no, mysteries have
plots, I'm not sure I can do that.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.353
And I said, what's the
easiest possible thing

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.396
to write for practice.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.960
And after a bit of thought I decided
that would be a historical novel.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.340
I was a university professor,
I knew my way around a library.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.716
It seemed easier to look
things up than to make them up,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.900
and if I turned out to have no
imagination, I could steal things

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.070
from the historical record,
which actually works pretty well.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.640
So I said, fine, a historical novel.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.980
Well, where should I set this?

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.846
Because I have no background
in history, just the six hours

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.073
of Western Civilization they make
you take as an undergraduate,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.416
and so I would have to
look up everything, anyway.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.070
So I was looking for a convenient
time and place to set this novel,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.966
and I happened to see a
really old rerun of Dr.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.986
Who on public television.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.590
Yes, for those who are not
laughing, Dr. Who is a really old,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.990
really long running science
fiction fantasy show.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.590
The doctor of the title is a time
lord from the Planet Gallifrey

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.586
who travels through space
and time having adventures,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.840
and along the way he
picks up companions

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.960
from different periods
over its history.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.130
And in this very old show, which has
to have been filmed 50 years ago,

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.530
it was filmed in the UK,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.296
he had picked up a young
Scotsman from 1745.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.420
And this was a 17-, 18-year-old
young man who appeared in his kilt,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.573
and I said, well, that's
kind of fetching.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.973
And I said, well, you know, hum.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.730
I found myself still thinking
about this the next day in church,

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.443
and I said to myself [laughter]
you want to write a book,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.393
it doesn't really matter
where you set it.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.060
The important thing is to
pick a point and start in.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.860
And so I said fine,
Scotland, eighteenth century.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.260
So that's where I began,
knowing nothing about Scotland

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.400
or the eighteenth century, having no
plot, no outline, and no characters.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.083
Just the rather vague images
conjured up by the notion of a man

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.023
in a kilt, which is, of course, a
very powerful and compelling image.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.720


00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.466
[laughter] In fact, my next to last
book, "A Breath of Snow and Ashes,"

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.353
was a very lucky book for me.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.486
It opened at number one
on the bestseller lists

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.416
of several countries, and it
also won me several awards,

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.916
including the Corine
International Prize for Fiction,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.883
which was totally cool, and I got
to go to Germany to accept this.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.540
Well, while I was there, the
German publisher had me interviewed

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.896
by absolutely everyone in the
German press, one after another,

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.690
every half hour for a
week, and toward the end

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.870
of this process I was talking
to a nice gentleman from one

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.766
of their literary journals,
and he said "Oh,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.296
I've read your entire works,
they're just marvelous, you know,

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.993
your narrative drive is tremendous,
your imagery is just transcendental,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.633
your characters are
so three dimensional."

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.513
I'm thinking yes, yes, go on.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.446
And instead he said, "There's
just this one thing I wonder,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.443
could you explain to me what is
the appeal of a man in a kilt?"

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.470


00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.196
Well, I was really tired or I might
not have said it, but I just looked

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.236
at him for a minute and I said,
"Well, I suppose it's the idea

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.350
that you could be up against
a wall with him in a minute."

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.510
[ Laughter ]

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.496
Yeah. The last time I told
this story in Denver a couple

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.956
of nights ago there was a gentleman
sitting in the front row in a kilt,

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.676
and I had said, you're
going to regret this.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.210
But, as I say, a very
powerful and compelling image.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.120
So anyway, that's where I began
and that's where Outlander started.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.523
So to date there are a number
of Outlander novels out.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.413
No one is quite sure
what to call them.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.136
Nobody knows quite what it is I
write except that it's really big

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.290
and I've seen them sold successfully
so far as fiction, literature,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.066
historical fiction,
historical nonfiction --

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.690
this is true, Foyles
Bookstore in London had them

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.976
in the history section -- and when
I mentioned this to the clerk,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.956
he said, oh, well that would
be Miss Kitty Foyle who,

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.343
at the time, was about 92.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.070
He said, she has complete
sway over her books or shelf,

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.683
and evidently she believes in
time travel, so -- [laughter].

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.756
So I was saying, historical
fiction, historical nonfiction,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.430
science fiction, fantasy, mystery
romance, gay and lesbian fiction,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.123
military history, and horror.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.430


00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.370
No, really, the same year with
that same book I was nominated

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.696
for a Quill Award, and for
reasons known only to the people

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.016
who nominate things, they put
the book in the science fiction,

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.380
fantasy, and horror
category where I was

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.906
up against George R.R.
Martin and Stephen King.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:34.640
I was thinking, oh, great, you know.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.393
But they had a lovely awards
ceremony which was televised

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.426
from the Natural History
Museum in New York.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.966
So, you know, I dressed up and
was wearing one of my best outfits

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.676
with the suede boots with the
four-inch heels and all that,

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.590
which I can stand up in
for about three hours,

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.936
and that's about how
long they kept us

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.670
out in the foyer while
they did all the TV setup.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.073
So by the time we got inside and
sat down at the tables, I, you know,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.270
unzipped my boots and took them off
under the cover of the tablecloth,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:00.770
and so I was enjoying
myself through the program.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.996
Now science fiction, fantasy,
and horror was the last thing

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.743
on the program, and as the time
got shorter, I was thinking,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.223
well now should I put
my boots back on.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.006
And then I'd look at George, who
was on the other side of the table.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.860
I don't know if you've ever
seen George R.R. Martin,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.353
he looks like an enraged
Dewok [phonetic] but --

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.296
[laughter] he's really a nice man,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.830
and he was wearing a
purple brocade vest --

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.213
he's about three feet across,
and I was thinking, hum,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.476
surely the TV cameras
won't pass that up.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:27.993
And there was Stephen King on the
other side and I was thinking, nah,

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.380
and so sure enough, I won
and was obliged to scamper

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.766
up on stage in my bare feet.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:36.863
I could just about see over
the podium, and I said, well,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.776
now you all know the
terrible truth, I'm short.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.490
But, anyway, I have a hard time
describing what it is that I write,

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.816
but I'm glad that so many have
you seem to like to read it.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.536
As I said, they tend to be big,

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.463
that's because I wrote the
first book for practice.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.196
I didn't intend to ever show it to
anyone, let alone try to publish it,

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.570
and so I didn't pay any attention
to what was marketable or commercial

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:01.986
or whatever, I just put
in anything I liked.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.770
Now it was a perfectly
straightforward historical novel

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.563
up to about the third day.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:13.430
I had gone to the library to do the
research, or to get started on it.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.370
And I said, well, the only thing
I know about writing a novel is

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.123
that it should have conflict, so
I'm looking for conflict in Scotland

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.003
in the eighteenth century.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.070
Well you don't do that for
very along before you run right

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.670
into bonnie Prince Charlie, and I
said, yeah, that looks like a lot

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.070
of conflict, we'll do that.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.803
I said, now, I must have a
lot of Scotsmen, of course,

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.740
because of the kilt factor, that
I think it would be a good idea

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.266
if I had a female character
to play off these guys

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.386
and will have sexual tension,
that's conflict, that's good.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.413
And I said, now, essentially,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.080
putting aside the political
complexity, we have English

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.680
versus Scots, so if I make her
an Englishwoman we will have lots

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.480
of conflict.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.343
So, the third day of writing I
introduced this Englishwoman,

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.616
no idea who she was, how
she got into the story

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.356
or what she was doing there, but
I loosed her into a cottage full

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.210
of Scotsmen to see what she'd do.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.256
Well, she walked in, they're all
pressed around the hearth muttering

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.896
to each other, and
they all turned around

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.230
and stared when she walked in.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.563
And I was thinking why, does she
look funny, what's going on here.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.940
Anyway, one of them slowly
drew himself up and he said,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.453
"My name is Dougal MacKenzie
and who might you be?"

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.556
And without my stopping
to think, I just typed,

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.796
"My name is Claire Elizabeth
Beauchamp and who the hell are you?"

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.710
I said well, you don't sound at all
like an eighteenth century person.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.776
So I fought with her for several
pages trying to beat her into shape

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.540
and make her speak like an
eighteenth century woman,

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:22.986
but she wasn't having any of this;

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.653
she just kept making
smart ass modern remarks

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.523
about everything she saw,
and she also took over

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.466
and started telling
the story herself.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.306
And so I said, well, you
know, I'm not going to fight

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.893
with you all the way
through this book.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:35.960
I said, no one's ever
going to see this,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.093
it doesn't matter what
bizarre thing I do.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.140
Go ahead and be modern, I'll
figure out how you got there later.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.513
And so it's all her fault that
there's time travel in these books.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.980
But having made that decision,
obviously anything went,

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.790
including the Loch Ness monster
and a few other questionable items,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.136
and so I arrived with this book
which is completely indescribable

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.000
and has remained so
for all these years.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.033
My only beloved editor used to say,
these have to be word-of-mouth books

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.993
because they're too weird
to describe to anyone.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.140
[laughter] Which is completely true.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.913
This caused my a lot of trouble
with book sellers because for lack

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.973
of any better idea, they started
shoving it in the romance section

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.093
because there was an identifiable
love story amongst everything else.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.913
And I said, well, you know,
this is fine, you know,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.006
I like well-written romance, and so
forth, but that's not what I write.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.420
And anyway, it took me
years to make them take it

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.270
out of the romance
section because, as I said,

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.116
people who read romance will
certainly go to the fiction shelves,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.516
but the reverse is
not true, you know,

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.393
and you will cut off the entire male
half of my audience if you do that.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.506
Men like the books and they
see different things in them

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.326
than woman do, and I must say that
I'm extremely gratified to see

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.930
so many gentlemen in the audience,
because evidently the word

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.843
of mouth has been working.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.853
Anyway, today I'm here with
a quite different book.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.720
It was, in fact, part
of the Outlander series,

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:53.746
but for once it's short, you know,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.173
to prove that I actually
can do a short book.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.523
Of course, it's short
because it's a graphic novel,

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.583
and you know what they say

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.783
about a picture being
worth a thousand words.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.050
If that's actually true, then it
is actually about the same size

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:07.440
as my others, it just
fits in a smaller space.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.460
I mentioned writing comic books
for Walt Disney back in the 70s.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.513
This happened because my mother
taught me to read at the age

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:16.860
of three, in part, by
reading me Walt Disney comics.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.993
And I never stopped.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.326
In my late 20s I was
reading one, one day

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:23.993
and I said well this is pretty bad,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.326
I bet I could do better
than that myself.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.913
And so I found the name and address
of the editor who handled that line,

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.386
and I wrote him this very
rude letter saying, "Dear sir,

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.820
I've been reading your
comics for the last 25 years.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.166
They've been getting
worse and worse."

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.863
I said, "I don't know if I could do
better myself, but I'd like to try."

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.780
Well, luckily I had hit Del Connell,
a gentleman with a sense of humor

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.693
who wrote back and said, okay, try.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.683
And he sent me a couple of
pages of a sample script

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:48.336
so I could see how to lay one out.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.403
I wrote him a story.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.870
He didn't buy it, but he did
something much more valuable.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:54.336
He told me what was wrong with it.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.803
I wrote my second story,
which he did buy,

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:58.470
that was my first fiction sale ever,

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.136
and I bounced off the
walls literally for days.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.670
But I continued to write for
him for about three years,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.230
at the end of which, the
Disney powers that be said,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.320
well we've got 40 years of classic
Carl Barks' strips in the files,

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.566
why are you buying new ones?

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:11.833
Why don't we just recycle those?

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.233
So they did, and that was
the end of my comics career.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.233
But, you know, I enjoyed the
forum, I really liked it.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.593
And so when graphic
novels kind of began seep

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.306
into the mainstream a couple of
years ago, I said to my agent, well,

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.106
you know, if anyone
would ever like me

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.506
to write a graphic
novel, I'd been thrilled.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.733
And a month later along came
Betsy Mitchell of Ballantine Books

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.623
who said, would you like to write a
graphic novel, and I said well, yes,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.536
I'd like that very much, Betsy.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.753
And what she said to me, was, I
want a new Jamie and Claire story,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.826
you know, one that's never been
seen before, but I want it to be set

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.013
within the parameters of Outlander.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.166
And I said, well that's interesting;
let me think about that for a bit.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.860
And so I did.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.593
Well, Outlander is
called that, of course,

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.583
because of Claire Beauchamp
Randall Fraser, who is an Outlander

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.070
in every sense of the word.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.470
You know, she's a fish
out of water, out of time,

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.803
doesn't speak the language,
knows nothing of the clans

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.003
that were surrounding her,

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.203
knows nothing of eighteenth
century politics.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.803
Consequently, there's a lot going
on around her that she doesn't see,

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.616
doesn't understand, or is
purposely kept ignorant of.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.273
And I said, what if I told that
story from the point of view

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:07.823
of someone who knew
everything she doesn't know.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:10.333
Okay. Now probably you've seen
a graphic novel or a comic book,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:14.713
whether you read them
regularly or not.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:16.773
At the top of the first page you'll
see a very large square panel,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.653
and this is what you
call the setup panel.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.993
This is where you introduce the
main character or a main character

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:25.940
from the story in a situation that
has something to do with the story.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.976
Okay, on the front page of "The
Exile," which is the new book,

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.666
you will see what looks like
a big square of swirling blue,

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.873
and if you look closer you'll
see it's a thrashing sea

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.193
and a louring sky, and a stark
Scottish cliff at one side

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.743
with a little kilted figure at
the top leaning on his sword.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.040
Well, he's looking out to sea,
and coming through the mist

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.076
and spray is a small sailing ship.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.796
Well, this is Murtagh, Jamie
Fraser's godfather, and he's waiting

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.893
for Jamie to come back from France.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.113
So this story begins
before Outlander begins,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:54.606
and we will learn what
sent Jamie back

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.183
from France and a few other things.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.256
And the story is told
largely from the point

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.403
of view of Murtagh and Jamie.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.336
So we see, you know, all the
things that Claire didn't see,

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.103
including what Murtagh thought
of Claire when he first saw her,

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:07.710
and what he thought of her
marrying Jamie and so forth.

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.430
But we will also, along
the way, pick up

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:11.963
and solve a few little mysteries

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.163
that people has been asking
me about over the year.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.020
It's like what did Mrs. Fitzgibbons
think of Claire's underwear,

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.240
and what happened to Claire's shoes.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:22.840
Claire's shoes are sort
of "Where's Waldo?"

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.040
of this book.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.640
The answer to that
question is in there,

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.773
but you have to look
closely to find them.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.506
Okay. So anyway, this is
where "The Exile" came from.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.953
Well, the next question, of course,
is who's going to draw the pictures,

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:34.993
because it's not going to be me.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.060
And I wrote the script,
of course, I laid it out.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.156
And the way you lay out a comic
script, or the way I do it,

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.880
is to actually draw the boxes on
the page for the different panels.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.553
At the top I put a description
of what I want to be going on in

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.856
that panel, and they include things
like the focus and the placement

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.440
of characters and the
expressions on their faces,

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.206
any particular objects
that should be there.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.806
It's really exquisite.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.540
And under that I put the
dialogue in script form.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.456
Well, this then goes to
an artist, and the artist,

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.756
of course is pretty critical here.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:04.903
Well, I went back to New York
and spent an afternoon with Betsy

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:06.753
and her merry band of
graphic novelists going

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.263
through an entire roomful of
samples of art from graphic novels

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.173
and comic books and they were saying
we like this, and I was saying I

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.103
like that, and we, you
know came to a meeting

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.363
on several criterion
that we agreed on.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.546
And they sent me, a week later,
a pile of samples from 10 artists

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:23.660
who matched both of our criteria,
and who were also available

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.203
for the two years it
would take to draw this.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:29.730
It took me six months
to write the script, so,

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.140
in fact I was not taking time
away from writing book 8.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.070
I finished it before I
finished "Echo and The Bone."

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:35.400
But it took the artist,
Hoang Nguyen,

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:37.716
two years to finish the
artwork, and you can see why.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.296
If you look at it, I chose him
for his sheer painterliness.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:44.470
He does beautiful things
with light and composition,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:52.150
but he also has an exquisite touch
with faces and with expressions.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.603
Now, if you've seen
graphic novels very much,

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:55.753
mostly the characters
only have two expressions;

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.023
they're either completely
deadpan, or they're going --

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.150
and I'm saying, well, no
this won't do, you know,

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.616
scowls won't cut it here.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:04.470
We need expressions to
carry the emotion here,

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.496
and so that's why I chose Hoang,
was that he could actually do that.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.423
And he's done it, you
know, just beautifully.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.290
Now people say, well, you know, this
is what I think Jamie looks like,

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.583
or that's not what I
think Claire looks like,

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.116
but if that's what Diana
thinks they look like, okay,

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.583
this is not what Diana
thinks they look like.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:22.183
This is as close as we could
come as an approximation.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.116
It is a graphic novel.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.116
That means it is essentially
cartoons,

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:28.873
though very sophisticated cartoons.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.803
The art is not meant to be an
accurate figuration of what Jamie

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.073
or Claire looks like, and, in fact,
they look quite different from panel

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.190
to panel just as real people
would if you took photographs

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.996
of them every 30 seconds.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.930
I don't know if that's going
to cause a problem or not,

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.596
but I better put it back.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.020
The drawbacks of waving
your hands when you talk.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:50.666
Anyway, I think we're good now.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:52.916
Yeah, so anyway, what
we did was I explained

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:55.816
to Hoang what the characters
looked like.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.150
He did approximations of them.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.283
I said, "No, more nose,
curlier hair," you know.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.083
I continued to say more nose,

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:03.616
curlier hair through
the entire thing.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.016
Hoang is a wonderful artist.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.950
He's a Vietnamese American.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.916
He came to the U.S. when
he was nine years old.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.310
In fact, I just saw him, met him
for the first time this last week.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.723
He came for the launch party so
that we could talk to the audience

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.363
about both the art and the drawings,
and he told me his dad worked

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.006
for the U.S. Embassy, and
in fact, his family made it

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.426
out on that last day, so.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:27.370
But anyway, he says he likes to
draw on both sides of his heritage,

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.110
so to speak, from the Vietnamese and
also from the more western milieu

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.363
in which he grew up, and you can see
it in the delicacy and the elegance

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.470
of - excuse me - of what he does.

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.016
But, possibly coming from an
Asian background and so forth,

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.220
all of his characters tended
to have rather flat noses.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.856
And so I kept saying, no, Jamie
has a long pointy nose, you know,

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.353
and so we got the for the most part,
but there are still places in there

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.533
where he looks a little flat to me.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.283
Anyway, you know, nothing
is absolutely perfect.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.203
You're not seeing what I see
when I see Jamie and Claire,

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:00.616
but you're seeing a reasonable
approximation of them.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:03.643
And as I mentioned at
the end of the book,

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.893
if you could see inside my head, if
you could see exactly what I see,

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.726
every single one of you would say,
but they don't look like that.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:11.953
[laughter] So, I don't think that it
will disrupt your own mental images

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.816
of them, and I hope you'll
enjoy the art as it is.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.976
I should pause at this point and see
if any have you have any questions

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.580
since we have about eight
minutes remaining here.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:22.800
Yes, I see someone
waving back there.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.466
&gt;&gt; Can you say - I don't know
how to pronounce it - Sassenach?

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.320
&gt;&gt; Sassenach.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.120
The question was, you know,

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.253
can I say this unpronounceable
word that Jamie calls Claire.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.720
It's pronounced Sassenach,
and it means an Outlander

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:39.586
by specifically an English person.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.320
Yeah. Um-hum.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.720
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320
Anything else?

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:47.853
Surely that can't be
the only question.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.453
&gt;&gt; How many more?

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.720
&gt;&gt; Oh, how many more?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.186
Well, I don't actually know.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:55.986
I don't plan the books
out ahead of time.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.720
I don't write with an outline and
I don't write in a straight line.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.986
I write where I can
see things happening,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.653
and then these little pieces
kind of stick together

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.253
and eventually I get a shape.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.253
All of my books have
geometric shapes inside,

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.653
and once I've seen the shape, then
the writing becomes much faster

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.853
because I can kind of see
the pieces that are missing,

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.253
but it takes me 18 months to
two years to get to that point.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.720
And it does take me two to three
years to write one of these books.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.853
It usually is a little longer than
that between books because there's

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:17.890
so much travel and
promotion to be done.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.816
So I say to people,
you have a choice:

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:25.083
you can have the next book
sooner, or you can look at me.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.470
You're looking at me.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.736
Yes, somebody back there.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.670
&gt;&gt; What prompted you
to choose Lord John

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:33.903
as a central character [inaudible]?

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.036
&gt;&gt; Oh, what led me
to choose Lord John

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.636
as a spinoff character
to write a series about?

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.370
Well, that was an accident.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.326
Some years ago I was invited to
submit a short story to a book

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.050
about short stories of
historical crime, and I said,

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.643
well that's interesting,
because I did originally want

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.710
to write a mystery
and loved to do that,

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.510
and I said, sure, you know, why not.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.843
But then I began to think.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.376
I can't write a short story
about Jamie and Claire

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.443
because of the way in which I work.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.710
You know, if I wrote something that
was significant enough of an event

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.910
to make a good short story,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.976
then that would be kind
of a rock in my way.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.976
I'd have to take account of
that circumstance when I worked

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.903
on my next book and I just
didn't want to complicate things.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.716
And so I said, well, but
you know, there's Lord John.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.810
I could write about him because
he's a fascinating character.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:13.966
He talks to me easily, and
yet he's not constantly

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.043
in the main story;
he drops in and out.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:19.750
And obviously he's having an
interesting life during those

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.816
periods when he's not on stage,

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.350
so why don't I write
about one of those.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:26.750
And so I did.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.483
Well, it was a good story,
but it was a British anthology

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.550
which meant it went
out of print like that,

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.416
and people in the U.S. began saying,
well we've heard about this story,

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:34.843
we love Lord John, where can
we get this, and I said, oh.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:37.123
I said, well I enjoyed
writing that story.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.356
What if I wrote another or two just
this time, and inspiration allowed,

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.490
then we could, you
know, collect them

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.356
and people could have them
if they like Lord John.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.090
So, I did.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.356
I wrote a second Lord John story,
and I mentioned it to my agents

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.623
as I was on my way out of
the country for a book tour.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.996
And I said, oh, I've written the
second Lord John short story.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.183
And they said, oh, good,
how long's this one.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.383
And I said, well, I knew
you'd ask, so I looked.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.730
It's about 85,000 words; I need
maybe five more to finish it up.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.180
They looked at each other and
they looked at me, and said,

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.026
that's the size that
normal books are.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.240
[laughter] And evidently I had
written a novel not realizing it,

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.953
and so they took it away and sold it
to everyone, and everyone said, oh,

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:13.873
here's a new Gabaldon
book and it's short.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.406
They were thrilled.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:17.540
And they said, can
she do that again,

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.140
and my agents being good agents,
said oh, I'm sure she could,

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.096
and they probably gave
us a three-book contract

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.423
to write more Lord John books,
so that's where he came from.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.010
Yeah. I didn't actually
do it on purpose, but,

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.143
you know, I enjoy him very much.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.010
Yes.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.010
&gt;&gt; I have one.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.676
&gt;&gt; Oh, you have one here.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.810
&gt;&gt; I question your process.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.276
Do you get up every morning and
go in a special place and write -

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, process.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.410
&gt;&gt; -- write at night?

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.343
&gt;&gt; I write at night.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.010
&gt;&gt; You do?

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.676
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, my, well, let's
see, let's put it this way.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.676
When I began writing Outlander
I had two full-time jobs,

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.476
I was a university professor, and
I wrote almost full-time freelance

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.610
for the Computer Press, and I had
three children under the age of six.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.676
The youngest of those is over
here on the grass, now 24.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.626
So, anyway, it -- yeah, I wrote at
night is basically the answer there.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:05.560
But I'm normally a
night owl, anyway,

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.663
so now that the kids are
all grown and so forth,

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.080
and I don't have either
of my two full-time jobs,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.300
I normally go to work
around midnight --

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.963
midnight to 4 a.m. is my main time.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.443
But, you know my husband likes to
go to bed fairly early, around 9:30

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.203
or 10, so usually -- and I'll
tuck him in, and then I'll go lie

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.890
down on the couch with
two Dachshunds and a book,

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.453
and if no one needs me --
these days they mostly don't --

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.003
I'll fall asleep, but I'll wake
again naturally around midnight

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:32.966
and go to work, and then
I go back to bed at four.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.440
&gt;&gt; So basically that's
your [inaudible].

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.773
&gt;&gt; That's my main time, yeah.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.240
I will write during
the day, as well,

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.973
but usually only an hour
here and an hour there.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.106
And I do research and other
things during the day.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.373
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.706
&gt;&gt; My pleasure, uh-huh, yes.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.073
&gt;&gt; Three generations of my family
are now hooked on your books.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.990
[laughter]

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.456
&gt;&gt; And when they heard I was coming
here today, the one question all

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.300
of them asked was, "When's
the next Outlander book?"

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.080
&gt;&gt; Ah, uh-huh.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.323
Well, "The Exile" is an Outlander
book, but I know what they mean.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.636
They want book 8, yes.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.636
I was just thinking about
the three-generation thing.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.193
I was signing books in Chicago
once and had a grandmother, mother,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:19.640
and daughter who were
all reading the books

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.640
and I was signing for them.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.573
The grandmother was talking
to me and she said, you know,

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.040
I was in the middle of Voyager
when I turned to my granddaughter

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.506
and said, "I just had
a terrible thought,

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.373
we're both lusting
after the same man."

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:32.510
[ Laughter ]

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.513
Anyway, the rough answer
to your question is,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.346
with luck, in 2012, I think, yeah.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.356
You will have a book next year
I think, because the third book

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.750
under my Lord John contract, "Lord
John and the Scottish Prisoner,"

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.816
I work on multiple things
at once because it keeps me

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.150
from having writer's block,

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.816
and as the Lord John books
are substantially shorter,

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.416
that's likely to be done first.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.350
So my guess is that
you'll get that next fall.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.683
So you will have something to read.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.016
Now, that's called "Lord John
and the Scottish Prisoner"

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.216
and it is a two-person book.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.416
It alternates in viewpoint
between Jamie Fraser and Lord John,

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.283
so I think you'll enjoy that.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.750
And then with luck, book 8 will be
out the following year, we hope.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.416
Okay, we have time for
maybe one more question.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.083
[inaudible] Oh, over here?

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.750
Who's he pointing at?

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:16.550
Oh, there you are.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.350
Sorry.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.750
&gt;&gt; Can you give us an update
on the movie/TV series?

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.083
&gt;&gt; Oh, can I give you an update
on movie -- really quick.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.683
Yeah. Yes, the books are under
contract, under an option contract.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.816
Now that does not mean
they're actually making movie,

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.216
it means that they want to make
a movie and they're looking

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:30.016
for 60 million dollars
in which to do it.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.216
So, they have hired a scriptwriter,
and I'm talking to them

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.883
in San Francisco next week, so with
luck, I'll have some news for you

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.883
at that point, and if I do,
I'll put it on my website.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.083
The next question, which I
can answer without hearing it,

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.150
is who would you cast
to play Jamie Fraser?

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.016
[laughter] Okay, up to about
a month ago I had no answer

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.816
to that, but now I do.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.683
Okay, you've never heard of him,
but this is a very nice young guy

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.283
from Edinburgh named Allan
Scott-Douglas, a very fine actor.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.483
He is six foot four, he does have
red hair, and he is Scottish.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.150
[applause] He's also 27, and I think
he might actually remember what it's

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.683
like to be a virgin.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.216
[laughter] Yes, do we have 30
seconds for another question?

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.350
No, we're done.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.750
Yeah. Okay, well thank you
so much, and I'll see you

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:33.833
at the signing later, thank you.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000


00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.350
[ Applause ]

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.216

of the Library of Congress.
