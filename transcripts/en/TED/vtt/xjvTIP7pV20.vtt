00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.216
When I was in the fifth grade,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.616
I bought an issue
of "DC Comics Presents #57"

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.376
off of a spinner rack
at my local bookstore,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.096
and that comic book changed my life.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.496
The combination of words and pictures
did something inside my head

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.056
that had never been done before,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.776
and I immediately fell in love
with the medium of comics.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.976
I became a voracious comic book reader,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.696
but I never brought them to school.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.536
Instinctively, I knew that comic books
didn't belong in the classroom.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.976
My parents definitely were not fans,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.096
and I was certain that my teachers
wouldn't be either.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.376
After all, they never used them to teach,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.296
comic books and graphic novels were never
allowed during silent sustained reading,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.816
and they were never sold
at our annual book fair.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.416
Even so, I kept reading comics,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.056
and I even started making them.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.096
Eventually I became
a published cartoonist,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.920
writing and drawing
comic books for a living.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.936
I also became a high school teacher.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.256
This is where I taught:

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.096
Bishop O'Dowd High School
in Oakland, California.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.656
I taught a little bit of math
and a little bit of art,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.056
but mostly computer science,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.496
and I was there for 17 years.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.376
When I was a brand new teacher,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.536
I tried bringing comic books
into my classroom.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.656
I remember telling my students
on the first day of every class

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.776
that I was also a cartoonist.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.896
It wasn't so much that I was planning
to teach them with comics,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.936
it was more that I was hoping comics
would make them think that I was cool.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.376
(Laughter)

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.776
I was wrong.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.776
This was the '90s,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.096
so comic books didn't have
the cultural cachet that they do today.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.056
My students didn't think I was cool.
They thought I was kind of a dork.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.976
And even worse,
when stuff got hard in my class,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.296
they would use comic books
as a way of distracting me.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.936
They would raise their hands
and ask me questions like,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.296
"Mr. Yang, who do you think
would win in a fight,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.576
Superman or the Hulk?"

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.616
(Laughter)

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.696
I very quickly realized I had to keep
my teaching and my cartooning separate.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.136
It seemed like my instincts
in fifth grade were correct.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.200
Comic books didn't belong
in the classroom.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.240
But again, I was wrong.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.856
A few years into my teaching career,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.776
I learned firsthand
the educational potential of comics.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.336
One semester, I was asked to sub
for this Algebra 2 class.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.656
I was asked to long-term sub it,
and I said yes, but there was a problem.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.376
At the time, I was also
the school's educational technologist,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.296
which meant every couple of weeks

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.736
I had to miss one or two periods
of this Algebra 2 class

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.576
because I was in another classroom
helping another teacher

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.696
with a computer-related activity.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.856
For these Algebra 2 students,
that was terrible.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.496
I mean, having a long-term
sub is bad enough,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.640
but having a sub for your sub?
That's the worst.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.216
In an effort to provide some sort
of consistency for my students,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.096
I began videotaping
myself giving lectures.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.736
I'd then give these videos to my sub
to play for my students.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.216
I tried to make these videos
as engaging as possible.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.376
I even included
these little special effects.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.256
For instance, after I finished
a problem on the board,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.896
I'd clap my hands,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.336
and the board would magically erase.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.776
(Laughter)

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.360
I thought it was pretty awesome.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.016
I was pretty certain
that my students would love it,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.256
but I was wrong.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.656
(Laughter)

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.536
These video lectures were a disaster.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.136
I had students coming up to me
and saying things like,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.416
"Mr. Yang, we thought
you were boring in person,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.896
but on video, you are just unbearable."

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.536
(Laughter)

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.896
So as a desperate second attempt,
I began drawing these lectures as comics.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.376
I'd do these very quickly
with very little planning.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.216
I'd just take a sharpie,
draw one panel after the other,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.936
figuring out what I wanted
to say as I went.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.696
These comics lectures would come out

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.816
to anywhere between
four and six pages long,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.816
I'd xerox these, give them to my sub
to hand to my students.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.056
And much to my surprise,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.896
these comics lectures were a hit.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.456
My students would ask me
to make these for them

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.416
even when I could be there in person.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.536
It was like they liked cartoon me
more than actual me.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.616
(Laughter)

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.336
This surprised me, because my students
are part of a generation

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.255
that was raised on screens,

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.496
so I thought for sure they would like
learning from a screen

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.056
better than learning from a page.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.736
But when I talked to my students

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.976
about why they liked
these comics lectures so much,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.376
I began to understand
the educational potential of comics.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.016
First, unlike their math textbooks,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.616
these comics lectures taught visually.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.456
Our students grow up in a visual culture,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.216
so they're used to taking in
information that way.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.016
But unlike other visual narratives,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.856
like film or television
or animation or video,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.736
comics are what I call permanent.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.416
In a comic, past, present and future
all sit side by side on the same page.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.856
This means that the rate
of information flow

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.600
is firmly in the hands of the reader.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.576
When my students didn't understand
something in my comics lecture,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.816
they could just reread that passage
as quickly or as slowly as they needed.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.816
It was like I was giving them
a remote control over the information.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.736
The same was not true
of my video lectures,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.536
and it wasn't even true
of my in-person lectures.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.296
When I speak, I deliver the information
as quickly or slowly as I want.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.696
So for certain students
and certain kinds of information,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.656
these two aspects of the comics medium,
its visual nature and its permanence,

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.336
make it an incredibly powerful
educational tool.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.336
When I was teaching this Algebra 2 class,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.576
I was also working on my master's
in education at Cal State East Bay.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.656
And I was so intrigued by this experience
that I had with these comics lectures

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.776
that I decided to focus
my final master's project on comics.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.776
I wanted to figure out
why American educators

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.016
have historically been so reluctant
to use comic books in their classrooms.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.136
Here's what I discovered.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.816
Comic books first became
a mass medium in the 1940s,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.256
with millions of copies
selling every month,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.416
and educators back then took notice.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.416
A lot of innovative teachers began
bringing comics into their classrooms

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.776
to experiment.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.656
In 1944, the "Journal
of Educational Sociology"

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.256
even devoted an entire issue
to this topic.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.656
Things seemed to be progressing.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.056
Teachers were starting
to figure things out.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.376
But then along comes this guy.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.376
This is child psychologist
Dr. Fredric Wertham,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.336
and in 1954, he wrote a book
called "Seduction of the Innocent,"

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.896
where he argues that comic books
cause juvenile delinquency.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.976
(Laughter)

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.616
He was wrong.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.016
Now, Dr. Wertham was actually
a pretty decent guy.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.096
He spent most of his career
working with juvenile delinquents,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.336
and in his work he noticed
that most of his clients read comic books.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.096
What Dr. Wertham failed to realize
was in the 1940s and '50s,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.256
almost every kid in America
read comic books.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.616
Dr. Wertham does a pretty
dubious job of proving his case,

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.976
but his book does inspire
the Senate of the United States

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.096
to hold a series of hearings

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.120
to see if in fact comic books
caused juvenile delinquency.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.456
These hearings lasted
for almost two months.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.976
They ended inconclusively,
but not before doing tremendous damage

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.176
to the reputation of comic books
in the eyes of the American public.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.536
After this, respectable American
educators all backed away,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.376
and they stayed away for decades.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.856
It wasn't until the 1970s

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.336
that a few brave souls
started making their way back in.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.416
And it really wasn't
until pretty recently,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.136
maybe the last decade or so,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.056
that comics have seen
more widespread acceptance

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.856
among American educators.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.016
Comic books and graphic novels
are now finally making their way

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.896
back into American classrooms

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.736
and this is even happening
at Bishop O'Dowd, where I used to teach.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.656
Mr. Smith, one of my former colleagues,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.616
uses Scott McCloud's
"Understanding Comics"

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.616
in his literature and film class,
because that book gives his students

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.736
the language with which to discuss
the relationship between words and images.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.656
Mr. Burns assigns a comics essay
to his students every year.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.616
By asking his students
to process a prose novel using images,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.176
Mr. Burns asks them to think deeply

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.135
not just about the story

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.176
but also about how that story is told.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.296
And Ms. Murrock uses
my own "American Born Chinese"

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.096
with her English 1 students.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.736
For her, graphic novels

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.536
are a great way of fulfilling
a Common Core Standard.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.456
The Standard states that students
ought to be able to analyze

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.200
how visual elements contribute
to the meaning, tone and beauty of a text.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.976
Over in the library, Ms. Counts
has built a pretty impressive

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.336
graphic novel collection
for Bishop O'Dowd.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.536
Now, Ms. Counts and all
of her librarian colleagues

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.576
have really been at the forefront
of comics advocacy,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.096
really since the early '80s,
when a school library journal article

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.456
stated that the mere presence
of graphic novels in the library

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.256
increased usage by about 80 percent

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.336
and increased the circulation
of noncomics material

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.600
by about 30 percent.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.656
Inspired by this renewed interest
from American educators,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.616
American cartoonists are now producing
more explicitly educational content

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.336
for the K-12 market than ever before.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.536
A lot of this is directed
at language arts,

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.616
but more and more comics
and graphic novels

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.136
are starting to tackle
math and science topics.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.656
STEM comics graphics novels
really are like this uncharted territory,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.120
ready to be explored.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.416
America is finally waking up to the fact

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.616
that comic books
do not cause juvenile delinquency.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.656
(Laughter)

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.856
That they really do belong
in every educator's toolkit.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.216
There's no good reason
to keep comic books and graphic novels

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.296
out of K-12 education.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.976
They teach visually,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.760
they give our students
that remote control.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.216
The educational potential is there

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.976
just waiting to be tapped

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.680
by creative people like you.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.656
Thank you.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.760
(Applause)
