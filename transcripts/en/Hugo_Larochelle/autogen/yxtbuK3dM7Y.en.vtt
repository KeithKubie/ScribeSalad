00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 in his capsule we will see another 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.779
 local search algorithm 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.670
 the algorithm so deserved of will not go so 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.040
 the similarity sentry box of Lenin or in 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.110
 French simulated annealing we can 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.210
 understand as an improvement of 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.340
 the algorithm and the clubbing one tries to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.070
 register to minimize the risk of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.100
 stay trapped in maximums of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.699
 minimal to the premises as is the case 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.529
 in limbo and so in that if 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.470
 what we are going to do is we are going to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.040
 allow to choose as a neighbor 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.120
 immediate 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.989
 a place that is not necessarily the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 better than the nude run so 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.690
 associations had a probability of 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.750
 move to a less immediate neighbor 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.789
 and that should allow me to 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.469
 escape the local optima since a 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.800
 actively blow a minimum maximum 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.809
 local minimum was characterized by 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.300
 does that locally around the neighbors 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.359
 are not so good but if you know enough 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.519
 a probability no he to pass to his 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.950
 neighbors the same if they are not so good 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.590
 may go 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.750
 allow yourself to escape the optima 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 local and then explore others who 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.539
 would not have been accessible otherwise who 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 was not visited otherwise and finally the 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.920
 probability of taking less good 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.509
 neighbors what we will do is that at 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.200
 as the gateway goes 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.110
 run 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.679
 we will gradually decrease this pole 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.079
 TV 2 2 allow a transition to 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.670
 a less good neighbor so that 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.009
 as the execution of 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.929
 the algorithm can converge to a 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.819
 search that will make it look like 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:46.049
 more and more to a search and the 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.640
 gangbÃ© so it's this decrease in 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.009
 probabilities there is going to be controlled because 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.130
 we will call a diagram in English this 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.420
 gift that will determine a series of 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.989
 temperature the temperature will start 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.970
 high then will decrease more and more 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.950
 to converge to zero so by 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.670
 example if we had a pattern of 100 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.380
 operations 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.869
 the size of the schema in effect determine 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.280
 the number of iterations of the algorithm 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.370
 so an example of my home would be 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 started with a temperature of 1 so 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.060
 of allah - 0 it would be equal to 1 next 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.299
 from ce2 to medium so a half a body 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.989
 institude towards a figure that 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:31.319
 would come closer and closer to zero 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:36.030
 there is no pure general recipe design 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.430
 and a schema is the best schema 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.209
 for a given problem your vary from one 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.639
 problem to the other so that's a degree 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.480
 of freedom with which we must 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:51.480
 must handle and tested for different 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.959
 problems to get better from 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.959
 best results 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.940
 here is a future code of the algorithm on 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.590
 gives between is again a one 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.859
 initial as in the camping but in 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.079
 the more the temperature scheme we are going 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:11.099
 declare running then a place a 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.109
 potential neighbor said others 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.710
 variables that are used at each 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:20.400
 iteration and we will use our ne 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.570
 running to the initials to come in took 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.460
 then a number 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.940
 of iterations that will match the 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.890
 number of temperatures in our scheme 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.300
 reconsult each of the temperatures 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.790
 some as a result of the orders of the most 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.090
 big to smallest 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.700
 then we will choose at random 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.320
 so uniformly randomly among 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.370
 the successors of hatred 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.110
 we will choose a place n premium randomly 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.990
 and for this new neighbor there we go 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.420
 determine what is the difference 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.430
 between its objective function and the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.720
 objective function of a court to what we 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.930
 will call here delta now in 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.990
 this variant of civility of the enigma 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.490
 so we maximize if we observe that this 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.380
 difference larger than zero 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.240
 so the objective function to print 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.960
 bigger than the objective function 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.000
 antennas 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.140
 we will make a transition so we will 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.690
 make the transition from n2 to green n 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.270
 between that we would assign m to a 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.010
 premium now his ministry marked 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.270
 that instead delta e would have 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.460
 just use f2m - fcm premium then 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.450
 in this case so are minimized and 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.120
 we detect and print 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.710
 smaller hand club one would have a 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.850
 size difference greater than 0 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.040
 he has in this case we would make a 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.320
 transition so if the only gentleman 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.880
 changes that have been made to adapt 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.850
 this variant the green variant that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.190
 minimizes 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.260
 so that's so if this condition there and 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.600
 possesses following that detail and no more 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.430
 great that 0 we still go 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.650
 to make a transition as a bonus so 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.990
 to assign the common name hate or to 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.810
 hate prime but with a probability 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.610
 which will match the exponential of 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.080
 delta e / our temperature you are so 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.840
 what that means among other things 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.130
 that the probability of doing a 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.290
 transition to a node n premiums go 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.740
 among others depend on how much is 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.930
 what jean py my goals function in 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.350
 making this transition so has the 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.780
 LTTE 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.370
 in this case because we went to 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.880
 7 tab 6 that means that delta and 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:35.270
 negatives or 0 so smaller or 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.300
 equal to zero and more 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.979
 the figure plus the delta is going to be negative 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.139
 but the greater the probability of doing the 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.639
 transition your little one so we'll get 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.310
 allow to make a transition a 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.870
 empire but if the knot is really 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.870
 really worse the policy of doing a 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.889
 transition to a love is smaller 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.330
 but there is another factor that is going 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.500
 influence the politics of doing the 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:00.080
 transition and that's the constant t and 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.690
 so if the constant and that's called 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.250
 temperature if the temperature is very 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.460
 high so let's imagine we had 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.130
 started that a temperature of 100 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.979
 miles and that our territory was 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.260
 relatively small so maybe around 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.510
 1 or 10 per medium donation at least 10 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.000
 in this case this term would be very 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.470
 close to zero and the experience of a 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.760
 figure very close to zero it's going to be 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.500
 close to 1 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.190
 so in this case also with a 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.889
 high temperature for differences 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.289
 of relatively low energy we go in 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.400
 does have a transition part that goes 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.320
 to be very close to 1 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.930
 on the other hand as we want 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:43.240
 decrease the temperature 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:46.539
 so I go so if we had a delta 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.039
 sorry for turkey who was small 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:51.110
 we would actually have a priority to do 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.010
 a transition that has also 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.639
 small 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:07:00.380
 so among others were nearby 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:03.349
 from scratch but in this case also actually 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.120
 we have a constant / a very 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:06.800
 very small so we would have a very small number 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.830
 very high against the negative side 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.660
 so we have nothing very very 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.389
 negative and the exponential to the numbers 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:18.169
 very very negative it's going to be worth 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:19.340
 who herself votes is almost zero so 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:21.650
 the probability for temperatures 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.860
 small to make a transition to an e 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.360
 less good are going to be very very low and 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.070
 so when the temperature is going to be 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.900
 little we will get closer we will be more 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.280
 close to a little research at the hill 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.789
 climbing we will only make 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.180
 transitions to nodes that who 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:37.180
 amelia 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:48.080
 so as I said the layton algorithm 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:49.940
 li ning did it allows him to minimize 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:55.010
 the risks of being trapped in 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:56.930
 however, if they have 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.610
 problems of incivility given the insee that 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:02.150
 we did not yield 2.6 tied between denial of 

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.510
 indefinitely 

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.920
 so we could have a hate then 

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.990
 so that some quality pass 

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.150
 an e which is a little less good by the 

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.490
 next we can come back or not 

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.470
 again we won no place 

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.840
 to come back to both presidents and 

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.250
 institutes so that's something that 

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.410
 is who we can talk about 

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:24.700
 names it to be observed when 

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:28.820
 executes the algorithm 6000 been dominated 

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:32.659
 a way to improve this problem the water 

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.099
 to eliminate it partially it would be or 

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.479
 totally done it would be to record 

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.890
 all the nudes we visited up to 

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:38.990
 now then to stop going 

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.969
 to places already visited and there we 

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:44.450
 begins to approach the algorithm to 

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:45.170
 star and if the name not to target 

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.510
 very very serious 

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:50.650
 it would be practically impossible to 

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.490
 to do that corresponds to costs of 

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.490
 memorization that would be too high 

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.470
 so a slightly less expensive approach 

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:01.460
 it would be just to remember 

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:03.260
 codes last visit us this is the 

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.510
 principle behind the taboo algorithm 

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.370
 search or search tabou in France is 

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.500
 so that's the last we have 

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:13.130
 match that we will call the set 

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.260
 taboo the paramedics it's a 

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.980
 parameter that must be determined by 

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.620
 the user 

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.630
 what are we going to do is we see 

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.930
 actually prevented from making a transition 

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:27.020
 to a place that has already been visited which 

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.940
 is part of the whole taboo and that's 

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.850
 which will allow us to eliminate in 

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.220
 does the oscillations actually it's not going 

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.589
 eliminate them totally 

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:38.480
 but it's actually going to reduce them and the 

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:40.480
 dress which does not align completely 

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.450
 is because we have a memory 

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:46.280
 limited number of people who were visited by 

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.750
 the past it could be that 

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.840
 eventually we forget we already have 

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.630
 visited a certain ne and we have 

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.210
 n because the coming in question was 

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:57.610
 forgotten but we observe in practice 

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:59.170
 this tiny change the 

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:02.080
 works very well to eliminate in good 

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:04.180
 part the oscillations I will add that 

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.960
 it's an option among many others 

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:10.060
 to build a taboo set and you 

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.000
 can consult the book the book between 

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:14.290
 others back from the nordics for 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.510
 to have other ideas on how 

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:24.160
 prevent situations like 

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:27.100
 that's another way to improve the 

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.230
 result obtained by a local search 

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:34.720
 so our algorithm would improve 

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:36.790
 that of bing search in the principle of 

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.010
 bing search actually is that rather than 

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:42.270
 to remember where first a single name 

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:46.660
 current we're actually going to have a set 

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:48.820
 of our courses and in the algorithm of 

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.300
 bing search what are we going to party 

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.980
 is that we will start with a certain 

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.970
 all of our two known 

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.190
 chosen randomly 

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:02.530
 then at each iteration will generate all 

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:04.390
 the successors of these known then 

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.650
 of his so we're going to everything should generate 

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.600
 a number of us that is bigger than 

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.070
 k and when in front and among all the 

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.440
 nodes generated we see remember 

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.440
 only deco better and it will become 

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:18.460
 our new set of known which is going 

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:20.410
 be reused at previous release 

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.380
 to generate a new set of 

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:25.660
 successor and so we will shoot like that 

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.660
 until we reach a certain 

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.520
 number of ration units at limit which 

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.490
 would be again by specified m 

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.750
 by the user 

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.980
 so that allows to initialize the 

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.330
 search at multiple locations 

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.240
 different in our space and 

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:43.060
 maybe to actually explore 

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.590
 several small local word networks and in 

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.990
 maybe even just hoped 

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:49.090
 escape the local optimals that are 

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.700
 less good and focus and on 

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:54.430
 focus on optima that are more 

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:58.450
 promising and possibly optimally 

00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:01.329
 global or the global optimum so we have 

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:04.989
 do business we call this algorithm 

00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:09.339
 precisely local bing search in France 

00:12:04.989 --> 00:12:10.989
 local beam exploration and a 

00:12:09.339 --> 00:12:13.480
 there is also a variant 

00:12:10.989 --> 00:12:15.579
 stochastic of these tags their pace 

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.709
 stochastic bing search or rather than 

00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:20.189
 take the co-best ones actually we have 

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:22.629
 signed a certain probability a 

00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:26.799
 certain probability to take each 

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:28.569
 naked and so we are champion ray 

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:30.189
 what are the following channels that will be 

00:12:28.569 --> 00:12:32.019
 pic wander his oaths the 

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:35.079
 common is better and that's 

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:36.939
 obviously inspired by the algorithm of 

00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:39.220
 simulate dinning but of some 

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:41.949
 generalized way 1 that we would have a 

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:46.290
 together of known rather than having a 

00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:46.290
 only common name at each iteration
