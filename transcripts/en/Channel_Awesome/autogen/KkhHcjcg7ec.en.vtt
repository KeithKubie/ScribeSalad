don't know I don't think it's enough to
 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.430
don't know I don't think it's enough to

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880
said I think it's good I think it's a
 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.359
said I think it's good I think it's a
decent movie so I don't know exactly why

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369
decent movie so I don't know exactly why
 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.400

so many people want me to review it but

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410
so many people want me to review it but
 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.540
so many people want me to review it but
it is one of those requests I keep

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550
it is one of those requests I keep
 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.730
it is one of those requests I keep
getting over and over and over so I'm

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740
getting over and over and over so I'm
 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.889
getting over and over and over so I'm
definitely not doing that one I like the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899
definitely not doing that one I like the
 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:21.300
definitely not doing that one I like the
movie next a goofy movie now I think I

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310

think I know why some people want me to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750
think I know why some people want me to
 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.260
think I know why some people want me to
do this it's probably because whenever

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270
do this it's probably because whenever
 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.390

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.740
backfires unbelievably and this one does
a little bit but I don't think actually

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750
a little bit but I don't think actually
 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.040
a little bit but I don't think actually
it's that bad actually it came out a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050
it's that bad actually it came out a
 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.960
it's that bad actually it came out a

you know it could have been a lot worse
 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.010
you know it could have been a lot worse
um and something actually I do like

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020
um and something actually I do like
 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.630
um and something actually I do like
about the film is that it's neat to see

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640
about the film is that it's neat to see
 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.570
about the film is that it's neat to see

with lilo and Stitch it's neat to see
 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.320
with lilo and Stitch it's neat to see
Disney animation do current things like

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330
Disney animation do current things like
 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.550
Disney animation do current things like
I think it's the first time I've seen a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
I think it's the first time I've seen a
 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.520
I think it's the first time I've seen a
hot tub in a Disney film it looks really

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530
hot tub in a Disney film it looks really
 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.830
hot tub in a Disney film it looks really
odd I mean it's it's me but it's like or

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840
odd I mean it's it's me but it's like or
 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.890
odd I mean it's it's me but it's like or
or an RV you know and things like

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900
or an RV you know and things like
 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.289
or an RV you know and things like
so it's it's certainly for just that

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299
so it's it's certainly for just that
 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.690
so it's it's certainly for just that
reason but on top of that uh I think the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700
reason but on top of that uh I think the
 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.009
reason but on top of that uh I think the
stuff it talks about is actually sort of

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019
stuff it talks about is actually sort of
 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.350
stuff it talks about is actually sort of
legit about a father trying to stay in

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360
legit about a father trying to stay in
 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.880
legit about a father trying to stay in
his son's life but the son wanting to

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890
his son's life but the son wanting to
 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.250
his son's life but the son wanting to
grow up and trying to let the Sun go but

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
grow up and trying to let the Sun go but
 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.920
grow up and trying to let the Sun go but
still have some connection uh I think

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930
still have some connection uh I think
 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.960
still have some connection uh I think
that's all there and I think they

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
that's all there and I think they
 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.979
that's all there and I think they
address it from the most part pretty

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989
address it from the most part pretty
 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.350
address it from the most part pretty
well I think it actually has some very

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360
well I think it actually has some very
