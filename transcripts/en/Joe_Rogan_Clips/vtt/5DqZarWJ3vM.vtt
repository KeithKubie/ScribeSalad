1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.390
Dear man,
I think maybe talking Duany to come to California.
Really?

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.090
I Dunno.
I'm got to get them used to that beach life.
Yeah.
I mean he,

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.100
so he's been coming down like my fight camp was 10 weeks long from four with him

4
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:14.731
I was longer,

5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:18.180
but with him it was 10 weeks and he was flying out three days a week.

6
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.400
So every Monday he would land,
he would leave Wednesday night.
Wow.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.870
And we train Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday and the hard right.

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.990
I make sure to take like Thursday off and then do my other stuff while he's
gone.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.440
But every week he was traveling back and forth and dedication right there.
Dude.

10
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:35.400
I have a family now,
you know,
like yeah,
he's lived in my house.

11
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:39.120
Like he's on the meal plans with the cal vetoes,
like he's full bore into it.

12
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:43.410
Like he gives me is all,
I'm a very fortunate person that I've met Dwayne.

13
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.290
And it's an amazing relationship or relationship.
Yeah.
How close it is.

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.270
It really is.
And I mean,
that's the ideal when you can get a mentor in a,
in a,

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.650
a student that have that kind of a bond together and you can learn so much.
Yeah.

16
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:58.620
And he won't let,
like we have such a good bond now too,

17
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.190
that he won't like let bullshit slide won't be pumping me up for no reason.

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.040
Right.
You won't like,
let me,
I mean,
I'm not a lazy guy,
but if I was,

19
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.740
he wouldn't let me like miss practice or,
you know,
I mean,

20
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:10.290
he almost has to pull me back more than anything,
but,
uh,

21
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.840
he gives me this true assessment of what needs to be done.
Um,

22
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.110
I obviously lost the suit pseudo,
we got home and he had sent texts.

23
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.300
Music had come out tomorrow.
I'm gonna work out with a warm,

24
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:23.870
but I'd love to get some working with you.
We just,
some things we should go over.

25
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:25.500
I was like,
alright.
Wow.

26
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.410
So like I was working out with him three days after the fight.

27
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.470
What did he say about that exchange?
Um,
he says like,
he,

28
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.330
maybe he needs a change and things on the midst and maybe like,
so for instance,

29
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:39.360
the whole exchange,
uh,
I think I closed the distance too hard.

30
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.930
Henry Su to switched up who he was as a fighter.
I think he came out differently,

31
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.350
which was great by him.
He's done great things.
He,
um,

32
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.020
I expected him to maybe run a little bit more and he came out aggressive.
Um,

33
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.170
and so getting used to the distance control,
you know,

34
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:55.700
not always having a set plan and,
and going for those Combos,

35
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.200
what I think's going to happen to be able to adjust on the fly.

36
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.281
And maybe me and him,

37
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:03.970
sometimes we are too set on certain things rather than um,

38
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.400
reaction type stuff,
you know,

39
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.190
and I need to react to distance change and you'd wrecked the things like that.

40
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.880
It's hard to really change anything on that fight because I didn't get a chance

41
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.490
to see it either.
You know,
it was so,
so quick.

42
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.480
Now do have you talked to Dana or anyone since,

43
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.990
I know you said that you guys would talk in the future,
but it's been about what,

44
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:25.230
how many days?
It's been about a week or so has been to uh,

45
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.070
about a week and a half.
It's been a week and a half now.
Yeah.
Um,

46
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.170
I haven't heard anything since the,
the day after the fight.

47
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.260
I was texting with them that after the fight and he said they had to sit down

48
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:36.390
and figure out what the plane is kind of thing,
you know.
Um,

49
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.710
but obviously everyone knows that,

50
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:42.540
that we want to run it back and it sounds like they do as well too,
so.

51
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.970
Well as far as something that people want to watch,

52
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:48.750
whether it's at 35 or 25 I think people absolutely would like to see that.

53
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.620
I mean at 35 the big selling point would be Henry gets a chance to become champ

54
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:55.950
champ.
Of course,
they all fight him at 25,000 for my 35 pound belt on the line.

55
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.120
I really,
it works that way.
I know it doesn't,
but I'm saying like,
if you beat me,

56
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.460
I was like,
I seriously,
like,
I wouldn't even tell him.

57
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.560
I just seriously don't even care.
Like the belts are awesome.

58
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.830
All that stuff in the and recognition,
all that stuff.
But to me,
I'd want that.

59
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.664
I want that one back.

60
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.730
I want that opportunity back to even just show how much work in how smart I was

61
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.290
and how I didn't get,

62
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:21.280
I didn't get hit and I wasn't fragile from being at 25 I really wasn't like,

63
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:25.060
it wasn't like,
um,
I didn't get beat because I was a 25 pounder.
I have felt,

64
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.520
I have no excuses.
I got beat because I got beat.
Right.

65
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.570
I have no excuses that I was too fragile at being at one 25 is I felt better

66
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:34.870
than I've ever felt my entire life.
I just want the chance to prove that.

67
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.680
You know what I mean?

68
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.340
So that's why I say that I would give him my built at 35 beats me at 25 again,

69
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.900
but,
well,
obviously take the fight wherever.
I mean,
I think Ali needed Frazier,

70
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.750
right?
Sugar Ray needed Tommy Hearns.
I mean,
this is just,

71
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.600
this is the nature of the sport and a guy like him.
I mean,
I think you,

72
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.200
you and Cody needed each other.
Yeah.

73
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.040
I think there's something about that kind of intense rivalry that is so

74
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:01.910
important for,
for,
for actualizing,
for pseudos a motherfucker.

75
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.750
Man,
he's good and he's a,
he's a world is a Olympic gold medalist.

76
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:07.540
He's a competitor.
He knows what he's doing.
Right.
Let me just,

77
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.510
arguably from his accomplishments is one of the greatest combat sports athletes

78
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:11.344
of all time.

79
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.820
The first guy ever to be an Olympic gold medalist and a UFC world champion,

80
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.320
which I,
the gold medalist thing.

81
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:21.580
I even hold even higher for him than even the being like obviously UFC
champions.

82
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:23.500
Huge,
right?
But I wrestled my whole life.

83
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:26.980
I grew up wrestling and to be an Olympic gold medalist is a fucking huge thing.

84
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.220
Um,
I still think today wrestling is the hardest sport I've ever done.

85
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.670
And just to see that achievement,
especially young,
he did it at,
that's,

86
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.690
I almost hold that higher than him being a UFC champion.
Well,

87
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:40.540
also the fact that he was beat by Dj,

88
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:44.270
he beat by beat by mighty mouse in the first round.
He gets destroyed.

89
00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:49.030
He gets need to the body,
taken out,
beaten up and stopped and humiliated.

90
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.780
Right.
Comes back.
And what was it like two years later?

91
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.760
I think it was deep and beats him.
I mean,
becomes the fucking champion.

92
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:01.660
Beats the pound for pound consensus.
Best fighter on the planet.

93
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.520
And the guy that had held that title from the very first time it was ever

94
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.150
brought to the UFC,
he's been the only flyweight champion until Henry came along.

95
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:13.120
So,
and that's another reason why I want that fight,
man.
Like,

96
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:14.980
you know what I mean?
Like I know that I'm better than him.

97
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.780
Obviously you're going to give me,

98
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:19.000
some people are going to give me shit for saying that because obviously the

99
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:21.520
fight they failed.
Think he went down the way it went down.
But guess what?

100
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.290
I'm better than that motherfucker and I want to prove it.

101
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.530
I want the toughest fights.
I mean that's why I was calling out Max Holloway.

102
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.280
I want to,
I want to be interviewed.
I want to call Max haul away with Sam Kalvia.

103
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:33.820
I can be walking around 165 pounds with 6% body fat,

104
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.720
you know 100% like this guy,
man,
he can stack the weight on me.

105
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:41.390
You can take it off me.
I can go.
I have a secret weapon was Sam cal veto.

106
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.280
I'm telling you and I could've had a secret.
You just,
yeah,
he blurted it out.

107
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.430
But people,
he won't work with everyone.
He won't do it.
Yeah.

108
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:52.420
If you come to him like unless you fit who we,
he likes.
If he fit his image,

109
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:56.290
like what does that look like?
We work out of his garage,
which is so crazy.

110
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:59.690
You know,
like he could have a giant facility with all his hard work and science.

111
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.900
He does,
but he likes the,
the grit of having any just house.

112
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.690
Like he gets home from work,
he's all dressed up in his tie,

113
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.670
sometimes were already there waiting for him and he's doesn't even change.

114
00:06:08.671 --> 00:06:11.330
He's out there throwing medicine balls that are facing his tie and I'll just up

115
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:14.560
from the soup from work,
you know,
like he likes that shit.
You know,

116
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.360
that's something I might not even be a calculus teacher anymore and just be a

117
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:20.270
string conditioning coach.
But that's not what he wants.
You know,

118
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.820
he's not in it for the fame and the money.

119
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:26.480
He's in it for the science and the love of doing it.
I want to see that garage.

120
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.030
You pull it,
pull up his garage because this doesn't,

121
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.750
now I'm thinking about how big my fucking gym out here is.

122
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.620
You couldn't even park two cars in it.
This is,
it's,
it's a small garage.

123
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:41.420
We have one,
uh,
one squat rack.
We have a spot to do,
like our cleans and our,

124
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:46.340
um,
dead lifts.
What he really has his,
he has three,

125
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.240
four by,
I don't know,
three bites.
There it is.
Yeah.
That's crazy.

126
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:52.690
So it's a very small two car garage.
Yeah.

127
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.070
That has got filled with a bunch of murderers.
Yeah.

128
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:58.760
He's got like three bikes and we ride bikes and walking by,
if you were a girl.

129
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.030
Oh Dude,
all the time.
People,
old people walk by all the time.

130
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:02.860
We're in the garage and I,

131
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.580
I'm yelling when I'm in there working out cause he's pushing like signs.

132
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.900
Our workouts are three hours long,
you know,
and we're going,

133
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.020
there's a park across the street and we're throwing medicine balls at each other

134
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:14.840
and go to that.
Back to that last one with Pico please.
Yeah.

135
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:16.880
You get a chance to see what's in the garage.

136
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.240
So I guess he parks his car in the driveway.
Oh yeah,
he doesn't,
he doesn't park.

137
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.340
That's the sanctuary man.
That's crazy.

138
00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.550
He's got these stationary bikes in there that where he kills us on.
That's like,

139
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:28.440
um,
how we push our lactate threshold.
So what does he,

140
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.970
he's doing something with bands right here.
Yeah,
that's true.

141
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:32.600
A lot of things with bands,
right?
Yeah.

142
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:35.390
Cause you get the east centric and concentric contraction.
You know,

143
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:37.310
you have a straight and he's like,
we're just doing it.

144
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:40.730
There's for your shoulder stability,
you rotator cuffs.
I mean yeah,

145
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.000
with the Jujitsu and the wrestling,
your shoulders take a beating.
Yeah.

146
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.480
And so that's kind of really does strengthen it.
Yeah.

147
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.720
I do a lot of cuff stuff because all the different injuries that I've had.

148
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:55.130
I do a lot of band stuff with my,
you know,
yep.
This way,
the external rotation,

149
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:58.010
internal rotation stuff.
Yeah.
Bands are great.
Now,

150
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:02.510
why bands though as a PR as opposed to cables,
like cables with a stacks.
Wait,

151
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.170
why does you use bands?
By just what's what we have.
I mean,

152
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:09.980
if he had a nice Kaiser machine in there,
maybe we'd use it.
But I think,
um,

153
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.960
the resistance coming back really,

154
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:14.120
really wants to support the further you extend a band,

155
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:17.030
the harder wants to pull you back to where when you have a weight on there,

156
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:20.420
it's the exact same weight going in and out toward the further you extend that

157
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:22.370
band,
the harder you make it on yourself.
There's,

158
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:25.370
I think there's just more you can do with it and it's just very easy and it

159
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:29.750
takes up no space.
Right,
right.
We do a lot of medicine ball work,
um,

160
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.970
for our core and for our shoulders as well too,

161
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:36.200
like catching and weird angles with keeping our balance.
Um,

162
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:41.230
we do like a lot of like kind of like old school shit but in a certain way.

163
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:45.860
In a certain time.
Yeah.
And so how does he get all that shit into his garage?

164
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:47.780
Does he have to pull stuff out into the driveway?

165
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.190
There's stuff on the side of his house.

166
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:53.690
He's got like a little Chessy stack stuff into and um,
man,

167
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.140
we,
a lot of it's,
it doesn't need much.
It really doesn't.
And there's a,

168
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.300
there's a lot of work you can do with just body weight,

169
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.330
but I mean we have a hundred pound medicine balls.
We got these big logs.

170
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.050
He makes it like,
it's almost like a,
the strong man competitions.
There's a big,

171
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.220
there's a big hill next to his house that he makes his carry these like hundred

172
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.830
pound logs and we at the farmer's carry him up the hill and we are doing with a

173
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:14.191
partner.

174
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:17.010
And when I get up so far I dropped my run back and get a hundred pound medicine

175
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:19.200
ball at the sprint up the hill with it.

176
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.610
Things like that where you're pushing your your lactate threshold over time.
Wow.

177
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.510
Yeah.

178
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.570
<v 1>And how does he schedule The training sessions?</v>

179
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:29.280
Like how does he know what to have you do?

180
00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.380
<v 0>One off of our timeframe of when we want to peak off of my heart rate</v>

181
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:37.230
variability and how my body's reacting to our training.

182
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:40.320
Cause maybe I sparred and I had met too hard with Dwayne,

183
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:44.010
so I wake up the next morning and he realizes,
oh we've got to pull back today.

184
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.640
Like if I push you hard today,
you're going to go in such a deep hole.

185
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:51.330
This is going to take you a week to come out of it to where he only wants me to

186
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:52.710
get to that really high peak,

187
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.880
take a day off so that now I can start coming back up again to where if I just

188
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.050
continue for four or five days,
just crushing it quite as hard as I possibly can.

189
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.110
My body is going to crash so hard.
That's going to take me,

190
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:06.390
it's going to be more of a detriment to come out of that hole.

191
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.500
Then if I would've just taken a break in between those days,
so he'll,

192
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:12.200
he'll sketch.
They are,
schedules will change.
We have a,

193
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.180
we have a schedule from the beginning,
so Sam,
12 weeks out.
Like,
all right,

194
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.500
this is our plan so we're going to do,

195
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.420
but then maybe I get sick or maybe I've trained too hard with Dwayne the day

196
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.450
before and so he'll realize all right,
this next day was a little bit easier.

197
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.810
Even if it's my Jujitsu,
he knows I'm going to do to practice.
He's like,

198
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.840
maybe just drill,
you know,
go flip page.

199
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.500
Just make sure it's like a low base drill.

200
00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:33.900
Like don't get your heart rate over such and such,

201
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.490
which I don't roll with the heart rate monitor on,

202
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:40.260
but I can can kind of just guess.
You know how hard I need to go.
Yeah.
Could you,

203
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.070
<v 1>I guess you could just,
you buddy,</v>

204
00:10:42.071 --> 00:10:45.160
do you know anybody who does [inaudible] now it seems like it would get knocked

205
00:10:45.161 --> 00:10:48.020
off or something.
I mean,
maybe for drilling.
Yeah.
You know,

206
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:53.250
so when he's got you doing all this crazy stuff like dead lifts and pliers and

207
00:10:53.621 --> 00:10:56.500
all medicine ball work,
um,
does,

208
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.770
is there like a logic to what exercises are done when and like how does he like,

209
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:06.280
cause it seems like you're doing all this old school stuff like Badass stuff,

210
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:10.560
but my question is always like when do you do that?
Yes.

211
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.050
When is that,
when is that done?
Like once a week.

212
00:11:14.051 --> 00:11:17.650
Is that done early in the training camp?
Is it done late?

213
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.500
Like when are you doing strength work and your,

214
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.660
cause you were saying you were doing cleans like the week out.

215
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.410
<v 0>Only us.
So when I'm doing those like a week I'm doing,</v>

216
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:29.740
I'm only a certain amount of reps,
um,
you know,
I'm not,

217
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.120
maybe not taxing my body for as long as I would an earlier camp and even though

218
00:11:34.121 --> 00:11:36.250
I'm going heavy,
maybe I'm only doing two sets,
you know,

219
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.860
just to keep my central nervous system strong

220
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.370
other than just taxing yourself,
you know.

221
00:11:42.371 --> 00:11:44.800
Or there's certain times like there are certain days he needs,

222
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:48.900
I need to get explosive power work.
Or some days I needed you.
Cadence,
fast food,

223
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.110
fast feet,
um,

224
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.820
cardio work and he has that all out on what days or what,

225
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.030
what weeks are what?
Depending on where I'm at,

226
00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.650
my fight camp or if I'm going 25 and if I want to stay as strong as it was at
35,

227
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.760
things like that.
Or if I end up going 45,
um,
to be able to keep my,
my,

228
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.430
my cardio up.
Because the thing was if I ever,
if I were to go 45,

229
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:10.780
I'm gonna have to put so much more muscle on.

230
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:12.880
The worry is that I'm going to lose cardio.
Right.

231
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.060
And nobody wants to be able to keep that lactate threshold and me keep my cardio

232
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:19.690
if I'm able to walk around at 165 pounds.
Now,

233
00:12:19.691 --> 00:12:23.080
what other stuff does he have you doing for recovery?
You're doing a sauna work.

234
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:27.430
Are you doing ice baths?
Like what kind of stuff?
I have an infrared sauna.
I do,

235
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:31.550
I'm a do red light therapy.
I do.
Um,

236
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.380
uh,
what do you mean by red light therapy?

237
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.430
There's a machine that I have in my house,
it's called a juve.
It's,

238
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:40.780
I'm a big red light.

239
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:45.550
It says 680 to 880 nanometer light that I stand in front of it for a certain

240
00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:48.880
amount of time to,
um,
not only increased my testosterone,

241
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:53.170
but to help recovery in my,
uh,
my mitochondria,
my cells and flushing my body out.

242
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.340
Um,
uh,
what does that thing look like?
Whoa.
Look at that dude.

243
00:12:57.341 --> 00:13:00.370
You're in the future is that,
you know,

244
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.470
[inaudible] there's jacked.
Yeah.
Um,
but yeah,
I have one of those in my garage.

245
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:09.610
I have a infrared sauna in my garage.
Um,
I do,
how big is that thing?

246
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.800
Is that there's new ones now that are huge.
I get as big as my body.
Um,

247
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:16.090
they have ones that go in the back of your door.

248
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:18.670
They have travel ones you can take with you.
That's really small.

249
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.160
The reason why I got into it,
it was for a,
um,

250
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.870
increasing my testosterone and the utility of my sperm Holla.
Yeah.
Cause I was,

251
00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:28.300
I was,
I was having,
um,

252
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:33.140
my session was low and I wanted to increase it and I saw this,
um,

253
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.590
through Matt Brown,
actually,
Matt Brown is the one that kind of got me this one.

254
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:36.980
I was out in Colorado,
shout out to the,

255
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.190
he's got some awesome training equipment and shot.
He's,

256
00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:42.910
and he's a very knowledgeable,
very well read guy.
And a,

257
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:46.240
you wouldn't like pure wouldn't guess that why when I had him on the podcast,

258
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:47.850
that's one thing a lot of people said they go,

259
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.830
I thought that the guy was a caveman.
Right.
Kind of is.

260
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.630
He's also kind of brilliant.
He wants to be the caveman like manly man.

261
00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:00.520
But he's very smart about it.
Yeah.
Um,
so he's the one that turned me onto that.

262
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:03.130
And so I got into it and uh,

263
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.120
I want to increase my testosterone but also read about,
um,

264
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.470
increasing motility and my spare time I was trying to have a kid and were having

265
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:11.590
trouble and this and that.
And it could be,
that could have been my diet.

266
00:14:11.591 --> 00:14:14.830
I switched so much up that I can't tell you which one it was.
You know,

267
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.210
cause Sam helped me out.
This helped me out.
I mean,
so I'm doing that.

268
00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:22.000
I'll do a hyperbaric chamber,
I'll do cryo therapy.

269
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.070
How often do you do the hyperbaric chamber?
Um,

270
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.460
only when I need it because it can mess with your,
um,

271
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.400
your hermatocrit you know,

272
00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:31.690
if I'm going to do a lot of altitude training as well too,

273
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.240
I'm trying to increase my red blood cell count and my hematocrit.
Um,

274
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.140
and then when you go,
when you get into a,
a heartbreak chamber,

275
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:41.350
you're breathing 100% oxygen.
So if I'm in too much,

276
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.840
so lower my hematic career,
right?
But I do a lot of,
here's the altitude Ms,

277
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:50.450
same as an altitude machine he has me used is called Alto lab.
Um,

278
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.550
I breathe into it for a certain amount of time and it's again,

279
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:55.340
another program he created.
The company was around,

280
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:59.510
but he created the program that I'm supposed to do to put my body in a hypoxic

281
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:03.110
state for only a certain amount of time because you can overtrain yourself that

282
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:06.840
way as well to,
um,
to increase my capillaries,
um,

283
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.780
increase the date of vasodilation and my veins as well as increase red blood,

284
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.670
increase increased red blood cells.
