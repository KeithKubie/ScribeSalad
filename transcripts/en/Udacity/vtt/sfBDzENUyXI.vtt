00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.590
Here's one way of doing that. Say, I want to take three

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.970
breaks throughout the day. I will use the break count variable to

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.170
keep count of the number of breaks I've taken. And then

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.910
add a while loop, to make sure that this code runs three

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.810
times. By the way, if you want to see some information on

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.710
how while loops work, there is a helpful link in the instructor

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.080
notes. Now, if I run this program. The program will wait

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.280
for ten seconds and play the song and do that three times.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.350
Another handy addition to our program can be a print

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.400
statement that tells us when our program began. Now, how

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.370
do I find the current time? When I have to

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.900
do some testing like this, I start to use this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.650
output window, so I can import time here. Which, as

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.830
you may guess, is a way to access time. And

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.470
I know there is a function called ctime, or current

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.230
time. That seems like the current time on my computer. Great.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.260
Back to the main program where I'll add this. Let me save and run this program.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.720
Now, as soon as I run the program, I get a prompt, suggesting when I started the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.488
program. Ten seconds after that, a video

00:01:10.488 --> 00:01:15.882
is played which asks me to take a break

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:17.120
[MUSIC].

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.970
So far so good. Another ten seconds pass

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.190
by and another suggestion to take a break.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.610
[MUSIC]

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.150
Now, if I want to stop this program

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.280
midway, I can either restart IDLE or use Ctrl+C

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.710
in the shell window, which will stop the execution

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.400
of the program when it comes back from sleep.
