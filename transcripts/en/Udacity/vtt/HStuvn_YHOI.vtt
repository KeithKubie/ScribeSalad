00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.059
Here's the perspective projection matrix. I hate it when objects get clipped by

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.563
the near plane. What happens if I set the near distance to zero? The

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:11.968
homogeneous coordinates cannot be turned into NDCs. All the resulting NDC Z

00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:16.893
values are zero. The X and Y values become mirrored, i.e, negated. The

00:00:16.893 --> 00:00:19.530
resulting NDC Z values are almost all one.
