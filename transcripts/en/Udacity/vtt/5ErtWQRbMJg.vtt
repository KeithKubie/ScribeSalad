00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.250
In this lesson, we'll talk about the web

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.710
and how web caches can improve web performance.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.680
We will study, in particular, the hyper-text transfer

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.130
protocol, or HTTP, which is an application layer

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.510
protocol to transfer web content. It's the protocol

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.250
that your web browser uses to request web

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.620
pages, and it's also the protocol that the

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.970
responses, or the web pages. Or the objects

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.610
that are returned as part of a webpage are returned to your browser. Your web

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.550
browser makes requests for webpages, and the pages and the objects in the page

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.680
come back as responses. HTTP is typically layered on

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.180
top of a byte stream protocol, which is almost always TCP. The client

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.070
sends a request to a server, asking for web content and the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.860
server responds with the content often encoded in text. The

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.210
server maintains no information about past client requests. Thus

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.750
we say the server is stateless. Let's take a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.020
quick look into the format of HTTP requests, and responses.
