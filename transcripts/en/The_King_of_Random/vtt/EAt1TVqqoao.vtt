00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.520
Hey what's up guys? We are back in the lab today with another random experiment with high voltage

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.780
Electricity for this experiment today. I'm bringing back my 12,000 volt neon sign transformer as well as this thing. This is the Jacob's ladder

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.730
I built for my mad science Minion project

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.719
And it allows an Arc of electricity to flow upward over and over and over again

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.890
Now if you go back in time and consider the electrical genius of Nikola Tesla

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
He didn't have access to solid state capacitors and relays like we do today instead

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.299
He used things like glass aluminum foil and saltwater to build capacitor banks for his experiments for this experiment today

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.360
I thought it'd be fun to build a simple saltwater capacitor bank and for that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.369
We're just going to need a glass bottle like these glass bottles of coke I picked up from the grocery store and some aluminium foil

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120
we want to get started by taking the caps off the top or moving the liquid from inside and

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.739
Replacing it with water salt water to be exact after that we're just going to use a little bit of aluminum

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.439
Foil or some aluminum tape I got from the hardware store to wrap around the outside and our capacitor is basically going to be complete

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.869
So let's gather up those materials and get to work

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.489
These bottles aren't really the best bottles because they've got an abnormal shape it would be better to have straight walls, but whatever

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.409
So here's what we've just done guys these bottles didn't actually have any labels on them

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.739
So there are no labels to remove so we just took a simple piece of aluminum

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.600
Foil wrapped it around and then crushed it down

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.710
So they're molded to the shape of the glass now the smoother you can get the aluminum the better

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.079
This is going to work, but I think these are going to serve our purpose very well

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.659
I took another sheet of aluminum, and I folded it over into strands to form these makeshift aluminum wires

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.689
They're going to go right down into the center of these bottles

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.029
It looked like a nice little metallic soda

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.449
Ready to go so I'll have to do now is put the liquid inside and for that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.259
We're using water with a little bit of salt now to mix up our saltwater concoction

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.639
I just filled up this little glass dish with some water and picked up some of this real sea salt

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.199
We could use the sea salt from a previous experiment if we wanted to we're going to do is take some of this we're going

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.039
To dump it into the water we're going to mix it around for a couple of minutes and tell as much that salt has been

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.730
able to absorb into the water as possible

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.789
They're just important to our bottle is until it comes up and relatively matches the top line of the aluminum foil here

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620
That should be pointed

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.519
Now just refined. I took all these glass bottles and turn them all into capacitors well

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.440
And all looks exactly the same except for this one

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.960
The foil is a little bit lower, but that's not going to make that big of difference

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.190
This is the basic capacitor because on the inside the saltwater itself acts as the capacitive plate the glass is the dielectric on the outside

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.639
The aluminum foil acts as the other plate to help build up that electric charge

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.059
Now capacitors have so many wide range of uses in electronics

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.839
I'm not going to get into the theories about why capacitors are important instead

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.010
I want to show you what kind of difference these simple little devices make when we hook them up to our Jacob's ladder

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.529
So let's talk about the Jacob's ladder for just a second

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.049
When we take our two high voltage electrodes and connect them to the terminal the electricity will Arc at the path of least resistance?

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.409
Which is right down here at the bottom where the two points are closest?

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.089
Now as our keeps up the air around it the Arc will naturally want to travel upward and as it does

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.930
Electricity will continue to flow through it because that Arc is the path of least resistance

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.779
Until it gets high enough to get stretched out so far a snap at which point it starts again at the bottom and repeats that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.880
process over and over again now just for fun

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.510
Let's go ahead and hook up our little saltwater

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.390
Capacitor in parallel with the system and see what kind of a difference it makes of that arc, so here's the quick setup

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.590
I've got for a parallel circuit

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.230
We've still got our high voltage electrode running to this one terminal

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.139
But now you can see an alligator clip joins it and runs through this wire connecting the wire that goes down inside the bottle

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.779
Now on the other side we have a second alligator clip that's not connected to anything the high voltage wire that's not connected to anything

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.819
We have the outside of the bottle that's covered in the aluminum foil the idea is that if I connect these together?

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.290
We'll see the same reaction

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.730
We did before but the second we touched them to the outside of the bottle that reaction should change just a little

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.730
We have our high voltage line connect them together

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.830
And we have the same reaction. We saw before that's great

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.859
We connect to the outside of the bottle here

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.590
We get some cool Corona

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.879
That looks pretty sweet by itself, but nothing happens with the Jacob ladder until we make contact with the other alligator clip as well watch

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.140
That's a little bit of a different reaction isn't it we go from the beautiful Arc that travels upward to a very very sharp arc

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.180
that stays down near the bottom

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.789
That smell we're smelling right now is ozone. We are literally generating Ozone right now

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.870
Which is actually poisonous, but not in small concentrations. So we're good

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.330
the other thing you might notice about this is it's

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.269
Incredibly loud in fact this reaction is so loud it might be a good idea to use earplugs because my ears are ringing

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.960
This is literally like mini lightning bolts shooting off on our workbench here, and it's not only happening on the Jacob's ladder

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.670
But you can see when I get close to the bottle itself

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.629
We can shoot both of lightning between the electrodes and the aluminum foil on the outside

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.960
It's amazing to think just a little bit of salt water a little bit of aluminum foil

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.119
And a coke bottle can have such a dramatic difference

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.289
But what happens if we take it to the next level and connect all the bottles together?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.900
That's going on next

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.780
(laughs)

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.139
We've done it guys we've taken our six coke bottles

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:17.829
We've lined them up in parallel so all six bottles are connected on the outside and the interiors as well, alright guys

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.680
I've just hooked my system up in parallel let me show you how I've rigged it

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.729
I've got two alligator clips with the high voltage terminals going into them. So we turn on the system

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.689
We should see the Jacob's ladder perform as normal one alligator clips runs to the top

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.609
Which is already in place the second one is waiting to be touch to the side so as the system is running

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.909
We'll be able to touch this in real time with one hand behind my back and see exactly what difference. It makes here we go

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.339
So you can see the Jacob's ladder is performing as normal now when I touch this to our capacitor bank

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.819
It's going to energize the capacitor, and we'll see what difference that makes here we go

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
That is loud

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.769
And you can see I can actually touch any of the bottles, and it has the same effect

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.079
No matter how high that arc is the second I touch the bottle it jumps back to the bottom

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:13.280
and

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.899
That's because there's so much power that the air current can't lift it. It's driving straight through the point of least resistance there

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.359
Now the reason I have one hand behind my back is because if I accidentally touch this there is enough electric potential it could stop

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.130
My heart we're jumping up into higher voltage and higher amperage and that is a dangerous combination

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.299
If I hold this to the constant distance you can see it takes a second for the charge to build up

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.870
But then it will start sparking when that charge is high enough to jump the gap

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:50.079
That's actually very similar to how lightning works. You've got the clouds and you've got the ground that acts as these capacitive plates

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:53.109
You've got the air in the middle. That's the dielectric and when the breakdown is enough

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.440
You have a bolt of lightning that connects the two and equalized the charges

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:02.049
So very dangerous stuff to be playing with so you can see it's very mesmerizing

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.960
And now my whole workshop smells like Ozone

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.690
Which is the smell you smell after a thunderstorm after all the lightning strikes. So there you have a guy's very cool experiment

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.709
You can do with some glass bottles and some aluminum foil to build yourself a simple electrical

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:19.479
Capacitor not very practical this day and age but they are the kind of technology that was used by Tesla

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:24.069
Thanks for joining us for this mad science experiment today. I'll be looking for in the next video talk to ya then

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.820
This is the Jacob's ladder. I built for my

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:35.109
This is the Jacob's ladder. I built for my a mad. This is the Jacob's ladder

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:41.110
I built for my mad science minion project and it allows an arc of electricity to flow upward over and over and over again

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:47.259
