access you know it is there's the
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.749
access you know it is there's the
potential to have access to technology

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759
potential to have access to technology
 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.710
potential to have access to technology
people in developing economies often own

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720
people in developing economies often own
 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.609
people in developing economies often own
smartphones and technologies that

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
smartphones and technologies that
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.830
smartphones and technologies that
equivalent rates to people in the

equivalent rates to people in the
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840
equivalent rates to people in the
developed world I'd felt quite often

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
developed world I'd felt quite often
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.279

they'll have that before they even have

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
they'll have that before they even have
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.670
they'll have that before they even have
sanitation in some cases so the

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680
sanitation in some cases so the
 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.900
sanitation in some cases so the
pervasive nature of technology is one of

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
pervasive nature of technology is one of
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.120
pervasive nature of technology is one of
the most important features of it the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
the most important features of it the
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.160
the most important features of it the
other important feature is just a rate

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
other important feature is just a rate
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.459
other important feature is just a rate
and pace enriched adoption is actually

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
and pace enriched adoption is actually
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.040
and pace enriched adoption is actually
occurring just to put some comparative

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
occurring just to put some comparative
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.690
occurring just to put some comparative
numbers on this if you think about

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
numbers on this if you think about
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.270
numbers on this if you think about
television it took something like 38

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
television it took something like 38
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.090
television it took something like 38
years before television penetration got

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
years before television penetration got
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.970
years before television penetration got
to the first 50 million people it took

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
to the first 50 million people it took
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.319

Twitter nine months so just the rate and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
Twitter nine months so just the rate and
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.900

acceleration which adoption occurs is

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
acceleration which adoption occurs is
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.569
acceleration which adoption occurs is
pretty phenomenal and then the other

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
pretty phenomenal and then the other
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.860
pretty phenomenal and then the other
feature that becomes very interesting

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
feature that becomes very interesting
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.560
feature that becomes very interesting
about technology is not just its pace

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
about technology is not just its pace
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.840
about technology is not just its pace
and scale and the rate of innovation but

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
and scale and the rate of innovation but
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120
and scale and the rate of innovation but
the economic aspects of Technology so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
the economic aspects of Technology so
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.460
the economic aspects of Technology so
when you have things in digital form

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
when you have things in digital form
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.190
when you have things in digital form
that actually the profound impact on how

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
that actually the profound impact on how
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440
that actually the profound impact on how
it affects the economics of things so

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
it affects the economics of things so
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.770
it affects the economics of things so
digital technologies have this feature

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780
digital technologies have this feature
 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.390
digital technologies have this feature
that have that you know economists think

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
that have that you know economists think
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.429
that have that you know economists think
of it as the non-rivalry and then

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
of it as the non-rivalry and then
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.560
of it as the non-rivalry and then
excludability of it what that means is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
excludability of it what that means is
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749
excludability of it what that means is
that my use of something that's in

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
that my use of something that's in
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.789
that my use of something that's in
digital form doesn't necessarily as a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
digital form doesn't necessarily as a
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.370
digital form doesn't necessarily as a
physical technological matter preclude

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
physical technological matter preclude
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.410
physical technological matter preclude
your use of it the good news about that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
your use of it the good news about that
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.830
your use of it the good news about that
is that from a user standpoint this is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
is that from a user standpoint this is
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.719
is that from a user standpoint this is
all good because it's what economists

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
all good because it's what economists
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.149
all good because it's what economists
talk about is consumer surplus so the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
talk about is consumer surplus so the
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.889
talk about is consumer surplus so the
fact that it doesn't cost us that much

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
fact that it doesn't cost us that much
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.710
fact that it doesn't cost us that much
more to get access to information with

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
more to get access to information with
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.620
more to get access to information with
its educational material entertainment

its educational material entertainment
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.410
its educational material entertainment
material that's all good for us is as

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
material that's all good for us is as
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.440
material that's all good for us is as
consumers I think it puts new challenges

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
consumers I think it puts new challenges
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.319
consumers I think it puts new challenges
for companies because now you have to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
for companies because now you have to
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.830
for companies because now you have to
think about how do you generate revenues

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
think about how do you generate revenues
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.569
think about how do you generate revenues
and monetize this we've seen how

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
and monetize this we've seen how
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.520
and monetize this we've seen how
technology is caused you know with these

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
technology is caused you know with these
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.069
technology is caused you know with these
marginal cost economics disruptions in

marginal cost economics disruptions in
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.930
marginal cost economics disruptions in
many many many many industries whether

generally good in the sense that it's

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819
generally good in the sense that it's
 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.089

all you know useful information that you

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099
all you know useful information that you
 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.910
all you know useful information that you
get the investments in in technology

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920
get the investments in in technology

infrastructure and technology assets is

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
infrastructure and technology assets is
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.550

in fact one of the more exciting things

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
in fact one of the more exciting things
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.059
in fact one of the more exciting things
about in the industrial area arena is

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069
about in the industrial area arena is
 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.159
about in the industrial area arena is
what everybody now refers to as the

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169
what everybody now refers to as the
 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.110
what everybody now refers to as the
Internet of Things that for the first

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
Internet of Things that for the first
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.679
Internet of Things that for the first
time we're now going to be connecting

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:47.689

sort that we like I think that's gonna
 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.050
sort that we like I think that's gonna
have a huge and profound impact so think

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
have a huge and profound impact so think
 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.360
have a huge and profound impact so think
about all the machine-to-machine

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370
about all the machine-to-machine
 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.399
about all the machine-to-machine
communications interactions think about

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409
communications interactions think about
 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.470
communications interactions think about
the possibility for how we manage our

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480
the possibility for how we manage our
 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.869
the possibility for how we manage our
use of energy how we manage our homes

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879
use of energy how we manage our homes
 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.119
use of energy how we manage our homes
how we manage these settings with us the

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129
how we manage these settings with us the
 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.659
how we manage these settings with us the
workspace the home the car when machines

and things get in that get connected

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639
and things get in that get connected
 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.759
and things get in that get connected
what I find interesting about that in

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769
what I find interesting about that in
 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.270
what I find interesting about that in
particular is what that does to

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280
particular is what that does to
 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.649
particular is what that does to
questions about industry structure and

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659
questions about industry structure and
 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.719
questions about industry structure and
competition I think we always used to

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729
competition I think we always used to
 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.619
competition I think we always used to
imagine that you know companies would

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629
imagine that you know companies would
 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.110
imagine that you know companies would
compete within their sectors so this

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
compete within their sectors so this
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.909
compete within their sectors so this
idea of these you know sectors made

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919
idea of these you know sectors made
 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.890
idea of these you know sectors made
sense at some point but when you have

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900
sense at some point but when you have
 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.619
sense at some point but when you have
technology and technology-based assets I

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629
technology and technology-based assets I
 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.770
technology and technology-based assets I
think it becomes possible to enter many

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780
think it becomes possible to enter many
 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.020
think it becomes possible to enter many
many sectors on the base of technology

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030
many sectors on the base of technology
 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.240
many sectors on the base of technology
platforms think about the fact that now

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250
platforms think about the fact that now
 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.460
platforms think about the fact that now
we're talking about Amazon as a

computing company through their cloud
 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.149
