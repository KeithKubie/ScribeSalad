[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:08.520
JAIME GREEN: Pamela Paul is the
editor of "The New York Times

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.269
Book Review" and
oversees books coverage

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.310
for "The New York Times".

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.160
She's also the host of the
weekly podcast "Inside The New

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.690
York Times Book Review".

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.700
She's the author of five
books, and her latest

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.760
is "My life with Bob,
Flawed Heroine Keeps Book

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.380
of Books, Plot Ensues.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.543
Please welcome Pamela Paul.

00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:27.584
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:29.500
JAIME GREEN: Thank you
so much for joining us.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.174
PAMELA PAUL: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:31.174 --> 00:00:33.090
JAIME GREEN: Would you
like to kick things off

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.450
by reading a little
bit from the book?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.376
PAMELA PAUL: Sure.

00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:37.000
Let me ground it a
little bit by saying

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.660
that each chapter in this
book is named after a book

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.670
that I read at some
point in my life

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.280
and recorded in this journal
that I've kept of every book

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.830
I've read since I was 17.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.600
And the titles themselves were
chosen kind of deliberately,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.434
not because each chapter
is about the book--

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:56.183
because I thought that
would be incredibly

00:00:56.183 --> 00:00:57.260
boring to read about.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.282
This is not a work of
literary criticism--

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:01.240
but because there was
something about that idea

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.770
that kind of captures
what I wanted

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.379
to write about in that
chapter, something

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.740
about the way in which
we read affects our lives

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.020
and forms our lives,
and the sort of space

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.610
between reader and book.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.030
So this is from a
chapter called Catch-22.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.970
And the Catch-22 is
essentially-- well,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.564
I'll start with
it, and I'm going

00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:22.105
to read a little
bit from the middle.

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:24.980
"This is every
reader's catch-22.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.210
The more you read, the more
you realize you haven't read.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.070
The more you yearn to
read more, the more

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.480
you understand that you
have in fact read nothing.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.290
There is no way to
finish, and perhaps that

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.610
shouldn't be the goal."

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.210
And I talk a little bit
about how as a child,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.625
I felt very book deprived.

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:44.725
"Some of my particular
strain of want

00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:47.110
is certainly due to
early deprivation.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.000
Books were and
still are expensive,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.310
and my mother almost
never purchased them.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.729
To this day, she
waits for a title

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.270
to become available while her
name climbs up the library wait

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.980
list.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.130
In my childhood bedroom, I
had one meager bookshelf whose

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.500
lower rung primarily
accommodated back issues

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.410
of 'Young Miss' and
'Seventeen' magazine.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.930
With my $0.10 second
grader's allowance--

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.570
that was cheap even then--

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.270
ratcheted up over the years
into a weekly allotment never

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.950
to exceed $5, I didn't
have much money for books.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.560
If I asked my mother for a
book, her standard response

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.856
was, get it from the library.

00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:24.730
There wasn't much you
could say back to that.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.300
Our house, a creaking
hulk built in 1673,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.580
had actually been our
town's first library.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.494
It had long ceased to
serve in that capacity,

00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:33.910
but we were just
around the corner

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.160
from the existing library,
which was directly

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.110
across from Main Street School.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.970
After dismissal,
I'd cross the street

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.460
and install myself
for an hour or two.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.130
While the library was, of
course, a public institution,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.780
it felt private to me.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.640
The children's library
shelves were mine.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.760
I knew where my friends
Ginny and Geneva awaited,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.430
and where the slightly naughtier
Klickitat gang hung out

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.140
at the end of the front row.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.880
The mean kids from
'Deenie' and 'Blubber'

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.740
looked down from the high shelf.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.570
These characters
provided my social life,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.230
and I never had to be told to
be quiet in their presence.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.640
I wanted to crawl
into the stacks

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.550
and absorb the musty smell
of decades-old paper.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.160
I rifled my fingers through
the wooden card catalogs

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.860
like they were flip books,
trying to decode them.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.410
I could be the first girl
to master the Dewey Decimal

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.310
System.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.980
I might one day know
where every book stood.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.560
All I needed was some
authority, or at least some kind

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.529
of officially sanctioned status.

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:27.070
A few years after
we'd moved to town,

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.320
I mustered the courage
to ask for a job.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.450
'I'm sorry, there
are no jobs available

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.520
for children,' the
librarian told me.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.900
I was 10.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.030
'You wouldn't have to
pay me,' I insisted,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.820
my eyes gleaming with what
surely came across as unhealthy

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.550
fervor.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.850
'That's OK, but thank you.'

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.470
The rejection was terrible.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.360
What was it that put
the children's librarian

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.710
off my candidacy?

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.570
Was it the 'you don't
have to pay me' part?

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.550
Did she question my intentions?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.140
Could she not see
that I was a book

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.690
person different from the other
more casual library visitors?

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.800
That I cared?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.200
That I would never leave a
book face down with its spine

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.029
splayed open like
other kids my age?

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.070
I couldn't help but feel
like they were taking me

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.380
down a notch. 'This
library isn't yours,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.396
you know' is how I read it.

00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:08.770
Every once in a
while, I'd gin up

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.110
the pluck to enquire
again, thinking maybe

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.360
they wouldn't remember
me for the last time,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.710
sometimes asking at
the children's library,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.709
other times going to
the person at checkout

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.480
with the enviable
task of scanning

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.670
each book through
the ghostly red glow

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.680
of the primitive
computer system.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.920
These requests were
swiftly rebuffed,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.400
and each time, I felt sorry for
having the temerity to ask."

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.490
I'm just going to skip
a little bit ahead

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.700
to what to me was like the peak
of my adolescence, which was

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.730
that I got a job at B. Dalton.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.365
"Now this was a job.

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:46.990
I was the only high
schooler who worked

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.230
there, a monumental achievement,
and a source of fierce pride,

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.662
even if you considered there
wasn't much competition.

00:04:52.662 --> 00:04:55.120
All the other employees were
actual grown ups, some of whom

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.000
saw the job as a calling, others
who could just as easily have

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.820
been working in the
produce section at the A&amp;P.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.500
Dan the manager was
one of the former,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.270
a short, sweaty man
in his mid-thirties

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.850
with sparse tendrils of
black hair clinging hopefully

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.160
to his pate, and a mind
brimming with knowledge

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.760
acquired the hard way.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.370
He greeted my
enthusiasm and ignorance

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.050
with tolerant dismissiveness.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.950
He had opinions.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.446
But I was determined to learn.

00:05:17.446 --> 00:05:18.820
I would know
exactly what to read

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.170
and what I would read next.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.960
My book of books would reflect
this clear path forward.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.510
Here at B. Dalton, I
could keep my pulse

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.910
on the passions of the nation.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.617
I just had to pay attention.

00:05:28.617 --> 00:05:31.200
I quickly noticed, for example,
that whenever a book broke out

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.420
in a big way, someone
from management

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.180
ordered rising
swirls of that title

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.690
that spiraled majestically
up from the floor.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.540
Only senior employees knew
how to build and maintain

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.550
these symmetrical assemblages.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.390
Regular sales clerks like me
were not allowed to touch them.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.090
Massive cardboard displays
known in the trade as dumps

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.520
loomed over the aisles, where
they signaled the defining

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.290
cultural events of the day.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.080
Over here, pillars of
'Bonfire of the Vanities'.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.960
Over there, an imposing tower
of Stephen Hawking's 'A Brief

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.750
History of Time', which everyone
in the We Are Sophisticated

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.670
suburbs just had to have.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.460
I would caress this
slender volume longingly,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.920
imagining that if I owned it,
my true place in the universe

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.266
would make itself known.

00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:14.640
I envied the people who could
just stroll in and purchase

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.100
a few hardcovers off the
important towers with the swipe

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.630
of a credit card.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.060
Somewhere along the main
aisles to the commanding dump

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.260
of 'Dianetics'.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.300
These must be
important, I mused,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.606
leafing through a title at a
copy during an idle moment.

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:28.980
'What do you think
you're doing?'

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.090
Dan barked.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.839
'Just curious,' I said
guardedly. 'What is that?'

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.130
'You don't want to know,' he
muttered with a quick wave

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.150
of his hand.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.860
I put down that L.
Ron Hubbard in a state

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.190
of unquenched curiosity,
too nervous to get

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.645
caught going near it again.

00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:43.020
There were so many
mysteries that

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.330
eluded my beginner's grasp
of the world of letters.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.090
'What's this?' I inquired,
holding up one of Joseph

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.580
Campbell's books on mythology.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.890
Who was Joseph Campbell,
and why was he so important?

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.120
'What's this?'

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.520
I asked, pointing to a swirl
of 'Clan of the Cave Bear'

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.070
with the mermaid from
'Splash' inexplicably crawling

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.270
across its cover.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.060
How did this book get to be a
movie, and what did that mean?

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.340
So many books indicated
something significant, yet

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.660
inscrutable.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.160
Authors seemed to
have reputations

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.020
I couldn't quite deconstruct.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.140
Stuart Woods dominated an
entire shelf-- a monolith

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.700
of contemporary letters?

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.490
Ann Rule, master of
criminal justice?

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.790
Then the threat of crime
itself came to B. Dalton.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.480
In 1989, when the Ayatollah
Khomeini in Iran issued a fatwa

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.940
against Salman Rushdie
for his novel 'The Satanic

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.360
Verses', my colleagues and I
were swept into what felt like

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.460
a mission of global import.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.880
The only time I'd given
thought to Iran prior to this

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.550
was during the hostage crisis
when someone graffitied

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.260
'Fuck the Ayatollah'
on a building

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.890
near Main Street
School, where it

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.629
remained for the rest of
my grade school education.

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.170
Every time I looked
at it, I thought,

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.380
'The world is full of
mysterious danger.'

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.540
But this current
danger was exciting.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.600
I became nearly delirious in
my desire to sell 'The Satanic

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.880
Verses', spellbound
by photographs

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.640
of Rushdie's daunting
eyebrows and pungent gaze.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.230
The tapping of cash
register buttons

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.030
was swiftly upgraded
into a campaign

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.070
to save literature from
the forces of darkness.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.380
I blazed with excitement.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.620
Each day, my coworkers
and I reported for duty

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.270
to get the latest
instructions direct

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.830
from corporate headquarters.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.810
Copies of Rushdie's
book were to be

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.420
kept near the cash registers--
no, behind the cash registers--

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.930
no, in the back of the
store, the stockroom, where

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.550
only management could tread.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.560
Employees who did not
feel safe selling the book

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.260
were allowed to be taken off
the schedule, no repercussions.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.450
People were bombing bookstores.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.610
Suburban customers who
couldn't for their lives

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.620
tell the difference
between Iran and Iraq--

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.110
I counted myself among them--

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.970
flocked in droves to our store,
whether out of curiosity,

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.440
for political
purposes, or simply

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.850
to feel part of something.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.590
They skulked up to
the cash register,

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.440
saying in the hushed tones
of a John Le Carre character,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.720
they wanted to buy the book.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.730
'If somebody asks whether
we stock it or not,

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.890
think carefully before
you reply,' we were told.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.515
'Answer on a
case-by-case basis.'

00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:57.090
'What's the book about?'

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.095
I asked Dan.

00:08:58.095 --> 00:09:02.020
'Nobody knows,' he replied.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.270
JAIME GREEN: That's wonderful.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.353
Yeah, I also worked in a
bookstore in high school,

00:09:05.353 --> 00:09:06.860
and it felt like magic.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.054
PAMELA PAUL: Yes, it's like
the greatest privilege.

00:09:09.054 --> 00:09:10.470
But did you get a
better discount?

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.140
Because we only got like 5%.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.200
It's terrible.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.420
JAIME GREEN: I very
rarely bought the books,

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.419
because what they let us do was
we could borrow any hardcover

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:20.460
we wanted, as long as
there were multiple copies.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.610
Because they wanted us to be
able to talk about the books.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.315
And that's how I read the
first five Harry Potter books.

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:27.190
PAMELA PAUL: Oh, wow.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.310
It's a much more
enlightened bookstore.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.480
JAIME GREEN: Who knows.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.950
So you allude very briefly
in that reading to Bob.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.346
Not by name, but
can you tell us--

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:40.970
I want to say who,
because it's a name.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.240
But tell us about Bob.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.640
PAMELA PAUL: So Bob
is this journal.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.462
He's still around.

00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:46.920
JAIME GREEN: You
do use he for him.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.780
PAMELA PAUL: I do.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.120
He's a guy.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.130
It's a really boring
looking blank book--

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.880
this is before Moleskine and
beautiful sort of Bespoke

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.230
journals--

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.710
that I started to
write in when I was 17.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.920
I was living for a summer
through American field

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.370
service in France, and I was
incredibly disgruntled at this.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.950
I thought it was going to be
a very glamorous expedition,

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.830
but instead I was sent
to a part of France

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.380
that no one ever writes
about, like a part that even

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.260
French people are like,
that's not France.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.760
And I started to keep
a journal of the books

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.430
that I was reading.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.019
Previous diaries that I had
kept I found were awful.

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:30.560
They were awful to
write in, and they

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.210
were awful especially to read.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.130
Because what I
would write in them

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.070
was like angry, angsty
adolescent thoughts

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.090
of rejection and
embarrassment, and things like,

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.040
Katie said she was
sleeping at Wendy's house,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.680
but I asked her to sleep
over first, and blah blah.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.480
And going back and
rereading those,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.620
it was like there was
nothing good about them.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.220
They reflected
terrible feelings.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.990
I couldn't even write well.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.370
There was no glimpse of
any kind of literary skill

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.460
in those words.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.930
And so I decided to--

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.980
and also, because I only wrote
about the times and the things

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.870
that upset me and depressed me.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.910
They didn't make for
very fun reading.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.370
And not enlightening either.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.181
So I decided to keep
a diary of the things

00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:14.180
that I did want to remember,
which was the books

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.380
that I was reading.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.010
And I started off that
first summer in France

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.720
with 'The Trial' by Kafka, which
is what I was reading, and is

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.320
the name of a
chapter in the book,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.800
because for me that
book was like a metaphor

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.490
for adolescence, where you feel
like everyone thinks that you

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.280
have done something wrong,
and you feel innocent,

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.310
and you feel like
everyone's out to get you.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.006
And I've been keeping
that journal ever since.

00:11:40.006 --> 00:11:41.880
JAIME GREEN: And it's
still in the same book.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.370
PAMELA PAUL: It's still
in the same book, yes.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.411
Yes, thank you for pointing
out that I've not yet

00:11:45.411 --> 00:11:46.400
finished the Bob.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.400
I thought I'd be like
on volume four by now.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.780
The handwriting is very
small in my defense,

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.120
so I write it down
in tiny little print.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.680
But I'm only half
way through, which

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.230
I guess makes sense,
since I'm probably

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.940
roughly halfway through--

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.710
a quarter of the
way through my life.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.640
And so there's lots
of space to go.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.960
JAIME GREEN: It seems
like a very private thing.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.950
You write in the book
about just a couple

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.760
of times where you've
shared it with other people.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.479
What does it feel like
writing about it publicly now?

00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:22.520
PAMELA PAUL: Well, you
will note that in the book

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.860
there's only one image from Bob.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.150
I've carefully put up a few
other pages on social media.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.180
But no, it'd be incredibly
embarrassing to have someone

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.040
actually go through
the entire thing,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.920
because of course you read
it-- and I should say,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.610
I don't write about
the books in there.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.280
It's just the title
and the author

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.820
and where I was when I read
it sometimes, and occasionally

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.140
a date.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.136
I spent a lot of my 20s living
abroad, so a lot of that

00:12:48.136 --> 00:12:49.760
is sort of about the
place where I was.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.250
But there isn't
anything but the title.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.040
So on the one hand,
that reveals nothing.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.930
But on the other hand,
that reveals nothing,

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.640
because I could put
down a bunch of books

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.060
that I hated, and someone could
pick up my Bob and be like,

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.380
you read that?

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.470
Why did you read that?

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.969
And I'd be like,
well, I just wanted

00:13:05.969 --> 00:13:07.970
to know, why is it so popular?

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.740
You read for all
different reasons,

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.420
and that's kind of what I wanted
to explore in my life with Bob.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.660
What do you glean
from what you read?

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.810
Why do you read what you read
at a given moment in your life?

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.990
Sometimes you read again
out of stupid curiosity.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.790
Sometimes you read on
the very first page,

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.680
which is in this book of books.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.100
I have 'Interview
With a Vampire",

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.600
which I really wanted to like.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.980
I hated it.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.531
I hated that book.

00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:38.030
And so that's one of the few
books that has a little I-N-C--

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.670
a little inc next
to it, which I wrote

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.716
for books that were incomplete.

00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:45.590
But if somebody picks
that up and looks at it

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.590
and they were like,
Anne Rice, really?

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.780
So then they'd form some
kind of impression of me

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.860
that I don't know is necessarily
revelatory in the way I

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.990
would want it to be.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.800
So "My Life with Bob", this
book is quite personal.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.619
But in a weird way, it's not
as personal as Bob itself.

00:14:04.619 --> 00:14:07.160
JAIME GREEN: Well it's at least
also written for an audience,

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.340
whereas Bob was very
much written for you.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.550
PAMELA PAUL: Yes.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.350
JAIME GREEN: And
this is much more

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.450
personal than the books
you've written before,

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:19.240
which were much more
reported and journalistic.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.670
Had you always sort of had it
in your mind to write a memoir,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:27.200
or did it surprise you when that
ended up being what came next?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.210
PAMELA PAUL: I was shocked.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.440
Even when I signed
the book deal,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.940
I didn't know it was a memoir
until "Publisher's Weekly" was

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.530
like, Pamela Paul
to write memoir.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.950
And I was like, oh my
god, I'm writing a memoir?

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.480
I thought it was a
book about books.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:48.166
And my editors, they had to kind
of tame me a little bit from--

00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:50.540
I kept trying to turn it into
a travel book, essentially,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.915
and they were
like, we don't need

00:14:51.915 --> 00:14:53.630
three chapters on Thailand.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.940
And so the Brazil
chapter is gone,

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.570
and there aren't
three chapters--

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.190
I had so much to say about the
Xinjiang Autonomous Region,

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.440
but that didn't make
it into the book.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.200
It is really personal.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.970
And it's funny, when
I was writing it,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.430
I thought, well, I'll just write
it the way I need to write it,

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.210
and it'll be really,
really personal.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.760
And then when I'm all done,
when it's totally done,

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.950
before I hand it in,
I'll just go back

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.790
and I'll take
everything personal out.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.170
I'll pretend like,
let me pretend

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.830
that my child is
reading this book,

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:26.920
and what would they think?

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.642
And then anything that I thought
would offend or upset them,

00:15:29.642 --> 00:15:30.350
I'll take it out.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.780
And then I just didn't do that.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.190
So now it's all out there.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:34.940
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.290
And one of the things--

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:41.180
I mean, speaking of things that
could feel embarrassing to put

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.199
out into the world--

00:15:42.199 --> 00:15:44.240
which I don't think comes
across as embarrassing,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.610
but when you're writing
it feels scary--

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.280
one of the things that I was
really struck by in this book

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.830
is when you write about
your younger self,

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.090
whether it's 10-year-old
you inquiring about jobs

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.150
at the library,
sort of sweet ideas

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.200
that you had, or in your
20s and your romantic life,

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.510
and your teens, various
blunders or situations that you

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.650
got yourself into.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.500
You write about all of that
with a lot of compassion

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.270
for your younger self.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.880
And I'm curious.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.880
Was it hard to write about
things that might have

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.304
felt embarrassing or awkward?

00:16:21.304 --> 00:16:22.970
You already shared
one strategy you use,

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.170
which is pretend no
one's going to read it.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.900
But what's your
relationship to younger you

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.827
as a character in the book?

00:16:31.827 --> 00:16:33.410
PAMELA PAUL: So I
think that you don't

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.550
want to prettify your life, and
I think especially with memoir,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.980
you want to access that
emotion in the moment

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.580
and be honest about it.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.280
And for me, it's the primary
emotions of my life--

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.610
and they still continue--
are embarrassment.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.070
And embarrassment not only
for me and my condition,

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.630
but I had contact embarrassment.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.690
So if someone else trips
while walking down the street,

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.260
I on their behalf will blush
and feel totally tortured

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.270
for the rest of the afternoon.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.050
And guilt-- pervasive guilt. And
guilt not only for the things

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.170
that I have committed,
but guilt for everything

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.230
that I may not have done,
and yet other people

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.670
may think I have done.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.270
And then guilt for everything
that everyone else does.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.240
And those feelings were
with me from childhood.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.500
And I write about
reading this book

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.150
that the comedian
Sandra Bernhard wrote

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.040
called "Confessions
of a Pretty Lady".

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.480
And she writes
about walking down

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.100
the street picking her nose.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.554
And that stunned me as a
child, because I was like,

00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:34.970
I walk down the
street just trying

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.650
to look like a normal person.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.990
And the fact that
you're flagrantly

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.050
violating the law by
picking your nose,

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.570
it just was so shocking.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:52.160
And again, I was able to easily
access those feelings when

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.870
I started to think about
the books, because for me,

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:02.750
my childhood I felt so different
from everyone else-- which

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.960
everyone I know feels, or
almost everyone, unless they're

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.419
abnormal-- unless they truly
are different, in which case

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:10.460
they feel like they're
the same as everyone else,

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.043
and that's what makes
them so strange.

00:18:12.043 --> 00:18:14.960
But because I felt that
way, I felt like books

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.240
for me provided a kind
of refuge and a place

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.310
where I felt accepted.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.810
So that's what I wrote.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.894
JAIME GREEN: Yeah,
it comes through.

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:24.560
As I was reading, I
was really surprised

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:30.050
that this kid who is
so intensely concerned

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.270
about all of those
things and felt--

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.010
I'm going like this,
so I guess young you

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.990
felt a little anxious
to me, or just

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.910
concerned about what
was right, and sort

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.200
of staying on that path.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.450
And then in your teens and
20s, you traveled so much.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.700
And not easy travel, either.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.579
Not just France.

00:18:46.579 --> 00:18:48.870
PAMELA PAUL: Had to torture
myself as much as possible.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.249
JAIME GREEN: And so first that
was inspired by a book, right?

00:18:53.249 --> 00:18:54.790
PAMELA PAUL: So I
was a good student.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.210
I went to an Ivy League college.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.610
I was going through the
job recruitment process.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.240
My senior year, I had
like a very clear path.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.460
I thought I was going
to work for like some--

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.710
I thought what I
was going to do was

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.620
I would either work in
publishing or in advertising,

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.720
but I basically--

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.540
any fancy corporation that
came to campus to recruit,

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.710
I was on their schedule.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.450
And I remember I was in an
interview with Quaker Oats,

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.330
and they were like, why do you
want to work at Quaker Oats?

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.150
And I started to be like--

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.350
I don't know what I
said, but the part

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.680
where I gained consciousness
of what I was saying, was I

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.670
was like, and I really like
Quaker Oats Captain Crunch,

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.170
but only with crunch berries.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.491
I don't really like it when
it doesn't have the crunch

00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:38.990
berries.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.130
And then suddenly I was
like, what am I saying?

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.900
Is this what I want
to do with my life?

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.770
And then I just had
this kind of experience,

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.810
where you'd see yourself
from a bird's eye view,

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.540
and you're like, what
are you talking about?

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.240
And I just stopped talking.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.770
And I was like, you know what?

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.050
I don't want to
work at Quaker Oats.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:05.330
And I walked out, and I decided
at that point that I would--

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.760
what I thought was
maybe the options

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.310
that I've been exposed to up
to this point were A through D,

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.380
and I don't even know
what E through Z are.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.550
And I therefore want to try to
do something unlike anything

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.550
that I've ever done.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.324
So I decided I would
go to a country

00:20:20.324 --> 00:20:21.740
where I didn't
speak the language.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.650
I didn't know anyone.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:23.510
I didn't have a job.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.450
I didn't have any friends.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.616
It was a different religion.

00:20:25.616 --> 00:20:26.994
I was an ethnic minority.

00:20:26.994 --> 00:20:29.160
And I picked out like a few
countries that fit this,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.993
and also that I didn't
have any interest in,

00:20:30.993 --> 00:20:34.380
and that I thought I
might hate living in.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.910
Just to kind of
really push myself

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.860
to every possible extreme.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.780
And I came up with
a list of countries,

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.130
and then I narrowed it down.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.140
I also didn't want to live
in a big international city,

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.230
because I'm from New York.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.700
And I thought, what's the
point of just going to Tokyo?

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.160
And you can do everything
you could do in New York,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.810
pretty much.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.450
So I moved to Chiang
Mai, which was a city

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.100
of 100,000 people at that time.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.455
A town, basically,
in northern Thailand.

00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:03.300
And this was before
the internet,

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.900
so back then, moving
somewhere like that

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.080
was even more extreme
in that I didn't

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.010
have any contact with anyone.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.530
I didn't own a phone.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.800
I didn't have-- there was no
mail delivery to where I lived.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.072
And my neighbor had a phone, and
so every other week-- and phone

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:23.280
calls were super expensive--
my parents would call me

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.330
at a certain time, and
I would talk to them.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:31.020
But the object of
that travel was

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.110
to constantly put
challenges in front of me

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:37.220
and make it deliberately
difficult and unpleasant.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.550
And the book
inspiration for that

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.740
was a book called "A Journey
of One's Own, Thoughts

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.690
for the independent
Women's Traveler" I think

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.570
is the subtitle,
by Thalia Zepatos.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.600
And Thalia Zepatos
was this woman

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:00.720
who had ridden camels through
the deserts of Africa,

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.730
and had done all sorts
of things that I thought

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.950
I would really hate doing that.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.290
And I thought, well, I
guess I'll try that out.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.710
And it one of those things
where I felt like at the time

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.590
like 5% of me made that
decision to do that and drag

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.450
the other 95% along.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.320
And I just bought the
nonrefundable ticket,

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.390
and then it was too
late to change my mind.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.924
Plus I told everyone on campus,
and I called my parents,

00:22:23.924 --> 00:22:26.340
and I was like, now it's just
too embarrassing to be like,

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.060
you know what?

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.210
Maybe I don't want to
do something that hard.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.340
Maybe I just want to
get a job in New York.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.840
But anyway, I did
end up doing that,

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.222
and it was probably the
best decision I ever made.

00:22:38.222 --> 00:22:40.180
One that I don't feel
entirely responsible for,

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.880
but nonetheless
was the best thing.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.254
JAIME GREEN: Why
was it so great?

00:22:43.254 --> 00:22:46.110
Was it as unpleasant as
you thought it would be?

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.080
PAMELA PAUL: No, no,
it was fantastic.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.540
No, it was really fantastic.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.540
I mean, there were aspects
of it that were hard.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.660
And again, that was
partly of my own doing.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.220
I decided at a
certain point that I

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.570
would go to China for six
weeks on a budget of $15 a day.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.080
And this was in 1994,
so that budget--

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.067
which was ludicrous.

00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:06.150
But I just set the budget.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.860
I didn't really
have extra money,

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.295
although I suppose I could have
begged, stolen, or borrowed.

00:23:11.295 --> 00:23:12.720
But that's what I had.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:18.750
And so there were times when I
was so strict about the budget

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.570
that I was like, no, I cannot
take the bed with the blanket.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.530
I shall sleep on
the concrete block.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.660
But even that was such a--

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.120
I was sort of trying
to see what that

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.290
would do to me as a person.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.956
I kind of felt like
up until that point,

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:40.560
I'd had it too easy, and
that I needed to sort of mess

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.620
with myself a little bit.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.040
But even though in the
day-to-day some of that

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.890
was difficult, ultimately it
was incredibly satisfying.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.680
And it taught me
something that has

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.990
stayed with me throughout
my life, which is that--

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:59.460
up until that point,
I'd had this really kind

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.370
of foolish idea that
life was like a path,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.400
and that every sort of task and
accomplishment that I could do,

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:06.900
I did.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.570
And I checked off my list, and
I got to the Ivy League college.

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.370
And then I could
have gotten the job.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.960
And then I was like, and
then you get the job,

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.970
and then you get the promotion,
and then you get the boyfriend,

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:15.970
and then you're engaged.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.040
I thought that
that's what it was.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.600
And I thought that by
getting off that path,

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.522
that when I got back
from living abroad,

00:24:23.522 --> 00:24:25.980
that everyone else would be
like a few notches ahead of me,

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.710
and I would have to spend the
rest of my life catching up.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:33.120
And so it was revelatory
to me at the time that no.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.570
Within you a year, we were all
basically in the same place

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:37.740
just doing different things.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.710
And that enabled to me a
little bit later in my career

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.080
to also make some
abrupt changes.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.810
At one point I got up, I
just quit a brand new job

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.540
that I had at Time Inc.
that was a big fancy job

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.840
after three months to move to
London, kind of on an impulse.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.920
And then later on, after
working in media companies

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.650
on the business side,
it sort of enabled

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.720
me to have the
courage to quit my job

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.262
to become a full time writer.

00:25:02.262 --> 00:25:03.720
And I don't think
that I would have

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.590
been able to do those things
had I not had that experience.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.170
JAIME GREEN: When you were
in those other countries

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.122
living that
challenging life, what

00:25:13.122 --> 00:25:14.580
did that do to your
reading tastes?

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.130
Did you want to read
comfort reading,

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.230
or were you reading
books about the places

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.820
that you were traveling to?

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.080
PAMELA PAUL: It depended.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.790
when I was in Thailand,
when I first got there,

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.660
I basically clung to
English literature,

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.060
which is my comfort literature.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.260
It's like Thomas Hardy.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.320
Like, I wanted to read
about comforting farmland,

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.150
and families in drawing
rooms, and that sort of thing.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.990
That was my way to--

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.200
it was like a mooring for me.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.380
And then later on
when I was traveling

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.230
in Vietnam and Cambodia, I did
read a lot about those places,

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:53.280
because the reason I had
chosen to go to Thailand

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.390
was because I really--

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.940
I truly had had no
interest in it at all.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.990
All I knew about Asia with
like Benihana restaurant,

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:07.440
don't like it, and that Michael
Creighton book, "Rising Sun"

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.300
or whatever.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.120
That was it.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.174
That was my knowledge
of all of Asia.

00:26:12.174 --> 00:26:13.590
So I did a lot of
reading about it

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.210
when I was there,
because I wanted

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.710
to know what I was seeing.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.120
So before I went to Vietnam, I
read a lot of war literature.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.840
Before I went to Cambodia, I
read a lot about the genocide,

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.990
and a lot of the history
of those countries.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.560
So it was an
education, certainly.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.740
JAIME GREEN: So you were saying
that your career has taken

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.270
a sort of non-linear path.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.539
And you were working
in media, and then you

00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:40.080
started doing some
freelance writing.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.955
And then you left to be
a full time freelance

00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:42.780
writer for a while.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.782
Was it straight from there
to the "Times Book Review"?

00:26:46.782 --> 00:26:47.490
PAMELA PAUL: Yes.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.330
What happened was I had
worked on the business

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.010
side in a number of media
companies and documentary film

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.590
and in television and
publishing and in magazines,

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:03.690
and I quit those jobs
to write my first book.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.677
I had started freelance
writing on the side

00:27:05.677 --> 00:27:06.510
for "The Economist".

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.040
I wrote a weekly column on
arts, and I loved doing that.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.330
And I did that at night.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.890
And that was my fun time.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.870
And I felt like I
sort of went to work,

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.910
and sort of paid my
dues during the day

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.160
and did what I loved at night.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.618
And it was almost
like I thought it

00:27:21.618 --> 00:27:24.210
would be too good to
be true to actually

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.130
just be writing all day.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.410
But when I got my first
book deal and when I did

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:32.110
quit my job to write all
day, it was so amazing.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.190
It was truly what I wanted
to be doing with my life,

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.340
and what I had always wanted
to do, but had suppressed it,

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.680
because that would be too good.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.676
And I decided that I would
never go back to working--

00:27:47.676 --> 00:27:49.050
to doing anything
other than kind

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.920
of being immersed in words.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.100
And so I freelanced for a
long time for "The Economist",

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.187
and then I was writing
primarily for "Time".

00:27:58.187 --> 00:28:00.270
A couple of books that I
wrote came out of stories

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:01.978
that I did for "Time"
during those years.

00:28:01.978 --> 00:28:04.530
And then I started
freelancing for "The Times"

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:08.610
for various sections
of the paper.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.570
The paper, that's like
a verboten word now.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.190
But the news organization.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.260
And I started
freelancing for those.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.390
And then the editor
of the book review

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.190
was looking for a
children's books editor.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.540
It was a full time job.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.000
And he knew I didn't want
to get a full time job.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.490
Like, I basically never wanted
to work in an office again.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.990
And I liked being in my
pajamas all day writing.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.380
So he asked me for help finding
a children's books editor,

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.560
because it's a great job.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.040
At that point there'd only been
five children's books editors

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.921
in the history of
"The New York Times".

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.920
And I was like, well,
obviously I don't want it.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.080
And he's like, I know you
don't want it, but help

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:46.960
me find someone.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.730
And I did try to help
him, but eventually, I

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.670
thought none of these people
would do as good a job

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.230
as I would.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.070
Which I realize is
incredibly obnoxious,

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.542
but I really love
children's books,

00:28:58.542 --> 00:29:00.000
and I believe in
them passionately.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.060
And though I hadn't worked
in them for a long time,

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.460
I kind of thought that I could
do a good job if maybe they

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.860
could make the job part time.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.499
So on a whim, I emailed him.

00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:14.040
And I was like, well, maybe if
you made this thing part time.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.600
And within a month, I was
sitting at "The New York Times"

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.230
doing that job.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.760
So I basically Dick
Cheney-ed my way

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.390
into the position, because I was
supposed to find someone else.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.750
And that's how I ended up there
and then became the features

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.590
editor, and then the editor.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.160
JAIME GREEN: So first, you spend
your days editing book reviews,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.840
and you write books.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.810
Is it hard switching
between the critical

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.592
and the creative mindset?

00:29:41.592 --> 00:29:43.300
PAMELA PAUL: That's
a very good question.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.300
You know, it's kind of--

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:44.841
I don't know.

00:29:44.841 --> 00:29:47.070
I wonder if you were a
handyman, you'd be like well,

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.600
now I'm going to
fix the bath tub,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.050
and then I'll work on painting
the walls and patching it.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:57.450
They're within the same
family, but different skills.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.660
And I kind of like
doing multiple things.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:08.010
So to me, it feels like a
little bit of a palate cleanser.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.050
And writing, I should
say, is something

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.800
that I don't generally do
too much of in my day job.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.380
I wrote this book
on the train, and I

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.170
felt like it was my treat
at the beginning of the day

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.430
and at the end of the day
to dive deeply into reading,

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.855
albeit only for 38
minutes, which was--

00:30:25.855 --> 00:30:27.160
it could have been longer.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.240
Like the one person that
wanted a longer commute

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.670
so that I could finish a
chapter, or at least a page.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.030
But they are different skills.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.370
And I felt when I
was a freelancer too

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.400
that switching between magazine
writing and newspaper writing

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.830
and book writing was similar.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:45.970
Sometimes you think of it--

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.980
the most negative way
to think about it,

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.230
but it's actually
a good thing is

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.630
that when you get sick of all
the things that bother you

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.120
about writing magazine
articles or whatever,

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.240
you can go into the book.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.880
And then you get incredibly
annoyed with certain things

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.980
about books, so then
you get to switch back

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.480
to magazines and newspapers.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.690
So I feel like I get to
do a little bit of it

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:06.160
all, and it works out.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.910
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:08.739
I know there are some
writers who don't

00:31:08.739 --> 00:31:10.030
read reviews of their own work.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.200
Do you read your reviews?

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:11.908
PAMELA PAUL: Yes.

00:31:11.908 --> 00:31:13.930
I read them, and I
dissect them, and I

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.390
find every negative thing.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.980
Yes, I read my reviews.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.940
And also, there's a third
category of authors or people

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.100
who just don't believe
anyone who says that they

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.220
don't read their reviews.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.460
So I have had people
very adamantly

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.100
tell me that they don't
read their reviews,

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.440
and then get very angry
at me for the reviews

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.680
that we've run in
the book review.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.370
JAIME GREEN: Question over here.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.210
AUDIENCE: I've just started
keeping a book diary myself,

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:44.050
having obviously
read for a long time.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:46.610
But I enjoy having the
opportunity having them

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:47.740
written down.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.300
I find my memory is selective
at times where people ask me--

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.190
or I ask myself-- what
did I read last month?

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.850
And I have no idea.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:59.140
No idea what I read last month,
until I see it on the page.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.900
And then I remember
everything about that book.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:07.120
So I think I agree with you,
just the act of title, author.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.370
I don't need to write a
review, because I remember it.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.880
That's enough for me.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.780
But I'm also at
this point in life

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:19.076
becoming more courageous
in not completing books.

00:32:19.076 --> 00:32:20.200
How do you feel about that?

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.330
I mean you mentioned
that with Anne Rice.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.530
Also a book that
I wanted to love,

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:30.670
"Interview with a Vampire", and
found it incredibly mediocre.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.520
PAMELA PAUL: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.320
I don't believe
quite as religiously

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.505
as I once did about finishing
every book that I start.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.970
Because for me, the
decision about what

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.520
to read next very much has to
do with my mood at the moment.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.590
It's like movies,
where you're like,

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.930
I'm not in the mood
for a thriller.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.630
I want something-- so I
feel that way about books.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.680
In a given moment, I want to
read something that fulfills

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.590
some kind of emotional need.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.045
And so sometimes
I'll start a book.

00:33:05.045 --> 00:33:07.510
And It's not necessarily
that I don't like the book,

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.540
but I find that this isn't this
isn't what I need right now.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.560
And so I'll put it
down for a later time.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:21.340
And I think one of the benefits
of having been in this world

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.710
for so long is that I have
a pretty good idea of what

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:24.670
I want to read.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.170
So I don't have as
many false starts

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.080
as I did when I was a total
idiot ignoramus working

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.400
in B. Dalton when I was 17.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.720
I try to--

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.430
I'm pretty strategic
about what I read.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:41.140
But I also-- and I wrote
an essay about this

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:45.980
on the op ed page of "The New
York Times" a few weeks ago.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.640
I believe strongly
in reading things

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.110
sometimes that I don't
like, that I disagree with,

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:58.469
that I find possibly even
offensive, just to get myself

00:33:58.469 --> 00:34:00.010
into a different
mindset for a while.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:05.020
And again, that goes back
to that weird tendency

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.800
I have to challenge
myself or to like almost

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.780
put myself in a kind of
situation of discomfort

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:14.320
on purpose.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.810
So I will sometimes
finish books,

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:21.280
even if I really hate
them, just to kind of get

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.607
an understanding of what it is
that is bothering me so much.

00:34:25.607 --> 00:34:26.440
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.080
I agree.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.010
JAIME GREEN: It
sounds like you're

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.414
following your heart and your
interest in what you read.

00:34:34.414 --> 00:34:36.580
Do you not have to do a ton
of reading for your job?

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.429
I'm surprised that you get to
decide what you read, instead

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:41.419
of like, here are the
10 new books coming out

00:34:41.419 --> 00:34:43.210
in the next few months
that I have to read.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:44.889
PAMELA PAUL: You
know, I should pretend

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:46.179
that I do read all of that.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.670
But the dark secret is
that I don't necessarily

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.400
read everything that we cover.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.860
I am very good at
reading around things.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.690
And I do get involved--

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.900
there are a lot of books
that I do read that have

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.520
to do with my work life.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.650
And especially the end of
the year when we pick out

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.270
our 100 notable
books of the year,

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.850
and our 10 best books of the
year, that's a collaborative

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.680
process that I'm involved in.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.760
And you have to read those
books in order to weigh in.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.760
But I'm pretty
selfish as a reader.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.140
This is the thing that I do.

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:22.470
I don't go to concerts,
and I barely watch TV.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.900
I actually feel like I
should be watching TV,

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.540
because it's so good.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:31.180
So this is my pleasure, and
I guard it a bit jealously.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.930
JAIME GREEN: One thing
you say in the book

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:36.290
is people have limited time for
books, and the job of reviews

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:37.610
is to help them make choices.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.170
And that's in the
context in the book

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:43.790
of dealing with having to
write or edit negative reviews,

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:47.360
and loving books, and
wanting to be positive.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.200
But also wanting to help
people make choices.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.820
So I guess my first
question is, do reviews help

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.980
guide your reading choices too?

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.590
PAMELA PAUL: They do, but
sometimes a negative review can

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.192
make me want to read the book.

00:36:02.192 --> 00:36:03.650
Sometimes I read
a negative review,

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.790
and I think about the reviewer,
and that reviewer's voice

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.990
is coming through, and
I'm like, you're a jerk.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.790
I don't like your
opinion, and I'm

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.530
going to read that
book that you say

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.900
is so terrible, because I
think I'm going to like it,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.870
because I don't like you.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:23.150
So I think a negative review
isn't always a bad thing.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.100
And at "The Times",
we're journalists,

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:31.190
and we are trying to guide and
illuminate the world of books

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.390
for our readers.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.820
So we're not promoters of
books, although of course we all

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.510
believe in them.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.580
We wouldn't be working
at the book review

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:43.190
if we weren't fans
of the format.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.710
But the other thing
that I should say

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:48.440
is that a lot of
negative reviews

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.870
come in from our critics, who
many of them are freelance.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:56.030
And we don't share their
opinions necessarily

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.204
as the editors.

00:36:57.204 --> 00:36:59.120
Sometimes we'll send out
the book, we love it.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.980
The review will come
back, and it's negative.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.770
But again, it's a newspaper.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:07.790
We are journalists.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:12.230
And what we do is we
don't edit opinion.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.100
We're not going to
change their mind.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.500
So we run those
negative reviews.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.660
And then everyone
gets angry at us.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.910
JAIME GREEN: And you're
sitting there silently saying,

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:22.592
I know, me too.

00:37:22.592 --> 00:37:23.300
PAMELA PAUL: Yes.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.690
The hardest is when we have
negative reviews of books

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:30.530
by my colleagues,
which does happen.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.455
And then we're sort of
like department non grata

00:37:33.455 --> 00:37:34.810
at "The New York Times".

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:35.780
JAIME GREEN: That must be tough.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:36.488
PAMELA PAUL: Yes.

00:37:36.488 --> 00:37:37.500
It's like it's--

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.320
I'm trying to think
of the equivalent

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.060
here at another company.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:45.650
But to get a negative
review in public,

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:49.100
I don't think people
often think about what

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.380
that feels like to be
on the receiving end.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.840
Like, imagine you're
a software engineer,

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.827
and a colleague writes
up a thing and is like,

00:37:56.827 --> 00:37:57.410
you know what?

00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:59.930
First of all, I see the way
that guy manages his time.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.620
He was on Facebook
for like 45 minutes.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.120
He was blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.250
And then they post it
publicly for everyone to read.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.620
And that's what it is like
getting a negative review.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.670
One of the advantages I feel
like I have at the book review

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.710
is that I have gotten
negative reviews,

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.280
and I've given negative reviews.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.980
So I feel like I
know what it feels

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.740
like on all different sides.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:25.070
And when I write
a negative review,

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:29.960
having gotten what I think
are horribly unfair, unkind,

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.110
and not true negative
reviews myself,

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:35.450
I try to be
respectful of the fact

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:39.740
that a book takes a
lot of time to write,

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.040
and is often sort of dear
to the heart of the writer,

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:45.530
and to point out what
the writer did well,

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.350
as well as what
the book got wrong.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.530
And not to attack the
writer, but to really

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.027
critique the book, and
to keep that separately.

00:38:54.027 --> 00:38:55.610
And there are a lot
of things that you

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.490
can do in a negative book
review that are unfair.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:01.730
Like you can use a book
to advance an argument

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.070
that you already have
set in your mind.

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:08.150
You can go into a book
not as an open reader,

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:11.542
but with your own argument,
and then read it in such a way

00:39:11.542 --> 00:39:13.250
that you're sort of
cherry picking things

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.790
out to support
your point of view,

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.430
and then write a
book review that is

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.339
essentially more of an op ed.

00:39:18.339 --> 00:39:20.630
And those kind of things I
think are incredibly unfair.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.730
So I try not to run them.

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:24.710
And when we get
those kind of reviews

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:28.700
in, even if we can only edit
them to a limited extent,

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.670
those writers usually are
not invited back to review.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:32.420
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.850
We have another
question over here.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:35.974
AUDIENCE: Hi, yeah, this
is to kind of go back to--

00:39:35.974 --> 00:39:38.450
I think we were talking about
it right at the beginning.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.390
But I love the idea
of a tiny Pamela Paul

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.820
at the library asking for a job.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.270
That is so darling, and I love
that kind of precociousness

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.702
that a lot of kids have.

00:39:48.702 --> 00:39:49.910
And I think it's interesting.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.743
I mean, I work with
Jaime on the books team.

00:39:51.743 --> 00:39:54.470
We have a whole
editorial program here.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.180
I think we've all
worked at bookstores.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.100
A lot of us have studied
literature, philosophy,

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:03.050
have at one time wanted
to be a librarian

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:06.390
obscure French philosopher,
professor, something like that.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:10.280
So I guess I wonder, when
you and your colleagues

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.657
on the inside of "The New
York Times Book Review",

00:40:12.657 --> 00:40:14.990
and talk about like-- well,
you talked about Victor Hugo

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:16.370
forever when you were
reading that book.

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.244
PAMELA PAUL: Yes, forever
being the key word.

00:40:18.244 --> 00:40:19.654
It took a long time.

00:40:19.654 --> 00:40:21.570
AUDIENCE: Or your
colleague, you just finished

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.700
"The Power Broker".

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.140
You can tell you
guys all probably

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.920
have a similar childhood story
of being kind of inexplicably

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.200
drawn to books and to reading.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.140
And so I don't really
know, the question

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.972
is kind of an absurd,
existential question.

00:40:35.972 --> 00:40:37.430
But what do you
think that's about?

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.160
What did draw you to
want a job at the library

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.520
when you were a kid?

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.810
PAMELA PAUL: It's
funny, when you

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.900
describe that, I think of that
old movie "Freaks", you know?

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:51.050
And there's that horrible scene
at the end of freaks, where

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.660
all the freaks are around
a table, and they're going,

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.280
one of us, one of us.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.280
And that's like the dorks
of "The New York Times Book

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.756
Review" where it's like,
I am among my people.

00:41:01.756 --> 00:41:04.130
One thing that we have in
common when you sort of grew up

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.002
reading more than
you did talking,

00:41:06.002 --> 00:41:07.460
and you weren't
well-socialized, is

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.960
that you mispronounce things.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.090
So before we go on the
podcast, we're often like,

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.570
wait a minute, how
do you say that?

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:21.710
And yeah, we all mispronounce
things all the time.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:28.375
But I mean, I think we all feel
incredibly lucky to be there.

00:41:28.375 --> 00:41:29.750
There are three
colleagues that I

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.458
have at the book review
who've been there

00:41:31.458 --> 00:41:35.000
for more than 30 years, because
it's the kind of thing--

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.890
like, if this is
what you like to do,

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.020
this is where you want to be.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:42.550
And unfortunately, there
aren't-- we're the last

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.560
freestanding book
review in the country.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.850
"The Washington Post" folded
Book World into Outlook

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:50.944
in 2008.

00:41:50.944 --> 00:41:53.360
And the one before that was
"The San Francisco Chronicle",

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.990
which folded in 2005.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:01.760
So I think we all
feel like we've

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.240
gotten to where we need to be.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.520
In terms of what it is that
makes people end up in a place

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.760
like this doing
this kind of work,

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.950
I do think that one
of the things that

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.140
marks my colleagues-- but
again, I think it's true

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.850
of many readers-- is
that reading for us

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:26.040
is not purely intellectual.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.440
It's an emotional
experience as well.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.010
And the thing that you
can't say on that podcast

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:33.510
is that people tear up.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.810
We all feel very, very
strongly about what we read

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:40.590
and what we do.

00:42:44.382 --> 00:42:47.280
So yeah, I don't know what
it says about us as people,

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.170
but there you have it.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:50.250
JAIME GREEN: Yeah.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:54.780
So I guess my last
question is, what have you

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.100
read lately that you've loved?

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:04.260
PAMELA PAUL: I don't have my
book of books in front of me.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.426
I don't have my cheat sheet.

00:43:05.426 --> 00:43:07.740
I don't remember things either.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.230
That's why I have my Bob too.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.420
It's my memoir.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:18.171
So I am almost done with Ben
Bradley's memoir from 1995,

00:43:18.171 --> 00:43:19.920
which is called "A
Good Life, Newspapering

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.870
and Other Adventures".

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:23.697
And that's a book
that I've been meaning

00:43:23.697 --> 00:43:24.780
to read since it came out.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.520
And I'm like, oh, I
guess I'll get to that.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.103
I didn't realize
that I'd been meaning

00:43:28.103 --> 00:43:30.005
to read it for 22 years.

00:43:30.005 --> 00:43:32.130
But there are many books
that I have been intending

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:33.210
to read for that long.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.110
And I love that.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:36.720
I'm a big fan of biography.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.620
And a novel that I read recently
that's pretty contemporary

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.270
that I adored was by a writer
named Chris Bachelder called

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:45.810
"The Throwback Special".

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:48.000
And this was an instance
of reading something

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.916
that I kind of thought
I wasn't going to like.

00:43:49.916 --> 00:43:51.960
In fact, it's a
novel about football.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.140
And as it becomes clear,
despite a brief period

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.950
of playing rugby in college,
I'm the least sporty person.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.560
I mean, I will probably trip
on my way off the stage.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:06.450
And so I would never
have read this book.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.150
But what happened is that one
of my colleagues reviewed it

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.330
and wrote such an entertaining
positive review that I really

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:16.342
felt annoyed, because I thought,
now I'm tempted to read this.

00:44:16.342 --> 00:44:18.300
And I don't want to read
a book about football.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.460
I don't know a single thing
about football, let alone care

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.040
to know a single
thing about football.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.650
So that happened.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:31.320
And then the paperback
came in, and then it

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.330
had a little blurb
from the reviewer who

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:36.390
is on staff at the book
review on the front cover.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.082
And I thought, darn
it, another thing

00:44:39.082 --> 00:44:41.040
that's going to make me
want to read this book.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.510
And then I had to interview
the author at an event

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:48.630
up at Amherst College for
the National Book Foundation.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.300
And so I thought, well,
I've got to read it now.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:51.930
And I loved it.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:52.680
It's really great.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.520
It's so funny.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.070
And of course, even though
it is about football,

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:00.120
It's about the Theismann play,
for those football people

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.270
out there, which is apparently
this horrific injury that

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.280
occurred on "Monday
Night Football" decades

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.610
ago, that the football
people remember very

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:14.130
well, because the guy's leg
broken in a really unkind way,

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.660
and he never played
football again.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:19.860
And the novel is about 22 guys
who get together every year

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.340
to recreate this play.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.330
And so it's sort of like a Civil
War re-enactment kind of thing.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:30.337
I mean, it's a guy
sort of ritual thing.

00:45:30.337 --> 00:45:31.920
But ultimately, what
the book is about

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:37.430
is about midlife and manhood
and masculinity and friendship.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:40.950
And I'm getting goosebumps, see.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:43.230
We're very sentimental.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:44.231
I loved it.

00:45:44.231 --> 00:45:46.230
It was really great, and
it was so well-written,

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.250
and it was so funny.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:49.320
And so I was one of
those annoying people

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.810
that any time someone came
into the room, I'm like,

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:54.110
I'm just going to read
this one paragraph.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.350
And then it'd be like
two pages, and I'm like,

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:57.120
I'm only going to read
you just one other thing

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.300
that you just have to hear,
because it was that good.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.870
JAIME GREEN: All right,
"The Throwback Special"?

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:01.600
PAMELA PAUL: Yes.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.274
I recommend it.

00:46:02.274 --> 00:46:04.440
JAIME GREEN: All right,
well, we're out of time now.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.240
But thank you so
much for coming in.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.030
PAMELA PAUL: Thank
you for having me.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:12.080
[APPLAUSE]
