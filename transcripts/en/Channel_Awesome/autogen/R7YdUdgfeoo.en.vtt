00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't even think about and it's just
like<00:08:49.640><c> Oh</c><00:08:49.790><c> like</c><00:08:50.360><c> how</c><00:08:50.510><c> could</c><00:08:51.080><c> I</c><00:08:51.170><c> miss</c><00:08:51.649><c> this</c><00:08:51.860><c> how</c>

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.010 align:start position:0%
like Oh like how could I miss this how
 

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.950 align:start position:0%
like Oh like how could I miss this how
can<00:08:52.160><c> is</c><00:08:52.339><c> this</c><00:08:52.520><c> very</c><00:08:52.730><c> obvious</c><00:08:52.880><c> thing</c><00:08:53.390><c> that</c><00:08:53.690><c> I</c>

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
can is this very obvious thing that I
 

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.139 align:start position:0%
can is this very obvious thing that I
didn't<00:08:54.350><c> notice</c><00:08:54.500><c> um</c><00:08:55.010><c> again</c><00:08:55.640><c> tying</c><00:08:55.850><c> it</c><00:08:56.000><c> back</c><00:08:56.029><c> to</c>

00:08:56.139 --> 00:08:56.149 align:start position:0%
didn't notice um again tying it back to
 

00:08:56.149 --> 00:08:57.730 align:start position:0%
didn't notice um again tying it back to
the<00:08:56.330><c> episode</c><00:08:56.690><c> um</c>

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:57.740 align:start position:0%
the episode um
 

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
the episode um
so<00:08:58.040><c> yeah</c><00:08:58.279><c> I</c><00:08:58.310><c> think</c><00:08:58.550><c> that's</c><00:08:58.910><c> something</c><00:08:59.120><c> where</c><00:08:59.570><c> I</c>

00:08:59.920 --> 00:08:59.930 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think that's something where I
 

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.410 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think that's something where I
like<00:09:00.770><c> it</c><00:09:00.800><c> again</c><00:09:01.430><c> in</c><00:09:01.610><c> fact</c><00:09:01.760><c> your</c><00:09:01.880><c> time</c><00:09:02.000><c> CAD</c><00:09:02.209><c> does</c>

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:02.420 align:start position:0%
like it again in fact your time CAD does
 

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
like it again in fact your time CAD does
this<00:09:02.630><c> to</c><00:09:02.870><c> where</c><00:09:03.080><c> they</c><00:09:03.170><c> really</c><00:09:03.470><c> sort</c><00:09:03.709><c> of</c><00:09:03.740><c> hit</c>
