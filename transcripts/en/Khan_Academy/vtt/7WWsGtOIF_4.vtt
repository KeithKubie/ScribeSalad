00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.450
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Kahn Academy

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.820
and today we're learning more

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.700
about McDonald versus Chicago,
a 2010 Supreme Court case

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.360
challenging a handgun ban
in the city of Chicago.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.320
The question at issue was whether

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.870
the 14th Amendment's due
process or privileges

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.560
or immunities clause means
that the 2nd Amendment right

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.990
to keep and bear arms for
the purposes of self defense

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.450
is applicable to the states
or, put more plainly,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.780
the 2nd Amendment says
the federal government

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.470
can't infringe on citizens'
rights to keep and bear arms,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.150
but can state governments?

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.256
To learn more about
McDonald versus Chicago,

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:40.130
I talked to two experts.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.860
Alan Gura is a lawyer who
argued McDonald versus Chicago

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.430
before the Supreme Court.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.390
Elizabeth Wydra is a
Supreme Court litigator and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.730
the president of the Constitutional
Accountability Center.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.760
So, Miss Wydra, could
you set the stage for us?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.050
Who were the challengers
in this case and why

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.260
did they decide to sue?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.231
- [Elizabeth] The lead plaintiff
is or was Otis McDonald,

00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:05.860
then 76 year old African American retired

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.199
maintenance engineer who
lived in a part of Chicago

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:12.980
and wanted to have a gun
for self defense, a handgun,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.350
to protect himself and
his family in his home.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.320
He lived in a neighborhood that had grown

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.320
increasingly troubled with
gang and drug related violence

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.400
and he felt that he
wanted to have a handgun

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.760
to protect his wife and
his family after his home

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.400
had been broken into several times.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.198
But because the city of
Chicago had strict rules

00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:37.198
barring handguns, he and
three other Chicago residents

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.180
brought their case into
court asking the court

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.560
to find that the individual
right to keep and bear arms,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.090
including a handgun for
self defense in the home

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.704
that had been recognized
just a few years earlier

00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:51.680
by the Supreme Court with respect
to the federal government,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.520
also applies to the states
and cities like Chicago.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.249
- [Alan] In 2008, the
Supreme Court had held

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.590
that the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.680
guarantees Americans
the right to have guns

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.445
for the purpose of self
defense, but that case

00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:12.320
took place in Washington
D.C., and Washington D.C.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.670
is sort of a unique creature in our law.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.030
It's a federal city, it's not located

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.010
in any particular state, and so everything

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.950
that the city of Washington
does is essentially

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.470
done by the federal government or a unit

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.280
of the federal government
to which the Bill of Rights

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.700
applies directly, but
historically, the Bill of Rights

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.700
was never thought to
apply directly to limit

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.320
what cities and states could do.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.130
- [Kim] So what were some
of competing interpretations

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.300
that were at issue in this case?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.221
- [Alan] Well, there were
a number of interpretations

00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:51.370
that were at issue.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.390
The 14th Amendment has
several parts to it.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.680
In the first section
of the 14th Amendment,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.397
it states that, "no state
shall make or enforce

00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:03.397
"any law which shall
abridge the privileges

00:03:03.397 --> 00:03:06.900
"or immunities of citizens
of the United States."

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.660
And then it also says, among other things,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.730
that "states can't deprive
people of due process

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.730
"when it comes time to
regulating their life, liberty,

00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:19.840
"or property."

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.650
States may not deprive anyone
of life, liberty, or property

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.490
without due process of law.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.830
When it comes to your basic civil rights,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.980
the question had always
been whether or not

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.306
the states are bound not to
violate your civil rights

00:03:34.306 --> 00:03:38.570
because they are told not
to abridge the privileges

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.470
or immunities of American
citizens or are your rights

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.250
not to be violated because
the states can't deprive you

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.970
of due process of law.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.430
- [Elizabeth] So when the
drafters of the 14th Amendment

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.630
were coming together to
think about what rights

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.535
would be protected in the 14th Amendment,

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:59.120
they looked at a lot of the
abuses by state governments

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.810
of key rights that had
been previously protected

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.363
against federal government
action in the Bill of Rights.

00:04:04.363 --> 00:04:07.830
And when they were debating
what rights would be included

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.519
in these protections against state action,

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.750
they talked repeatedly
about the importance

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.020
of the right to keep and bear arms.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.250
But the way they talked
about it was very different

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.870
from the way that we think

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.050
about the 18th century
revolutionary founders talking

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.810
about the right to keep and bear arms.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.230
In that case, it was very
much about the militia

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.440
and preventing the tyranny
of government action.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.944
In the 14th Amendment
context, the right to keep

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:37.410
and bear arms was very
much an individual right.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.850
They were concerned about
freed persons being subject

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.480
to white militia violence and being able

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.000
to protect themselves
with a gun in their house,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.120
and so that was really
one of the ways in which

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.980
they wanted to protect the
individual right to keep

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.660
and bear arms, different
from the way that I think

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.330
the founders thought about
it when they were drafting

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.987
the 2nd Amendment.

00:04:58.987 --> 00:04:59.960
- [Kim] Yeah, this is a
really interesting point

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.140
because you can kind of
see how these things evolve

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.110
over time and particularly in the 1860s

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.862
after the Civil War, there are
many local or state statutes

00:05:11.862 --> 00:05:15.530
known as the Black Codes
that specifically prevented

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.760
newly free African Americans
from owning firearms

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.150
or any kind of weapon.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.690
- [Elizabeth] Exactly,
and that was a concern

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.840
because, one, it was a
right that they considered

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.980
to be a right of citizenship,
but two, and more practically

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.900
and more immediately of
concern for the people

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.518
who were being targeted
by this racial violence,

00:05:33.518 --> 00:05:36.660
it was something that was a question

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.940
of life or death for them,
and the debates on this

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.930
by the drafters of the 14th
Amendment were very clear

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.000
and very colorful.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.821
Senator Samuel Pomeroy
described how indispensable

00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:50.185
the right to keep and bear arms was

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:52.530
and how important it was
that the 14th Amendment

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.560
protect that right.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.657
He said during the debates,
"every man should have

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:59.387
"the right to bear arms
for the defense of himself,

00:05:59.387 --> 00:06:01.267
"and family, and his homestead.

00:06:01.267 --> 00:06:04.617
"And if the cabin door of
the freedman is broken open,

00:06:04.617 --> 00:06:07.677
"and the intruder enters
for purposes as vile

00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:11.077
"as were known to slavery, then
should a well-loaded musket

00:06:11.077 --> 00:06:14.007
"be in the hand of the occupant,
to send the polluted wretch

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:16.077
"to another world, where his wretchedness

00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:18.100
"will forever remain complete."

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.420
- [Kim] So going back
to the McDonald case,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.610
how did the court rule in this case?

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.570
- [Alan] In McDonald,
we made two arguments

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.930
for why we should win.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.362
The first argument we
made was the historically

00:06:29.362 --> 00:06:32.350
more obvious one, although
it's one that the courts

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.000
had not often entertained,
and that's the argument

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.750
that says that when the
14th Amendment provided

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.466
that the people cannot be
deprived of the privileges

00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:44.560
or immunities of American citizenship.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.090
That means they couldn't be deprived

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.980
of their basic fundamental rights.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.510
Right there in the text
of the 14th Amendment

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.260
it tells you that you can't
be deprived of the rights

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.820
of American citizenship.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.980
Secondly, we made the
argument that, and this is

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.200
the argument that the courts
have been more open to

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.310
over the years, we made the
argument that where the state

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.610
is prohibited from depriving Otis McDonald

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.560
and other Chicago residents
of due process of law,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.650
and you can't deprive
someone of due process.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.240
That means not just that the state

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.470
can do things arbitrarily,
not just that Otis McDonald

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.700
is entitled to some procedural protections

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.320
in the way that he's regulated,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.700
but also that there's
some results, some things

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.550
that simply cannot be
done, and taking away

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.550
someone's firearms in violation
of the 2nd Amendment rights

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.200
is not something that the state can do.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.710
There's no procedure that
the state could create

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.820
to achieve that.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.770
They would still be considered to be

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.150
giving somebody due process of law.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.640
- [Elizabeth] So the court
said what we have done

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.940
when we've looked at individual rights

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.810
under the 14th Amendment,
and whether or not

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.270
original Bill of Rights
rights that were initially

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.350
understood to limit the federal government

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.140
applied to the states,
is look at whether or not

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.660
they are part of what
we generally talk about

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.440
as fundamental to our
scheme of ordered liberty,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.448
or stated another way, the
question is whether the right

00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:16.930
is firmly rooted in this
nation's history and tradition,

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.900
and when they looked at
that question with respect

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.760
to the right to keep and
bear arms, they looked at

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.730
a lot of the Reconstruction
history and said

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.110
this was clearly something
that the drafters

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.410
of the 14th Amendment considered
to be very fundamental

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.466
to ordered liberty and
thought that, indeed,

00:08:32.466 --> 00:08:37.466
the freedmen, the African
American people of the South

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.420
who had been subject to the slave power

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.610
and people across the
country who'd been subject

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.470
to discrimination from
the states should be able

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.860
to look to the Constitution
to protect the right

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.910
to keep and bear arms as
their individual right,

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.530
just as the court had
held in the Heller case,

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.260
they could be able to
look to the Constitution

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.410
for protection of that right

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.020
against the federal government.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.510
- [Kim] So in the McDonald
case, how did the majority

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.810
of the court rule?

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.210
- [Alan] The justices broke
down in multiple different ways.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.923
There were four justices,
led by Justice Alito,

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:12.890
who refused to look any
further at the privileges

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.440
or immunities clause.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.600
They thought it was old, it
was water under the bridge.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.410
They were not interested in looking to see

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.122
whether or not the courts
erasing of that provision

00:09:25.122 --> 00:09:28.771
was legitimate, even it's widely agreed

00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.040
to be illegitimate today, but the court

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.850
didn't wanna go there, and
instead those four justices,

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.850
led by Justice Alito, held
that the due process clause

00:09:37.974 --> 00:09:41.820
incorporates the 2nd Amendment
right to keep and bear arms

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.950
as against the states because
it is a fundamental right.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.710
It's deeply rooted in our
nation's history and traditions.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.500
It's something that's very
basic to our understanding

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.230
of our civil and political institutions.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.000
The four justices thought the
right to keep and bear arms

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.040
is fundamental.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.010
- [Elizabeth] There was actually
a debate among the members

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.410
of the majority who all
believe that there was a right

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.340
to have a handgun in the
house for self defense

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.320
that was protected against state

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.349
and local government
regulations, but Justice Thomas

00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:15.500
would have found that right
through another means.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.300
He would have looked at the
privileges or immunities clause

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.300
of the 14th Amendment, instead
of the now accepted method

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.800
of looking at due process liberty clause

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.710
of the 14th Amendment, which
is how these other provisions

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.980
of the Bill of Rights
have been incorporated

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.200
against the states.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.890
There were many arguments,
including, I should say,

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.403
a brief that I filed on behalf of scholars

00:10:41.403 --> 00:10:44.530
from across the ideological spectrum

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.360
who said that, in fact, the
privileges or immunities clause

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.958
of the 14th Amendment is the part

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:54.720
of that constitutional
amendment that was intended

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.790
to protect this particular
substantive right

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.259
as well as the other substantive rights

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:04.150
of the Bill of Rights
against state infringement,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.130
just as Thomas'
concurrence did not get any

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.200
of the other votes,
whether from the people

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.910
who were against the right
to keep and bear arms

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.710
or those who didn't, but it
is an important contribution

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.058
to thinking about how we understand rights

00:11:19.058 --> 00:11:23.030
and where they are protected
in the Constitution.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.840
- [Alan] Justice Thomas'
opinion in McDonald

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.890
is groundbreaking.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.230
It represents the first time since 1868

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.064
that the original meaning
of the 14th Amendment's

00:11:34.064 --> 00:11:37.430
privileges or immunities
clause, the basic protection

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.750
that we have for civil
rights in this country

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.020
against state and local
governments was decisive

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.150
in a case at the Supreme Court.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:50.150
It's been that long since a
true original understanding

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.410
of the 14th Amendment's
language has finally proven

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.260
to be decisive.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.210
- [Elizabeth] There
were, of course, justices

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.960
who thought that there is
not an individual right

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.493
to have a handgun in the
home for self defense.

00:12:05.426 --> 00:12:08.760
These were the same
justices, not surprisingly,

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.922
who thought there wasn't
a 2nd Amendment right

00:12:10.922 --> 00:12:14.850
to be protected against
federal government action

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.840
to keep a handgun in the
home for self defense.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.668
They would've thought that
this was much more a right

00:12:19.668 --> 00:12:22.610
in the 2nd Amendment
context that had to do

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.530
with militia service, military service,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.260
and therefore did not extend
to an individual right

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.140
to have a gun in the
home for self defense.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.970
- [Alan] McDonald's really
a 14th Amendment case.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.560
I mean, guns happen to be
the thing that was in it,

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.172
but I'd always seen as primarily
is a 14th Amendment case.

00:12:39.172 --> 00:12:40.960
It's not really a case
that tells you anything

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.933
about the scope of the 2nd Amendment.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.440
In fact, it doesn't say
anything about the scope

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.420
of the 2nd Amendment, very little.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.510
- [Elizabeth] There are many
issues left to be resolved

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.380
in the 2nd Amendment context.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.250
The Heller case itself,
which first articulated

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.860
that there was a right for
individuals to keep and bear arms

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.610
in their homes for self defense made clear

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.700
that it wasn't saying that there
could be no gun regulation.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.110
That case, even though it was
written by Justice Scolia,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.740
and certainly in the McDonald case,

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.518
Justice Alito's majority
opinion reiterated this,

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:15.600
said that while there were certain laws

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.420
that would be struck
down as unconstitutional

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.560
because they prohibited
the possession of handguns

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.210
in the home, they
recognized at the same time

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.380
that the right to keep and
bear arms is not a right

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.400
to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.760
in any manner whatsoever,
and for whatever purpose,

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.457
so given that the court itself,

00:13:33.457 --> 00:13:36.807
and even very conservative
justices recognize

00:13:36.807 --> 00:13:41.000
that there could be and perhaps should be

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.970
common sense limitations
on both the types of guns

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.260
that are allowed, the manner
in which they are allowed,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.230
and where they can be
taken and in what manner,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.550
then a lot of the gun
regulations that are being passed

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.100
are still very much a part
of the constitutional debate.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.240
We've seen, frankly, most
of the laws, thus far,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.870
be upheld as constitutional
laws, that, for example,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.788
target assault weapons,
high capacity magazines,

00:14:12.788 --> 00:14:16.790
and certain licensing and
registration requirements.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.000
So I think we will see more
cases to define the contours

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.796
of the individual right
to keep and bear arms

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:27.296
as these gun regulations get passed

00:14:27.296 --> 00:14:32.250
and as the courts get to pass
upon their constitutionality.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.180
- [Kim] So we've learned
that the Supreme Court ruled

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.360
that the 14th Amendment's
due process clause

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.780
that no state can deprive
a citizen of life,

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.500
liberty, or property
without due process of law,

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.653
did incorporate the 2nd
Amendment into the states

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:50.910
under the reasoning that the
right to keep and bear arms

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.630
for self defense is fundamental
to the nation's scheme

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.090
of ordered liberty.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.820
According to Alan Gura,
even though this case

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.420
was about guns, it was
really a 14th Amendment case

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.170
concerning whether states can
restrict citizens' liberty.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.320
Elizabeth Wydra, however,
cautions that the decision

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.340
in McDonald didn't preclude any
restriction on gun ownership

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.880
and she suspects that
new cases will continue

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.280
to define the individual
right to keep and bear arms.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.679
