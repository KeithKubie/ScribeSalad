1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,040
Today.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,660
I wanted to begin with that
question I left you with.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,853
Um,

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,780
what does housekeeping have
to do with the identity plot?

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,760
Did you see elements of the
identity plot in this novel?

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,803
Who did?

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,200
Okay.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,260
And what did you see? Yes.
What did you see? Oh yeah. Oh,

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,530
now you have to, you
have to make good. Yes.

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,583
MMM.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,930
You going, I can come
back to you. Yes, I would.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,780
I would be quite happy to do that.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,870
Is someone else more ready to say what
this novel has to do with the identity

14
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,590
pot?
Yes.

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,180
Well,

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,180
I wouldn't leave speaking Ruth struggles
with her own identity and how to fit it

17
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:55,820
into societal conceptions of what
it means to be a normal person

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,400
and function.

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,590
Absolutely. And what
details for you most, um,

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,570
mark that conflict in Ruth?
Where do you see that happening?

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,370
Can you see it a lot in her care?
Ah Huh.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,650
In her hair and her dress? Yes.
So you see, by contrast with Ruth,

23
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:22,700
you see Lucille doing a
lot of work on her hair,

24
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,660
trying to make clothes,
um,

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,740
becoming close with the
home economics teacher, uh,

26
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,780
chiding Ruth for not looking normal
than they walked down the street.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,910
Um,
so you really do see it in that dynamic,

28
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:42,560
especially between the two sisters
and as you say, and clothes and hair.

29
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,300
Where else do you see this?

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,050
Yeah,

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,030
that sense of being at odds is one
part of it. Where else do you see it?

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,640
Okay. You're not talkative today.
Let's try something easier.

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,240
I'd like to read the first
sentence of the novel.

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,840
Yeah.

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,430
My name is Ruth.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,690
What can we say about that sentence
as the opening sentence of a novel?

37
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,200
Any thoughts or observations about it?

38
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,653
Yes.

39
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,200
Yes, it absolutely does. And
what's the first line of Moby Dick?

40
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,140
Call me. Oh, in chorus.
That was beautiful.

41
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,700
So you may have read Moby Dick
even if he didn't read this. Um, so

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
call me Ishmael. Okay. Absolutely.

43
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,470
Marilyn Robinson as is going to emerge
in my lecture today is very much

44
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:48,160
preoccupied with the 19th century.
She is very interested,

45
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:53,161
especially in these classic American
writers of the American transcendental

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,990
school, and that's Melville,
Hawthorne, Emerson.

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,820
I'm also very interested in Dickinson,
Emily Dickinson.

48
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,880
She has a sensibility that
maps very closely with theirs,

49
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,960
and I'll get into that towards
the end of of my lecture today,

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,590
but just as a narrative strategy,

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,100
how is call me Ishmael
different from my name is Ruth.

52
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,070
You would have ideas about that.
What do you,

53
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,580
what's different about
those two sentences?

54
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,330
Yeah,
we'll call me Ishmael.

55
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:35,740
Seems like it's more of a
choice on the characters' part.

56
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,140
Identify themselves [inaudible] is this
something that was given to her or not?

57
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,790
It wasn't something that she chose.

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,120
Okay, very good. Yeah, so Ishmael says,

59
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,860
here's what I want you to call me,
and Ruth says to us,

60
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:53,700
this is what people do call.
Yes.

61
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,110
What is interactive in
what is declarative?

62
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,810
Absolutely. Yes. So the
called me implies a you,

63
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:05,010
it reaches out of the text and
uses that implied second person.

64
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,850
You call me Ishmael.
My name is Ruth.

65
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:11,160
Simple declarative sentence.

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,520
It gives you that sense that
Ruth is more separate from you,

67
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,300
perhaps as a reader.
Um,

68
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,380
then Ishmael is Ishmael wants
to enter into dialogue with you,

69
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:27,960
wants you to reach out towards him.

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Ruth offers you herself as something
like the object of contemplation or a

71
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:40,530
stranger as a stranger. That's
what a stranger says to you. Hi,

72
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,630
my name is Amy. Uh, that's the kind
of address a stranger gives you.

73
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,380
What else do you notice
about those two sentences?

74
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:54,381
Any other differences you can think of
or similarities even between the two?

75
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,250
Both those names. Ruth initial
male. Yes. Is your hand up?

76
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,000
Your hand is yes. Dangerously floating?
Yes. Actually I'll take yes. You,

77
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,930
yeah, absolutely. Both people call names
and they have certain similarities too.

78
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,183
Yes.

79
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,420
Uh, finish male. We're sort of a stranger
unit cultures that they lived in.

80
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,760
Absolutely.
Can you explain more about that?

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,753
Well,
um,

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,360
if mail was the first son of Abraham
that he was not really brought into the

83
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:33,991
family and eventually he was left in the
wilderness stories that from him spring

84
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,400
up the, uh, the Arabic tribes.

85
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,200
That's right. So He's Hagar
son. He is the son of Abraham's,

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,160
uh, is or, um, Sarah serving woman.

87
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,630
So He's, I, Abraham is unable
to conceive a child with Sarah.

88
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,910
So he sleeps with Hagar and Hagar
bears him, his son, Ishmael.

89
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,440
So he's from the family of Abraham,
but he's outside that family.

90
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,680
Now what about Ruth? Do
you want to continue? Yeah.

91
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,700
Ruth married into a Jewish family.
She herself with,

92
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,230
from a Jewish family. She
was from another tribe. Um,

93
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,420
but she went,

94
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:18,950
her husband died and her father in law
died instead of returning to her own

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,870
people,
she stayed with her mother in law.

96
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,320
That's right. So she stays
with her mother in law, Naomi,

97
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,690
and they go back to the land
of Judah. And there she, uh,

98
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,580
becomes known as a righteous woman,
a humble,

99
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,230
loving, and righteous woman. She is a
daughter to her mother in law. Naomi,

100
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,460
she in fact, stays with Naomi,
um, because she loves her.

101
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,830
There's this beautiful line,
uh,

102
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,920
when Naomi urges her to go back to
her own mother and stay in Moab,

103
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:55,550
her own land,
she says to Naomi,

104
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,900
where you go, I will go. It's probably
a line you've heard and it goes on.

105
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:03,170
It's a very beautiful,
actually meant to bring my Bible with me,

106
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:07,460
but I seem to have forgotten
it. Um, very beautiful line.

107
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,480
So it highlights her faithfulness.

108
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,510
It's faith to Naomi that brings her into
the realm of Judah under the protection

109
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,410
of the god of the Israelites and
causes her to become married to Boaz,

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,770
who was of a noble family.

111
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,930
And Ruth finally is the great
grandmother of King David.

112
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,840
So she is an alien,

113
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,841
a stranger who comes into the Israelite
fold and ends up being in the lineage of

114
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:49,520
their greatest king. And in
the New Testament, of course,

115
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:54,521
that also means that she is of the house
of Jesus because Jesus is of the House

116
00:07:55,941 --> 00:08:00,230
of David.
So in Christian teaching,

117
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,290
the story of Ruth is about the
foreshadowing of the gentile inclusion

118
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,970
of the Jewish redemption.
So the Jewish Messiah

119
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,390
is the world's redeemer and
the presence of the alien,

120
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:25,391
the stranger in his bloodline suggests
that expansion of the promise.

121
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,870
So Ruth is a very important character.

122
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,200
She is identified both by her status as
a stranger and by her absolute central

123
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:39,470
valley to a strong identity,

124
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,730
either as Israel light or as Christian.

125
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,930
So in these two versions of these,
this story of lineage,

126
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,880
it is no accident that this is
the name that Robinson chosen for,

127
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,260
for this character.
Um,

128
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,040
lots of elements of that
story enter into Ruth's story.

129
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,960
So Ruth,

130
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,350
like her namesake cleaves
to a woman relative,

131
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,590
and this is Sylvie Shi Shi cleaves
to and becomes faithful to Sylvie,

132
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:20,220
her aunt in place of her own mother.

133
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,550
So there is an exchange as in the biblical
story between the mother that she has

134
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,840
lost this in this novel through
the mother's suicide. Uh,

135
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,630
she's replaced with an aunt.

136
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,980
There's also that sense that she
follows the aunt into a wandering life.

137
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,300
So in the biblical story,
the wandering has a very clear end.

138
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,420
It's a wandering back to
the mother in law's land.

139
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,420
Back to Judah.

140
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,680
You will have to think about as
you get to the end of this novel,

141
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,040
whether there is an end to the wandering
in housekeeping or whether it is an

142
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:07,500
unmitigated wandering

143
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,950
related to that question is
another one about narrative.

144
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,670
And that is where does
this voice come from?

145
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,760
What account of this voice are we given?

146
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,350
Who is speaking to us and from
what position in the world?

147
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,990
This is a question, I will get a
two by the end of this lecture.

148
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,920
We will come to an
understanding of that question.

149
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,403
So

150
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,480
the biblical reference as well as the
male Villian reference suggests wandering

151
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,240
and it suggests a complex
picture of identity.

152
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,600
And I think that's what you get in the
novel that connects it to the conventions

153
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,500
of the identity pot.

154
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,230
So there's one element which is the
whole theme of Lucille and Ruth,

155
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:04,350
which uh, I was talking about
coming from your comment.

156
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,620
That's the simple version. There's
a more complicated version, um,

157
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,020
that I just want to show you on 96 97.

158
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay.

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is when Lucille and Ruth
are playing hooky from school.

160
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,690
They've made their summer very long.
Starting in March,

161
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,670
I don't recommend this by the way.
Um,

162
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,970
and they are walking around by the
railroad tracks and they come upon some

163
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:40,964
hobos.

164
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,200
This top of 96 we in our plaid dresses
in Orlon sweaters and velveteen shoes and

165
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:54,280
they in their suit coats with the
vestigial collars turned and the lapels

166
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,114
closed.

167
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,860
Might have been marooned survivors
of some lost pleasure craft.

168
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,780
We and they alone might have escaped
the destruction of some sleek train.

169
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:08,560
That's an Ishmael Ishmael
reference right there.

170
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,540
Ishmael is the only person to escape the
p Quad to come back and tell the story.

171
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,170
So there's an element of that
Melville reference rate here too.

172
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,030
Some flying shuttle of
business or commerce.

173
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:27,031
Lucio and I might have been to have a
numerous family off to visit a grandmother

174
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:28,120
in lap.
Why?

175
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,700
And they might've been touring
legislators or members of a dance band.

176
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,260
Then our being there on a bigger
morning and ruined and unsuitable close

177
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:43,261
wordlessly looking at the water would
be entirely understandable as it was.

178
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,120
I thought of telling them that our
grandfathers still lay in a train that had

179
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,210
slid to the lake floor
long before we were born.

180
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,360
Perhaps we all awaited a resurrection.

181
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,470
Perhaps we expected a train to
leap out of the water caboose.

182
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,420
Foremost as if in a movie run backward
and then to continue across the bridge,

183
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,160
the passengers would arrive sounder than
they departed accustomed to the depth

184
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,080
serene about the restoration to the light
disembarking at the station and finger

185
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:15,400
bone with a calm.

186
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,200
That quieted the astonishment of friends
say that this resurrection was general

187
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:23,530
enough to include my
grandmother and Helen.

188
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:28,531
My mother say that Hellen lifted our hair
from our napes with her cold hands and

189
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:31,390
gave us strawberries from her purse.

190
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Say That my grandmother Peck Tower Browse
with her whiskery lips and then all of

191
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:40,300
them went down the road to our house,
my grandfather,

192
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:44,770
youngish and high pocketed just outside
their conversation like a difficult

193
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:49,420
memory or a ghost. Then Lucille
and I could run off to the woods,

194
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,460
leaving them to talk about old times and
make sandwiches for lunch and show each

195
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,930
other snapshots.

196
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,560
There's a lovely movement in that passage.

197
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,310
So first she moves from a fantasy that
would make the hobos and Lucille and

198
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:13,540
Ruth,
part of comprehensible holes,

199
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,280
comprehensible social groups,
going to identifiable places,

200
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,040
moving through spaces that made sense.

201
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,100
So if they were legislators,

202
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,190
members of a dance band or the girls
were part of some large family.

203
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,770
If they were all on some pleasure craft,

204
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,800
it would explain the inappropriateness
of their clothes and how they ruined if

205
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,310
there had been a disaster.

206
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,550
All these are ways of imagining a stable
and socially legible identity for all

207
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,860
the people in the scene,
Hobos and girls.

208
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Then it slips into this moment where the
difference between Ruth and Lucille and

209
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:05,000
the Hobos is insisted upon when she says,

210
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,190
I thought as it was,

211
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:12,191
I thought of telling them that our
grandfathers still lay in a train that had

212
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:17,381
slid to the lake floor long before we
were born by turning to the Hobos and in

213
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,420
her mind addressing them.

214
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,540
She pushes them further away from
her and Lucille and begins to craft a

215
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:29,030
distinction between them.
They,

216
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,390
Ruth and Lucille are rooted in finger
bone by the very weight of their family

217
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,800
lying at the bottom of the lake.

218
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,770
So it gives them a rootedness to the
place that the Hobos can't claim.

219
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,160
The hobos transients is highlighted
by this imagined address to them

220
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,933
when

221
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,460
she further dreams of the
resurrection of the whole train,

222
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,340
all the family at the bottom of the lake.

223
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,550
It allows her to imagine herself
and Lucille in this warm,

224
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:10,370
coherent embrace in a more fulsome way.

225
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,700
So the family then isn't just imagined
to distinguish them from the Hobos,

226
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,460
but to imagine a more fully alive,
uh,

227
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,740
presence to her,

228
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,470
a family that will restore her
identity and her legibility to herself,

229
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,500
not just to the Hobos or

230
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,393
the town.

231
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,280
And I love this repeated structure,
verbal structure.

232
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,600
Say the proposition.
Say that Hellen lifted our hair,

233
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,580
a very intimate gesture.

234
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,280
Say That my grandmother picked her
brows with her whiskery lips so that it

235
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,430
invites us into the sensual
commerce of a family.

236
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,470
That's what she uses her imagination
to do. But then how it ends a,

237
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,910
you can't miss this.

238
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,410
Lucille and I could run off to the woods,

239
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,980
the restoration of the family.

240
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:15,810
The resurrection is precisely what then
will liberate them to do exactly what

241
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:19,590
they're doing now. Running off
to the woods, being truant.

242
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:26,210
So in this beautifully crafted passage
where we see Ruth's imagination moving

243
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,190
from one fantasy to another,

244
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,360
you see how the act of trying to
restore her own legibility through this

245
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:36,330
narrative,

246
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,110
through that repeated say the propositions
finally gets her back to where she

247
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:47,361
was before so that the restoration of a
secure identity in a family is in fact

248
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:55,221
what then propels her out to imagine
once again her separateness from it.

249
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,540
So what Robinson gives us,
I think in this version,

250
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:05,460
not so much in the story of Lucille and
Ruth and the difference between the two

251
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,294
of them,

252
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,810
which parses the problem as being those
who conform and can be legible to the

253
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:18,840
world and those who are not and have
to be separate from the social world.

254
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,760
Lucille goes to the home economics
teacher roof goes with Sylvie.

255
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,580
That's a very simple split.

256
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,130
This passage and the way Ruth's mind
works makes it much more complex.

257
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,910
So that it's the identity that
allows for the final alienation,

258
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,550
the identity or the security in the family
is what allows for the finding of one

259
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,630
separateness in the woods.

260
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,430
So there are two kinds
of identity at issue,

261
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,680
the single and the communal,

262
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:58,080
or we could say the
contemplative and the social.

263
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:04,010
I think it's ultimately the contemplative
or the singular person that interests

264
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:07,350
Robinson even more.

265
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,100
But I will say that in the
initial reception of this novel,

266
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,250
because the identity plot is so fixed
in the pattern of literary work in this

267
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,930
period,
and also fixed in the concerns of critics,

268
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,180
early readings of this novel,

269
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,210
really we're all about that
simpler version of identification.

270
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,910
People read this as a feminist novel
that was really all about women being

271
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:40,911
liberated from a confining domesticity
and finding their individual identity out

272
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:45,480
there in the world some other way.

273
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,800
So that housekeeping and it's rejection
where the major terms of the criticism

274
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,410
and if you've ever seen the film Fellman
Louise, you can sort of see the, uh,

275
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,220
the,

276
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,660
the way it chimes with a lot of what
was being thought in popular culture on

277
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,620
these questions.

278
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,360
You can think of Helen sailing
off the cliff into the lake,

279
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,660
so seamen as empowering in her car.

280
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,260
It did not take long for readers of this
novel to abandon that because of the

281
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,410
predominance of the themes that
I'm going to talk about next.

282
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,770
And that's the question of how can you
be a coherent person in this world?

283
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,820
What does that look like?

284
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,660
Ruth is very troubled by this quality.

285
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,780
It comes though in tiny ways like on 78

286
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,990
with other characters.
Lucille,

287
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,410
we are told is caught,
uh,

288
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,550
cheating by her teacher on a test.

289
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,770
Lucille was much too indifferent to school
ever to be guilty of teaching and it

290
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:04,771
was only an evil fate that had prompted
her to write Simone Bolivar and the girl

291
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,870
in front of her too,
right Simone Bolivar.

292
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,750
When the answer was
obviously General Santa Ana,

293
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,880
this was the only error either of them
made. And so their papers were identical.

294
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,830
Lucille was astonished to find that the
teacher was so easily convinced of her

295
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:21,930
guilt,
so immovable.

296
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,560
He persuaded of it calling her up in
front of the class and demanding that she

297
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,750
account for the identical papers.

298
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,860
Lucille rived under this
violation of her anonymity.

299
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,140
What does it mean to call that
instance of violation of her anonymity?

300
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,341
Well,

301
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:44,341
what's imagined here is that two minds
by some mysterious process sort of melded

302
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:50,740
with one another and
produce the same answers,

303
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,110
the exact identical exams.

304
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,490
Lucille is so easy with the
idea of that kind of melding

305
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:09,110
that she is stunned by being called out,

306
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,940
not as a violation of her honor,

307
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,440
but as a violation of her anonymity.

308
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,850
She wanted to be without name essentially.

309
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,300
That's what being anonymous means.
You're without a name,

310
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,340
you kind of blend in with the crowd.

311
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,350
That's exactly what she was doing when
her mind blended with that of the girl in

312
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:35,610
front of her and they produced identical
papers. It's a funny little logic.

313
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,640
It's a tiny detail that you can see now
rhyming with other details in the novel.

314
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:46,940
If you think of the conversation
between Lillian knownow, the two, um,

315
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,310
maiden aunts that take care
of the girls for a while,

316
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,790
that funny conversation on page 38,
um,

317
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:59,870
where essentially these are two women
who have totally melded into each other.

318
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,030
They say the same things.

319
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:08,031
Their conversations are just the ritual
assurance of a shared thread of thought.

320
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,020
Someone filled the teapot.
We're not even told which of them it is,

321
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:15,750
cause you can't even
really tell which it is.

322
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,270
Children are hard for anybody.

323
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,890
The Hartwick has always kept them out and
I understand that. I don't blame them.

324
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,500
No, no. And it goes on. Um,

325
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,610
these are two people who like
Lucille and the girl in front of her.

326
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,000
Their minds have melded
this time by long habit,

327
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,620
by long living together and
buy their love for each other.

328
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,410
It gets darker though on one oh five.

329
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,843
Okay.

330
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,680
It's hard as it turns out,

331
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,050
to maintain your separateness or to
maintain a sense that you really are an

332
00:23:57,991 --> 00:23:59,490
entity as a person.

333
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,453
Okay.

334
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,730
Where's Lucille says Sylvie to
Ruth having woken up on a bench.

335
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:12,850
Yeah,

336
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,570
home says Ruth. Well,
that's fine. Sylvie said,

337
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,240
I'm glad to have a chance to talk to you.
You're so quiet.

338
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:20,740
It's hard to know what you think.

339
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,240
Sylvia had stood up and we began
to walk toward home. I suppose.

340
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,650
I don't know what I think this
confession embarrassed me.

341
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,140
It was a source of both terror and
comfort to me then that I often seemed

342
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:39,520
invisible incompletely or
minimally existent. In fact,

343
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,800
it seemed to me that I made no impact
on the world and that in exchange I was

344
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:47,050
privileged to watch it unawares,

345
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,740
but my allusion to this feeling of
ghostliness sounded peculiar and sweat

346
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:57,400
started all over my body, convicting
me on the spot of gross corporeality.

347
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,620
Well, maybe that will change. Sylvie
said, we walked a while without speaking.

348
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,720
Maybe it won't. I dropped a step
behind and watched her face.

349
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,320
She always spoke to me in the voice
of an adult dispensing wisdom.

350
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,580
I wanted to ask her if she knew
what she thought and if so,

351
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,960
what the experience of that sort
of knowledge was like and if not,

352
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,970
whether she too felt ghostly
as I imagined she must.

353
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,970
This is an instance where what?

354
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,060
What Ruth experiences might
be said to be total identity,

355
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,450
a very stable identity.

356
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,630
She cannot alienated herself from
herself to know what she is thinking.

357
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,000
So if you think about that construction,

358
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:53,420
I don't know what I think it posits
and I who could know the self,

359
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,430
that's two entities,
not one.

360
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,900
So if you don't know what you think,

361
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:08,930
maybe it's because there isn't that
objective distance between an eye and a

362
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:09,601
self.

363
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:14,601
You're not self alienated in that way
that remember Ambrose always is in lost in

364
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:18,900
the fun house.
That's his curse,

365
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:22,020
that he's alienated from himself
and he can never integrate.

366
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,470
So it's like he's Lillian
known I in one person,

367
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,510
two entities,

368
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,600
but somehow the same roof on the other
hand is like an indivisible substance.

369
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,080
But because it's indivisible,
it seems,

370
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,110
the logic here imagines it's somehow
it's like an essence or something,

371
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,423
um,

372
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,480
on substantive because it doesn't
have that alienation built into it.

373
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:01,510
How can you exist in the company of
other people if the structure for even

374
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:06,260
knowing oneself doesn't
seem to exist in the mind?

375
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,280
Yeah,

376
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,280
there are other manifestations
that have more to do with nature.

377
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:17,100
And you can find one of
these on one 15 one 16

378
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,890
the bottom of one 1615 this is when
Lucille and Ruth spend the night outside.

379
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:33,201
It's one of two very important moments
when Ruth spends the night outside.

380
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:38,010
Here's one with Lucille and there'll
be one of right after the page where I

381
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:41,640
asked you to stop for today with a Sylvie.

382
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,660
Yeah.

383
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,040
For awhile she Lucille saying Mockingbird
Hill and then she sat down beside me

384
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,600
in our ruined stronghold.

385
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:55,601
Never still never accepting that all
our human boundaries were overrun.

386
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,190
Lucile would tell this story differently.
She would say,

387
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,200
I fell asleep,
but I did not.

388
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,890
I simply let the darkness in the sky
become coextensive with the darkness in my

389
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:12,260
SCO and bowels and bones,

390
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,440
everything that falls upon
the eye is apparition.

391
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:18,260
A sheet dropped over the
world's true workings.

392
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,090
The nerves and the brain are tricked
and one is left with dreams that these

393
00:28:23,091 --> 00:28:28,010
specters loose their hands from hours
and walk away the curve of the back and

394
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:32,420
the swing of the coat so familiar as
to imply that they should be permanent

395
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:35,630
fixtures, fixtures of
the world. When in fact,

396
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,120
nothing is more perishable.

397
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Say That my mother was as tall as a man
and that she's sometimes set me on her

398
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:48,290
shoulders so that I could splash my
hands in the cold leaves above our heads.

399
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,090
Say That my grandmother was saying in her
throat while she sat on her bed and we

400
00:28:53,091 --> 00:28:54,740
laced up her big black shoes.

401
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,720
Such details are merely
accidental who could know but us.

402
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,070
And since their thoughts were
bent upon other ghosts than ours,

403
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,660
other darknesses than we had seen,
why was must we be left?

404
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,690
The survivors picking among flotsam among
the small unnoticed unvalued clutter

405
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,820
that was all that remained
when they vanished,

406
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:22,030
that only catastrophe made notable
darkness is the only solvent.

407
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,350
While it was dark,
despite Lucille's pacing and whistling,

408
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,370
and despite what must have been dreams,
since even Sylvie came to haunt me,

409
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,520
it seemed to me that there need not
be relic remnant margin residue,

410
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,910
memento, bequest, memory,
thought track or trace.

411
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,310
If only the darkness could
be perfect and permanent.

412
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,900
So Ruth Fields,

413
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:54,901
her boundaries overrun when the content
of her mind and the quality of the world

414
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,940
become indistinguishable.

415
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,390
The darkness in the mind and the body
indistinguishable from the darkness

416
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:02,260
outside her.

417
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,190
And this is a positive condition for her
in so far as it seems to eliminate the

418
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:15,580
need for things like memories,

419
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,660
traces, remnants, that
list that were given.

420
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Now I'm going to talk much more about
the question of loss on Wednesday.

421
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:27,640
That's the theme for that
lecture on this novel.

422
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:31,000
So I'm going to leave that as
something for you to think about.

423
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:34,320
What is the status of loss in the novel?
Um,

424
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,600
but for now what I want to note is how
the overrun boundaries of the self is

425
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,450
imagined as redemptive.

426
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,320
So the loss of identity as
against some other outside thing,

427
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:52,180
be it nature,
another person,

428
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:57,181
another piece of the community and other
group that is idea is imagine not as a

429
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:00,130
problem but as something to be embraced.

430
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,640
Yeah.

431
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,640
These observations about
Ruth's permeability and
the general permeability of

432
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:13,720
persons one to another brings us back
to that question that I asked a little

433
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:17,020
while ago.
Where does Ruth's voice come from?

434
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:18,980
Okay.

435
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,150
And here.

436
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:25,151
I want to note that language is imagined
to be all mixed up with the material of

437
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:35,510
the world. If you look on page 85
you can see one example of this.

438
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,293
Oops,

439
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,990
sorry.
They think that's not the,

440
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,603
okay,

441
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,360
sorry. Yeah. Yes. This
is the one that one,

442
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,170
I remember Sylvia walking through the
house with a scarf tied around her hair

443
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,070
carrying a broom.

444
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,180
Yet this was the time that leaves
began to gather in the corners.

445
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,790
There were leaves that had
been through the winter.

446
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,470
Some of them worn to a net of veins.
There were scraps of paper among them,

447
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,740
crisp and strained. From
there, mingling in the cold,

448
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:19,630
brown liquors of decay and degenerate
and regeneration, and on these scraps,

449
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,340
there were some times words,

450
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,520
one red powers meat and another which
had been the flap of an envelope,

451
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,520
had a penciled message in anonymous hand.
I think of you,

452
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,510
perhaps Sylvie, when she swept,
took care not to molest them.

453
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,290
Perhaps she sensed a Delphic niceness
in the scattering of these leaves and

454
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:44,120
paper here and not elsewhere
thus and not otherwise.

455
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:50,210
Words are all bound up in
the material of the world.

456
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,480
The stuff that gathers in the corners of
a house and more over their words that

457
00:32:55,881 --> 00:33:00,881
are very evocative powers meet as if
somehow language and leaves meeting in the

458
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:07,661
corner of a house signifies the various
powers of the cosmos coming together.

459
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,850
Powers meat,
I think of you and its anonymity.

460
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,380
It's character as coming
from an envelope flap.

461
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,490
The kind of piece of paper that travels
from one person to another suggests a

462
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:24,800
communicative minus,

463
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,950
a general intent surrounding
these pieces of matter,

464
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,990
leaves and paper.

465
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,440
So two things associated with language,

466
00:33:36,441 --> 00:33:41,441
the words themselves and also
intention gather around these debris.

467
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,400
If that is true,

468
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:51,180
we might also think of one 26 the
dictionary full of pressed flowers.

469
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,820
Sin,
another beautiful image.

470
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:59,821
So Lucille has asked Ruth to look up
pinking sheers in the dictionary because

471
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:05,350
she's trying to make her dress and she
doesn't know what the pinking shears are

472
00:34:05,351 --> 00:34:09,790
that are called for in the pattern.
And so she asks Ruth to look it up.

473
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,060
Ruth finds pressed into the flow into
the old dictionary flowers that her

474
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:20,680
grandfather has gathered,
all filed under they're alphabetical name,

475
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,540
and she is much more concerned with the
flowers than she is with getting the

476
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:32,440
definition of pinking shears. So here
you have two visions of language. One,

477
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,990
the pinking shears language.

478
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:39,991
The hoard of words is for identifying
things so you can do practical tasks.

479
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:45,760
And in this case, the practical task
is Lucille's effort to blend in with,

480
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,050
with the town.

481
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,730
Ruth's conception of language is that it
is a horde of expressive gems or part.

482
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:01,450
Well, it's not a good way
of putting it. It's um,

483
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,460
it's a vocabulary of the world
that includes not only words,

484
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:11,450
but also flowers
and that there are beauties of eat

485
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,050
all in their place in this dictionary.

486
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,760
So if language comes almost viscerally
from nature here we can see exactly how

487
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:32,040
Robinson is in the realm of the
19th century. Transcendentalists.

488
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:37,220
And here I'm going to read you a little
bit from Emerson's essay nature. Okay.

489
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,850
This is what he says about,
um, being in the woods.

490
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,280
Yeah.

491
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,140
Within these plantations of God,
a decorum and sanctity rain.

492
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:54,141
A perennial festival is dressed and the
guest sees not how he should tire of

493
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:58,650
them. In a hundred year. In a
thousand years in the woods,

494
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,860
we return to reason and faith there I
feel that nothing can be for me in life.

495
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,490
No disgrace,
no calamity leaving me my eyes,

496
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,450
which nature cannot repair.
Standing on the bare ground,

497
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:17,310
my head bathed by the blithe air
and uplifted into infinite space,

498
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,920
all mean egotism vanishes.

499
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,850
I become a transparent eyeball.
I am nothing.

500
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,650
I see all the currents of the
universal being circulate through me.

501
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,740
I am part or parcel of God,

502
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,690
the name of the nearest friend sounds
then foreign and accidental to be

503
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,370
brothers,
to be acquaintances,

504
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:42,420
master or servant is then
a trifle and a disturbance.

505
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,830
I am the lover of uncontained and
immortal beauty in the wilderness.

506
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:51,831
I find something more deer and coordinate
then in streets or villages in the

507
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:56,520
tranquil landscape and especially in
the distant line of the horizon. Man,

508
00:36:56,521 --> 00:37:00,210
behold somewhat as
beautiful as his own nature.

509
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:01,780
Okay,

510
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,560
so the transparent eyeball I am nothing.
I see all

511
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,240
that is the sense you get of Ruth's voice,

512
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,230
that Ruth's voices like the voice
of that transparent eyeball,

513
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,500
the difference between Emerson's
vision and Robinsons I think is the way

514
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:24,580
Robinson is willing to
let the human environment,

515
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,840
the built environment,

516
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:30,841
the house become part and parcel of that
woodsy hole that Emerson so wants to

517
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:35,920
immerse himself in.

518
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,600
So the house is opened to leaves,

519
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:45,690
leaves are mixed up with pieces of paper
with words and so you get that sense of

520
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:51,301
a creation that is saying something to
this consciousness in the same way that

521
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:57,970
Emerson imagines,
but it can happen in a house.

522
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:04,030
She embellishes this vision
of a speaking material world.

523
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,090
Yeah.

524
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,300
So Ruth's sense of self,

525
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,793
okay.

526
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,510
Mirrors that.
Um,

527
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,680
that fluidity that you get
in the transparent eyeball.

528
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,330
There is um,

529
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,600
also something that you can
see. Wait, hold on. I'm trying.

530
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:31,650
I'm now trying to find my, um,
the page number that I need.

531
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:38,430
Um,
this is 16 through 19.

532
00:38:38,431 --> 00:38:39,264
Here it is.

533
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,453
Okay.

534
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,680
That fluidity of consciousness that
the transparent eyeball gives you is

535
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,970
beautifully on display in this passage.
Um,

536
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,740
towards the beginning of the novel
when Ruth is thinking about how her

537
00:38:55,741 --> 00:39:00,300
grandmother responded to the death of
her husband and the departure of her

538
00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:00,990
daughters.

539
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,900
I'm not going to read this whole thing
because it would simply take too long,

540
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,380
but I just want to show you what
happens over these three pages.

541
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,270
So on the top of 16,

542
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,900
this is another one of
those hypothetical's.

543
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,090
One day my grandmother must have carried
out a basket of sheets to hang in the

544
00:39:18,091 --> 00:39:20,760
spring sunlight wearing her widows black,

545
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:25,020
performing the rituals of the
ordinary as an act of faith.

546
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,120
Say there were two or three inches of
hard old snow on the ground with Earth

547
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:33,870
here and they're losing through the
broken places and that there was warmth in

548
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:38,520
the sunlight when the wind did not
blow it all away and say she stooped

549
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:43,410
breathlessly and her corset to lift up
a sodden sheet by its hems and say that

550
00:39:43,411 --> 00:39:45,900
when she had pinned three
corners to the lines,

551
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,730
it began to below and leap in her hands
to flutter and tremble and to glare with

552
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:51,450
the light.

553
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,320
And that the throes of the thing where
as gleeful and strong as if a spirit

554
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:59,040
we're dancing in,
it's Sarah Mints that when she would say,

555
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,000
because it pushed the skirts of her coat
against her legs and made the strands

556
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,320
of her hair fly,

557
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,780
it came down the lake and it smelled
sweetly of snow and rankly of melting snow

558
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,930
and it called to mind the small scare
stemi flowers that she and Edmund would

559
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:19,500
walk half a day to pick. Did you
catch that little transition there?

560
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,070
Yeah.

561
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:25,710
Transition from propositions
say that this happens.

562
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:30,711
Say this is what my grandmother did
and saw and smelled to a seamless

563
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:34,870
inhabitation through that
free indirect discourse.

564
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,890
Ruth enters the mind of her grandmother.

565
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,210
Yes,

566
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:45,210
and starts to inhabit her memories of her
husband from long before the time when

567
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,240
Ruth was born.

568
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:47,740
Yeah.

569
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,740
We smell the wind with Ruth through the
grandmother and we know that it reminds

570
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:59,840
her of the flowers that she and Edmond
would pick and then you get along

571
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,920
meditation of the most private thoughts
that the grandmother has about her

572
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:09,730
husband and what he's
like in the springtime.

573
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:14,731
And this is at the bottom of 17 and it
concludes with this line at such times.

574
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:20,320
He's just, she's just imagined him as
a, as a primitive man rather than, um,

575
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,140
formal Edmond at such times.

576
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:28,170
He was as forgetful of her as he was
of his suspenders and his methodism,

577
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,140
but all the same. It was then
that she loved him best as a soul,

578
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:35,180
all unaccompanied, like
her own. It's that,

579
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:40,181
so all unaccompanied that most
concerns Robinson as a writer.

580
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,580
And here Ruth imagines of kind of free
access to that other soul that is her

581
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:50,924
grandmother.

582
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,640
And if you look in the middle of 18,

583
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,950
there's one of these amazing tents shifts.
She's going,

584
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:05,951
Ruth is going from meditating on her
early widowhood as a memory to a time,

585
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,480
a little less far back to the
wake of her daughter's departures,

586
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,690
the grandmothers,
a grief at their departure.

587
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,790
And now that's the now referred to in
the middle of 18 and now to comfort

588
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:23,624
herself.

589
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,720
My grandmother would not reflect on
the unkindness of her children or have

590
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:31,370
children in general.
She had noticed many times,

591
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:36,371
always that her girls faces were soft
and serious and inward and still when she

592
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:40,100
looked at them just as they had
been when they were small children,

593
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,480
just as they were now, when they were
sleeping, if a friend was in the room,

594
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:49,510
her daughters would watch his or her face
intently and t's or sued or banter and

595
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:53,510
any one of them could gauge and respond
to the finest changes of expression or

596
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:55,820
tone.
Even Sylvie if she chose to,

597
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,710
but it did not occur to them to suit
their words and manners to her looks and

598
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,810
she did not want them to.
In fact,

599
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:06,110
she was often prompted a restrained
by the thought of saving this

600
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:10,340
unconsciousness of theirs.
She was then a magisterial woman,

601
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,310
not only because of her height
and her large sharp phase,

602
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,110
not only because of her upbringing,

603
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:19,700
but also because it suited her purpose
to be what she seemed to be so that her

604
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:24,500
children would never be startled or
surprised and to take on all the postures,

605
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:29,501
investments of matron to differentiate
her life from theirs so that her children

606
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:32,030
would never feel intruded upon.

607
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,270
She's careful to guard their separateness
and then you get this wonderful

608
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:42,320
meditation, quite mysterious, and I
don't actually have a full account of it.

609
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:47,710
Why the grandmother finding the potatoes
in the garden comes to be a moment of

610
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,930
revelation. Maybe this is
something you can think about.

611
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:56,230
Why is it that specifically that detail
that Robinson chooses to make a moment

612
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:03,470
of epiphany when the grandmother says,
what have I seen? What have I seen?

613
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:06,980
The earth and the sky and the garden,
not as they always are,

614
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,810
and she saw her daughter's faces not
as they always were or as other peoples

615
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:12,590
were,

616
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:17,180
and she was quiet and aloof and watchful
not to start all the strangeness away.

617
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,940
She had never taught
them to be kind to her.

618
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,250
So in that three page passage,

619
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:30,910
Ruth's voice inhabits her grandmother's
mind at widely varied moments in the

620
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:35,850
grandmother's life, important,
extremely intimate moments.

621
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,240
Even this strange moment
of epiphany in the garden.

622
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:43,680
No one's anywhere near around different,
very mysterious kind of epiphany.

623
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,620
Who knows really what it means.
And yet Ruth can tell us about it.

624
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,460
Robinson has described her
writerly project as giving
us access to the kinds of

625
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:01,470
things that people
would say if they could.

626
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:05,460
And I just want to read you
this quotation from Robinson.

627
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:11,540
One of the primary mistakes people make
is to take people spoken language to be

628
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:13,740
equivalent to the level of their thinking.

629
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,980
I think it's one of the oddest errors.

630
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,480
What she takes herself to be doing is to
be providing for Ruth's mind a language

631
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:30,830
that can match the flexibility of
this young person's consciousness,

632
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,180
its range,
its permeability,

633
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:41,810
and also in that very supple
voice to be her identity.

634
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,200
So the voice becomes who Ruth is.

635
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,900
So no matter how far she ranges
across her boundaries of person,

636
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,710
no matter how indistinct the darkness
in her mind is from the darkness outside

637
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:02,274
her body,

638
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,640
that voice can still be heard and
it can still be identified as hers,

639
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,110
even as it ranges in and out
of her grandmother's thoughts,

640
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:16,170
in and out of Sylvie's thoughts,
in and out of Lucile's thoughts,

641
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,030
in and out of her mother's thoughts.

642
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,830
So that in the end is what constitutes
something like identity in this novel.

643
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,510
Now on Wednesday,
in the very short time I will have,

644
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,960
I'll talk about what that voice has
to do with the question of loss,

645
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:40,710
which haunts this novel in every sentence.
As I'm sure you've noticed,

646
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,500
very Ella giant sense to this novel.

647
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,620
So I'm going to reconcile this argument
that I've made today with an analysis of

648
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,430
what that is doing in the novel.
