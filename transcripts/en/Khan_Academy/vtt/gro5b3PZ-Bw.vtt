00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:02.805
- [Instructor] We're
told a company produces

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.042
processing chips for cell phones.

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:07.085
At one of its large factories,

00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:11.195
two percent of the chips produced
are defective in some way.

00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:13.668
A quality check involves
randomly selecting

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:15.501
and testing 500 chips.

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:20.709
What are the mean and standard
deviation of the number

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:24.079
of defective processing
chips in these samples?

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.264
Like always, try to pause this video

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:28.145
and have a go at it on your own,

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.551
and then we will work through it together.

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:33.895
All right, so let me
define a random variable

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:36.524
that we're gonna find the mean
and standard deviation of,

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:37.661
and I'm gonna make that random variable

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:39.623
the number of defective processing chips

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:41.373
in a 500-chip sample.

00:00:42.894 --> 00:00:47.061
Let's let x be equal to the
number of defective chips ...

00:00:53.224 --> 00:00:54.807
in 500-chip sample.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.287
The first thing to recognize is that

00:01:02.287 --> 00:01:05.607
this will be a binomial variable.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.024
This is binomial.

00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:10.178
How do we know it's binomial?

00:01:10.178 --> 00:01:12.345
Well, it's made up of 500,

00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:17.058
it's a finite number of
trials right over here.

00:01:17.058 --> 00:01:19.281
The probability of
getting a defective chip,

00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:21.128
you could do this as a
probability of success.

00:01:21.128 --> 00:01:22.584
It's a little bit counterintuitive

00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:24.616
that a defective chip would be a success,

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:26.830
but we're summing up the defective chips,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.126
so we would view the
probability of a defect,

00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:33.959
or I should say, a defective chip,

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:38.207
it is constant across these 500 trials,

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:41.682
and we will assume that they
are independent of each other,

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:42.515
0.02.

00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:45.807
You might be saying, "Hey,
well, are we replacing the chips

00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:47.411
"before or after?" but we're assuming

00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:50.459
it's from a functionally
infinite population,

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.174
or if you want to make it feel better,

00:01:52.174 --> 00:01:53.872
you could say, maybe you
are replacing the chips.

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:55.954
They're not really telling
us that right over here,

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:57.803
so we'll assume that each of these trials

00:01:57.803 --> 00:01:59.388
are independent of each other,

00:01:59.388 --> 00:02:00.728
and that the probability of getting

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:04.078
a defective chip stays constant here.

00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:06.356
So this is a binomial random variable,

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:08.998
or binomial variable,
and we know the formulas

00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:10.899
for the mean and standard deviation

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.695
of a binomial variable.

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:16.970
The mean, the mean of x,
which is the same thing

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.687
as the expected value of x,

00:02:19.687 --> 00:02:24.288
is going to be equal to
the number of trials, n,

00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:28.668
times the probability of
a success on each trial,

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:31.765
times p, so what is this going to be?

00:02:31.765 --> 00:02:33.706
Well, this is going to be equal to,

00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:37.873
we have 500 trials, and then
the probability of success

00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:41.778
on each of these trials is 0.02,

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:45.681
so it's 500 times 0.02,

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:48.642
and what is this going to be?

00:02:48.642 --> 00:02:51.809
500 times 2 hundredths is going to be,

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.976
it's going to be equal to 10.

00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:59.846
That is your expected value of the number

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.763
of defective processing
chips, or the mean.

00:03:02.763 --> 00:03:05.939
Now, what about the standard deviation?

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.939
The standard deviation
of our random variable x,

00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:12.961
well, that's just going to be equal to

00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:16.245
the square root of the variance

00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:20.155
of our random variable x,
so I could just write it,

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:21.899
I'm just writing it all the different ways

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:23.261
that you might see it because, sometimes,

00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.383
the notation is the most
confusing part in statistics.

00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:29.146
So this is going to be
the square root of what?

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:32.099
Well, the variance of a binomial variable

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.851
is going to be equal
to the number of trials

00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:39.793
times the probability of
success in each trial,

00:03:39.793 --> 00:03:44.597
times one minus the probability
of success in each trial.

00:03:44.597 --> 00:03:49.209
So in this context, this
is going to be equal to,

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.789
you're gonna have the 500,

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:53.122
500, times 0.02,

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:58.842
0.02, times one minus 0.02, is .98,

00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:04.578
so times 0.98.

00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:08.319
All of this is under the radical sign.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.925
I didn't make that
radical sign long enough.

00:04:10.925 --> 00:04:12.452
So what is this going to be?

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:14.434
Well, let's see, 500 times 0.02,

00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.507
we already said that
this is going to be 10.

00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:20.672
10 times 0.98, this is
going to be equal to

00:04:20.672 --> 00:04:22.589
the square root of 9.8,

00:04:25.426 --> 00:04:28.778
so it's going to be, I don't
know. 3-point-something.

00:04:28.778 --> 00:04:30.912
If we want, we can get a calculator out

00:04:30.912 --> 00:04:34.097
to feel a little bit
better about this value.

00:04:34.097 --> 00:04:35.680
I'm gonna take 9.8,

00:04:36.998 --> 00:04:40.795
and then take the square root of it,

00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:45.317
and I get, if I round to
the nearest hundredth, 3.13,

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:49.484
so this is approximately 3.13
for the standard deviation.

00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:55.028
If I wanted the variance, it would be 9.8,

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.420
but they ask for the standard deviation,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.351
so that's why we got that.

00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:01.600
All right, hopefully, you enjoyed that.
