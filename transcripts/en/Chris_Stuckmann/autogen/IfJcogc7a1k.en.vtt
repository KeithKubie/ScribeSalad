00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370
in Iron Man 3 that seemed like they were
 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.890
in Iron Man 3 that seemed like they were
way too convenient they were huge plot

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900
way too convenient they were huge plot
 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.240
way too convenient they were huge plot
points and other films they sort of just

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250
points and other films they sort of just
 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.090
points and other films they sort of just
let happen and one of them was the

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100
let happen and one of them was the
 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.830
let happen and one of them was the
shrapnel inside him in the arc reactor

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840
shrapnel inside him in the arc reactor
 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.810
shrapnel inside him in the arc reactor
keeping it from coming to his heart now

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820
keeping it from coming to his heart now
 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.550
keeping it from coming to his heart now
they showed that they were using some

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560
they showed that they were using some
 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.320
they showed that they were using some
sort of magnetism to pull it out of him

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330
sort of magnetism to pull it out of him
 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.080
sort of magnetism to pull it out of him
but the thing is I just that was such a

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090
but the thing is I just that was such a
 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.760
but the thing is I just that was such a
huge plot point in the other films I

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770
huge plot point in the other films I
 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.310
huge plot point in the other films I
would have liked more time to show what

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320
would have liked more time to show what
 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.780
would have liked more time to show what
exactly that was all about

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790
exactly that was all about
 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.490
exactly that was all about
I mean the procedure a little bit more

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500
I mean the procedure a little bit more
 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.900
I mean the procedure a little bit more
in depth with that all I'm saying is it

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910
in depth with that all I'm saying is it
 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.580
in depth with that all I'm saying is it
was such a big plot point yeah yeah they

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590
was such a big plot point yeah yeah they
 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.590
was such a big plot point yeah yeah they
should have like maybe did more than

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600
should have like maybe did more than
 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.330
should have like maybe did more than
just one little shot where whoa I guess

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340
just one little shot where whoa I guess
 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.830
just one little shot where whoa I guess
he's opening that there was a section in

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840
he's opening that there was a section in
 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.510
he's opening that there was a section in
the middle where like there wasn't too

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520
the middle where like there wasn't too
 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.160
the middle where like there wasn't too

much action it was just kind of Tony
 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.630
much action it was just kind of Tony
doing his thing but the reason I like

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640
doing his thing but the reason I like
 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.410
doing his thing but the reason I like
that is because the whole theme kind of

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420
that is because the whole theme kind of
 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.880
that is because the whole theme kind of
of the movie is that you can take away

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890
of the movie is that you can take away
 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.860
of the movie is that you can take away
the parts you can take away the pieces

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870
the parts you can take away the pieces
 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.570
the parts you can take away the pieces

but he's still iron man and he proved
 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.770
but he's still iron man and he proved
that a lot in this movie because he

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780
that a lot in this movie because he
 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.480
that a lot in this movie because he
really actually isn't in this suit that

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490
really actually isn't in this suit that
 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.790

being and using his ingenuity to get out
 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.260
being and using his ingenuity to get out
of situations and I like that because it

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270
of situations and I like that because it
 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.930
of situations and I like that because it
was yeah I like when a hero who has a

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940
