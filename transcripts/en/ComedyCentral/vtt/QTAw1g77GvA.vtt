The stuffing's my favorite part.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:12.178
Oh, well I mean it's just a pile
of little pieces of bread,

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.414
densely packed together.
What's not to love?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.282
The way you describe shit
is so beautiful.

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.084
Thanks.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.621
Okay, so are you ready to show
and tell bay-bay?

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.190
Oh yeah ...
Small Business Saturday!

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.659
We are like really doing it up
this year.

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:28.795
It is so important to support
local businesses.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.798
So as I was browsing the shops
on Le Canal de Gowanus ...

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.299
the Gowanus Canal-

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:34.500
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.702
I stopped into a local
pottery shop

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:42.475
and got this piece
to support the local artisans.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.077
I guess it's a mug.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.579
You could use it for a variety
of snakes.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:49.049
Yeah, I'd put my penis in this
if I was a boy.

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:51.484
Look, I'm nosing it.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:53.352
Okay, you ready for this?

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:54.553
Yup.

00:00:54.586 --> 00:00:58.624
I didn't go to Lowe's ...
I didn't go to Home Depot ...

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:04.564
I didn't go
to Hardware Town USA.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:09.335
I went to my local Dev's
Hardware Store and I got ...

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.537
this hose,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.739
because one day I'm going to be
one of those fancy people

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:16.642
that has that wide selection
of dope plant life

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:18.845
on my fire escape,
and when I am,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:22.381
I'm going to use this hose
to keep those bad boys alive.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:25.518
Genius ... inspiring ...
and good for the world.

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.786
Thank you.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.122
Okay, this auto shop near me

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:33.126
also makes neon signs
for other shops. Check this out.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.530
Oh my gosh.

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:39.198
One, it creates
the perfect ambiance.

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:40.433
Great font.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.135
Two, it's a refreshing spin
on a sad lamp.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.402
Great vibe.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:44.837
And three, it's
a friendly suggestion.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.372
Great directive.

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:47.607
Thank you.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.641
You did good.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.610
We are really participating
in our community.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:51.811
Oh, totally.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.779
And you know what, all this
small business shopping ...

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.481
we earned Cyber Monday.

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:58.484
Oh, I cannot wait to just
go like this. Boop.

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:01.220
God, I miss Amazon.
Just scrolling,

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:02.788
you know.
It brings my heart rate down.

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.825
How much do you think this hose
is if I bought it on Amazon?

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.927
It's not like
a local-made hose.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.563
That's right, and it's like
I'm buying something local,

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:13.466
and yet it was made somewhere
else. You know what I mean?
