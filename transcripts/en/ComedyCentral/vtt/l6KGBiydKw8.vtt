00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:03.337
She would hit me up on Instagram
to come out after the show.

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:04.963
She was with five girlfriends.

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:07.507
I just show up,
and they all have tattoos,

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:10.427
and they're talking about
the bartender's micro-penis.

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.554
I was like,
"Yeah, that sucks for him,

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.891
like this little dick guy."
You know what I mean.

00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:18.352
Girls, if you wanna know
if a guy has a ...

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.354
what kind of dick a guy has,

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.148
insult a guy with a small dick
in front of him

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.942
and see how angry he gets.

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:26.985
We'll make for sure
we're testing Andrew by that.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.528
It's the same thing
with vaginas.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:32.824
When I dated a guy who referred
to a girl he dated as having ...

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.576
one of her labias were longer
than the other

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.328
so he called Stroke Pussy.

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:37.621
The worst person.

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:39.498
It's to me,
kind of joking about it.

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:41.667
Did you get angry?

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.253
Not at him, I was just like,
"Ha ha ha ha ha.

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:45.921
I'm never showing you mine,"

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:47.506
which I eventually
definitely did.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:48.715
Yeah, she taught him.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.759
At least mine has a stroke
on both sides.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:58.892
So you got mad because they were
making fun of your penis.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.186
I was like, "How dare you say
about us.

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.482
We are good people.
We're good people.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:06.692
We'll go down on you.

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:08.443
We'll finger you.
We'll love you."

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.238
Did they take you to a strip bar
'cause that's all of Portland.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.781
That is all of Portland.
I never went to ...

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.074
No, I didn't go to one.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.201
But, no, they ended up
going into a photo booth

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:18.161
and taking pictures
of their own tits

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.705
and giving it to me,
as like, "Here."

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.082
Like as an appreciation.
I think I probably could have-

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.752
That's like the ... in Hawaii
when you get like a lei.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.129
That's what they do
in Portland.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.464
They go into a photo booth,
they shove their tits up-

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.133
Of their tattooed tits.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.135
Everyone has tattoos there.
It's very earth-toned.

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.678
How do you feel about that?

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:36.888
I like it. I don't know,
sometimes ...

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.348
Or, at least,
I used to look at

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:40.225
when someone would have
a ton of tattoos as dirty.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.435
I'd be like,

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:43.353
"Oh no, they probably
have all the STDs."

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:47.232
That would go through my head.
But now, since I have them all,

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.859
I'm like,
"Yeah, these are pretty cool."

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.777
It was pretty cool.
Maybe I'll get a tattoo now.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.697
I know guys that only wanna
date girls with tattoos.

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:56.575
Yeah, that's 'cause
their mom had tattoos.

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.243
-No.
-Yes.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.120
My mom thing doesn't
really check out there.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.998
No, that was the best
when I go my mom has COPD.

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.708
She has emphysema.

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:06.793
You're like, "You wanna date
someone like your mom."

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.837
I was like,
"Yeah, like a scuba diver."

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:11.548
Some of us sleep apnea

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.883
Someone that also has a tank.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:14.634
I have to explain.
Yeah, your mom has a tank.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.303
People don't know that people
with emphysema have tanks.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:17.554
Oh, really.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:18.764
Yeah, you have to like bridge
that jump.

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:20.098
Yeah, my mom
has really bad emphysema.

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:21.350
Okay. So your joke ...

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.185
I'm helping him
write a joke 'cause he ...

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:26.188
I was like, "Every dates ...
Men always go after their moms."

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:27.898
So his mom has emphysema
so he should say that,

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:29.191
'So, my mom has an oxygen ...."

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.484
You have to say
she has an oxygen tank,

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:31.693
and then go to the scuba.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:33.487
Yes, my mom has an oxygen tank.
She's always on oxygen.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:34.988
She has a tank
with a tube.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.740
Right. So I've been dating
a lot of scuba divers.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.116
I'm like,
"Can you wear it to dinner?"

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.326
That is great. That's great.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.911
The problem is
they're never on land.

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.204
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:43.497
Come on. Come out and look.

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.999
You gotta look at another
fucking reef, really.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.793
All of his dates have
to happen in the ocean

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.461
just so these women
can remind him of his mom.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:50.754
That's great.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.048
I like tattoos on guys
when they don't ...

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:54.758
when they're mistakes.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.635
When they're like, "Yeah,
I got this when I was 18.

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:58.970
It means nothing.
It literally means nothing.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.431
I don't know why I got it.
My buddy ...."

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.267
I like bad stories
with tattoos.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.769
Not intentionally bad
where they're like,

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.270
"It's a joke we got."

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.773
But like, truly it meant
something to them at one time

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.566
and now it's so humiliating.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.319
It's like wearing a TBT
on you constantly,

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.821
a reminder of
when you were lame,

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:17.489
and you weren't cool.
You know what I mean?

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.657
Yeah.

00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:22.953
I like that, but I don't like
fresh tattoos with new meanings.

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.038
Or if somebody ...
Yeah, I told you about the guy

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.833
I went out that had
the broccoli tattoo.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.460
Yeah, that's pretty gross.
Actually, I'll take that back.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.130
Adam Levine last night
at the Superbowl, I dug his-

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.673
I love it. Sleeves.
Does he have sleeves?

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:36.174
I dug everything.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.844
I know everyone
was so not into that,

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.304
but Adam Levine is so hot.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.265
But what about if you
have sleeves and stuff,

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:44.474
and then you're an accountant.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.226
I feel like there's
a lot of people in Brooklyn

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.936
that are like,
"Oh, I'm tattoo arm rugged ...."

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.187
It says something about who are.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.564
Oh, my God.
For sure.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:51.857
Look at Adam Levine.
Wow.

00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:53.567
I mean, California,
across the stomach.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.068
He's got a lot of tattos

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.319
Some guy did a name ...
some like, fat guy

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.280
in the Midwest
just did one and wrote Illinois

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.032
across his and took a ...
It's been going around.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.910
What about Bieber?
Bieber is covered now.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.332
To me, it just says you probably
would have cut in another world.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.209
Like, it's a form of cutting.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.379
I know that a lot of people
get tattoos for the pain of it,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.590
that's why it'd be
appealing to me.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.383
I think I would like
the pain of it.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.594
Some people get off on that.

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:23.180
I think that's why a lot of
people can't stop getting them.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.725
But also,
there's gotta be case studies

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.895
about people that get tattoos
and mentally how different

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:31.730
they are than people
who choose not to.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.523
I don't know.
I got my ...

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.609
What's the closest
to a tattoo thing you've done?

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.235
You have to do
something rebellious.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:40.572
I used to pick really, a lot
of certain parts of my skin,

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.450
or pull hair out,
like a OCD, pain thing.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.785
Okay. You had trichotillomania.

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:46.077
A tiny bit, yeah.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.329
Oh, wow.

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:48.788
For short periods of time
when I was a kid.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:49.998
A lot of people do.

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:53.001
Not trichotillomania so much
as pressing pressure points

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.669
and hurting my skin.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.671
It had to be ...
I've never talked about this.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.382
Here, here,
until it would almost bleed,

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.843
or chewing parts of my mouth,
and then I'd stop.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.428
It was always ...

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:05.013
Sometimes I'll get
into that again.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.264
So many people do that.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:12.938
I mean, the more that I have
female friendships in adult life

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:15.649
and we're getting further away
from the stuff we did as teens,

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:16.942
like more of it's coming out.

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:19.194
Woman are becoming more
comfortable talking about like,

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.947
"Yeah, I picked out
all of my hair when I was 17."

00:05:21.947 --> 00:05:23.740
Or, they're currently doing it.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.493
A lot of people
have these things ...

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.954
I don't think the picking
out your hair is as ...

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.749
People can be more open about
eating disorders than that,

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.418
at this point.
But I hear you.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:36.962
I know a lot of you
are out there.

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:39.464
It's never been my thing,
but it could've been my thing.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:40.674
I don't judge that at all,

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.801
but that is a thing
that girls do a lot.

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.471
I only cut once after
I got caught shoplifting.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:50.767
I was just like so mad at myself
and I wanted to punish myself.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.228
I understood cutting
in that moment.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.896
So that to me, I get it.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.773
But tattoos, yeah.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:06:01.361
I've just never had anything
that I just care enough about.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.572
You know, I think
that's the classic thing,

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:05.699
that reason people give that
they don't get tattoos.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.242
But I got my nose pierced
when I was 18.

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:08.535
Oh, really.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:09.911
Yeah.
Septum. No, side.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.121
Side because I knew-

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.330
How long did you keep it in?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.623
I researched it and I knew
that ...

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.750
I have enough acne scars
there that it would just ...

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.960
the worst,
it would look like an ...

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.545
It would just blend in,
so who cares.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.172
It's not gonna be a ...
I knew that there was an out.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:24.384
I really liked the Ankh symbol,
the Egyptian Ankh symbol,

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:28.096
which kind of looks like a
female symbol when I was 14-18.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.306
Thank God
I didn't get it tattooed

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:31.224
because I wanted
a big one on my ankle,

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.642
but I also sort of thought ...

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.394
I was judgemental about tattoos
so I never did it.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.604
Yeah, I think its-

00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:36.938
And I'm glad.
I got this pierced ...

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.148
like the top of my ear.

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.482
I thought that was
really rebellious.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.276
That is so-
Does that hurt?

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.194
And then it got infected.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:47.115
I thought how I felt horribly
that it was connected to my ear.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.742
And then my dad was like,
"Yeah, you're right."

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.243
I think he was just saying
that because he didn't-

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.828
What do you mean it's connected?
What are you talking about?

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.079
It's connected to your ear.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.331
Like, so it got
a little infected

00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:56.875
and then I didn't feel healthy.
So then I connected-

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.044
Andrew T. sleeps in logic
in his stories

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:00.754
'cause he's gone there,
but you ...

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.297
He doesn't walk you
to where he's going.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.757
Do you mean that you got
the flu or something,

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.008
and or an ear infection?

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:06.259
Yeah, I just was feeling off.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.094
Oh, like an ear canal infection.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.764
I don't now. It was infected
on the top of my ear.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.474
And then I started to feel sick.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:13.767
He's a hypochondriac.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:14.976
Oh, you're body.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.603
But then I connected it
to the ear,

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.521
but it was probably
just I had the sniffles.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.231
You know what I mean?
You're right.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.651
But then when I told my dad,
who's a doctor, he was like,

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:24.194
"Yeah, you're probably right."

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.113
I think he didn't want
the freaking ear ring.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.823
He didn't want his son
to have an earring

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.033
on the top of his ear.

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:31.284
Yeah.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.911
There's a joke there too,
somewhere.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.245
What?
Nikki can help you develop it.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.413
No, no, no.
I think.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:36.665
He's got it.

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:37.874
I like it.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.584
Am I here. I think I'm here.
