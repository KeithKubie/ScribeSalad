&gt;&gt; Hello, YouTubers.
This is Sergey, I'm here at Davos and have

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.080
lots of exciting
conversations here.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.610
I just got this question I saw about voting
and what could we do to

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.070
improve it.
I think a really important part of voting

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.140
is to have a public that's
engaged and educated and really interested

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.330
in all the key issues as
well as the candidate positions.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.470
And that's why I think that YouTube is a great
platform for that.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.140
We started with the debates, having questions
come in directly from all

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.350
of you, but I think there's lots more opportunity
for engagement to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.570
form greater communities around important
issues, so you're not just

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.850
getting little sound bytes but you can actually
delve deeper into these

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.399
issues and discuss them at a very deep level
with both experts around

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.190
the field and just many ordinary, interested
citizens.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.239
So I'm a big fan of education and engagement
when it comes to voting.
