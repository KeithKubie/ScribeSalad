Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible] joining me today is an Iranian born Shia Muslim scholar and the president of the Islamic Association of South Australia. You mom Mohammed to Ed. Welcome to the Rubin report. Hello. Thank you for having me. Which one of us is going to be in more trouble for doing this? Well, I'm already in enough trouble, so hopefully we can share that part. All right, so two interesting things that happened even before we start this conversation. First you said to me in the green room, nothing is off limits. You said asked me the hardest questions you can possibly do because, uh, I appreciate that as an interviewer and that's, it's a refreshing thing to hear. Um, I just thought it was interesting that you even said that to me because it's like, you know, a lot of times people just want to come in and say what they want, but, but you, you want to be challenged.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       You want to go to those places. I'm trying to, I've had so many interviews over 400 interviews in the last two years, whether they be on radio or television or youtube. And I just feel that many people, uh, give us special treatment just because I'm Muslim and even though they know that I do have some conservative views such as, uh, a border on border protection, national security, but even then they still want to give me that special treatment. So I made that request publicly as well. Yeah. Okay. Please don't be nice. There's a lot of information I could share. All right, well I'm probably going to be nice to you, but I will try to get to some of the hard stuff. Don't worry. It's right here. That's number one. And then number two, right before we started, you requested that normally right behind you there we have a, a little bing of wine bottles that are right behind you.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       And you asked that we removed it just out of your direct shot behind you because you just don't want to get any, any bonus hate, let's say, which I think is, I sympathize with that position. But it's also sort of interesting because you take all of these very controversial positions and it's like, oh, well they got him with some wine bottles. It's like, yes, well these, uh, issues of the extremist agenda, extremist can obtain an image of me beside the wine bottle or a bottle for example. Then they can easily discredit me as a Muslim e mom because Muslims don't drink and I don't drink either. But they can easily stick that accusation when they have a picture of me being close to a wine bottle and they want that and I'm not going to allow them to do that. How thrilled are they going to be that you're in the home studio?

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       Have a gauge you, this cannot be a, a, that's got to be worse than wine bottles. What's the list? Well, I would say 2% upset and they won't be happy. They won't be happy at the fact that, uh, you have a large audience as well. So they try to silence me and you've got people that tried to silence you as well. So, but I'm happy to be here getting on not to do or not. I'm happy to be here. Yeah. And I'm happy you're here and all right. So let's, let's let it fly. So first just tell me a little bit about your history. You, you grew up in Iran until you were about 12 years old, right? Correct. Yeah, I was, uh, in Iran, uh, for the first 12 years of my life and we traveled to Australia. We'll ended in 1995. My father is a prominent Muslim faith leader as well.

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       And your mom and he traveled from Melbourne, which we, we first landed to Western Australia and established the first Shia Muslim mosque. And it was originally a church. He called the, it was called Saint Mary Church, so he left her name Saint Mary Mosque. Wow. Yeah. Out of respect for the Greater Christian majority. Huh. And, uh, you see my father, I learned tolerance from him. He didn't have that belief in him that, or it's a church, it's filthy. We can't turn it into a mosque. It was for sale. The people will come to the mosque. Well, none of these terrorist attacks had happened. People were fine with mosques. And so the first mosque was erected in, uh, uh, in, uh, Perth, Western Australia. And, uh, basically I grew up there until 2007 I was raised her amongst scholars and Islamic teachings and a very conservative Muslim family. I come from what is a conservative Muslim family mean?

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       A conservative Muslim family, uh, goes the extra mile to be extra religious. So we wouldn't even go to banks or shopping centers that played music, let alone listening to music ourselves, whereby other Muslims would not listen to music because it's banned in mainstream Islamic jurisprudence. Uh, there would still go to shopping centers and you know, at 10 music lessons in class, in school, but we were very, very conservative. I couldn't wear anything shiny or anything like that, such as watches or Nicholas or anything like that. What was that like for you or just as a young person that, you know, I'm sure you knew that music was out there. I'm sure you knew movies were out there in video games and the rest of it, I'd never been to a cinema until I was 20 years old. Well, I've never actually completed a movie. Now I'm not here to, uh, uh, play the oppressed person in or was harsh.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       And I know you are not me, but I'm going to be, I try to be as honest as I can. I didn't know what that life was like. So the life I was living was very normal. It was, this is how life is to me. I didn't know there was another life. And in fact, when I first moved to a, uh, a public Australian school, uh, I, uh, was shocked that we actually had people that were not Muslim because the school I grew up in was a, I was raised in initially, uh, completed my initial studies in Western Australia. There were, it was a private Muslim school, also a conservative atmosphere. So the house was a conservative atmosphere. School was a conservative atmosphere up until 2007 I had gone back to Iran. And then you've got sharia law everywhere. Wow. So I've never actually had time to be open to the rest of the world and just accepted everyone.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       And that happened after, you know, my family was oppressed by Isis in 2014 when I was still there studying. And it just hit me that this can't be the way we were supposed to live. Do you remember the moment that it hit you? Was it, was it finally going because another school? No, I was an Islamist a fundamentalist and an extremist as well. Okay. So I'm going to later in the interview, let's define some of those terms because I think people get lost a little bit in the difference between Islamist jihadist, fundamentalist, etc. Okay. So put it this way, I wouldn't have sat with you. Yeah. Uh, before 2014 I wouldn't have, I wouldn't even shake your hand because that was the mentality that I had complete rejection of the west and I was walking in, in the holy city of Karbala. It's a Shia Muslim stronghold.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       And the speakers of the sacred shrine of [inaudible] are saying, and now that Mosul, which is Mosul, the Iraqi city close to Baghdad, had fallen under the authority of Isis. And that's what an hour away from where I was. So that's when it really hit me. And then as I tried to leave the country, uh, I found a lot of struggle because airports went out blocked. These guys were shooting down airplanes and the Australian passport that I had saved me, I was given priority and I returned back to Australia. But before all of this happened, my uncle was kidnapped, burnt, alive, who served in the Iraq army. And we had to go receive his body from Baghdad. So this whole scenario woke me up. And when I came to Australia, I saw that hand got Muslims killing Muslims. I've been interrogated in Iran for several times for my views and opinions.

Speaker 1:          00:08:02       And the Muslims in Australia are playing the victim card, recurring Islamophobia. So then I started to form diplomatic relations and public relations to combat extremists. So what was it like right when you got onto the scene? Right when you started being more public about this? Cause I'll be very honest with you, when I first saw you on Twitter and you were tweeting about some of these things, I thought I can't immediately, everybody was like, Reuben, you've got to have the amount to eating on. Everybody was saying it and I was like, this guy just came out of nowhere. I can't just magically sit down with him. I am not perfectly versed in all of these things obviously, and I don't want to be used as upon basically. So what was it like as you started talking about these things from the inside community and the outside community?

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       Okay. The inside community knew who I was because of my lineage, because descend from the, the companions of the Prophet Mohammed, one of the early converts from Christianity to Islam and you know, shared their wealth and the military and the tribes and everything. A military power with the Prophet Muhammad. And they went through it with the Route Arabia in all the wars. And I've written in my book that they're terrorists. So my prominent lineage, uh, my father, my grandfather, and also the fact that I was close to the ground, I told us, and I was ordained publicly as like your mom. So the inside world of Islam knew who I was and I still had Facebook, I still had Twitter, you know, very humble following of basic following. And, but I was still known not that being Twitter star you are now. Well, life changes. Yeah. So what happened was the, there was no Naomi and there are many forums now dating back to 2008 that discuss what I'm doing.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       So they knew who I was. But as you, as you started speaking up against, didn't have plans to speak out. I didn't have plans. I'm going to be honest with you. Many people think that I have an agenda. I didn't have any plans. I was discovered by, look how I'm putting it as though, but American idol, Australian idol, let's go. Uh, I got a call from channel seven in Australia, one of the Best Australian that channels top channels. And they had a program called tonight, tonight. And apparently they googled Mrm Adelaide Muslim, just to get a comment. Yeah. So they came in wanting a three minute comment on a certain issue and I gave them a 30 minute talk about the Muslim community and everything. And so they take that and then the director gets in touch with me and they're let you know, we can do a lot with what you're saying and you have this, we didn't know.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       So then I became known in the area nationally and then internationally I had a few heated exchanges on Australian television. Sunrise. Yeah. Were those usually with a suspect? They were proudly with white people on the left. Is that fair to say? Or maybe maybe with people more extreme on there? Right. Well we did have several interviews where the host was a leftist and the other guest was an extremist Muslim and they would gang up on me, give him more time and not giving me the right of reply or for let's say, you know you're doing something right or articles about me without even asking my opinion or just pops up article one, article two, article three. And so were you shocked once you started talking about these issues and the problems that you see within Islam and the and the solutions that you see? Were you shocked, were you were getting comfort from and where are you?

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       We're getting hatred from? I always absolutely confused. Confused is the right word to put it because on one hand I've got politicians, me telling me that you are an asset, you speak English, you're young, you're presenting yourself well, you know how to talk. You're against the extremist. You love Australia clean record, we need you but not publicly. So that really hurt because what do you mean not publicly? You want to work with me behind the scene, but you still want to visit the extremists for votes. Why wouldn't they want, oh, so that's purely votes because, so that really does tell you about some demographics that does does. So they'll, they'll sit with me privately and these meetings aren't official meetings. It's not enough. I would actually have my, my turban on the side and we're just, I'll open some buttons and we just, it was a very relaxed gathering with this politics.

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       Should the record, you walked in here a turban lists her man and without the robes. So just FYI. And it was a very uh, friendly gathering with the gifts. We would exchange gifts but as soon as the issue turned public it's like they're not normally. So that almost gets to the heart of exactly why the discussion around Islam is so difficult because every time someone tries to come in and talk some sense about the difference between an ideology and people and all of the sort of moderate things that I see you talking about all the time. You guys are the ones that get thrown under the bus. There's so many examples of this. I've almost every minority that tries to fight from within, they're the ones that get thrown under the bus and then all that does is strengthen the extremist. I think what helped me a lot was the fact that I had a political adviser and then who worked in the, in the Australian parliament for 40 years, retired now.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       Uh, Australian. So born in Australia, non Muslim, yeah. And can I ask you his name? Just know. Okay. I'm really sorry because I feared for his safety. Okay. And basically this man was giving me advice as to how to handle the media because look, Dave, you asked me a question about how I felt. Let me just give you one scenario so you know exactly what was going through my mind. I'm criticizing extremists on Twitter. I get a phone call from the uh, ABC in Australia. This is the, the main Australian Broadcasting Corporation. And they asked me what is my opinion about claims that I am aligning myself with the right? And I said, what is the right? I did not know. So I came from a completely a conservative Muslim background. Now I'm trying to serve humanity. This is my only agenda to so going against the extremist and someone's telling me that there's lifting is right now I have to sit back and try to understand what's happening.

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       All right? So which politician that I met with was on the right, which one was on the left. We're trying to put everything together and get some perspective. And that was one of the things that really confused. So it was really good to have a political adviser two and a half years ago because he told me exactly what was going on. Yeah. So what about the reaction from within the community though? I would imagine once you start talking about these things, often the reaction from within the community is going to be even worse because now you're a trader and a sellout and the rest of it, the community reaction was very fast and evaporate quickly because if the mom's state silence, if the lead is carried on, then it would be a different scenario. So what do you make of that? I make that the lead is a agree with me because they still come to my house and we have dinners and no problem. But they don't want any photos. But I do have photos, but I share that with the people in government to know what the progress is with what I'm doing. I'm not a one man band who's walking around with nobody. No Muslim leaders come to my house and we have amazing dinners and we talk about Muslim issues, but the community will reject them if they know that they have relations with me

Speaker 2:          00:15:57       in a way that does that type of person. Although I can sympathize with their position, right. They don't want it. They don't want their congregation to turn on them or something like that. But that type of person that gives you the quiet support but won't do it publicly, isn't an in a way the most frustrating type of support. I find that I've also many people that will come up to me, public people, people were famous with plenty more money and all sorts of things that come up to me and say, David, you know, I really love your show. And I have, I'm sorry, I can't tweet about it. I just don't want to get in hot water

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       or, or, and I think this is a theme amongst a lot of the people that, that were sort of connected to. Um, it's frustrating, but I also appreciate it because at least I know who's on my side and who will not attack me with a fatwa without me knowing. So it's good. I don't appreciate the sign at once. Is there a co fat, why could we get a fat while on both of us? Right? There would be amazing. It's like an episode of curb your enthusiasm, but it would be amazing. But it would certainly paved the way for, for other people to get fed to us. So I don't know how we would feel about that. Right, right. We can deal with it. We can, we can. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:17:02       okay. So let's just do a little bit of sort of Islam one o one and sort of how to talk about these issues. So when I first sort of became interested in all of this, most of my audience knows my sort of political evolution, but it was the night and I, I suspect you've probably seen this, that Sam Harris, the neuroscientists was on real time with Bill Maher and they were talking about the difference between Islam, a set of ideas and Muslims as people. And that you shouldn't be prejudice, but you should be allowed to criticize ideas. And the line that sort of caught the internet on fire was Ben Aflac Calling Bill Maher in Sam Harris, gross and racist. He said, that's gross and racist. And for me, and I was, that was a progressive at the time and the whole thing. Um, I thought, Whoa, this just captures everything that I've seen wrong with my, the inability to deal with a complex issue honestly. And that the immediate charge is you must be racist, you must be a bigot. And the rest of it. So first off, can you just talk a little bit about that? Just how you can talk about a doctrine, any doctrine, but in this case, you know, through an Islamic Lens and then how, how you can do that, but then not be racist or prejudice towards people.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       Okay. That's a very dangerous area to fall into because I'm not a political commentator. I am trying to change the mentality of a community, at least on a local level. Socially, I might not be able to change Mecca and changed the whole religion, but at least where we live, we want to have a peaceful community. So I'm trying to present a better example for the moderates or the vulnerable ones, then the extremist Islam in their own mosque. So it is a very dangerous field because the moment you lose their trust, you lose a Muslim Muslim man's trust or any Muslim individuals trust. If you then recite the Quran, they'll say you're lying because they lost her trust. It's finished, they're not trust you anymore. And I find that very difficult to get that point across. However, what I do is I use a lot of quotations and so it's not my words. I quote certain issues and I refer to certain social events and I comment on them. So I try my best not to make any statements from myself because the, the level of mentality within the Muslim world is that, okay, as long as it has a divine coating, then we'll accept it. If it's from he be himself, then it's manmade. So if it's divine, they also can't reject it. So I tried to use a lot of quotations.

Speaker 2:          00:19:50       Okay. So can you give me an example of say a quotation and then how you would approach it?

Speaker 1:          00:19:54       Definitely. For example, when I speak against stoning, I can refer to the more secret book outside the crime, the Makati and show that this stoning began when two monkeys were throwing rocks at each other in Behati throwing rocks at each other. And the companion of Mohammed saw them and said, okay, so that, that must be, must be a female. I must've cheated on that mail. So he's stolen, incur. So we must apply that. And this is the more sacred book after the Quran. And the Quran itself does not have a verse on stolen it because a goat eight of that verse. So what I do is I bring to the sacred scriptures that speak them at stoning how it began with monkeys. And it began and the verse that was supposedly there was eaten by a goat. And I quickly say, well, this is a monkey teaching. It sounds finally as hell. I'm having a go at them. But the evidence is there.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       Yeah. Um, okay. So we can, we can talk about these issues. A certain amount of people all over the map are gonna not be happy with either one of us. What do you have, do you have proof of some of the inroads that you've been able to make in terms of d radicalizing people?

Speaker 1:          00:21:11       The extremists are so frustrated with me. They're trying to ban the, I've got diplomats and the Pakistan government that tried to shut me down.

Speaker 2:          00:21:19       Uh, are you banned on Facebook as we tape this right now? You were band a couple of days ago. Can you just explain to people what you posted because I retweeted it. It's incredible. I didn't, I wasn't sure if the band, the band was still awful while I was cause they hopefully it's still out by the time we post this in a couple of days, but hopefully not

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       the, uh, amazing Song Jihad Bells, Jihad bells. Do you handle the way I got that song and I posted it on Facebook and I said I share this song every Christmas because the extremists don't like it. Therefore please share it. And it's, it's a, it's a funny song at ridicules them for what they're doing. And Facebook shut me down for 30 days and said that was hate speech and that was it. So I find it very ridiculous. This is the mind time Facebook has blocked me or bang, you're a published my page completely in 2018 so it's, you know, the Twitter has never suspended me. Not once.

Speaker 2:          00:22:17       Yeah, nothing. What do you make of what's going on with our ability to talk about these issues online? So you haven't been suspended by Twitter, but this has happened a bunch of times on Facebook. Yes. Do you know my friend Faisal Al Mutar chance. So Faisal, who is one of my best friends on earth, I love the guy, I adore him. He has been banned several times for tweeting out, similar or for posting on Facebook. Several things like that. It's like, did they realize, do you think they realize they're actually emboldening the extremists the more they try to take people like you out?

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       Well, they definitely do because the extremist only operate as much as they do because they know that they can operate with no criticism or if there is criticism, it's only one or two accounts that are speaking against them. So by shutting me down, I mean, that's a big win for the Jihad. This because let's not forget jihadist use Facebook friend recommendations to build cyber societies, the cyber caliphate. And it's a real study that Facebook's been falling into. This trap where it's, it's website recommends Jihad this to each other based on the pages. They're like, yeah. So now they have this community and Twitter is the same. Twitter recommend friends to each other. So these guys have that advantage with the help of Facebook and Twitter, but we don't, when someone likes my page, the next person that comes on is a right

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       wing figure. So the people say, okay, we're not going to like this page. I'm going to unfollow this guy too. Yeah, it's incredible. You're fighting an ideological war at some level and a, and an algorithmic war. Yes. I had another level. So let's just do some of the definitional stuff. Um, so first off you, you've mentioned moderate Muslims sometimes. So what would you say are the categories, so to speak of of Muslim

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       people? Okay, well there's a Muslim who believes in God, believes in the prophet, Mohammed's believes in the Quran and just an average person who, and this is me speaking in the West, uh, believes that they should pray five times a day fast in Ramadan, seller based the Muslim celebrations. That's about it. That's the definition of a Muslim. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       But can you be less than that and still be Muslim so to speak. So you, so you couldn't be just sort of nominally secular Muslim, where do you don't pray five times a day or are Muslim by name? So you would say that. Would you say that to ex Muslim? So there is a girl I wanted to ask you about the ex Muslim community also, but so you would say that's just, you would say that's actually not Muslim, that's just sort of,

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       look I'm Muslim. The term Muslim, it's taken from Islam, which means submission. So when it's a verb and Muslim is a man who submitting, so you're everyday you're praying so you are upholding that name of being a Muslim. If you don't pray then you just Muslim by name, you're not an actual Muslim, you're not an ex Muslim because you haven't been announced the religion, you just missing prayers or drinking alcohol. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:25:21       So do you have any idea the number is a bad amount? I would imagine in the West that that's probably a very large percentage of Muslims.

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       The majority of Muslims believe in God and uh, and uh, and pray. And there are also Muslims that believe in God. I love believe in Mohammed but don't pray. Right. So I wouldn't say that's an issue for us. They can pray or not pray whenever they, like for me it's the more extremist ones and then trying to differentiate between the moderate and the extreme.

Speaker 2:          00:25:49       Right. Okay. So we've got sort of just the ones by name only. I gather the ones who let's say aren't practicing but, but still are, they were born Muslim. There was, and then the ones who are not practicing on the ones the WISC refers to as moderates. Right. So that's where I was trying to get with this to understand what your definition of moderate is. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       It's the ones who don't practice. And by not practicing, I mean the other laws of Islam. So for example, the uh, the stoning of the killing, the reporting on people who break the blasphemy law issues like the people who just don't care. I just want to go to work nine to five, come back and raise a family, you know, live life, go on holidays. Yeah. Parents were Muslim. We born Muslim, but that's about it. These guys are the ones who are referred to as moderates, but they're not really moderates. The moderate is the, the ex, the, the, the, the Muslim that is conservative but wishes to ban certain, uh, teaching, setting verdicts. They are the moderates.

Speaker 2:          00:26:49       So the moderate is the one who sort of staying within the religion and fighting the extreme parts of the religion

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       personally on a family level, not raising their children in extremist mosques. Those on the mothers.

Speaker 2:          00:27:02       Okay. And then you obviously include yourself in that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:06       Well, uh, well I can see why this would be a tough question for them. I don't believe in something called the mother Islam now just for the viewers don't get confused. Yeah, I'm answering your question based on what society and what Islam Sates. My personal opinion could be another thing. So you might want to ask me what my opinion is on this issue. I don't believe there's a mother of, let's pretend I asked you your opinion. There is no mother Islam. Islam is Islam and uh, you're either a reformist I reformer or reformed person or you're still on Muslim. The Muslims were doing to chop the handle of the fee if and don't stolen and don't, uh, you know, applying the violence of Sharia law there, they've diverted away from the core beliefs of Islam.

Speaker 2:          00:27:56       So in a weird way, you're an e mom who also, you obviously have a great, affinity is not the right word. You have a great respect, I suppose for the, for the ex Muslims in a way,

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       the extra Muslims have every right to be where they are. Yeah. Because now is the west top to be a Muslim and when I'm Muslim has a problem or is facing a problem, whether it be inheritance, financial issues, abuse at home, divorced after being married off. You know, at a very young age they don't find the person who listens to them. The majority of moms in mosques have zero qualifications when it comes to counseling. When it comes to solving real life problems, they only know how to talk when it's against Israel, against the Jews and to play the victim card and basically spread news about what they're doing in society. So the ex Muslims, the majority of them leave the religion because number one, they really feel it's not for them anymore. And the people who paved the way for them. Uh, right. I do know that some people read Richard Dawkins or read certain books and then changed their religion or leave religion completely. But Isis makes more ex Muslims than any intellectual in the West. So to, if we want to blame x Muslim for me ex Muslim, it's the Muslim, the fundamentalist Muslims that made them ex Muslim. They are the ones who are making them leave the religion

Speaker 2:          00:29:33       and that's completely contrary to what the media would portray about this. They would say it's, it's that if you talk about any of this, you're driving people to become extremists, which as many people call it, this is the soft bigotry of low expectations. If I was to say anything that might offend you, you would automatically become an extremist, which is such a horrific way of viewing a, another human being. You know, is there something that I could say to you that somehow you might end up blowing me up? Nothing. If you were to kill me and I'll come back to low, I'd still have, I still shake your head or you got another to worry about brother. Um, okay. So let, let's just do a little bit more of, of the deaf. Okay. So wait, so we have sort of the ex Muslims and the nominal Muslim then, then the moderate that you say is not really a thing actually. Then can you sort of explain, uh, Islamists and jihadists. Okay. And if there's anything else that I missed within that

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       Islamist is an individual that believes in preaching and spreading and expanding Islam and the message of Islam through militant means. So there would spread Islam by the sword and now the tactics are a bit different. Now it's getting through congress. So before it was by the sword, now it's getting themselves into parliament and then making laws that act as the sword, the Islamophobia law in Canada and one or three. Yeah. So an Islamist would silence you just to spread his agenda. That's different from a Muslim, I'm Muslim would say, okay, this is the Koran I believe is the right God. I believe Islam is true except that you don't accept it. You're not going to be saved. Goodnight. Goodnight. That's basically a Muslim and Islam most will actually go the extra mile of kidnapping someone because they drank alcohol a whipping them because they believe that is the right thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       We've seen across Europe, statues are being destroyed because it's not allowed in Islam. So that's an Islamist and Islamist organization would be Hamas. Hamas is an Islamist organization that did terrorist. Uh, doings, it's responsible for terrorist activities. So then it became a terrorist organization. But its ideology is an Islamist ideology. So two state solution is not an option. They need to be eliminated because our message is the right one. That's an Islamist mentality. Now the other person or the other group of people would be the fundamentalists, a fundamentalist Muslim once to preserve the message of Prophet Mohammed and live like Mohammed the same way he lived. So if the report, say Mohammad had a short pants because his pants would stop to his ankle, they'd go to the university, Harvard University and with their ankles sticking out. So if there was no deodorant in Macau, we're not going to use the order.

Speaker 1:          00:32:25       And if they, if Mohammad never trimmed his beard with a blade, then we're not going to use a blade on ours. That's a fundamentalist. And these guys will always take the side of the Islamist rather than the moderate. And also moderate it just a politically created term. It's a political term to differentiate. But at the end of the day, I don't believe there's one that you in the Muslim iron arts and then there are liberals in faith as to how deep you on how, how much into the religion you are. So where does the jihadist fit into that? Because I thought that was a little bit of your definition of a Islamist because of the, because of the use of violence, the Islamist isn't always a jihadist. Islam is, can be someone who believes in the ideology of spreading Islam by violence, who believes that's the right way, that's how religion should develop.

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       But they don't actually go and fight. You know who these people are? The majority of the moms, so they're sitting in their mosques recruiting, sending people to Isis, but they're not jihadists that in Momma's responsible for the jihadist growing and fun joining Isis. So here's the Islamist and he would send the, the Islamist congregation to them become jihadists. So this is when, when people talk about the radicalization that's happening in mosques in the West, you believe that to be a real thing. Of course it is a real thing and it's something we battle every single day.

Speaker 1:          00:33:59       What? So what if I was to go into one of these marks, what would I be hearing? Well, firstly, because of your beard, you'd be welcome to lengthen this a little bit. Okay. So you'd be welcome. Okay. And a fundamentalist mosque would there would definitely frown upon you if you had shaved opiate completely. So be it. You'd be welcome to have you don't have a beard. You actually can't even go in. No, I don't care. They'll just tell you why. What's wrong? Are you a woman? Are you a Jew? Why? Because the reports saying that the Jews that came to fight Mohammed had no beard design. It was a sign of going to war and in Arabia, the sign of going toward would be to shave your head. The Jews in Arabia would shave their beards. So then you can tell who is who in the backdrop.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       So Jesus, yes, slums kept their beards. Okay, so it's not a credit. I mean, there are many reformers were don't have beer. It's not a big deal. I grow this out. It's a week from now. I say to you, let's get mom, get me to one of these masks. I want to know what's going on. I walk in with you, let's say on a Friday prayer. Yeah, we're just tell me what, what, what is actually being spoke of that is the place from where it goes from in Islam as an ideology to a fundamentalist ideology? Well, what are people hearing? Well firstly it depends on the speaker. It depends on the MRI. There are Islamist in moms who say in close circles what they will not say on the pulpits because of the laws in the West. And then there are in moms who would go on there and things nobody could have imagined would ever be set and the history of Islam on the pulpit, they will just say it. So there

Speaker 2:          00:35:44       between the West and some of them, they're doing this in though. I mean we see this out of Canada a lot, just these incredibly, I'm awful things that people that they're saying

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       memory has a wonderful archive of all of these issues. Youtube is another great source. And the issue is they, the Mascaro records that your mom and applauds it on. You've chipped. So it's nothing being discovered. They, they know that the world is going to react this way and they still continue to produce this content and now they're speaking in English, which makes my job a lot easier because I have to translate sometimes but now they were just saying it in English. Yes we want to be heard and we want to conquer. And

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       so when they're, when I see these videos and memory does a great job of the translations when I see these videos, but let's say the new ones that aren't translated from Canada for example, they want that message to get out of the mosque. Like you would think that's contrary to what they would want. You'd think it's like you'd want to keep it sort of radicalized within so you can put a good face on things. But you're saying when they're talking about this and now with the Jews and the gays and this and that and the other thing you think they actually want that to get out there? Cause they're the ones putting it out.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       Yes. And also there's a concept of the one Muslim nation and it's called the Muslim Ummah Islam, the Islamic nation. Now what it is is basically a Muslim is a citizen of two or more nations. One of the nation, they live in America, Australia, the UK, and the second one is the nation of Islam. Not Farrakhan, but the actual Islamic nation. So if the mufti in Mecca issues affect Wa and Islam are sitting in La would come in a terrorist attack. You see that connection? Yeah. So when they were Salman Rushdie's at Starbucks, yes you're on issues or fatwah they'll get him here. There's a link and no other religion has this power unless it's an organized a organization that targets people in sense Hitman, but no other religion has this power. And in mom in Mecca would would say that the Jews are the enemy or that the Christians are the enemy.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       Knowing 100% that they will be a Muslim who would go and comment a terrorist attack. He doesn't even have to look for him and doesn't need to do anything. He just knows the Muslim who will get this and we'll do the job. Not other religion has this. And we see it several times where the, in Russia they killed the a uh, I think it was a, sorry, in Turkey, I think it was a Russian ambassador was shot dead. Oh yeah, yeah, there's video of it. Yeah. Just right in the fight in the museum. There's nothing that was supposed to protect him. And he said for Syria, and we see us every single month and act doesn't go by without in the west, committing a terrorist attack and saying, this is for Syria, this is for Iraq. What's that link? And this confuses our intelligence departments. They've never seen anything like it. So when we're speaking about the moms uploading videos online, they're actually contributing to that platform of the Islamic nation. Whoever's out there. This is our message.

Speaker 2:          00:38:57       So I know you a free speech guy because I see you tweeting about it all the time and then you're exercising. You are free speech here. It's a beautiful thing. What should be done now? I don't mean just from, you know, the inside conversation, say you meeting with a a more fundamentalist, the mom and trying to, you know, uh, get him back, let's say towards the center or something. But what should be done by these states? What should Canada, what should the United States, what should Australia be doing because they're using the, the freedoms of the West against themselves. I mean, this is as difficult to free speech topic as there is for the, for the true free speech people. Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:39:32       They're fighting for democratic rights to be applied for the extremist, for the Islamist when their Islam is, doesn't believe in democracy. They will use democracy to destroy democracy and then establish their on a belief system. Now what can we do? I think, and I say this all the time when, when I'm having dinner with a politician or a premiere or you know, and I say, your political party is finished. You guys are infiltrated. And if you email me, I'll send you reports about one or two of your candidates and what their backgrounds are like. And they remained spit just, and I'm not speaking in Liberal, I'm speaking Conservative Party. I'm speaking parties who, you know, we have hope in. Okay. These guys will seriously serve, uh, the cause of national security will tighten the situation at the borders more than let these jihad this come in, uh, refugees who ended up being behind this, that we've had them in Australia. So these guys are being infiltrated. So number one, what we can.

Speaker 2:          00:40:34       So what does that mean? They're being infiltrated? Meaning meaning that there are actual operatives within the political parties. I mean, I just had Brigitte Gabriel on who talks a lot about the Muslim Brotherhood's long plan that this is an actual plan.

Speaker 1:          00:40:47       Yes. It's, it's one of the main plans to infiltrate political parties and then make their way into positions where they can change or make the law. And we've seen this numerous times. I mean, my book, I speak about a lady deep, I mean, uh, she became, well she's deceased now, she passed away, but she wa she actually said that about her long term goal is to make all of American Muslim and she was getting grants from the American government. She was overseeing educational curriculums

Speaker 2:          00:41:21       and, and you see this, I mean even in the United States, and I'm not totally sure this is her name, Alon Omar, is that her name? The representative in Minnesota who just got elected and you know, should they found old tweets of hers where she's saying, you know, uh, the Jews or Israel has pulled the wool over something and all ask to take care of this. And then the entire time that she was being elected, she kept saying, she's against boycotting Israel. The day she gets elected and now she's for it. So, so this is not just pie in the sky stuff that you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:41:51       Everything you see in the Muslim world when it comes to politics is all studied, is strategic. It's all planned, well funded, well organized, and they know exactly what to do. And when to do it. All the media that's going on now against the, uh, the organizations such as care, they do no harm to care whatsoever. Care has a clear vision and they are reaching their goals because there are loopholes and there are cracks within the system and they're equivalent in Canada. They're equivalent in Australia. And these, you know, these loopholes within the government keep getting bigger and bigger as these guys get elected. And I don't want to scare your viewers, but all I have to say is these people are very smart people. They're not what the media says that when they actually attack and then there are mentally ill or these people are, are minorities, they're very strategic and they're very, very smart, which is why intelligence services around the world need hundreds of millions of dollars just to keep up with what these guys are doing, that we need these resources to understand how they operate and they keep learning and they're getting better and better.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       What do you make of

Speaker 2:          00:43:07       the, uh, the progressive alliance seemingly with Islamist? I, I, to me, this is like the biggest piece of this, that you've got certain pieces, pieces of the left that are just useless idiots basically are, they're useful, idiot, not useless. They're useful because they're allowing these people to attain power in the name of tolerance. And it's like, well, you guys will just be the last ones to be beheaded. I mean, that's really the way I see this thing playing out.

Speaker 1:          00:43:34       First, when I was in a fundamentalist Islamist, someone who rejected the West rejected ballot with the West, my best friends from the outside world, you know, and I wouldn't say there were friends who aren't your personally, but the people who I considered our friends, our allies where the leftists. So when I was a fundamentalist in mom's sitting in, in Iraq or Iran, and I am on social media, there were certain people, I liked politicians. I liked Jeremy Corbyn hero. Uh, people like that. Yeah. Hillary Clinton, every Muslim, every extremist Muslim in the United States votes for Hillary Clinton. This is a fact. I'm not saying all of them volts, but lords will do four vote. Hillary. There would never republican. Right. So can you explain that connection there? There's a common agenda. The edge. It's very common. I mean you take a look at what these guys are doing. It's very common. Most extremist Muslims just want to operate. Who's going to give them that free room to breathe. They'll vote for that person. And Hillary and Obama, these guys, they funded Isis, they funded isis and they funded and with Jackie Dean, the jihadists, these rebels who killed my family and these guys fund them. So the extremist at the end of the day, it's not seen as a threat by the Democratic Party and they visit them every Ramadan and they sit with them every Ramadan and they, you know, they welcome each other.

Speaker 2:          00:45:11       So what do you think, okay, so I'll go with you on that. But what do you think then is in the mind of Hillary or Obama or any of these other lower level politicians that then I would say again are useful idiots basically. They don't understand the threat that you're laying out here are or do they, are they in that? Like what? What do you think is actually going on in the mind of Hillary when, when she's doing these things, and we don't even have to make it about her specifically, but any of these people,

Speaker 1:          00:45:36       she understands the threat and so do many people like her. They know the threat of what they're doing. I think they're just greedy because they know they can't be touched, so she's protected. She doesn't care about anybody else. It's greed,

Speaker 2:          00:45:50       but pat protection doesn't always last. Right. I mean this, this is a fool's game, right?

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       It doesn't last, but I mean, I think she's going to teach for the rest of her life. She's going to have that protection at least because you know, any Iraq, we had the same situation. How did isis get in? Ice has gone into Iraq because certain politicians plate the diversity game. You know, why have borders with Saudi Arabia? Why have a wall, let the desert to be open and then these cars came in from around the world and they took over 40 minutes away from bad debt. I mean then politicians, when their family members were being killed, they will up. So maybe that, that's what it takes, that you, you experience the threat of jihad personally. Then you'll understand where in Mankato Hillary is coming from and people like Dave Rubin who understand what your mom told he is saying maybe some people will wake up, but then again, that's another world of politics.

Speaker 2:          00:46:47       Let's talk about immigration a little bit cause it's been sort of a thread through this. Um, your first strong border protection, uh, I mentioned to you right before we started, I was in London a couple months ago and I hadn't been there for quite some time before that. I've been there twice this year and the first time I was there, one of the things that was shocking to me, it's just, it's just viscerally shocking and it has nothing to do with bigotry or hatred or anything else is that I was in, you know, the Harrods area right in the sort of center of London and the amount of women that I saw in burqas. I mean only eyes. That's it. Now, I have no problem with those people individually of course, but seeing this amount, I mean I'm talking, it seemed like at points 20 or 30% of the women now, if they, if, if I had seen 30% of the women dressed in traditional Mormon clothing or dressed as orthodox Jews, I would have also thought there's something strange going on here. Let's put it that way. That's what I do. It's just like this something odd going on here. Can you just talk about that related to Western countries and then how that's related to immigration? Very simple. You see how I had to even ask the question in a way that's like, I'm apologizing for seeing something. It's like it's pathetic.

Speaker 1:          00:47:52       Yeah. Uh, it's very simple. The West has become weaker. They become stronger. They're telling you this is the norm. In fact, this is the college norm. This is how we're going to address. You're going to look at us and you're going to turn away if you're not like it. That's basically it. That's what's happening now. Are these people extremists? Of course. I'm not saying every lady that always a burger is an extremist. What I'm saying is because you know this is between us on camera. Yeah, don't worry, it's just going to youtube. So you know, some of the filthiest woman to ever exist are ones that were burgers, seriously hookers. Uh, they were brokers because they don't want them their faces to be not. And uh, you know, now in Baghdad from the reports that come, because you know, I speak to officials, they tell us that they have a problem with prostitution and the woman are wearing burgers and they want to stand out from the other women that are wearing burkas. So what they do is they flip their attire inside out, but it's all black. But all you have to do is focus on that thread. Is that inside out?

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       Ah, so an inside out burger and fries to three,

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       exactly in Baghdad and some air, some Muslim areas. If a lady went in there with a burger, they know she's up to something. So this isn't Islamophobia, this is Muslim areas or what's, what's she up to? So it's none of that. Oh, I wear it to preserve my modesty. No one's going to hit on me or on the street and cat calling. No. In fact, some guys got there just to look for these women because they know she's out for business. Yeah. No, not all of them, but this does exist for the women who live in the West who web workers. There are several types of women. One, one that's forced by her husband. The second one, the second type is the type that would divorce her husband if he told her to take it off and the third one would be someone who is just trying to fit in with all of this. We are the rebels in society. We are the real Muslims. That's basically my analysis of the city.

Speaker 2:          00:50:10       Yeah. Do the average leftie that used to be your ally when you were more extreme, so to speak, do you think they realize that this set of ideas is so in direct conflict with the rest of their ideas, their rest of their ideas, tolerance, and we're for gays and minorities and women and all of these things that they've aligned themselves with it with an ideology. If you were to look at it in their pyramid, they've put Islam really at the top of their pyramid because they believe it's a brown person's religion, which of course is is a racist notion in itself because a religion is not of a skin color. Um, but do you think they even realize like now I'm not talking about say the Islamist, what they realize their alliance is the other way around. Do you think these people have any sense of what's going on here?

Speaker 1:          00:50:55       I think what's happening now is that loyalty has shifted from being loyal to your country and to your people, to being loyal to your boss and to your company. So I've seen generalists who would write wonderful articles about me. The moment they get a job and a left leaning outlets, it's like I'm a whore. I'm the worst person that they've ever known. And the contradiction remains online. Like what happened here? I'm, I'm someone who is going to influence the Australia and I'm a peaceful guy and they welcome me and here I am a fraud who should be silenced. Don't give him the megaphone. So you see, I think a loyalty falls in, uh, companies, uh, no more in, in country or faith or family.

Speaker 2:          00:51:42       Yeah. Can you talk a little bit about the sort of unique way that Islam is designed to spread? So already, are you familiar with Dr Bill Warner who does political islam.com? So one of the things that he said when I had him on, I think this is probably over three years ago, that I thought it was interesting. He said that religions are designed to spread differently. So Judaism for example, it's very hard to convert. You have to do a lot to convert. But if you want to get out, you just basically say, I'm not a Jew. Every Jew would be like, ah, you're still a Jew. And then that's it. Where Islam, it's very easy to get in, right? You just have to recite something very quickly and it's almost impossible to get out because then you're an apostate, so now we can, we can kill you. So he said it's actually a virus is, is very easy to attain and very difficult to eliminate. So that's what he was comparing it to. I thought it was an interesting analogy.

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       Okay. Um, for me personally, the way I see it is if Islam was going to grow in Huston row in the right direction, because I believe Muslims will always be converting people and there'll be, people always come back to Islam. So I don't believe religion can be stopped at all or eliminated. I mean, look at Judaism, they never had a government to protect them for thousands and thousands of years. Everyone was trying to kill them and did in fact kill them. They've been butchered in the millions, but they still, they're still around. It's hard. It's not hard. It's almost impossible to eradicate a religion. It doesn't work like that. Uh, so that's my take my position. So I don't see it as a virus. I just believe people will always have certain opinions and and change religions. What I do acknowledge is the fact that Islam is very strategic in recruiting adherence to its belief system.

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       And this isn't all Islamic schools of thought, but the majority of them, so the majority of mainstream do actually have a strategy and it's called throw down that way. What does it is they go out to the streets and there are basically selling religion. There was solid religion and in return they'll give you heaven, a paradise in the hereafter. That's the basic transaction. And you know there's an audience for everything. This is a fact and many people do embrace Islam because of the promises that they get. I mean if you're a businessman and you're stopped by one of these stalls and they'll tell you there's so much wealth waiting for you, one prayer, we'll build your five castles. If you're a farmer, they'll tell, they'll promise you massive farms in, in paradise. If they know that you're like women, they'll promise you plenty of women.

Speaker 1:          00:54:17       Like the Jihad is 72 virgin issue. Let's see. Two virgins seems like a bit much. No, the actual teaching say each one of these 72 virgins comes with her aids. So it's actually more than 72. And the actual number 72 or 70 in the Arabic language just means a lot. It means unlimited PTO is right. I've told you a million times. That's good to know. So it's not actually 72. Um, and it's not raisins either. Maybe people say it's not because the Islamic books describe their hair, their eyes. And if one hair wants to fall on planet earth, the perfume would be smarter by everyone. So there are descriptions that these actual women non reasons. So the strategy of Islam spreading is very unique in a sense that their unity, uh, in, in their urology is unbreakable. It's impossible. I mean, I'm Muslim would unite with a Muslim, against a Christian, against an atheist, even if he knows his brother and faith is wrong. So then how are you a Muslim? And that's the thing. When you ask him, are Shia Muslims Muslim? They'll say, no, you asked the Shia and the Sunni Muslim, they'll say, not real Muslims. Then that Hamodia will say, both of these guys are not Muslim. I'm the real Muslim. And then bought the she and the suddenly all the United against that at the and say, here's what the real Muslim, so it's a struggle within Islam itself. It's a problem. And they fall into many contradictions because of this, because Muslims killing Muslims everyday Muslim governments bombing all Muslim governments,

Speaker 2:          00:55:59       right? I mean what's going on with Saudi Arabia in Yemen, right? Yeah, yeah. Which nobody talks about of course, because we don't know how to frame it properly. So we just wait for something to happen with Israel basically. And then it's like, oh well now we can, we got good guys and bad guys. It's easy. So all right. So two more questions for you. So one, where do you, what do you think it is about you? About the guy I'm sitting across from him right now that gives you the sort of bravery to talk about this. This is, this is, I mean that's why when first came on the scene and everyone was like, talk to this guy, I was hesitant because I was like, I just, I just don't know enough that I had a, I don't want the wool pulled over my eyes, but be, you know, as your critics will say, there's fame to gain out of this. There is all of this other, a bounty to be habit. So what is it about you that makes you do this?

Speaker 1:          00:56:44       I'm nobody special. I swear I'm nobody special. I'm just a regular guy who grew up in almost a family, was trained in Iran, um, life put me in this position or they end as a scholar, came back to Australia, started meeting with politicians. It worked out really well. More politicians started inviting me. We started working with parliaments, advising senates, and I have a Twitter account that I'm active on. I have a foundation and organization, basic stuff. And I speak out only because I've always been outspoken about it when I was in Islam as I was an outspoken Islam. So let's put it that way. Going out smoking Islam. This sound like you don't want to hear it. It's horrible. I was outspoken. I used to flagellate. I don't know if you've seen my pictures now, but you, so you actually used to do it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       Wait, can you explain what that is? I would cover myself in my own blood. Absolute flagellation so you know I'm, I'm, I'm not a convert into the religion. I've come from that whole lineage and lifestyle. You got credit, but people usually ask me what red pilled you and because this is politics, this is religion. I just don't know how to answer that. But I think the best way to put it is that I have always been outspoken and I'm not afraid. In fact, I am afraid of the fact that I'm not afraid because I can get myself into serious trouble. I've said certain things in front of certain people that I've had to leave the country at the same afternoon.

Speaker 2:          00:58:28       Yeah. Well your, your Twitter, Twitter, bio used to be something to the, do you know what exactly it is? Where I want to today.

Speaker 1:          00:58:35       One day you will hear that. I have been killed and the news will speak about it. That was my first Twitter bio and then I changed it simply because I had a meeting with state intelligence and they said, you know what, you could be giving ideas to certain people, so remove it. So I put peace advocate, things like that. But I do have a, you know, a great security team and I'm very grateful for.

Speaker 2:          00:59:02       Yeah. All right. So my last question is this. Paint me two roads of the future. Give me two pictures of the future, Hawaii, the the future that you want to build and then I want the future. If that does not get built, what does that look like? So you can do either one first.

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       The future, I want to focuses on the west and the West alone. The Middle East isn't in my area anymore because me having this interview, something like this in the Middle East would see me killed the same week. So the best way to reach the Middle East is through social media. And I've got my accounts and Arabic, I've got a counseling, different languages where I have translators that do that for me. But my main vision and my effort and energy goes into the west and I would like to see all Islamist extremist centers shut down. Uh, the people who are fundamentalists and have been sponsored by terrorist organizations such as care to lose their positions in government. I would like to see a honorable leader of a country that cracks down on these extremists. On the other hand, I would like to see the so called moderates or just the regular Muslims speaking out more and they're in moms being more vocal against the extremists and have this unity as a society.

Speaker 1:          01:00:42       You could be Jewish, I could be Muslim, our friend could be Christian and we could just sit down and have a meal together, shake hands, go to, you know, a, a match, watch a match together. Watch a movie. No problem in that which people are doing every day in the west. Yes. We shouldn't forget that we are doing that. So after this interview, I'll go back to Australia and I go back into the Muslim community. I don't go back to meeting with Jews and Christians. I do that in my interfaith work, but I actually live amongst the Muslim community. So I would like to see that Muslim community embracing the larger community in the West. That's uh, my vision because then we can work on establishing peace and building a better relations and basically uniting with w with the rest of the world against the extremists, within our own religion.

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       That's my vision. If that doesn't work out, I was going to say we should have done this and the other way because now you're going to end up ending on, on the bad notes. So I'll try to figure out a way to get us the thumbnail offending is. If that doesn't work out, then I believe we have to unite as a, because there will always be Muslims or have conservative views. Do you know how many Muslims about for Trump? Many. They flit from the rulers who Trump is now putting in line. So they would vote for Trump just for that very reason that they know that they're all as back home can start war with other countries who are allies with America. So many Muslims vote for Trump. Well that, that also is the ultimate irony of the alliance with the left because it's like you're taking a group of people who are inherently conservative, who old conservative religious values and then your aligning them with people that hold none of those values and they're going, please join us for now.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       I think if my vision of the West doesn't end up being successful, then we need to unite as the, uh, the revisionists reformist Muslims who are completely against what's happening unite with the Jews, with the Christians. Let's put far left far right aside and let's just speak as humans who are concerned about national security, we need to unite on a professional level. It's not enough to speak on youtube and, and to tweet. This isn't enough for me, which is why I go and I sit with politicians because I want to get something done. So we need tonight, either now or unite in, in a, in a much more global style in the future to end on a positive note. I'll tell you this, the Islamists are worried now may be not showing it too much because they were getting people into Congress and people into parliaments, but then are worried they've lost a lot of territory.

Speaker 1:          01:03:42       The caliphate that they dreamed of, they have lost Isis and they've lost a lot. I mean the United Arab Emirates shutting them down, uh, Austria shut down 60 deported 60 months back to Turkey. I mean we are doing things that harm them and harm their, you know, their, their agenda of death basically. And we're doing them in large portion, so in portions they can't accept 16 months vanished from the country in one day. That's a big loss for them. Yeah. So we are pushing back, I believe as a, as a society or as a global society against the extremists. Uh, but I think it's a slow way to the finishing point and we will win at the end of the day. I do know that eventually people will just get fed up with the extremists and unite with these reformers and just get them out of the society. I don't know how.

Speaker 1:          01:04:41       Maybe in a hundred years, I don't know, but it's going to be really bad. The way we win. We'll be really bad. That one might be peaceful and it's, I really hope that we can pave the way for a much more peaceful ending, but I'll just say this. Every time I came on Australian television, I have a police officer that time that tells me, you're not your mom. I've been testing this every time you go out there speaking, we get more applications for firearms because they believe Marine invasion is coming. So then I started to tone it down a little bit. Yeah, but I still want to say the truth and I wish for

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       a peaceful ending. That's basically it. Isn't it weird how you just have to live your life and do what you think is right at all times? I remember when I first started talking about this stuff and I was just a little worried about security and things. I said to, do you know Dennis Prager? Yes. I said to Dennis Prager. I asked him about just security cause it just, any of any of my friends in this world, they're talking about this stuff. I was just asking and I said to Dennis, uh, you know, what do you do about security? And he told me some things that I can't repeat, but then he goes, but at the end of the day when it's your time to go, it's your time to go. I thought, well, I'm a little younger than you. I'm not quite ready for that yet. Well listen, you have an ally in me and I hope, I hope, I hope we, I hope we helped spread a little bit of what I know you've made your life about. And uh, you know, hopefully there's a way that it doesn't get that bad before it gets better. I suppose. We shall see. Definitely. Thank you so much for having me. Yeah. And I'm sorry we can't hang out tonight cause I would've loved to, but I'm a little crazy at the moment. And for more on a mom to Iti, follow him on Twitter before he's banned at eamomm of peace.
