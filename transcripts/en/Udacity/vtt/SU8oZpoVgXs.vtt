00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.750
So, to build an app like this one for
location services and

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.820
many of the other services that you'll
be encountering in this course,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.780
you're going to do the following steps.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.610
First of all, the easiest way to
get started is to create a new

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.190
app using a Blank Activity
in Android Studio.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.790
Once you've done this,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.830
you'll edit the build.gradle
to add the services libraries.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.020
You'll using something like this,
but the version number may change.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.420
Then, you'll edit AndroidManifest.xml,
to tell your application that you're

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.750
using these services libraries, and the
particular version that you're using.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.490
When you put this value,
integer Google Play services version.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.830
When you do a gradle sync, the correct
version number will be put in for you.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.050
So it's good just to use this string.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.320
And then finally,
in AndroidManifest.xml you're

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.300
probably going to be adding
a bunch of permissions as well.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.410
In this case I was doing location so

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.850
you see I set users permission for
access_fine_location.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.097
Depending on the activity or depending
on the type of application that you're

00:00:57.097 --> 00:00:59.769
building, you'll be putting
different permissions in here.
