00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.370
Um, sorry to be the bearer of startling news,
but...the clouds are disappearing?

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.190
Like we could be edging closer and closer
to a world with no clouds, which could contribute

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.290
a significant 8 degrees to the already predicted
global temperature rise.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.290
(looking up at the sky) “No come bacccckkkk!”

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.660
We all know climate change is already radically
changing our world and will continue to do

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.660
so.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.070
But an unexpected byproduct of high atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels is a loss of clouds.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.240
I know it sounds insane, but it may have happened
before.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.300
Around 56 million years ago, the geologic
record indicates that the world was essentially

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.690
ice free.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.470
In other words, it was SUPER hot, with an
average annual temperature of around 30 degrees

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.040
celsius—a hot flash in the earth’s history
we now refer to as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.040
Maximum.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.960
In trying to figure out how the heck earth
could have gotten that toasty, today’s scientists

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.520
estimate that it could be due to a loss of
cloud cover—particularly stratocumulus clouds.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.770
To help us unravel this theory, we spoke to
journalist Nathalie Wolchover, who spent over

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.269
a year researching this topic.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.380
Nathalie: The question of how stratocumulus
clouds will change is kind of the most important

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.719
question in knowing how bad kind of global
warming is going to be going forward.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.549
Stratocumulus clouds are the most common cloud
type and more of earth’s surface is covered

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.429
by them than any other kind of cloud.

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.899
They keep Earth and its oceans cool by shading
all of us underneath them and bouncing sunlight

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.250
back into space, away from us.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.479
A lot of them also produce a nice drizzle.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.899
They’re dependent on convective instability,
and they form a distinctive, relatively thin

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.859
layer because their growth upwards is limited
by a zone of dry stable air above them, even

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.079
while they draw moisture from whatever’s
underneath them.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.700
Their structure is totally dependent on their
ability to release and absorb heat and moisture

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.040
in a very particular way.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.780
A way that cannot be disturbed.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.450
Now, we do have very high-fidelity simulations
and computer models that help us understand

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.709
the possible effects of climate change.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:08.250
From sea ice melt to sea level rise to temperature
changes, we can understand how fluctuating

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.620
factors like levels of atmospheric CO2 may
affect the earth’s natural systems.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.620
These kinds of models are run on supercomputers
because they have so many intricate moving

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.360
parts that the calculations would just be
impossible on any other kind of computer.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.020
But cloud dynamics, like what’s happening
inside stratocumulus clouds, actually take

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.930
place on too small a scale to be included
in these larger models.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.830
They’re also just so complex that they’re
very difficult to predict, so they get left

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.300
out of big climate simulations that tell us
a lot about what could happen to our world

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.300
as it warms.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.510
A joint research team from CalTech and the
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory tackled

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.680
this gap in our climate models.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.610
They created a novel application of the same
kind of simulations we use for larger climate

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.710
phenomena: a large-eddy simulation.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.630
Applying this on a smaller scale allowed them
to study cloud behavior in response to several

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.180
factors—one of them being atmospheric CO2
concentration.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.730
And it turns out—as the CO2 levels rise,
the stratocumulus clouds can’t achieve as

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.540
much longwave cooling, or the release of heat
from the top of the cloud.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.860
This disturbs the convection that keeps the
cloud together, and they just break apart.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.700
Nathalie Wolchever: So they found that this
breakup of stratocumulus clouds could actually

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.380
add eight degrees Celsius of additional warming
to the Earth's system in the future.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.920
And a big question is at what point will that
tipping point occur.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.800
But based on some Simple simple assumptions
this tipping point would occur when the CO2

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.000
in the atmosphere reaches twelve hundred parts
per million.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And that's actually CO2 equivalent.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So that would include other greenhouse gases
Kind of yeah.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.380
So that level is three times the current level
of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.510
This work confirms that high historic CO2
levels may have caused the lack of cloud cover

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.800
that led to a sweltering PETM back in the
day.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.500
But it also presents the alarming prospect
that rising atmospheric CO2 today not only

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.209
raises global temperatures, but could lead
to loss of cloud cover.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.570
This results in even hotter global temperatures
than we’d previously anticipated—just

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.290
because our climate models didn’t include
cloud dynamics.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.099
Nathalie: And it's also important to remember
that this tipping point is far enough away

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.380
that we can avoid it.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.440
And that's been interesting to talk to these
scientists and kind of understand that they

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.421
are more optimistic than you might expect
because I mean maybe that's the nature of

00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:30.421
the people who study climate change.

00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:34.240
You have to be optimistic or you just wouldn't
be able to stand dealing day in and day out

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.069
with this prospect.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.900
This research makes an essential contribution
to our understanding of atmospheric science

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.360
in an era of changing climate.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.270
But this simulation only looked at one particular
area of the globe that’s prone to cloud

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.629
loss, and we may not be able to extrapolate
that behavior to the whole world, at least

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.180
not without further work on the subject.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.580
It’s a crucial example of why continuing
to understand how all these complex unknowns

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.960
work together is SO important, and needs to
be supported.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.629
So we can keep preparing for our new reality,
and hopefully, if we detect these issues early

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.080
enough, take action that could keep them from
happening in the first place.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.990
Now that we have your attention, it’s Earth
DayAnd let’s not forget about Earth Day,

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.050
. Ever wonder what would happen if the earth
just get a liiiiittle bit hotter?
