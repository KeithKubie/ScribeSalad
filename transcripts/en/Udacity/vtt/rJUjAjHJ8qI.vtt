00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.710
All right, so
let's walk through the pseudocode

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.520
with a very tiny little example in mind
just to see how the value updates work.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.340
So what we're doing here is we start
off at the beginning of an episode.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.280
We say that the eligibility for
all of the states is 0.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.030
Zero.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.860
And the new values,
the new value function

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.740
is whatever the value function was
at the end of the previous episode.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.780
So we just make a note of that.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.930
What we're going to do for this example
is just keep track of the changes.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.890
So this ultimately it's all going to
get added to whatever the previous

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.690
value was.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.330
All right, so now we make a transition.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.830
And the first transition we make is
from S1 to S2 to with reward r1.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.150
What does that do to the eligibility?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.190
&gt;&gt; Well, for
S1 it sets the eligibility to 1.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.370
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.310
All right, then we're now going to loop
through all the states, all of them,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.810
and we're going to apply the same
little update to all of them.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.920
And the update has the form,
whatever the current learning rate is

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.255
times the reward that we
just experienced, the R1,

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.027
plus gamma times whatever

00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:08.890
the previous iteration value was for
the state that we landed in.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.380
Minus the previous iteration's value
of the state that we just left.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.900
All right, so this quantity is going to
actually get added to all the states,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.470
but the amount that it's going to
get added to all the states

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.015
is proportional to the eligibility for
that state.

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:28.245
And since, at the moment,
states S2 and S3 are ineligible,

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:31.445
they have their eligibility set to 0,
really nothing's happening there,

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:34.215
we're only making an update
with respect to state S1.

00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:35.765
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay I see.

00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:37.355
So then why are we bothering?

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:39.415
&gt;&gt; Well, it's not clear yet.

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:41.295
For now, let's just make sure
that it does the right thing.

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:44.990
Then we'll talk about why it's
a reasonable thing to have done.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.420
Okay, I trust you Michael, implicitly.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.190
&gt;&gt; All right, so
that's the changes that we've made so

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.970
far to the new value function for
S1, S2, and S3.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.880
All right, now we take the next
step which is from S2 to S3.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.610
Oh wait, no, sorry.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.370
Before that, we have to decay
the eligibilities for everybody.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.040
So the 0s decay to still 0, and
the 1 decays down to gamma.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.750
Right.
Now, we've done that update from

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.660
the step that we just took, we take
the next step, S2 to S3 reward r2.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.950
So, what does it tell us to do?

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.490
Well, the first thing is, we have to
update the eligibility of the state that

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.160
we just left, so
that bumps S2s eligibility up to 1.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.940
Then we go through everybody and
we add this quantity again.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.210
So what's the new quantity?

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.050
It's r2 plus gamma times
the value of the state that we

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.950
just left minus the previous value
of the state that we, no sorry,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.902
the state we just got to and
the state we just left.

00:02:36.902 --> 00:02:41.160
All right, so this is this update
that is now independent of

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.590
which state we're actually changing.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.650
We're going to apply that everywhere.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.760
But we're going to apply
proportionally to the eligibility.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.609
So the eligibilities are at the moment
gamma 1 and 0 so gamma 1 and 0.

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.415
So we just have to add this
into the other things.

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:56.965
&gt;&gt; What does that look like?

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:58.505
&gt;&gt; So through the magic of cut and
paste,

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:02.915
we can actually add that same complex
quantity to both these updates here.

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:05.135
And in particular,
we're multiplying by the eligibility.

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:07.965
So for the first value,
we have this extra gamma in here.

00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:09.265
For the second one, nothing.

00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:10.945
And for the third one,
it gets multiplied by zero, so

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.435
I didn't even bother to write it.

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:15.605
So this is starting to look a little
bit hairy, but that's okay,

00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:17.345
because we're going to
do some simplification.

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:18.260
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.570
So here's the interesting
thing to observe.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.460
That previously we added
in this value of S2,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.450
according to the previous
value function, times gamma.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.830
And now we're subtracting away the value
of S2 from the previous iteration.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.010
And we're multiplying that by
this gamma and this alpha.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.240
So they actually match exactly.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.716
This thing [SOUND] and
this thing [SOUND] cancel.

00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:44.000
&gt;&gt; That's beautiful.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.370
&gt;&gt; So now I can rearrange
the remaining terms and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.980
make it look a little bit simpler.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.900
All right, and
this is the simplified form that we get.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.080
It compactifies really
nicely actually and so

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.580
we have something that's of
a similar form that we had before.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.340
But the point is that mainly what just
happened is we regrouped terms and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.530
the S2 related stuff in this term,
in this update here, cancel.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.020
So the last thing we do after we've done
all those value updates is we update

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.350
the eligibilities and
we're ready for the next step.
