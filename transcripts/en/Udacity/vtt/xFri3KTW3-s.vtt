00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:04.415
The tools we've described so

00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:06.850
far represent the majority of
time you'll spend in the program.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.280
But there's a handful of
others you'll use as well, so

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.180
we'll go through those
real quick as well.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.800
The tools we'll talk about here will
cover managing your Georgia Tech

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.750
account, taking proctored exams,
interacting with your classmates

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.400
on social media,
attending office hours with your TAs and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.280
professors, and
participating in a peer review process.
