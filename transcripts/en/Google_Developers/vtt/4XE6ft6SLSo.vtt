EDDIE BEARNOT: Direct Fresh
is Bangladesh's first premium

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.760
online grocery store.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.320
I think our biggest challenge
is getting customers online.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.570
E-commerce is brand
new to Bangladesh,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.770
and so shoppers aren't
accustomed to buying

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.407
anything online, especially not
their groceries, where they're

00:00:22.407 --> 00:00:24.990
used to going into a store and
seeing and feeling the objects.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.320
So there's a lot of education
that we've had to do.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.685
But that's one of our
biggest challenges.

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.060
SAM BRETZFIELD:
Another challenge

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.250
would be the online payment
gateway here in Bangladesh.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.310
It's a very convoluted process,
not very user friendly,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.310
which means that in
some cases, customers

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.250
have to go literally to two
to three different pages

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.410
in order to just check out.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.807
So we've overcome that really
by having a handheld credit card

00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:51.390
machine where our customers are
able to swipe their cards when

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.389
their food is delivered.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.240
MISHAL KARIM: We've also done
a lot of work with our website,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.570
studying analytics
and user experience.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.120
We now feel we can
take this model

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.760
and drop it in other cities.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.950
And we've identified Bangkok,
Goa, the UK as the next three

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.400
cities that we're
going to go after.
