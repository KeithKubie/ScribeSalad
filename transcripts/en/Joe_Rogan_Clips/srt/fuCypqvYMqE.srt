1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,530
Can Hoist doesn't, you know,
at this point when you compare,

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,100
compare to these athletic guys and
MMA today we saw it with Matt Hughes,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,010
you know, you know, he
couldn't compete anymore. Um,

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,120
once people sort of knew
the tricks. But um, yeah,

5
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:15,210
I mean that it's very humbling.
The whole experience. Even crazier.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,510
Hixon hoists his brother voice will
tell you he's 10 times better than him.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,380
Yeah. Hixon would do to hoists what hoists
would do to other black belts. Well,

8
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:26,710
wasn't that select the,
uh,

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,700
the story was they could have had Hixon
but he was too athletic and two s,

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,270
you know,

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,270
there was a bunch of issues and I would
not want to say exactly what happened

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,530
for fear of upsetting either side, cause
I think there's two different stories.

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,490
Okay. But, uh, he was essentially
the champion of the family.

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,790
And one of the thoughts was that it would
be a more impressive if hoist did it

15
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:55,320
because her voice was only 175 pounds
and with his shirt off and he looked like

16
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,320
he was fit but look like a volleyball
player or something. Right. Whereas Hicks,

17
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:00,690
like Freddie Mercury, Hickson
was shredded. It takes him,

18
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:04,260
was like really into physical training.
He did a lot of gymnastics and yoga.

19
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:09,210
He was unbelievably athletic. Yeah. But
he was also like way physically stronger.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,360
It would appear more that he was
just dominating some like a cat.

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,210
He would jump on. So it wasn't
as good of an advertisement for,

22
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:16,740
it wasn't necessarily true though,

23
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:19,830
because there was also talked that no
one can control Hicks and it didn't want

24
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:23,610
Hixon to win. Cause Hixon is
a, he's like a free spirit,

25
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,110
like in the greatest sense of the word.

26
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,620
Like legitimately he might throw his phone
in the ocean to disappear for a month

27
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,220
and just fucking surf and do
Jiu Jitsu somewhere. Oh he's,

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,140
he's a freak in the best sense
of the word. That's awesome.

29
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:38,120
So I don't think they ever thought they
could control Hixon that was part of the

30
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,720
problem with having Hicks
and be the champion.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,960
Hixon would probably freeze up the
whole organization. I want $10 million,

32
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:43,860
I'll never fight again.
Right.

33
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,270
Like they were offering him fights for
years and he had some crazy number that

34
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,720
he wanted and he was like, if you give
me that number, I'll fight for a door.

35
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:54,780
If you give me that number, I'll fight
the best fighters in the, Oh yeah,

36
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,770
it's after. After the Oct, right?
Yes. What after the UFC started,

37
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:02,310
but everybody's still knew. See when
hoists was winning, everyone's still new.

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,240
Hickson was competing in something
called Japan Valley Tudo and one that you

39
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,500
have to see the super high level
Jujitsu pride. One was Hixon, um,

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,430
and uh,

41
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,730
Hickson was the guy that everybody knew
that if something happened and then

42
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,630
hoists was out of the UFC or there
was no other, uh, Gracie's in the UFC,

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,440
Hixon is always there to step in.
And we were always wondering,

44
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:29,220
when is he gonna step down? When's it
gonna Fight? The best guys never did. No,

45
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:30,054
he fought.

46
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,320
He fought foo knocky who was a really
high level guy that was his last fight and

47
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:39,000
he strangled him, uh, put them to sleep.
It's crazy image man of him. Rear naked,

48
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,140
choke,
finicky,

49
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,380
and for Nike's eyes roll in the back
of his head and he goes unconscious and

50
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,420
Hickson just throws him off.
