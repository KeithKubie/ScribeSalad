00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.566
Now, let's try and make this more difficult. Here's another logarithmic

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.660
equation. And notice that there's multiple logarithms on the left and multiple

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.552
logarithms with base six on the right. Now, I know this may look complicated,

00:00:13.552 --> 00:00:17.136
but we can use our properties of logarithms to rewrite the left-hand side and

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:23.980
the right hand side. So, what expressions do you think go here, and here? So

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.180
that way we can simplify the left hand side, and we can simplify the right hand

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.739
side. Remember that the name of this thing is just called the argument of the

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.464
logarithm. It's the number that we take the logarithm off. So what are these

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:37.300
two arguments?
