&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.970
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.110
This is sponsored by
science, technology,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.410
and business division.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.220
I'm Tomoko Steen.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.280
I'm a research specialist at the
library's science, technology,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.900
and business division.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.380
Today's speaker is cyber
security discussion.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.780
It's going to be
very interesting.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.480
He is Professor Jean-Pierre
Auffret

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420
at George Mason University.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.070
And he's a director of
a research partnership

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.510
in the school of business,
and also associate director

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.530
of the Center for Assurance
Research and Engineering

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.120
in the school of engineering.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.770
He's currently also
a visiting lecturer

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.310
at Duke Sanford School
of Public Policy.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.520
He has a PhD in physics,
and also MBA

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.280
from the University of Virginia.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.060
And his PhD is from
American University.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.710
He has a chemistry undergraduate
degree from Duke University.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.410
Cyber security is really
close to our lives,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.290
and from communication
to medical research,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.800
and also the medical
devices are now, you know,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.200
cyber security really involved.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.240
So before further
ado, please join me

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.120
in welcoming Professor Auffret.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.220
[ Applause ]

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.570
&gt;&gt; J.P. Auffret:
Thank you, Tomoko.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.060
And thank you all
for joining today.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.370
It's a real pleasure to visit
the Library of Congress again,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.350
and to meet all of you.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.040
Just real quickly,
the main focus

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.440
of the talk is both domestically
and internationally what some

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.000
of the challenges
and innovations

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.710
and approaches are
to cyber security.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.010
As part of that, I'm going
to start with a little bit

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.640
of background and context both

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.690
on the changing technology
landscape,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.190
but also changing cyber
security landscape.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.190
And then wrap up with
international relations

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.450
and some on future trends.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.660
A little bit of background
of our cyber security center

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.680
where -- A research
to practice center.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.680
And has a range of technical
projects and policy projects

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.230
as well as leadership
and governance.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.990
So some of the current ones
we have are two projects

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.290
with DARPA.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.270
One on distributed
denial of service,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.760
and one on internet of things.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.810
Trying to ascertain whether
a device has been compromised

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.280
by change in the electromagnetic
field or power consumption.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.360
Then had a recent project
with IBM on smart grid,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.110
and then two projects,
leadership and governance

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.950
with the National
Science Foundation,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.810
one on developing
core competencies

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.250
for cheaper information security
officers, and a new one working

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.030
with cities and counties
across the country

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.640
on fostering cyber security
partnering amongst cities

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.940
and counties.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.630
The idea being that many cities

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.970
and counties are relatively
small and have limited expertise

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.810
and budgets, and
there's a great potential

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.250
for them partnering together.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.670
So as some background I
think on the landscape

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.790
and the technology landscape,
I think these two are --

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.610
circumstances are
really quite amazing,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.690
and illustrate the increasing
importance of technology in day

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.780
to day lives and in society.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.610
The one on the upper left is
the digital identity in India.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.970
So the Indian government
has a digital India program,

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.150
and about five years
ago undertook a program

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.050
to provide everyone in the
country over the age of five

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.350
with a digital identity.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.670
So part of the motivation is 80%
of India lives in rural areas,

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.510
and with 1.3 billion
people total,

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.810
it's about 1 billion people.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.970
So it would make it one
of the biggest countries

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.860
in the world, just
the rural areas.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.080
And many of those in the rural
areas did not have identities,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.800
drivers' licenses or another
type of government identity.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.810
And, in fact, many of the
women's identities were

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.800
through their husband, and
they didn't have their own

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.100
actual identity.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.410
And so as a way of fostering
economic growth, partially also

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.560
to address corruption,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.850
the Indian government
undertook this program.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.730
So it's quite a large challenge

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.540
to provide unique identities
to a billion people.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.820
And so the way they did
it was with iris scans

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.620
and taking 10 fingerprints.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.090
And the program has
since broadened.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.390
So not just for identity.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.440
The Indian government now
trying to replace paper currency

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.430
with digital currency also uses
this [inaudible] for mobile,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.220
mobile SIM chips,
really becoming more

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.630
and more a part of society.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.270
Of course there's issues and
challenges with cyber security

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.270
and privacy, but the Indian
government sees it as a way

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.240
to truly catalyze the
country in the coming years.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.440
Then on the bottom
right, Estonia,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.100
considered the most digital
country in the world,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.400
really kind of interesting.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.110
They only had a few
years of independence

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.620
for the last 700 years until
the early 1990s and the 1920s.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.290
And if you go to the Estonian
embassy there's a letter

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.590
welcoming the [inaudible]

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.680
by Calvin Coolidge welcoming the
Estonia ambassador to the U.S.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.690
for that short number of years.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.730
But after they became
independent they really tried

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.740
to develop an IT industry.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.010
They had a history of computer
science from the soviet years,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.400
and Microsoft chose them as
a test bed for new products.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.830
And so the Estonian
government developed a consensus

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.930
that they were going to
compete as a small country

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.610
in the ICT space, that they'd
digitize the government

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.040
for the most part, founded
Skype, and now a number

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.740
of other companies, but
really totally reliant on ICT.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.490
And also totally reliant
on cyber security.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.380
So those are two examples where
more and more so in the world --

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.900
I think IT puts out [inaudible]
reports every year measuring the

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.680
information society.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.390
This is from last
year's, I believe.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.840
Really remarkable
that the blue line

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.600
on the upper part is
mobile phone adoption.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.170
I'm sorry.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.460
The -- The orange line
is mobile phone adoption.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.180
And so pretty much 100
subscriptions per 100 people

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.480
around the world.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.950
Even in rural areas and
developing countries

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.750
so that the cell phone has
tremendous power, and more

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.390
and more like a computer.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.070
One other interesting
note on this slide.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.300
The dark green one is
mobile broadband adoption,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.760
and that's even faster
than mobile phone adoption.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.850
So more and more
countries have industries --

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.280
Well, mobile banking,
such as M-PESA in Kenya.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.100
And the motivation for that
is the country might have 20%

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.200
or 30% of the country
has a bank account.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.360
90% or 100% have cell phones.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.610
So the cell phone
providing an avenue

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.740
for banking and other services.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.520
Here, too, this is just in
the last number of years.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.120
Only recently, the last 10 years
or so, did submarine cables land

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.890
in West Africa, and East
Africa it was just a little bit

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.190
before that.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.490
A follow on to that.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.880
Many, many countries are now
developing fiber backbone

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.000
networks in Africa.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.820
With that, the cost of cell
phone and availability coming

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.650
down rapidly in the country,
becoming more and more reliant

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.850
on IT and at risk
from cyber security.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.510
Just a little background

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:01.750
on what's driving the
technology change in the areas

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:07.420
of computer storage, processing
speed, and transmission speed.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.020
And these trends continue.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.820
So it was just in 1980
that the first 1 gigabyte

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.570
of storage became
commercially available.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.530
It was about the size
of a refrigerator

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.550
and weighed 550 pounds,
and cost $40,000.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.050
So today we can all
go to a microcenter

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.130
and buy several terabytes
for $50.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.030
So that trend continuing.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.700
Similarly, with transmission,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.430
only in 1957 the first
Transatlantic cable, and only 36

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.160
or so simultaneous phone calls
for many dollars a minute.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.060
Today 3 or 4 million calls
on a fiber optic cable.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.100
And that trend continuing too.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.710
And lastly, processing speed.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.450
By coincidence, the
first Apple computer,

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.600
as well as the first
lunar lander,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.590
both had processing speeds of
about 2,000 cycles a second.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.260
Now 6, 7, 8 billion
cycles a second.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.630
So as much as technology
has changed

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.250
over the last 30 years
today, it's hard to imagine

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.010
with these trends
continuing, where it will be

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.900
in 10, 20, or 30 years.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.840
And there too what
the cyber risks are.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.000
Of course much written
and much being done

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.060
on the sustainable
development goals.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.960
And some really interesting work
and many interesting initiatives

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.730
on the role of ICT and all of
these, but also too the risk

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.880
of cyber attack and the
importance of cyber security.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.680
One of the more interesting
initiatives I think is Japan's

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.260
Society 5.0 partially to
address demographic trends

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.400
or -- in society.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.600
Or decreasing population.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.920
Also to stay competitive, but
Japan looking to embed even more

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.760
so ICT and all the
infrastructure in their approach

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.340
to all there is of society.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.460
So Japan with a very large focus
on ICT, but a very large focus

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.340
on cyber security too.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:14.440
And then lastly on some of the
main challenges and issues,

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.540
this is a World Economic
Forum report, I believe.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.540
World Economic Forum report.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.140
And so it's not all
about the technology.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.880
The left-hand side has
institutional capacity,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.330
and across the bottom
has technology capacity.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.370
And you can see the country's
fallen in different sides

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.130
of the 45 degree line.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.590
Some countries much stronger

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.210
and have much more developed
institutional capacity,

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.860
like legal frameworks
and ICT governance

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.390
and ICT leadership
and government.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.010
Privacy policy.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.690
Others are much stronger
in technology,

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.080
and a little bit less developed

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.270
in ICT governance
and ICT frameworks.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.120
And then some countries are
doing quite, quite well in both.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.270
But ultimately, though, it
takes both the ICT governance

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.570
and the legislative framework
and the policy framework

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:11.370
and the cyber security and the
trust as well as the technology.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:20.300
Some of the changes from a legal
standpoint and a risk standpoint

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.710
for cyber security and
understanding the risks

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.030
to governments and countries.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:31.930
Everyone recognizes
that the Anonymous mask,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.990
really quite an active
organization.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.060
And some say one of the first

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.810
or the first non country
country, actually.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:48.000
But they provide a threat
to many types of countries

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.380
as well as local governments.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.840
From where I'm from
in south Florida,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.040
the Fort Lauderdale government
passed legislation on loitering.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.800
It had to do with the
homeless, but they were trying

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.000
to help the homeless,
but also pass this

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.850
anti-loitering legislation.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.000
And Anonymous actually
defaced their website.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.980
Also, too, attacking many

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.960
of the pharmaceutical
companies and larger firms.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.790
The risk on the bottom
right of the insider,

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.640
we'll talk about this a little
bit later, not in the context

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.310
of Edward Snowden, but in the
context of different perceptions

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.820
of cyber security from
country to country.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.070
The upper left was one of the --

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.050
a conviction by the U.S.
government Department

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.010
of Justice.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.280
This gentleman led
a ring in Estonia,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.800
as it turns out, on
click thru fraud.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.340
And so they made tens
of millions of dollars,

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.480
and the chart there shows that
the companies that they bought

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.130
with the proceeds from the
click thru fraud that they had.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:55.000
And then the bottom left, the
Chinese group who attacked some

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.720
of our companies, Westinghouse,
U.S. Steel, in cyber espionage,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.400
industrial espionage, and
we'll talk about that too,

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.740
and different perceptions,
in a little bit.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.150
And then lastly this
is a current one.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.860
You can see the quite
large award or reward,

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.100
$1 million offered by the FBI.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.890
This gentleman was running
fraudulent car auctions here.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.000
He lived overseas, but here.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.740
And so people were buying cars
online and paying for the cars,

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.240
but there was ultimately no car.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.370
And so the U.S. government --
He's one of the most wanted,

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.350
the cyber most wanted,
by the FBI.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.030
So a lot of risk to
citizens, and a lot of risk

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.760
to critical infrastructure.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.310
Last year a topic that was

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.330
in the news a lot is the
risk to the electric grid.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.210
So electric grid is changing.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.690
So previously over the years
it was one directional,

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.540
power flowing one way.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.930
It wasn't very IT reliant.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.280
It had industrial
control systems

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.540
with many, many years of life.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.180
Not connected to networks
or to the internet.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.550
Now the power system
is different.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:10.470
So power goes two ways,
both from the power company

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.260
to the users, and also for those

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.980
with solar power back
to the power company.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.410
Also more and more reliant
on information technology.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:24.420
So this example from
Russian territory,

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.070
part of the Ukrainian power
grid was shut down for

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.340
about three hours or so.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.660
And it was of interest
both because of --

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.350
Primarily because
it was demonstrating

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.580
that someone could indeed
take down a power company.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.690
Part of the sophistication of
this was that it was planned,

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.020
and the reconnaissance
that it took.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.500
Part of it wasn't
that sophisticated.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.240
More the click through
type of thing.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.890
But the U.S. government very
oriented towards the risks

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.500
to the power system as well
as to the risk to many --

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.590
much of our critical
infrastructure.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.620
One of the kind of
interesting things

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:07.610
about the U.S. is both our
distributed governance as well

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.370
as distributed approach to
critical infrastructure.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.040
So in the U.S. we have
50,000 or so water companies,

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.090
more than 3,000 electric
utilities.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.090
Many are very, very big,
and very sophisticated.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.920
Many are much, much smaller.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.790
Oftentimes they're
municipal owned.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.490
And then there's the national
government responsibility

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.460
as well as state government
from public service commissions.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.580
So part of the challenge here

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.920
in the U.S. is how all
these things come together.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.860
Part of the other challenges
is the technology itself.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.480
Sometimes with operating
systems and windows,

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.060
sometimes with flash drives,
sometimes with -- at the banks.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.610
Adopting new technology.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.930
And sometimes, as I mentioned,
with the electric grid.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:16:00.070
This is an interesting
demonstration which I was going

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.820
to show, but I'm not
using my computer.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.670
Has anyone seen the
Aurora demonstration

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.460
from Idaho National Lab?

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.420
So it's a demonstration
of the connection

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.350
between physical security
and internet security.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.610
And part of the motivation

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.910
for the Japan Society 5.0 is
the increasing convergence

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.450
of physical and cyber
and internet.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.040
But what this demonstration
was in 2007,

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.030
and this is a CNN video,
is by online opening

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.880
and closing the relays
out of phase

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.270
with the electric grid they
were able to cause this

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.780
to start shaking slowly.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.640
And ultimately end
up smoking like that.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.110
So it was a very
visual demonstration,

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:52.000
and part of the objective
was to do something visual.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.520
But the point being that there's
this connection between physical

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.910
and cyber that's becoming
more and more relevant.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.310
So right before we were talking
a little bit about drones,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.860
so there there's a connection.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:11.520
Many of the drones operated from
ground, and the drone flying.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.630
Autonomous vehicles
such as cars.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.370
Robots and robotics.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.680
And even artificial
intelligence.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.580
All of these things
with more autonomy,

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:25.270
and oftentimes a
physical aspect to them.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.760
Okay. What makes the threat so
-- Part of what makes the threat

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.990
so challenging is
the asymmetry of it.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:37.300
So the systems that we have
today are really complicated.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:46.690
Millions and millions of lines
of code, often of custom code

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:52.980
and some open source, some
legacy code, and contrast

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.740
that -- Oftentimes malware
can be as small as 125 lines.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.950
So relatively easy to
duplicate, relatively easy

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.420
to sell non sophisticated types.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.340
But really a contrast with
the systems that we have.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.950
This is a DARPA slide to try
to demonstrate the asymmetry

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:15.110
or the advantage sometimes
with today's technology

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.190
that an attacker might have.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.600
So the questions for the
country and for a company

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:29.180
and for an individual, too,
is how secure actually are you

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.920
as a company or as a government

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.650
or as a home, a house,
or a family.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.060
And how do you answer that?

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.600
Which is difficult
because it's a risk issue.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.480
Are we more secure this
year than last year?

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.000
And how do we know?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.820
And how much more secure
would we be if we spent

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.970
so much extra in budget dollars?

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.560
And how much more
secure would we be

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.070
if we adopt these processes,
practices, and technologies?

00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.410
So these are difficult questions
to answer, and that's part

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.110
of the challenge or objective
with IT governance is

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.630
to develop a way or to have
an approach within a company

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.840
or a government to answer
these types of questions.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.090
And then the answers to
these types of questions lead

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.030
to the cyber security plan
or program for the year,

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.370
and the budget, and
the initiatives.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.570
So a country's overall cyber
security strategy is much,

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:23.870
much broader than this,

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.340
but at the company level
this is a big part of it.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.770
So part of answering
that is to look

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:35.080
at what the actual
cost is to a company.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.660
And there's two types.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.600
So there's a type of
cost that there might be

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.760
for a critical infrastructure
breach,

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.750
and that is more
the financial cost

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.510
from a personal type
information breach.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.760
But let's look at one example
from Wyndham Worldwide,

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.360
and see what the direct
and indirect costs are.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.320
So Wyndham owns Ramada, I
think, and I think Day's Inn,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.060
and some other ones
[inaudible] big hotel chain.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.360
And quite a good one.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:09.660
So they had a major breach
about 2010 or so with the theft

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.710
of millions of credit cards.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.010
So a major breach.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.580
Not as big as some,
but quite big.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.860
And so there was the cost to
the consumer of the monitoring

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.480
which they covered,
but also the cost

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.200
for whoever lost
-- identity loss.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.550
But also there was many, many
other costs to the company.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.830
So the Federal Trade Commission

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.750
in the U.S. has a very
large cyber security role,

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.600
and it derives from
fair trade practices.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:47.190
And so they -- And also
how you present yourself

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.420
to your customers,
whether you're truthful

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.220
in presenting yourself.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.260
So they've had dozens of
actions, some of which have been

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.300
that companies haven't been up
front about what they're doing

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.890
with data or what
cyber risks they have.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.720
But in this case there was a
theft of personal information,

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.780
and so the FTC sent a
request to Wyndham Worldwide

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.400
to provide information.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.410
Over several years -- So
Wyndham Worldwide provided

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.300
over 1,000 pages
of documentation.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.300
So it affected through
the burden

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:25.040
of answering the questions
the company operations.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.430
Ultimately FTC filed a
lawsuit which they settled.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:36.790
So just with the FTC a
large amount of costs,

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.810
but Wyndham at this point
isn't complete with the FTC.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.320
So the FTC now has oversight on
Wyndham's systems for 20 years.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.280
Wyndham has to provide reporting
annually and to the FTC

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.970
about how they're
providing cyber security

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.450
and how they know.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.840
But also Wyndham
ended up with lawsuits

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.230
from state attorney generals,

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.170
and a shareholder
[inaudible] lawsuit

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.990
which was ultimately dismissed,

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.880
but shareholders
asking the company,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.680
and the company wouldn't or
didn't, to sue executives

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.390
for not performing their cyber
security responsibilities.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:21.280
So Target, too, class
action settlement.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.050
Paying the banks also,
not just the card holders.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.030
Another one.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.940
This was -- Oh.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.700
The Home Depot shareholder
derived suit.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.500
So a number of very large costs

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.140
of the companies developing
a cyber security strategy,

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.090
but also developing
policies and procedures

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.650
to protect the customers,
to protect their employees,

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:49.950
protect their operations.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.370
But also more and more the risk

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.470
from the Federal
Trade Commission

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.300
and other government agencies

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.590
who have oversight
responsibility.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.860
So these agencies,
to some extent,

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.810
are driving cyber security
[inaudible] of our companies.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.870
Okay. So what are the
company's key assets,

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.170
and how does a company go

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.140
about developing a
cyber security program?

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.140
One of the best ways
I've seen --

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.170
A gentleman who's been
CISO at a major bank

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.470
and a major power company,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.680
and now at a major
pharmaceutical company,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.220
is to develop a consensus
amongst the executives

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.580
as to what the key assets
are within the company.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.280
Key information assets.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.150
So much different
in the power company

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.450
than in the pharmaceutical.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.270
The pharmaceutical company the
intellectual property as well

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.060
as the personal information,

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.540
the power company the
control systems and the

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.820
like as well as the financials.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.430
But develop a consensus
across the organization

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.520
as to what the key
information assets are,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.600
and what risks they
face, and then how to go

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.200
about protecting them, and what
budget dollars do they need.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:02.150
Another thing he also does is
have an external assessment

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.930
of the cyber security.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.970
And he's evolved it, and so
now he partners with companies

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:13.720
from other industries, has
someone come in to assess them

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.830
on a number of attributes,
and then does a comparison

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.130
across all the companies

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.190
and gives him leverage
with the board.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:25.810
But you can see some
of the assets here.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.040
A plane schematic
on he bottom right

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.890
which was actually
stolen by the Chinese.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.590
Upper left credit
card information,

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.350
and the bottom left
power company.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.510
So these are some
of the elements

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.850
that this company has
benchmarked against others.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:46.090
So a lot of it is
leadership and governance.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:50.080
So policies, the
organization, HR security.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.650
Some of it's technology,
cryptography,

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.080
communications security.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.760
And then some of
it is compliance

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.200
and incident management.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.180
One of the new ones that
many companies are taking

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.460
up partially post Target
is supplier relationships,

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.370
including many of the larger
companies here in Washington.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.090
So going back, reviewing
their existing contracts,

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.140
the ones with the largest
vendors that might place them

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.510
at most risk from
cyber security,

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.650
and where possible
renegotiating part of it.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.800
And setting up a process
for any new contract

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.030
if it exceeds some
threshold with cyber risk

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.860
that the CISO signs off on it.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.330
And then this is
how they organize.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.960
This is a 100,000 person
company quite distributed

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.260
around the world.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.850
But you can see it's not --
Strategy and architecture,

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.430
enterprise risk, privacy
incident response,

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.870
and third party are
the main parts.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.020
And then kind of interestingly,
and I think different

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.810
than many companies,
although there's more

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.140
and more doing it this
way, the actual day

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.400
to day technology part
of cyber security,

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.870
like managing firewalls and
alike, is done by the CIO,

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.920
the information technology
group.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.660
So this group, much
more strategic

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.630
and much more engaged
with the board.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.610
And it's what this gentleman
did at the very large bank

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.420
and the power company too.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.430
So I think this is a really
good approach at a company level

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.060
to how to go about it.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.940
Did anyone read the
Inspector General's report

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:28.040
on OPM, the OPM aftermath?

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:33.080
It actually reads like a roadmap
for the Chinese, unfortunately.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.070
But it talks about a lot
of these types of things.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.200
So the not having CISO, the
cyber security staff that was

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.220
that OPM not being very elevated
and being able to connect

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.460
with executives, not having
two factor authentication.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:54.890
So a lot of the things which are
good practices can go a long way

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.470
towards strengthening
cyber security.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:03.290
Okay. One of the more important
things, I think, but --

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:09.410
is leadership in cyber security,
and really elevating the role.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:13.050
Especially where it's possible
in large organizations.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.390
So we're working with
the cities and counties.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.860
We had a workshop for Virginia.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.160
And so many of the
Virginia cities

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.570
and counties are quite small,

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.800
and oftentimes don't have
a cyber security executive.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:31.610
And sometimes, too, don't
even have an IT staff person.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:36.100
So there's -- The size is
really, really important.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.270
But for the larger organizations
the leadership is integral.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.770
So in the U.S. itself it's
had a quite long focus

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:49.450
on elevating the role of CIO,
and this is international too.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.420
Many countries now have
national ICT plans,

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.950
and many countries
have either legislation

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.980
or policy requiring a CIO

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.900
in government ministries
or agencies.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.790
And some of the legislation
goes so far as to require CIO

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.970
and in private sector
companies like Japan's does.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.190
And we'll see this being
adopted in cyber security.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.800
So in the U.S. our first
act was in the late 1990s,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.430
the Clinger-Cohen Act
which required a CIO

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:20.750
in government agencies, and
also established the federal CIO

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.140
council for coordinating IT
across government agencies

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.700
on issues of commonality
such as cyber security,

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.120
enterprise architecture,
and human capacity building.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:37.460
Over the years the role
didn't necessarily turn

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:44.210
out as envisioned, and in some
agencies the CIO didn't have

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:48.950
budget authority or in some
agencies there's multiple CIOs

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:52.110
who didn't necessarily all
report up to the main CIO.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.290
So Commerce is a
good example of this.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:29:00.660
So Commerce, a wonderful
agency with this fantastic work

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.380
and multiple organizations
within it such as [inaudible]

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.050
and patent and trademark
and [inaudible].

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:12.110
Some of those receive their
budget through user fees,

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.730
and have some degree
of autonomy.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:20.850
So within Commerce the NOAA CIO
and the patent and trademark

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.170
over the years not
necessarily reporting

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.400
in to the Commerce CIO.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.150
So this being a way

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.230
to strengthen CIO
leadership in government.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:36.040
More and more organizations
and government agencies,

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.190
and this is worldwide
too, elevating the role

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.260
of chief information
security officer

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.470
to a peer level with CIO.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.080
It varies by industry,
and it varies by degree

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.080
of cyber security maturity.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.170
It varies by size
of the organization.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.110
So the gentleman from the
pharmaceutical company,

00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:01.550
he's a peer of the CIO and a
peer of the CFO, the CISO role.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:06.520
And state -- And county and
state government, it varies.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.010
In Arlington County the
CISO reports to the CIO,

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.160
and in other counties
that isn't so.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.210
There's more of a peer --

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:20.900
There can be a conflict that the
CIO oriented towards moving --

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.450
developing services quickly,
and customer service,

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.800
and product delivery,
the CISO for security.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.170
But it can work both ways,
but there can be a conflict.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.550
This is a project we did
through the International

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.130
Science Foundation.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:43.280
We interviewed executives
across the country, cyber and IT

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:49.600
as well as other executives, in
regard to the core competencies

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.200
for the most important
core competencies

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.960
for chief information
security officers.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.350
And talked to both government
and private sector and local,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.980
state, and national government.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.880
And we organized
them by perspectives.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.530
And, as you can see here
too, as with the CIO,

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:14.020
and as with the large company,
many of these are non technical.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:18.440
So leading large organizations,
building high performance teams,

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.790
compliance, communications
being at the top.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.090
One interesting thing.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:27.660
We had a question, "Do you
think technology knowledge is

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.060
as important or more
important than leadership?"

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:35.180
And leadership background
and communications.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:39.360
And the overwhelming answer
was that they are both

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.520
for CISO equally important.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.770
That some technology and
technology knowledge and ability

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:50.570
to communicate about technology
both to staff as well as boards

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.920
as well as leadership
being quite important.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.070
That was part of the report.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.550
So what are countries doing then
for cyber security strategy,

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:05.770
and what are the implications
for international relations?

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:11.520
According to ITU, about 75
countries now have cyber

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.930
security strategies
and policies,

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:22.180
although on their website some
of them are quite old or dated.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.020
But about 75 countries.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:30.120
About 90% of countries
have national ICT policies

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.420
and strategies.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.700
So a subset having
cyber security policies

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.690
and strategies.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:40.470
But mostly they follow along
and address some of the topics

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.770
of this one from Singapore.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:47.990
So Singapore is similar to
Estonia competing on IT.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:52.180
And oriented towards
being a smart society.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.880
So some of their major
initiatives are hardening

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.360
security, developing
the workforce,

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.910
working internationally
which we'll talk about,

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.600
and public outreach
and awareness.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.670
So many of the types of things
or a subset of the types

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:11.250
of things that we do here or
that are really important to us.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.990
Countries compete
on cyber security.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.100
So Korea has as an objective

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.180
of its industrial strategy
being a world leader in internet

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.450
of things, and developing
a vibrant Korean internet

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.070
of things, ecosystem.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:30.500
One of the pillars of that
strategy is IOT security.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.820
So becoming a leader, world
leader, in IOT security

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:38.780
as a means to become
a world leader in IOT.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.150
Here's kind of a --
It's really quite small,

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:46.580
but as with ICT national
plans, evolution of plans

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.960
and strategies over the
years, this is Singapore's,

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.490
but we've had something
similar here.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:57.280
So we have had an evolution of
national plans and strategies.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.060
One major difference
to highlight, I think,

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:04.660
is the difference in,
well, size obviously,

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.970
and national geography.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.590
But also the difference
in our approach

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:13.450
to government derives
somewhat from our size.

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:17.370
So we have the municipal,
the state, and the national.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:22.350
Much different than Singapore
which has one government.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:27.510
So here we have the national
approach with the roles of FBI,

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:31.630
DHS, and director of
national intelligence.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:36.080
There's state roles, and then
there's also the roles of local

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.850
and municipal government
in cyber security.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.810
And then those coming together.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:46.230
One other interesting aside on
the differences that we have.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.740
So the states.

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.590
Many of the electric companies

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:56.690
and water companies are
municipally owned, but also all

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.770
of them are licensed
through the state public

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.420
service commissions.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.460
So state public service
commissions are beginning

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:09.220
to take a role in cyber security
and overseeing the industries

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.570
and companies that
they regulate.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:12.870
But it's really kind

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.590
of remarkable how these public
service commissions differ

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.030
across the country both in
their makeup and how they come

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.080
to be, and in their mission.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.150
So in some states
they're appointed.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:26.970
In some states they're
elected statewide.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.510
In some states they're
elected in the regions.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.370
And in some states the
mission is real narrow,

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.740
and in Mississippi, for example,

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.240
the role of the public
service commission,

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:40.090
one of the prime roles, is to
foster economic development.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.630
So really very, very
different across the country

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.010
as they look to take
a cyber role.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.410
Connecticut now requires
annual reports

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.410
from the Connecticut
Public Service Commission,

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:54.790
from their companies that they
regulate in an annual meeting

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.140
with the service commission.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.580
Others are different stages.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.370
So, as I said, many
countries have policies.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.810
These are just three.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.470
The U.K. Chile.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.210
And on the left, Japan.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:17.840
A lot of commonality, but also
some differences in approach

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.150
and differences in
emphasis which we'll talk

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:24.480
about a little bit more when we
compare U.S. and China or talk

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.820
about the U.S/China
relationship.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:31.870
Just on the role of the CIO,
for example, so as I mentioned,

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:35.990
the Japanese law for CIO
requires private sector

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.800
companies to have them.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.460
About two years ago Korea

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.720
through legislation
started requiring CISOs,

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.320
chief information
security officers,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.170
in financial companies
over a certain size.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:52.250
So different than here, although
here in the U.S. now state

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:55.350
of New York requires CISOs

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.210
in financial service
companies over a certain size.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:02.650
So again regulation really
driving a lot of this.

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.100
ITU helping countries,
developing countries,

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.560
develop national cyber
security strategies.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.590
And here's the elements.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.000
Number one is similar to
private sector companies

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.940
and boards having engagements
and accountability by the board.

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.880
Having a coordinator.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.480
Having a focal point.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.740
Legal framework for
cyber security,

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.930
including cyber crime and trust.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.040
Incident response
for the country.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.430
Awareness and education.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.530
Building on public/private
partnerships.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.700
Skills and training
and cooperation.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.170
Singapore, for example, has one
other one that's not on this one

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.560
from IT which is innovation.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.970
So Singapore looking to compete
in the cyber security industry,

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:56.000
and wanting to be an
innovator in that.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.680
But so many of the
countries working

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.020
with ITU are taking
this approach.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.190
We had a Humphrey Fellow
visitor last year for six weeks

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:09.770
from Nigeria, from
OAU University.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.990
And I -- He was working
on a project.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.650
So Nigeria just recently
passed a cyber security act,

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.840
but their challenge, as
many developing countries,

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.070
they don't have the
institutional foundation

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.760
to implement something
like that readily.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.710
So the project he was working
on was to develop the --

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:31.010
strengthen the institution

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.990
so that they can actually
implement the act they have.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.960
And their university, also a
World Bank Center of Excellence

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.470
for cyber in West Africa.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:43.540
Okay. Some of the trends I
think, some are technology

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.830
and then some are
policy and international.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:53.290
One is the role of artificial
intelligence and big data.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:39:00.750
So the systems and the network
elements are generating millions

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:04.900
or actually billions
of data instances.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:10.980
It's impossible to hire enough
staff to look at all of these.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:16.400
So the path is artificial
intelligence and being able

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.600
to analyze a lot of the
cyber data computationally.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.690
Becoming less reliant on
analysts, and using analysts

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:26.850
for the really -- things
that need a lot of expertise.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:30.350
So the schools are --
have many cyber students,

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:33.870
but just demand is
much, much too great.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:37.740
Also too, for example, smaller
companies can't afford a

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.190
cyber analyst.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.040
Or smaller water companies.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.680
So automation being
really, really important

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.460
and a big part of
the path forward.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.840
Also on technology,
and I don't have it,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:55.170
but I think the interaction
of hardware and software,

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:58.730
like some of the companies
are working on such as Intel,

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.380
and [inaudible] with their
[inaudible] but many others too.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.780
Samsung. Building
part of the security

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.260
in to the hardware is part of --

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.160
an important part of
the path forward too.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.470
Another part is international
cooperation

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:17.670
at the multilateral
level, and we'll wrap

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.480
up with the bilateral level.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.740
So many fantastic
initiatives worldwide.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.590
The bottom right
highlights a challenge

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.760
of cyber security in general.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.170
So countries have
different perceptions

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:35.280
of what cyber security is
and what the internet is.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.570
Amongst each other, it varies
somewhat east and west,

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:42.220
somewhat developed
and developing,

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:47.680
some even amongst neighbors
much different perceptions.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.130
There's also differing
perceptions on governance

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.330
of the internet which
comes in to play too.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:56.840
The U.S. having a central
role since the start of it,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.830
but many countries --
And tying in to the view

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.130
of cyber security thinking

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.400
that the role should
be more distributed.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.940
This is a wonderful book
on the bottom right.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.950
So in Estonia there's a
NATO cyber security center

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:13.870
of excellence, and they put out
a first version of this manual.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:17.040
It's by academics,
and it's non binding.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.960
The first one was on cyber
war, but this is more on day

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.560
to day cyber operations and
things like sovereignty.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.940
And they go through issue
by issue, and they talk

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.650
about issues, whether there's
a consensus amongst all the

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:34.610
experts, including from the U.S.
and Russia and China and Europe

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.260
and South America
and Africa and Asia,

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.100
but also whether it's just
disagreement amongst the experts

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.060
and not a consensus.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:46.270
About 10 years ago or a little
bit longer, the ITU wanted --

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.830
The secretary of the ITU wanted

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:51.160
to undertake a cyber
security project amongst the

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.540
ITU membership.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:58.470
The ITU has done a lot more
on cyber since, but he wanted

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:02.120
to come up with a non
controversial project

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.050
that all the members
could participate in.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:09.120
And the only one that he
was able to get an agreement

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.580
that he thought he could
get a consensus on was

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:16.820
on pedophiles, online predators.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.330
So that was the one where there
was a consensus amongst all

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:24.170
countries that -- on
what it was and the risk.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.490
But it's not just NATO.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.410
So [inaudible] has an active
cyber program World Bank

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:32.780
funding, World Bank
centers of excellence.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.960
OECD is doing quite a lot.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.610
European Union, United Nations.

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:40.290
So the international
community quite active in it,

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.170
and part of it is
technology innovation,

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.010
but part of it is strengthening
the institutional capacity

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.550
of the countries.

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:52.890
Part of it too is security
by design so that software

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:58.990
and devices as they are taken
to the market are secure

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:00.730
and not at as much risk.

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.260
So part of the challenge of
this is differing motivations,

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.770
and who actually pays, and
economic disincentives.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:14.000
So if you're producing a device
and it's very low margin,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.210
and you need to get it in to
the market, and you're not going

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:20.780
to bear the cost of a cyber
security breach, for example,

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.160
if it's taken over
for a DDoS attack,

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.060
your motivation isn't
necessarily

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.900
in to putting a lot
of security on it.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.830
So aligning economic motivations

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:34.550
with the technology
development is a big case too.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.390
A better example
of that, I think,

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.150
is electronic medical records.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.170
It's similar economic incentive.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:44.330
So pretty much everyone
agrees there's a public good

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.370
if everyone has electronic --

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.390
a portable electronic
medical record.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:52.450
You're able to go from doctor to
doctor and hospital to hospital.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.930
But there's multiple
stakeholders

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:58.240
and there's not enough
incentive or motivation

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.480
for any one stakeholder
to fund it over the years.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.840
So not necessarily an
incentive for the hospitals.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:09.170
It's different now
with the government,

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:11.270
the government payment system.

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.080
But not incentive
for the hospitals.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.140
Insurance companies
have a motivation,

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:18.960
but can't carry the data
for having it implemented.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.980
The patients like it, but
are not necessarily going

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.400
to pay for it.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.860
And so that's part of the
backbone of why we haven't --

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.780
why we don't have it here.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:31.960
So our government, 2009, part
of the Affordable Care Act,

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:36.730
implemented that you would get
a bonus if you implemented them

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:40.070
on Medicare and Medicaid,
and over time a penalty.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:42.890
So the government using
positive and negative incentives

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.560
to try to drive behavior.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:51.230
But over time security
by design --

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.050
Multilateral security
agreements.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.910
So European Union, for example,
looking at digital Europe

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.410
and harmonizing some
of the approaches

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.160
to cyber across the countries.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.690
Really important initiative.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:08.630
And then lastly, bilateral ones.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:13.160
My point, though, and wrapping
up with this one, is not so much

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.850
to highlight the agreement.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.040
This was from 2015,
the two [inaudible],

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:22.180
but to highlight the
differences and point of view.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.460
So the agreement
itself was this.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:32.970
So this was right after the
-- The five, I believe it was.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:39.050
Chinese military were indicted
in Pennsylvania for hacking

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:42.950
in to industrial espionage for
Westinghouse and U.S. Steel.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:46.000
So shortly after the
indictment there was a meeting

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.810
between President
Obama and President Xi,

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.500
and they had this agreement.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.660
So timely coordination.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:56.050
Cooperating and remaining
consistent with national laws.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.970
Neither country's government
will support cyber theft

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.720
of IP, which was new.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.340
And both sides making
a common effort.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.900
But the background to this is

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.290
that historically there's
been differences in the view

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:12.480
of what espionage is
between the two countries.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.400
And also differences in the view

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.730
of how the internet
should be governed.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:21.100
So the Chinese view
historically has been espionage

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.290
under a broad umbrella,

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:25.570
and so industrial
espionage is just part

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.640
of overall national espionage.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:32.020
It's something a country does to
strengthen its national position

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.890
or national competitiveness.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:37.170
And so our view is a little
bit different historically,

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:42.910
that there's national
espionage that we do,

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.920
but that industrial
espionage is separate

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.410
and not sanctioned
internationally.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:54.330
So that's a very broad
divide between the two.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:47:01.980
And even within our definition
the OPM one may well have --

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.640
be considered espionage
under a U.S. view.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.260
But the industrial
ones of Westinghouse

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.350
and U.S. Steel are not.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:13.640
So this agreement to the
extent it is followed,

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:17.110
actually China agreeing
that IP may well --

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:19.990
type of espionage may
well be different.

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:23.640
So these types of
agreements have potential too.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.680
That's cyber security being part

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.800
of a real broad umbrella
internationally,

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.150
and part of international
relations.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:37.430
Ultimately, though, it's the
intersection of better systems

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:40.360
and better technology
and innovation

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.200
and cyber security along

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.210
with increased cyber security
leadership and governance,

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:50.220
policy and legislation,
which will come together

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:54.490
to make the world safer
from a cyber perspective.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.500
So I hope that was
somewhat interesting.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:01.430
And if anyone has any
questions, that would be great.

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.150
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Questions?

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:06.950
&gt;&gt; J.P. Auffret: Yes?

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:17.010
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:18.550
&gt;&gt; J.P. Auffret: so the --

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:22.600
With quantum computing
there's some risk

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:27.410
that our current encryption
approaches will become obsolete

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:28.900
quite quickly.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.070
Yeah. There is -- Yes.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:34.180
There is a view that
there's that risk,

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:40.790
and NIST has a program now for
developing encryption algorithms

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:44.200
that would work in a
quantum computing world.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:48.890
So the U.S. government is
concerned that as demonstrated

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:54.150
through the research they're
funding -- I think too --

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:58.730
This is from very far away.

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:04.650
That Chinese government seems
to be advancing quite rapidly

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.290
in quantum communications
with the satellite they have,

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.250
and quantum computing.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:13.960
And so I think probably from
our standpoint we would do well

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.820
with, you know, further
investment or focus on it.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.870
But it's an important
area, I think.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:22.170
Oh, yes.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:23.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a lot
of talk about a shortage

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.790
of qualified security
professionals

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:28.010
that [inaudible]
they can't afford

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:29.310
to pay them [inaudible] wages.

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:33.780
Are there some recommendations
that you have

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:38.840
for what [inaudible]
can do to invest better,

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.410
and more particularly
[inaudible] workforce?

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:42.710
&gt;&gt; J.P. Auffret: Oh.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:44.010
I think there's quite
a few things.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:51.200
I think part of it is external,
and then part of it's internal.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:57.450
So there's -- So the government
has some fantastic programs

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:03.400
working with the universities
to -- Well, foster --

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.240
enhance education, cyber
security education,

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.020
and also increase the
number of students going

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.100
in to cyber security both in
undergraduate and graduate

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.280
and increasingly K through 12.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:22.950
And so I think that the
universities are both training

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:25.030
and educating a fair number

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:27.540
of students I don't
think will ever be enough

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.270
because of the issue
with technology.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:33.320
But then I think it's
also somewhat difficult

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.210
to join the government.

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:37.140
So I think for students looking

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:42.100
to join the government there's
fantastic programs to --

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.300
for internships which
our students do.

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:50.020
Many of our students have a
challenge with the process,

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.300
although many of the
agencies are very helpful.

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.700
But the long process.

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:58.760
There's also the chicken and
egg issue with clearances

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.000
that can be a bit
of a challenge.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.720
And then one other thing
I've noticed in the very,

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:09.830
very large ones, agencies,
is that career pathing --

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:13.230
Some of the agencies are
fantastic on career pathing

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:17.070
and cyber, and some not so.

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:18.430
So I can give two examples.

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:21.510
Not the name of the
agency, but two examples.

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:23.500
So one a quite large agency.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:29.540
Does fantastic things, but they
-- And this is hard everywhere,

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:30.840
in private sector companies too.

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.410
Struggling a little
bit with technical

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:35.790
versus managerial career paths,

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:40.510
and how to keep somebody
challenged and interested

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:45.600
and on an advancing career
path in the technical field

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.750
who really loves it and
is really offering a lot.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:51.490
Or how someone can try
a managerial career path

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:52.790
and then go back.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:54.910
And so that's hard on a
consulting company too.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:56.550
So I think that's an example.

00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:02.550
And another company or agency,
and this is one of the ones

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:06.760
that does offensive
too, and cyber threat --

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:12.330
And so their part of the
issue is organizationally

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.020
where the cyber security
group put --

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.070
There's not much
career advancement.

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:20.130
And that the offensive
is working

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.680
with the more current
technologies.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.020
So everyone wants to grab
a take towards that too.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.250
So I think it's a little bit
working with the universities,

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:31.540
and then a little bit
to ease the way in,

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:37.370
and then a little bit to --
the career pathing issue.

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:39.360
What do you think?

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:46.350
I know there's a lot of
talk about opening up some

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:48.620
of the programs like
the [inaudible]

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.380
for [inaudible] two
year institutions

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.830
or even short term programs.

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:56.380
I don't know.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.750
&gt;&gt; J.P. Auffret: Well, the
CyberCorps one is fantastic,

00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:59.650
and I think connecting
more towards --

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.380
with the community
colleges would be great.

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.380
The National Science Foundation,
the core competency project

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:08.160
that we had, that was
a CyberCorps project.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.370
The community colleges,
they're training

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:14.080
and working with hands on.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:19.600
So I think also too
-- I think there's --

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.130
Well, many I've talked to
it's kind of mixed reviews

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:26.310
of [inaudible] and the
U.S. digital service,

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.460
but I think those types

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:34.980
of initiatives have potential
too for cyber security.

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:41.510
Yeah. So I think all those.

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:49.150
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:50.450
&gt;&gt; J.P. Auffret: Yeah.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:52.580
The FDA is quite active.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:58.790
Oh. It's cyber security
for medical devices.

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:01.500
The FDA is quite active in it.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:07.690
It's a hard topic, I
think, because part

00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:12.820
of with the approach
to approvals --

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:20.790
So if a device is similar,
it has a rapid approval

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:22.890
or an expedited approval path.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:25.670
But it's very difficult
to say that software

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:29.120
on one device is similar to
software on another device.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.640
But the FDA is looking
at enhanced regulation

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:37.380
of medical devices according
to the risk obviously.

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:41.580
And then also some testing
approach for medical devices

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.740
and medical device security.

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:48.790
And also increased guidance
on issues such as patching.

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:52.350
So I think all of those, but
it's a real challenging area,

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:56.950
the -- Everyone see some
of the examples in the news

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:58.430
over the last years or so

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:00.210
that got highlighted
with medical devices?

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:04.100
I think the one that had the
most news play was an infusion

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:10.240
pump, the drip, where it was
hacked and someone was able

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.220
to turn it on and off remotely.

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:16.010
They didn't do it,
but they demonstrated

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:17.610
that it was possible.

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:22.470
Actually, one of our masters
degree programs we have,

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:25.150
they have a capstone
class project.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:27.030
They did a medical
device project,

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:32.480
and they tested heart monitors.

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:36.430
They put it on themselves,
and were able to --

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.550
Some of them had no
security on them.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:40.930
They were able to monitor
someone's heart rate

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:43.460
from like 100 yards away.

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.190
So I think the manufacturers
are getting better,

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:47.800
but it's a big challenge.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.200
And it's a big challenge
for the hospitals too.

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.850
I think the hospitals are
going to drive a lot of it,

00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:54.270
and then one thing I
didn't mention is the role

00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:57.260
of insurance and
cyber insurance.

00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:02.690
So cyber insurance is
becoming more and more common.

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:11.190
And it's being driven partially
by boards to help manage risk.

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:13.920
It partially provides an
external party that comes in

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.540
and does underwriting
assessment in some manner.

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:22.550
So it helps you benchmark, but
I think it also has an impact

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:25.620
on medical device companies
who are selling medical devices

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:28.020
that could have a problem.

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:31.050
Federal Trade Commission
too has a very large role.

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:34.390
But it's a big issue.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.050
Oh, yes?

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:39.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I don't know that
I want to focus on [inaudible]

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:44.780
but it seems that cyber is an
area where [inaudible] ahead.

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:47.370
You can't afford to fall
behind if you invest more

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:52.240
and more resources in
just maintaining what you

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.120
already have.

00:56:54.120 --> 00:57:01.030
Is that -- Do you see
that having an effect

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:04.320
on rate of implementation?

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.990
Some countries may be
[inaudible] investments.

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.290
And then [inaudible].

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:09.590
&gt;&gt; J.P. Auffret: That's
an interesting question

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:11.160
because I think it
ties to the role of ICT

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.560
in a country and in society.

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:16.880
So I think every
country faces a risk.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:24.420
If -- As Japan is moving towards
society 5.0 and Singapore

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:28.670
and Estonia and us,
that countries

00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:32.770
who aren't ICT oriented
risk falling further

00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:34.590
and further behind and
becoming less competitive.

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:40.410
And so given that, and given
how important cyber security is,

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:42.680
I think it's imperative
for the countries

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:44.840
to be cyber security
oriented too.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.770
What holds them back,
though, is partially cost.

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:52.550
So a lot of the technologies
are very, very expensive,

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:53.870
and take some expertise.

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:59.600
So the countries
have a challenge both

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.770
with the new ICT they're doing,
but also in the cost and how

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:07.730
to go about the cyber security.

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:14.330
There's -- Through
-- ITU in Singapore.

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:16.920
There's a group who has a focus

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:23.400
on open source cyber
security tools.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.800
There's many, and they
don't do everything,

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.100
but they do some things, and --

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:31.190
But there's a challenge
of putting them together.

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:32.790
But there's that challenge too.

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:37.330
Many, many companies now have
30 or 40 technologies that --

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:39.930
sometimes which conflict.

00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:43.820
And so some of the research
now is in company initiatives

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.080
or using the phrase
orchestrating cyber security

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.570
technologies so they're
compatible.

00:58:52.510 --> 00:59:08.220
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.520
&gt;&gt; J.P. Auffret: Oh.

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.820
I have an opinion.

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.510
I don't think so.

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:20.550
I don't think there's
-- I don't think the --

00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:25.690
I don't think there would be the
national will that it would take

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:32.240
to actually do that, given how
we're organized and the role

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.020
of the private sector
and things like that.

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.840
So I don't think.

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.600
But it's a really
fascinating question.

00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:42.840
The electronic medical
record, the value of it is --

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:46.450
on the black market is much
higher than a credit card.

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:48.980
So credit card is
relatively low.

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.730
But medical record much,

00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:55.700
much higher because if you steal
someone's medical record it will

00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.850
be -- You can put
bills through on it.

00:59:57.850 --> 01:00:01.000
It will be six months
before it's caught.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.400
A credit card might be
stopped the next day,

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.220
but you can Medicaid
or Medicare fraud

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.690
or insurance fraud
six months or a year.

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:10.050
So it's much more valuable.

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:12.330
One kind of note on that.

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:16.250
In Virginia, 7 of the 10
largest hospitals have Epic.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:18.480
The Epic electronic
medical records system.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.140
But they're for the most
part on different versions.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:24.670
So they're not compatible
amongst each other.
