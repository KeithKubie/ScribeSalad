study human behavior and human
experience and how it relates to the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
experience and how it relates to the
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.840

as a member of a group or of a
collectivity you get a completely

collectivity you get a completely
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650
collectivity you get a completely
different perspective on that person and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
different perspective on that person and
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.990

that you cannot see if you just study
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.139
that you cannot see if you just study
individuals but that you must study

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
individuals but that you must study
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.090

extremities had been cut off and
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.760
extremities had been cut off and
reattached these extremities and I used

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770
reattached these extremities and I used
 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.320
reattached these extremities and I used
to cut class my first year of medical

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330
to cut class my first year of medical
 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.300

Boston and I did this for quite a while
and eventually as we would operate on

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150
and eventually as we would operate on
 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.120
and eventually as we would operate on
these kids they were primarily kids one

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130
these kids they were primarily kids one
 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.880

after another day after day I came to

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
after another day after day I came to
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.200
after another day after day I came to
the realization that the kind of

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210
the realization that the kind of
 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.420
the realization that the kind of
healthcare that I wanted to practice was

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430
healthcare that I wanted to practice was
 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.040
healthcare that I wanted to practice was
not the kind that took care of people

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050
not the kind that took care of people
 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.170
not the kind that took care of people
one at a time but rather the kind that

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180
one at a time but rather the kind that
 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.670
one at a time but rather the kind that
tried to take care of whole populations

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680
tried to take care of whole populations
 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.220
tried to take care of whole populations
of people I mean I wanted to understand

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230
of people I mean I wanted to understand
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.620
of people I mean I wanted to understand
why do groups of people become sick not

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630
why do groups of people become sick not
 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.360
why do groups of people become sick not
just why do individuals become sick and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370
just why do individuals become sick and
 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.910
just why do individuals become sick and
how can we make groups become well not

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920
how can we make groups become well not
 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.890
how can we make groups become well not
just individuals become well one at a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900
just individuals become well one at a
 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.080
just individuals become well one at a
time and part of this was prompted by my

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090
time and part of this was prompted by my
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.520
time and part of this was prompted by my
realization that I was running around

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530
realization that I was running around
 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.580
realization that I was running around
putting my fingers in the dike one hole

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590
putting my fingers in the dike one hole
 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.980
putting my fingers in the dike one hole
after another was springing water and we

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990
after another was springing water and we
 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.450
after another was springing water and we
were running around all of us trying to

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460
were running around all of us trying to
 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.580
were running around all of us trying to
plug these holes and I was interested in

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590
plug these holes and I was interested in
 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.040
plug these holes and I was interested in
how can we make a better dike how can we

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050
how can we make a better dike how can we
 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.200
how can we make a better dike how can we
make a situation in which fewer people

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210
make a situation in which fewer people
 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.450
make a situation in which fewer people
become sick to begin with in which we

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460
become sick to begin with in which we
 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.150
become sick to begin with in which we
spring fewer holes to begin with in the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160
spring fewer holes to begin with in the
 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.910
spring fewer holes to begin with in the
dike as it were and in fact I began to

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920
dike as it were and in fact I began to
 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.830
dike as it were and in fact I began to
ask what I came eventually to see as

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840
ask what I came eventually to see as
 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.770
ask what I came eventually to see as
sociological questions about the origins

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780
sociological questions about the origins
 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.440
sociological questions about the origins
of illness and disease and suffering and

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450
of illness and disease and suffering and
 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.870
of illness and disease and suffering and
death in our society and I wanted to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880
death in our society and I wanted to
 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.220
death in our society and I wanted to
understand how we could have a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230
understand how we could have a
 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.320
understand how we could have a
sociological response a collective

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330
sociological response a collective
 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.390

epidemic beginning a few years ago maybe
 

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.440
epidemic beginning a few years ago maybe
10 or 20 years ago it had become

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:31.450
10 or 20 years ago it had become
 

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.390
10 or 20 years ago it had become
fashionable to speak about the obesity

fashionable to speak about the obesity
 

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.120
fashionable to speak about the obesity
epidemic and it was clear that obesity

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.130
epidemic and it was clear that obesity
 

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.830
epidemic and it was clear that obesity
was epidemic in one meaning of the word

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840
was epidemic in one meaning of the word
 

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.299
was epidemic in one meaning of the word
meaning that there's more of it than

meaning that there's more of it than
 

00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:41.370
meaning that there's more of it than
there was before for example just in the

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:41.380
there was before for example just in the
 

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.990
there was before for example just in the
last 10 years the prevalence of obesity

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000
last 10 years the prevalence of obesity
 

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.049
last 10 years the prevalence of obesity
has gone from about 20% to about 30% and

00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:46.059
has gone from about 20% to about 30% and
 

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:48.180
has gone from about 20% to about 30% and
fully 2/3 of Americans are now

fully 2/3 of Americans are now
 

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.299
fully 2/3 of Americans are now
overweight or obese so something is

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:51.309
overweight or obese so something is
 

00:19:51.309 --> 00:19:53.190
overweight or obese so something is
going on that has given rise to an

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200
going on that has given rise to an
 

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.130
going on that has given rise to an
increasing amount of obesity and there

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:56.140
increasing amount of obesity and there
 

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.049
increasing amount of obesity and there
are a number of structural factors that

00:19:58.049 --> 00:19:58.059
are a number of structural factors that
 

00:19:58.059 --> 00:20:00.240
are a number of structural factors that
have been suggested as causing the

have been suggested as causing the
 

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.130
have been suggested as causing the
obesity epidemic because we don't really

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:02.140
obesity epidemic because we don't really
 

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.180
obesity epidemic because we don't really
believe that there's something

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:03.190
believe that there's something
 

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.279
believe that there's something
biological going on here even though the

much over the last 30 years so something

00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:13.299
much over the last 30 years so something

social something else must be going on

to help explain why obesity has been

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679
to help explain why obesity has been
 

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:19.980
to help explain why obesity has been
rising so much and people have offered a

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:19.990
rising so much and people have offered a
 

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.659
rising so much and people have offered a
number of structural explanations

00:20:21.659 --> 00:20:21.669
number of structural explanations
 

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:23.580

food food is cheaper than it used to be
so by basic economics you're going to

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:27.220

kinds of explanations for the obesity
 

00:20:58.929 --> 00:21:01.440
kinds of explanations for the obesity
epidemic but we wondered whether we

epidemic but we wondered whether we

epidemic but we wondered whether we
could add an explanation whether we

could add an explanation whether we
 

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.000
could add an explanation whether we

think about obesity and the epidemic of

determining individual's likelihood of
 

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.840
determining individual's likelihood of
killing themselves could something

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:38.850
killing themselves could something
 

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.730

individuals changing their body size so

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:44.250
individuals changing their body size so
 

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.860
individuals changing their body size so
to the extent that obesity is a product

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:45.870
to the extent that obesity is a product
 

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.660
to the extent that obesity is a product
of personal choices and voluntary

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:47.670
of personal choices and voluntary
 

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.700
of personal choices and voluntary
behaviors the fact that people are

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:49.710
behaviors the fact that people are
 

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.530
behaviors the fact that people are
embedded in social networks and are

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:51.540
embedded in social networks and are
 

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.910
embedded in social networks and are
influenced by the appearance and

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:52.920
influenced by the appearance and
 

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.460
influenced by the appearance and
behaviors of those around them led us to

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:55.470
behaviors of those around them led us to
 

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.440
behaviors of those around them led us to
suppose that it might be possible to

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:57.450
suppose that it might be possible to
 

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.480
suppose that it might be possible to
find evidence of the spread of obesity

00:21:59.480 --> 00:21:59.490
find evidence of the spread of obesity
 

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.000
find evidence of the spread of obesity
within social networks so we needed a

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.010
within social networks so we needed a
 

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.550
within social networks so we needed a
special kind of data to do this and this

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:04.560
special kind of data to do this and this
 

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.370
special kind of data to do this and this

done an experiment in high school in

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:39.350
done an experiment in high school in
 

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.080
done an experiment in high school in
which you took a water table and you

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.090
which you took a water table and you
 

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.029
which you took a water table and you
dropped a pebble on the water and then

00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039
dropped a pebble on the water and then
 

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:45.190
dropped a pebble on the water and then
you had these waves that emerge from

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200
you had these waves that emerge from
 

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.110
you had these waves that emerge from
where the pebble hit the water and these

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120
where the pebble hit the water and these
 

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.250
where the pebble hit the water and these
waves would hit the perimeter of the

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:48.260
waves would hit the perimeter of the
 

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.230
waves would hit the perimeter of the
table and bounce back and if you did it

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240
table and bounce back and if you did it
 

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.789
table and bounce back and if you did it
just right you would get a standing wave

00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799
just right you would get a standing wave
 

00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:54.220
just right you would get a standing wave
on the surface of the water and if you

on the surface of the water and if you
 

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.450
on the surface of the water and if you
didn't do that experiment you probably

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:55.460
didn't do that experiment you probably
 

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.919
didn't do that experiment you probably
had another experience as a kid which

00:23:56.919 --> 00:23:56.929
had another experience as a kid which
 

00:23:56.929 --> 00:23:59.110
had another experience as a kid which
was sloshing around in your bathtub and

00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120
was sloshing around in your bathtub and
 

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.310
was sloshing around in your bathtub and
you probably remember that if you

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320
you probably remember that if you
 

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.440
you probably remember that if you
sloshed just right in your bathtub you

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:02.450
sloshed just right in your bathtub you
 

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.180
sloshed just right in your bathtub you
can get your body into sink with a wave

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:04.190
can get your body into sink with a wave
 

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.740
can get your body into sink with a wave
and get a big wave that'll come out of

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:05.750
and get a big wave that'll come out of
 

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.930
and get a big wave that'll come out of
the bathtub and splash onto the floor

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:07.940
the bathtub and splash onto the floor
 

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.000
the bathtub and splash onto the floor
and make a big mess and that's a kind of

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.010
and make a big mess and that's a kind of
 

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.370
and make a big mess and that's a kind of
a standing wave as well and what we

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:12.380
a standing wave as well and what we
 

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.659
a standing wave as well and what we
thought we'd be able to do would be to

00:24:13.659 --> 00:24:13.669
thought we'd be able to do would be to
 

00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:16.060
thought we'd be able to do would be to
see waves of obesity within the social

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:16.070
see waves of obesity within the social
 

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.190
see waves of obesity within the social
network because you can imagine networks

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200
network because you can imagine networks
 

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.860
network because you can imagine networks
as a kind of social topological surface

that it might be possible to see waves

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:24.740
that it might be possible to see waves
 

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.649
that it might be possible to see waves
within this network so that is I gained

00:24:26.649 --> 00:24:26.659
within this network so that is I gained
 

00:24:26.659 --> 00:24:27.970
within this network so that is I gained
weight it makes my friends gain weight

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:27.980
weight it makes my friends gain weight
 

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.169
weight it makes my friends gain weight
and as my friends gain weight it makes

00:24:29.169 --> 00:24:29.179
and as my friends gain weight it makes
 

00:24:29.179 --> 00:24:30.789
and as my friends gain weight it makes
their friends gain weight and though and

00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799
their friends gain weight and though and
 

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:32.590
their friends gain weight and though and
you literally could get a wave within

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600
you literally could get a wave within
 

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.029
you literally could get a wave within
the surface so this little video

00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039
the surface so this little video
 

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:36.250
the surface so this little video
animation about to show you was both the

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:36.260
animation about to show you was both the
 

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.289
animation about to show you was both the
most exciting and the most depressing

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:38.299
most exciting and the most depressing
 

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:42.580
most exciting and the most depressing
moment of my scientific career ok so

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:42.590
moment of my scientific career ok so
 

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.560
moment of my scientific career ok so
again every dot is a person every line

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:44.570
again every dot is a person every line
 

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.810
again every dot is a person every line
between them is a relationship again we

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:46.820
between them is a relationship again we
 

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.640
between them is a relationship again we
make the dot size proportional to

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:48.650
make the dot size proportional to
 

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.590

you can think of human beings in this

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:12.630
you can think of human beings in this
 

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.960
you can think of human beings in this
way as having these kinds of properties

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:14.970
way as having these kinds of properties
 

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.210
way as having these kinds of properties
these emergent properties because we

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:17.220
these emergent properties because we
 

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.310
these emergent properties because we
partake of this bigger hole because

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320
partake of this bigger hole because
 

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.020
partake of this bigger hole because
we're a part of this other living thing

we're a part of this other living thing
you can think of us as being constituent

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:23.310
you can think of us as being constituent

point Durkheim was making earlier about

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:29.670
point Durkheim was making earlier about
 

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.540

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.400
 
so now what might be some possible

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:40.410
so now what might be some possible
 

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.590
so now what might be some possible
mechanisms or explanations of the spread

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600
mechanisms or explanations of the spread
 

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.540
mechanisms or explanations of the spread
of obesity so here we might think of the

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:44.550
of obesity so here we might think of the
 

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.610
of obesity so here we might think of the
altar that's the other person and the

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620
altar that's the other person and the
 

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.340
altar that's the other person and the
ego that's you so one possibility is

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:49.350
ego that's you so one possibility is
 

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.810
ego that's you so one possibility is
that the alters appearance or behavior

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:50.820
that the alters appearance or behavior
 

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.210
that the alters appearance or behavior
could change the egos appearance or

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220
could change the egos appearance or
 

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.160
could change the egos appearance or
behavior so for example your friends say

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:55.170
behavior so for example your friends say

it's a terrible combination but your

it's a terrible combination but your
friends suggested it so you copy your

friends suggested it so you copy your
 

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.390
friends suggested it so you copy your
friends behavior and you gain weight as

that you've assumed a second possibility
is that the alters appearance or

natural social networks are very
 

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.270
natural social networks are very
different so for example if you look at

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:41.280
different so for example if you look at
 

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.799
different so for example if you look at
this network you can see that different

00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:42.809
this network you can see that different
 

00:31:42.809 --> 00:31:44.630

for example individuals B and D so B has
 

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.409
for example individuals B and D so B has
four connections and D has six

so you can think of networks as a kind

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620
so you can think of networks as a kind

carbon atoms assembled and connected
another way so you connect the carbon

00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:15.859
another way so you connect the carbon
 

00:34:15.859 --> 00:34:17.619

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:23.990
which is hard and clear and there are
 

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:25.750
which is hard and clear and there are
two key intellectual ideas from this

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760
two key intellectual ideas from this
 

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.540
two key intellectual ideas from this
observation first these properties of

observation first these properties of
 

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.070
observation first these properties of
softness and darkness and hardness and

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:30.080
softness and darkness and hardness and
 

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.560
softness and darkness and hardness and
clearness do not in here in the carbon

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:32.570
clearness do not in here in the carbon
 

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.389
clearness do not in here in the carbon
atoms there are not properties of the

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399
atoms there are not properties of the
 

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.099

carbon atoms their properties of the
 

00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:39.369
carbon atoms their properties of the
collection of carbon atoms second which

00:34:39.369 --> 00:34:39.379
collection of carbon atoms second which
 

00:34:39.379 --> 00:34:41.470
collection of carbon atoms second which
properties you get depends on how you

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480
properties you get depends on how you
 

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.030
properties you get depends on how you
connect the carbon atoms to each other

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040
connect the carbon atoms to each other
 

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.070
connect the carbon atoms to each other
and similarly the pattern of our

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:45.080

it's the ties between people that make

00:34:51.099 --> 00:34:51.109
it's the ties between people that make
 

00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:52.659
it's the ties between people that make
the whole greater than the sum of its

new properties emerge because of the
 

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.670
new properties emerge because of the

the ties between people and not
 

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.849
the ties between people and not
necessarily because of the people

00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:00.859
necessarily because of the people
 

00:35:00.859 --> 00:35:03.370
necessarily because of the people
themselves and in fact our experience of

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:03.380
themselves and in fact our experience of
 

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.829

structure of the social network ties

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:07.790
structure of the social network ties
 

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.910
structure of the social network ties
around us and this is like the

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920
around us and this is like the
 

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.290
around us and this is like the
artificial networks we saw at the

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:11.300
artificial networks we saw at the
 

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.570
artificial networks we saw at the
beginning of the bucket brigade and the

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:13.580
beginning of the bucket brigade and the
 

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.700
beginning of the bucket brigade and the
telephone tree you take human beings and

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:15.710
telephone tree you take human beings and
 

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.290
telephone tree you take human beings and
you assemble them one way you get one

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:17.300
you assemble them one way you get one
 

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.849
you assemble them one way you get one
set of properties you assemble them

00:35:18.849 --> 00:35:18.859
set of properties you assemble them
 

00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:20.320
set of properties you assemble them
another way you get a different set of

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:20.330
another way you get a different set of
 

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:26.150
another way you get a different set of
properties just like the carbon example

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160
 
 

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.890
 
so here's a more specific human example

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:28.900
so here's a more specific human example
 

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.780
so here's a more specific human example
of how social network structure can

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:30.790
of how social network structure can
 

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.880
of how social network structure can
affect the Constituent individuals this

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:32.890
affect the Constituent individuals this
 

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:34.650
affect the Constituent individuals this

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.720
a sociologist at Northwestern University
he became very interested in Broadway

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:39.730
he became very interested in Broadway
 

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.820
he became very interested in Broadway
musicals and why some Broadway musicals

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:41.830
musicals and why some Broadway musicals
 

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:43.740
musicals and why some Broadway musicals
are big success and other Broadway

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:43.750
are big success and other Broadway
 

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.200
are big success and other Broadway
musicals are a total disaster and what

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:46.210
musicals are a total disaster and what
 

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.850
musicals are a total disaster and what
he did is he put together a sample of

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:47.860
he did is he put together a sample of
 

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.770
he did is he put together a sample of
three over 300 Broadway musical

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:49.780
three over 300 Broadway musical
 

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.870
three over 300 Broadway musical
production companies and he looked at

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880
production companies and he looked at
 

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.880
production companies and he looked at
the structure of the of the production

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:53.890
the structure of the of the production
 

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.650
the structure of the of the production
company the network structure and

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:55.660
company the network structure and
 

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.570
company the network structure and
assessed how was associated with the

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:57.580
assessed how was associated with the
 

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.790
assessed how was associated with the
financial success and the critical

00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800
financial success and the critical
 

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.190
financial success and the critical
acclaim of the Broadway shows that those

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.200
acclaim of the Broadway shows that those
 

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.770

images of how the networks might be

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640
images of how the networks might be
 

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.100
images of how the networks might be
assembled you see that there's a central

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:08.110
assembled you see that there's a central
 

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.570

ten possible connections and in the

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:16.180
ten possible connections and in the
 

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.670
ten possible connections and in the
cartoon you see there none of those

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680
cartoon you see there none of those
 

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.500
cartoon you see there none of those
connections zero of ten of the ties are

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:19.510
connections zero of ten of the ties are
 

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.120
connections zero of ten of the ties are
present and we would say that there's

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.130
present and we would say that there's
 

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:23.670
present and we would say that there's
zero percent density in this network or

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680
zero percent density in this network or
 

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.560
zero percent density in this network or
you might see that the all ten of the

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:25.570
you might see that the all ten of the
 

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:27.810
you might see that the all ten of the
ties are present so you have 10 out of

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:27.820
ties are present so you have 10 out of
 

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.150
ties are present so you have 10 out of
10 100 percent density and densities

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160
10 100 percent density and densities
 

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.740
10 100 percent density and densities
sort of like transitivity that we were

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:31.750
sort of like transitivity that we were
 

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.930
sort of like transitivity that we were
talking about earlier or four of the ten

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:33.940
talking about earlier or four of the ten
 

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.120
talking about earlier or four of the ten
ties are present so you have 40 percent

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:36.130
ties are present so you have 40 percent
 

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.160
ties are present so you have 40 percent
density and what hootsie did was is he

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:38.170
density and what hootsie did was is he
 

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.380
density and what hootsie did was is he
plotted on the x-axis the density of the

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:40.390
plotted on the x-axis the density of the
 

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.090
plotted on the x-axis the density of the
Broadway musical production company and

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:42.100
Broadway musical production company and
 

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.820
Broadway musical production company and
on the y-axis how successful the

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:44.830
on the y-axis how successful the
 

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.800
on the y-axis how successful the
Broadway musical was how much money did

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:46.810
Broadway musical was how much money did
 

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.660
Broadway musical was how much money did
it make and how many favorable reviews

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:48.670
it make and how many favorable reviews
 

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.370
it make and how many favorable reviews
did it get and as you see by the

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:50.380
did it get and as you see by the
 

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.650
did it get and as you see by the
parabolic shape on the Left if you have

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:52.660
parabolic shape on the Left if you have
 

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.090
parabolic shape on the Left if you have
a network in which nobody knew each

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:54.100
a network in which nobody knew each
 

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.160
a network in which nobody knew each
other from before the show was a flop

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:56.170
other from before the show was a flop
 

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:58.560
other from before the show was a flop
and at the other extreme if you see that

00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:58.570
and at the other extreme if you see that
 

00:36:58.570 --> 00:36:59.730
and at the other extreme if you see that
everybody knew each other from before

00:36:59.730 --> 00:36:59.740
everybody knew each other from before
 

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.610
everybody knew each other from before
the show was a flop but in the middle if

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:02.620
the show was a flop but in the middle if
 

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.870
the show was a flop but in the middle if
some of the people knew each other from

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880
some of the people knew each other from
 

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.700
some of the people knew each other from
before and some of the people didn't

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:05.710
before and some of the people didn't
 

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.230
before and some of the people didn't
know each other from before the show was

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240
know each other from before the show was
 

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.110
know each other from before the show was
a big success so it seems to matter here

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:10.120
a big success so it seems to matter here
 

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.760
a big success so it seems to matter here
is it's not just the individuals putting

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:11.770
is it's not just the individuals putting
 

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.010
is it's not just the individuals putting
on the show it's the structure of the

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.020
on the show it's the structure of the
 

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.900
on the show it's the structure of the
network that affects the likely success

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:15.910
network that affects the likely success
 

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.450
network that affects the likely success
of the show and you see has gone on to

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:18.460
of the show and you see has gone on to
 

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.520
of the show and you see has gone on to
show that there's similar work or

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:20.530
show that there's similar work or
 

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.960
show that there's similar work or
similar findings with respect to

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:21.970
similar findings with respect to
 

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:23.760
similar findings with respect to
scientific collaborations and other

scientific collaborations and other
 

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:26.850

so for example think about this you can

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780
so for example think about this you can
 

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.870
so for example think about this you can
have a forest you can invest skill and

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880
have a forest you can invest skill and
 

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.760
have a forest you can invest skill and
effort you can clear the forest and you

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:13.770
effort you can clear the forest and you
 

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.460
effort you can clear the forest and you
can make a farm and this farm is a stock

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:16.470
can make a farm and this farm is a stock
 

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.770
can make a farm and this farm is a stock
of capital it's more productive at least

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.780
of capital it's more productive at least
 

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.569

in terms of fruits and vegetables and

00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579
in terms of fruits and vegetables and
 

00:41:20.579 --> 00:41:22.940
in terms of fruits and vegetables and
grains then the forest was and by

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:22.950
grains then the forest was and by
 

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.799
grains then the forest was and by
investing skill and effort and working

00:41:24.799 --> 00:41:24.809
investing skill and effort and working
 

00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:27.530
investing skill and effort and working
upon the land and changing the land you

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:27.540
upon the land and changing the land you
 

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.120
upon the land and changing the land you
have created a reservoir of wealth

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.130

idea you can take this tree you can

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:43.170
idea you can take this tree you can
 

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.539
idea you can take this tree you can
invest skill and effort and you can

00:41:44.539 --> 00:41:44.549
invest skill and effort and you can
 

00:41:44.549 --> 00:41:46.339
invest skill and effort and you can
transmute the substance of the tree and

00:41:46.339 --> 00:41:46.349
transmute the substance of the tree and
 

00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:48.680
transmute the substance of the tree and
mill it into lumber and the lumber is

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:48.690
mill it into lumber and the lumber is
 

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.030
mill it into lumber and the lumber is
more valuable than the tree you can

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040
more valuable than the tree you can
 

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.680
more valuable than the tree you can
invest still more skill and effort and

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:51.690
invest still more skill and effort and
 

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.990
invest still more skill and effort and
convert the lumber into a violin which

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000

is more valuable than

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:54.890
is more valuable than
 

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.500
is more valuable than
the tree because it reflects this

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:56.510
the tree because it reflects this
 

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.730
the tree because it reflects this
additional investment of skill and

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:57.740
additional investment of skill and
 

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.950
additional investment of skill and
effort and because in having changed the
