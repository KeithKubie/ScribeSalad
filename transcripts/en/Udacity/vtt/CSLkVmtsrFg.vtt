00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's see. How do we want to do this?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, I'm looking at the side opposite this 42 degree angle.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I'm going to be comparing it to my known side of the 1000 meters.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You also could've compared it to the x, but I'm going to do it this way.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, opposite and hypotenuse--it looks like I'm going to need sine. Okay.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So sine of 42 degrees I know that equals 0.669.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But I also know that it must equal the opposite over the hypotenuse.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's what the sine is and that equals y over 1000.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, I can multiply both sides by 1000 just like I did before

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to get that y = 669 meters.  Pretty cool.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now we're really getting to the point where we can start to calculate the circumference of the earth.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Before we move any further, there's one more tool I think we should learn.
