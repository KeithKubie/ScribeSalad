&gt;&gt;I'm Jeff Jarvis.
I blog at buzzmachine.com and teach journalism

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.530
at CUNY.
And my part of the world, what we need to

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.019
do to change the world for
innovation, is to get in entrepreneurship.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.360
I think the future is entrepreneurial more
than institutional.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.640
The institutions, which is pretty much here
at Davos, are the ones that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.619
are disrupted.
We need to bring together the disruptors and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.470
to find ways to support
them.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.800
I teach entrepreneurial journalism at CUNY,
which is not an oxymoron.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.850
And I think we have to bring entrepreneurship
to many industries and to

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.279
enable the future to be built.
It's going to be painful but let's get there

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.419
faster than later.
