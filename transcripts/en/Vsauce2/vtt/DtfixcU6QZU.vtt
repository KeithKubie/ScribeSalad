00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.600
This 3D printer has the ability to print fruit.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.180
And a laser device can detect the presence
of alcohol vapors in passing cars then send

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.150
a photo to police officers waiting down the
road.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.089
Vsauce! Kevin Here.... this is Mind Blow.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:24.179
Supernumerary robotic limbs will give you
extra arms. Researchers at MIT are designing

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.259
them to help with tasks that may be otherwise
impossible such as screwing in objects over

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.610
head or opening a door while having your hands
full. They're also working on prototypes that

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.570
can be worn around the waist and on making
the arms intuitive to movements to predict

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.560
what the wearer needs help with.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.490
Keplar 10c is a rocky mega Earth that weighs
17 times more than our planet and this new

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.280
discovery means potentially habitable planets
could be closer than we thought.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.390
SynTouch gives prosthetic hands the ability
to mimic human fingertips. The tactile sensors

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.040
can distinguish between different objects
and surface textures and the hand can also

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.579
sense the pressure needed to pick up an object
without crushing or damaging it. The fingertips

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.450
consist of a rigid core surrounded by an elastic
liquid-filled skin.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.340
The Infinadeck is an omnidirectional treadmill
designed to work in virtual realities. The

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.840
user can walk in any direction infinitely
and they're hoping to use this for applications

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.219
ranging from gaming and law enforcement training
to physical fitness.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.420
Researchers at MIT are creating a camouflage
generator that could eventually lead to digital

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.229
invisibility cloaks. The algorithm analyzes
multiple photos of a scene taken from different

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.179
angles and makes a camouflage image to cover
eyesores like electrical boxes, air conditioners,

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.439
or portable toilets. But they still have a
ways to go in order to account for changes

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.409
in lighting.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.020
The CityHome can make a 200 square foot home
feel three times bigger. The transformable

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.859
gesture-controlled multipurpose unit can become
a bed, a desk, and a dining table. And can

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:05.189
be easily moved doubling the size of your
living room, bathroom or kitchen. But no word

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.759
yet on when this will be available to the
public.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.180
This newly discovered fish dwells in cave
streams in Southern Indiana and has no eyes

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.170
but does have an anus behind its head.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.040
Researchers at Rice University have developed
a method of killing or damaging cancer cells

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.400
by using gold nanoparticles. After the use
of some chemotherapy the gold nanoparticles

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.590
that target specific cancer cells are introduced.
They're stored just beneath the protective

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.530
outer membrane of the cancer cell when a tiny
laser is shone on the cells. Since the gold

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.950
can't absorb that wavelength of light it creates
tiny bubbles that explode and destroy the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.970
cancer cell.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.640
Betabrand has created a reflective button
down shirt that makes it easier for bicyclists

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.650
and pedestrians to be seen by motorists. Reflective
yarns are woven into the design and the idea

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.580
is to create fashionable clothing that can
be worn during the day but safe at night.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.900
New York City is preparing for a massive storm
by creating an 8 mile long stretch of dikes

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.980
and a 16 foot high barrier that will have
varying functions for the city during non

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.890
storm times. Including aquariums, parks, and
public art space. And a total of $920 million

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.150
dollars was recently awarded for various storm
proofing efforts.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.040
This robot from Korea can run 46 kilometers
per hour and was inspired by velociraptors...

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.470
so yeah.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.210
The Genneo is a portable generator that captures
energy from your movements and converts it

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.210
into power for your electronic devices. Every
five hours of just carrying the Genneo provides

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.760
an hour of talk time and shaking the device
multiplies the rate of charging by 20. They

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.610
can be pre charged before you leave and are
kept charged by your movements.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.340
Finally Octopuses of the Night is an underwater
film shot by Dustin Adamson during his night

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.340
dives in 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.350
the Philippines.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.350
I'm going to leave you with pizza making robots...
and as always... thanks for watching.
