00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.140
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.640
"Gremlins"!

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.520
"Jaws"!

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.340
"Beetlejuice"!

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.380
"Watership Down"!

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.940
"Raiders of the Lost Ark"!

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.880
[hesitant]
"Frozen",

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.940
"Inside Out",

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.120
"Kung-Fu Panda",

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.340
"The Lego Movie",

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.780
"Mr. Magoo"...

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.840
What do all these movies have in common?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.980
They're all, strangely enough, rated PG.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.940
At least, that's what the always logical 
Motion Picture Association of America says.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.740
For those who somehow don't know, 
America has five ratings for films:

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.980
"G", for General Audiences of all ages;

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.220
"PG", for Parental Guidance suggested;

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.180
"PG-13", for some material might be inappropriate for children under 13;

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.160
"R" for Restricted- anyone under 17 needs an adult;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.560
and "NC-17" for you must be 17 to watch.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.000
It doesn't sound like a bad system, except when you ask the question:

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.580
"How is this...

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.060
[screaming]

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.700
... in the same league as this?"

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.120
"Hello, did I wake you?"

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.240
"Do you have to play that?"

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.440
"Well, I have to practice."

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.000
Or, the bigger question:

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.600
"Why is this movie that 
obviously doesn't need parental guidance

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.640
suggesting it, when it seems identical to another movie that doesn't suggest it?"

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.480
They're even made by the same company.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.780
Well, to best understand, it's probably best to look at 
the history of the rating system.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.540
You see, years ago, there was really just only three ratings:

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.400
G, PG, and R.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.400
And everything else was just porn.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.880
But, if you had one of these ratings, you're not porn,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.220
and you can be shown in the majority of theaters.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.840
That mostly made sense;

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.480
one was acceptable for most people,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.860
one might be a little iffy for some,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.660
and one was clearly just for adults.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.720
Because of this, the ratings were a little bit more relaxed than you may think of them today.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.400
Films like "Planet of the Apes", "The Haunting", and "True Grit"

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.520
are all movies that no one in their right mind would've called G nowadays.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.040
With several swear words, off-screen violence,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.840
on-screen violence, tons of deaths, 
and some pretty dark intense situations.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.520
But the idea back then was people knew there'd be some risk going in.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.360
As in, you can't shield everything from everyone.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.400
That didn't always make the ratings right.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.060
Hell, all three of these films can have 
some very disturbing scenes in them.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.180
But they seemed ethically sound and not overkill.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.660
Everybody of every age wants entertainment, after all,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.900
and they knew there had to be some intense moments to keep you engaged.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.740
That's just the kind of gamble you take when you see a film, even if it is rated G.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.940
But as movies went on, the envelope was pushed more and more.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.840
And some movies weren't really extreme enough 
for an R, but PG didn't seem to cover it either.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.660
When "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" came out, they didn't know where to place it.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.900
It was certainly more than a PG, but not too much more than "Raiders of the Lost Ark",

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.280
which was also pushing the PG rating.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.480
Thus, the PG-13 was born, a compromise that seemed to fit in between the two.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.340
The upside is the loopholes for this rating allowed, in many respects, much more violence

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.100
for our blood-hungry 13-year-old minds to take in.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.660
Resulting in, funny enough, even more violence than a lot of R rated films.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.480
The downside is for years, this is 
all people wanted to make.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.300
You see, because of this rating, there was suddenly more of a distinction between G and PG.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.860
G was now seen as not really general audiences anymore, but kids.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.740
And eventually, when you saw that rating you would think: "Oh, a kids only movie".

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.780
PG suddenly could buckle down a little bit more.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.560
And let things that could fly, in say, "Planet of the Apes", "The Haunting", and so forth suddenly not fly now.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.280
Because of this, the G rating was now 
being stigmatized as baby movies.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.800
Which hey, we're grown adults and 10 to 16-year-olds who want to be grown adults.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.320
We don't want to watch that crap! 
G movies suck now!

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.380
A lot of kids hated them so much 
we started marketing  R-rated movies as toys.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.600
"Terminator's back to fight evil 
with his mobile assault vehicle!"

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.520
"... talking and electronic RoboCop, 
in three action packed sizes."

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.700
It was... a little messed up.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.540
Cool, but a little messed up.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.740
This meant, obviously, not as many people wanted to see them.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.620
Because of this, what were obviously G-rated movies

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.200
started throwing in one or two elements that are completely pointless,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.380
but help get that PG rating.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.120
They do this to show: "Hey! There's something in this movie you're not supposed to see,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.660
And that makes it a little risquÃ©, right?"

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.040
Remember the out of nowhere swear words in "Casper" or "Iron Giant"?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.240
"The bitch is back!"

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.320
How about the mountain of 
awkward adult jokes in Dr. Seuss movies.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.320
"Dirty hoe!"

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.800
Yeah, thank God your parents are there to help you understand

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.060
those totally childish moments 
parading as adult moments.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.260
Clearly, this was made for people with a more mature mind.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.560
What they missed though is that 
a lot of the great films are G-rated.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.280
And actually got away with a lot more 
by being clever and, dare I say it, necessary.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.080
Disney was the reigning champion of that for years.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.140
For decades, and decades they produced nothing but G-rated material.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.840
By turning their limitations into their advantage,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.460
they gave us some of the most messed up stuff.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.760
A lot of it was dark, nightmarish and intense,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.140
but not always in the way that would get a PG-rating.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.800
Because they had to find new avenues that people wouldn't think of if they had the luxury of a PG movie.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.780
Films like "Bambi" or "Lion King" have intense scenes of family members getting killed.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.240
Hell, sometimes you even see the body!

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.880
But because they worked in that this is a part of life that's important and worth understanding,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.500
it can still count as a G film.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.440
Perception is everything.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.180
That all changed in 1979 though, when Disney released its first PG film "The Black Hole".

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.180
It sucked!

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.920
So they opened a new studio where they could get away with more PG material called Touchstone.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.600
It seemed to work for a while, but PG eventually did work its way into dominating Disney films once again,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.200
and even finally moved out into PG-13 with "Pirates of the Caribbean".

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.380
And while I like that film fine, it does raise the question:

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.160
"How far away are they getting from Disney's original plan,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.340
entertainment that anyone 
could and should be allowed to see?"

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.300
Is there an R-rated film in the future?

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.800
More importantly: Is it even needed?

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.580
I remember much more great and disturbing imagery from "Hunchback of Notre Dame" or "Snow White"

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.800
than anything in "Lone Ranger" or the other "Pirate" films.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.440
So what's even the point of trying to get the higher rating?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.080
There was, however, a point when G film were becoming popular again,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.800
and that was with the invention of Pixar Studios.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.100
They started off making "Toy Story",
a smash hit G-rated film.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.280
For a long time every Pixar film was G.
And every movie was trying to be just like them.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.640
The adult-talking childlike characters 
with celebrity voices

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.440
that talk about children's scenarios and make them intelligent and adult,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.480
all without having to resort to 
the gimmick of the PG rating.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.980
Then the little hit came along, called "Shrek",

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.060
and it showed that a PG animated kids' film can be a little naughtier than Pixar.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.220
Suddenly, "Shrek" was the movie 
everyone wanted to try and be like,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.820
even though Pixar was doing fine
with its G-rated storylines.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.360
But then something terrible
started to happen to Pixar...

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.360
... they started to suck.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.320
Not suck hard, but... hard enough.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.240
And as a lot of suits in Hollywood usually think: "It must be because they're not hip enough."

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.260
Yeah, let's throw a P in front of that G
for... I don't know, innuendo?

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.600
Some scary imagery?

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.960
W-what's that line in "Frozen" no kid would get?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.080
"Foot size?"
"Foot size doesn't matter!"

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.880
Yeah! Throw that in there to get 
the PG rating that shows that we're edgy!

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.620
Thus, the G movie practically feels extinct again.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.100
Even though most parents don't even bother watching a Pixar or Disney film with their kid.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.140
At least, not for "parental guidance".

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.380
It feels like they just put it on there
so if you want to complain about something stupid,

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.340
they could just point and say,
"well, there's the PG warning,"

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.820
resulting in unneeded adult scenes
that only last a second

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:03.020
to prove that a movie is somehow "naughty" or "edgy"
when really it's nothing of the sort.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.620
Sometimes, it can even work in the other direction.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.740
Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland" has
eyes stabbed and plucked out,

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.940
heads floating in water 
with people climbing on them,

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.760
and even a pretty graphic decapitation scene.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.020
It only got a PG rating when this is borderline R!

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.380
"Dark Knight" wanted to get that 
ever-marketable PG-13 rating,

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.200
so they cut corners by showing nobody drinking, very few swear words, and little to no sex.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.280
Which balanced out all the shit-ton of 
super-intense violence, and even gory imagery.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.520
In fact, movies like "Hunger Games" and other PG-13 films

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.680
actually have more violence in them
than most R-rated movies now.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.800
But as long as they don't show too much blood or say a curse word,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.040
it's okay to see children slaughtered?

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.340
This is no surprise though, as the rating system for some time has been incredibly inconsistent

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.220
and... what's the word I'm looking for?
Insane!

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.760
For example, the F-word could be used once in PG movies for years.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.900
You'll notice them snuck into films
like "Spaceballs" and "Beetlejuice" that got a PG rating.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:10.360
Now this changed recently to PG-13, 
and it has to be used when not talking about sex.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.860
So... when Wolverine drops the F-bomb in two "X-Men" movies

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.420
putting complete and total attention on it,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.660
but if he said it one more time
or used it talking about sex...

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.380
only the 17-year-old mind can understand that!

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.600
"South Park" made a great mockery
of a similar rule,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.060
declaring that if over 400 swear words 
are used in your film,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.040
it'll get an NC-17 rating, which most theaters won't play.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.520
How many did they use?

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.320
Three hundred and ninety-nine.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.580
Insert slow clap here.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.580
Thank God they didn't use that one more swear, or else that would've been too much!

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.880
Oh, by the way, it's totally okay that you show a gigantic clitoris and make that part of the story,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.420
but if they said one more swear word
that would've been too far!

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.240
Actually, a lot of things involving sex
in the rating system don't make any sense.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.780
Now don't get me wrong, I think sex should be taught at the right time and very delicately.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.420
But by age thirteen, I think most kids have an understanding of what it is,

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.680
as well as the responsibilities that come with it.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.500
Hey, I'm not saying they practice those responsibilities, but they know what they are.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.240
Yet the number of times you show people humping can make the difference between an R and an NC-17;

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.320
things like three humps will get it an R,
but four would get an NC-17. Why?

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.180
Nudity is something that has to be blocked out a lot, even though you can say the F-word once

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.780
and show children getting slaughtered
and faces getting burned up.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.700
But God help you if there's a nipple in there!

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.740
Something... everybody has.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.320
On top of that, the way the ratings are 
done are bizarre too.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.740
If you check out the movie appropriately titled
"This Film Is Not Yet Rated",

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.700
they go into the details about
how you can't see the people who are rating it.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.280
Nor know their identity.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:02.560
Nor reference past films that got a different rating, even if your film does the exact same thing.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.060
All of that is bonkers.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:10.840
Bottom line: the rating system has been and continues to be incredibly outdated,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.960
and even kind of meaningless.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.500
In this age of the Internet, where any information can be found at any time,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:23.040
children, teens and adults are learning
more and faster than they ever have in the past.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.560
The rating system needs to reflect that.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.880
Now don't get me wrong: 
I know it's all subjective.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.860
One kid can watch the G-rated "Snow White" and be fine,

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.080
another can watch it and get nightmares.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.440
It's never going to be a perfect system,
nor should it be.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.700
It's art, it should be subjective.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.680
But the ratings should reflect our current environment,
and be more consistent.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.080
Why is "Drag Me To Hell", 
an over-the-top gore fest, PG-13,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.820
but "Love Is Strange", where a gay couple kiss, rated R?

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.360
Yeah, there's nothing else in this movie except a gay couple kissing and sleeping in bed.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.700
Totally clothed!

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.500
That was deemed more inappropriate than this!

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.720
It makes no sense in our current environment.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.160
I guess it's easy to say things have either gotten too inconsiderate, or things have gotten too PC,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.400
but the fact is: they're both right.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.900
None of it makes any sense from any angle.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:23.060
It's a different world now, and the rating system is changing, but... not in a way that reflects it.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.480
I know these aren't law, and a lot of younger people can still sneak into R-rated films and such,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.600
and I also know there'll always 
be loopholes and everything,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.080
but if the idea is to help guide people to what will culturally be accepted to the mass public,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.780
this current system doesn't really do that.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:45.220
This should be G, this should be R,
and both should be glad that they're a G and an R!

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.900
The secret to cinematic success isn't the rating,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.020
it's making a good film.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.600
"Toy Story" was a hit despite it being 
a G-rated kids' film;

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.580
"Deadpool" was a hit despite it being
an R-rated superhero flick.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.820
How did they do that?

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.880
What was the secret?

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.360
They were good!

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.300
Changes need to happen on both sides:

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.260
we need a system that makes more sense, and we need studios that can

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
stand by their movies, not their ratings.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:19.720
Because if someone is honestly gonna tell me a parent should be present when watching "Mr. Magoo"?

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.200
I think everybody's trust needs to be 
brought into focus.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.460
Because that should obviously be an NC-17, it shouldn't be shown anywhere.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.720
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.880

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.620
Hey, Doug Walker here,
doing the charity shout-out.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.500
This week we're doing 
the Children's Defense Fund.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:24.020
Their "leave no child behind" mission is to ensure every child a healthy, fair, safe, and moral start in life.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.160
And successful passage to adulthood,
with the help of caring families and communities.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.260
They provide a strong, effective and independent voice for all the children of America

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.720
who cannot vote, lobby, or speak for themselves.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.600
They pay particular attention to the needs of poor children, children of colour,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.480
and those with disabilities.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.140
They educate the nation about the needs of children and encourage preventive investments

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:53.860
before they get sick, drop out of school, get into trouble, or suffer family breakdowns.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.260
They began in 1973 as a private 
non-profit organization

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.220
supported by individual donations, 
corporate and government grants.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.520
With a solid A on Charity Watch and several videos on their YouTube channel

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.760
to show the good they're doing,
you too can help make sure

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.180
as many children as possible 
deserve the help they need.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.620
