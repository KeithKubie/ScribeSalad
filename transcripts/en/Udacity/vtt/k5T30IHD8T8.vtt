00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.110
Your next big goal in this course is to recreate a visualization to improve it.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.820
In order to do that, I'm going to be teaching you some design principles that

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.840
can enhance your graphics and help you prototype.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.270
&gt;&gt; I'll also take you through how to refine a design, and

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.690
also a few metrics that'll help you measure their effectiveness.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.970
&gt;&gt; We'll be seeing all the different options we have for choosing a chart or

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.850
a graphic depending on our data.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.210
And learn some of the formalism and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.860
theory surrounding how to make that selection.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.790
We'll also be building a much more complicated graphic,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.080
using a library built upon D3, and see how we can engage our audience more.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.440
Let's go learn about charts now.
