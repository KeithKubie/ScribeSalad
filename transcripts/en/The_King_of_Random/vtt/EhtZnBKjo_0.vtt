00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
So our first Diamond Play Button
got a little bit broken.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.520
So in this video,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.940
we are going to try
to melt it down,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.300
turn it into a trophy.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:14.960
[Music]

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.960
You may have followed
some of our adventures

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.340
with our Diamond Play Button.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.560
It had some issues.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.360
We made a mold of it,
and that worked pretty well.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.200
Then cleaning it up.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.100
The diamond part in the middle
just kind of comes out,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.380
and then one of Grant's children

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.100
might have dropped
it a little bit,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.518
and so it broke there,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.220
and I nicked it a little bit

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.500
while we were trying
to make the mold,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.320
and so the surface got
a little messed up,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.180
and overall, this thing
has had a stressful life,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.020
even as short as it's been.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.381
So we think that we're going
to do something else with it.

00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:45.900
You can, see this is,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.120
you know, it's got
our name on it.

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:48.051
The King of Random.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.720
Congratulations on passing
10 million subscribers.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.800
From YouTube.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.422
It's all very nice and official.

00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:55.520
I saw a video

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.880
where the Backyard Scientist
had a whole pool full of Orbeez,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.740
and he poured some molten
aluminum into it,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.220
and what came out
looked really awesome.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.050
So I was thinking we want
to try and do that.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.540
So here's the basic idea.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.400
We're pretty sure

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.960
that it is mainly made
out of aluminum.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.880
So we're going to try to melt
it down in our furnace,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.940
and then pour it

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.300
into a bucket of Orbeez
to make a really cool shape.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400
It fits directly in,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.300
but then, there would be
nothing to contain it.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.060
Yeah.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.520
And if it melted,
it would just all puddle

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.540
at the bottom of our furnace,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.620
and that's no good.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.000
So we've got
a stainless steel pot.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.050
We're just going to set
this right on top,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.066
and hope that all

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.000
of that propane power
will get up into the button,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.400
and melt it down.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.420
And this is some form of glass.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.900
We're just going
to put all of it in,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.140
and see what happens to it.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.980
[Music]

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.700
Bye Diamond Play Button.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.080
[Music]

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.480
To try and keep some
of the heat in,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.120
we are going to put another
metal bucket up on top of it.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.600
Hopefully, that'll make
things go a little bit faster,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.840
because this is
a large block of metal,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.520
and we'll just check in
on it every 10 minutes or so.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:32.500
[Music]

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560
Haha!

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.420
Yeah.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.220
You're going down button.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.140
Down.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.160
Hey, that's still hard.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.280
I can like poke a hole in it.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.400
But I can scrape this off.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.640
There still some solid
in the middle there.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.580
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.200
Let's see if we can--

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.860
[inaudible] through.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.360
[inaudible] Diamond button.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.880
[inaudible]

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.460
[inaudible] something, little buddy.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:28.020
[Music]

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.540
That is a lot
of liquid aluminum.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:43.820
[Music]

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.540
All right.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.986
First, a tiny tiny bit

00:03:45.986 --> 00:03:48.100
to see if it's going to like
splash or anything.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.500
[Music]

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.625
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:54.945
Okay.

00:03:54.945 --> 00:03:55.460
Keep going.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.180
Keep going.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:13.580
[Music]

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.920
Now, that's a lot of steam.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.720
Oh, I think we've melted
through the side of the bucket.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.940
Orbeez are escaping.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.820
We lost everything.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.080
No, we haven't.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.420
Much of it is still in there.

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:30.080
Keep going.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.600
You can still make something
really cool out of this.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.692
This side is not melted yet.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.500
Keep--

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.180
Oh, our poor $3 bucket.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.500
And so many Orbeez.

00:04:43.512 --> 00:04:44.012
Oh!

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.080
Wow.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.880
But that's already doing

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.152
&gt;&gt; something really good.
&gt;&gt; Okay, I gotta say,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.680
I actually did see
that coming, kind of.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.440
That's why our white bucket
is sitting in another bucket.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.340
The other bucket
is full of sand.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.260
I more suspected
the problem would be

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.340
that the aluminum would go down
to the bottom and melt through,

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.774
but it reached the side,

00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:06.913
and unsurprisingly,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.800
destroyed the side
of the bucket,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.780
and just poured play button
all over the ground.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.800
Oh man, the second bucket
has also started melting,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.660
because the aluminum
did pour out onto the sand,

00:05:17.672 --> 00:05:19.662
and it's just pressing
right there now.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.700
This is really cool.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.540
So you can actually
see over on this side,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.608
the Orbeez caught,

00:05:25.608 --> 00:05:28.320
and I can't tell if this is
aluminum and plastic, both?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480
But they're still there.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.240
So once we,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.200
once we're able to actually
get the Orbeez out of this,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.520
and clean it all up,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.900
we're going to have
something really weird.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.580
I'm kind of feeling

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.100
like I'm just standing
in a steam shower right now.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.740
It's incredibly hot still.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.120
Look at this.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.780
Look at this pattern
you got happening.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.420
This looks like something alien.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.580
Well, here's one part.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.392
You went too far.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.040
There's a hole
in the bottom too.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.780
What did you do?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.980
There's our glass button,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.120
or a diamond,
I should say.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.120
There's the glass,
and the triangle piece of steel.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.080
It's not hot, it's just pointy.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.320
Yes.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.400
Look at that.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.600
That's just pretty.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.820
[Music]

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.140
Oh my gosh, just a bath
full of warm Orbeez.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.200
That would be an experience.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.520
That's something you
should have at a spa.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:43.720
[Music]

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.940
Ah.

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:45.982
Got it?

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:46.820
Yeah.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:55.600
[Music]

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.780
What?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.032
This is amazing.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.140
Yeah.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:13.940
[Music]

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.300
This has slice up my gloves.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.300
Alright, YouTube.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.440
This is where you
should be giving out,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.860
instead of Diamond Play Buttons.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.580
This is cooler.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.220
Oh, yeah. I want all the
Orbeez to stay forever,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.480
but I know they won't.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.300
That looks awesome.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:53.020
[Music]

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.260
Guys, over the years, Grant
has accumulated some stuff.

00:07:57.372 --> 00:07:59.201
He has quite a bit
of it collected by now,

00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:00.925
and some of it,
he has had long enough,

00:08:00.925 --> 00:08:02.080
and wants to get rid of it.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.891
This isn't old used stuff
that he doesn't want anymore,

00:08:04.891 --> 00:08:06.034
because it's old and used.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.960
Its new stuff.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.940
It's still in great condition.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.340
So, today is our first giveaway

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.694
that we are actually
going to be using

00:08:11.694 --> 00:08:13.218
the codes in the videos for.

00:08:13.218 --> 00:08:14.811
You've probably seen them ever

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.320
since we had our Captain
America shield video.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.451
We've started embedding
codes around the videos.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.840
Sometimes, they pop up
with letters or numbers.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.160
Sometimes, the King of Random
Shield logo pops up

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.840
for like one or two frames.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.120
Sometimes, Grant pops up,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.700
and he'll salute,
or he'll wave,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.360
or any number of things.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.740
And we're going to be using
those embedded codes to give

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.947
stuff away to you guys.

00:08:35.947 --> 00:08:36.597
That's right.

00:08:36.597 --> 00:08:38.053
And today is the first time,

00:08:38.053 --> 00:08:40.550
and so here is the first thing
we're giving away.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.888
We've got some of these,
they're called Mighty Mugs.

00:08:43.888 --> 00:08:45.520
And here's the thing.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.840
When I saw it in the box,

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:48.614
I thought, well
this look silly.

00:08:48.614 --> 00:08:49.850
Who cares about that?

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.750
It's just got this picture
of a person,

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.420
like tipping it
and it doesn't tip.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.320
Kinda thought it was just
gonna be like, I don't know,

00:08:55.323 --> 00:08:57.260
a heavy weight at the bottom,
and I thought well,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.350
that's really inconvenient.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.639
But then, I actually opened it,
and started using it.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:04.579
This thing is like,
I'm super amused with this.

00:09:04.579 --> 00:09:06.423
This is actually really cool.

00:09:06.423 --> 00:09:08.650
There's a suction cup
at the bottom.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.700
So if you have any sort
of smooth surface,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.640
and this isn't even
like a perfectly smooth table,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.700
but it's pretty smooth.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.360
It's like the suction
cup has a seal on it.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.440
So that if you lift
it straight up,

00:09:17.444 --> 00:09:18.228
it breaks the seal,

00:09:18.228 --> 00:09:19.642
and you can just
pick up your cup.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.342
Like you don't
feel any resistance.

00:09:21.342 --> 00:09:23.960
It feels just like picking
up any other thermos.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.025
But this, like the clever thing
is that if you don't pick it straight up,

00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.660
if you go at it at an angle,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.780
the suction cup seal catches
and it doesn't tip.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.380
So we've got a couple
of these small ones,

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.460
we've one of these
taller ones here.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:38.880
Both of them.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.700
They don't fall over.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.280
If you, I mean,
you can overcome it.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.676
If you like push hard,

00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:44.820
you can get it off,
push him sideways,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.140
but it's not going
to fall over by accident.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.760
You can, you know,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.660
hit one cup
with the other cup.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.300
They're crazy.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.240
I might have to end up
getting one of these myself.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.060
So here's what you have
to do to enter.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.360
Okay, there's a link
in the description down below.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.300
That's where you're going
to enter your code,

00:10:01.303 --> 00:10:02.529
and to find that code,

00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:05.180
you need to go watch our video
where we blended up

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.980
glow sticks in a blender.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.300
For this video,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.440
we're not using the the
appearing King of Random logo,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.260
and we're not using
the appearing Grant.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.020
We might use it
at a different contest giveaway,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.800
sort of thing.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.840
But for this time,
just the codes.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.240
There should be five of them
hidden throughout the video.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.900
So glow sticks in a blender,
and go check that out.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:25.700
Come back here.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.640
Link in the description.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.680
Enter the code,
and you could win.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.360
Guys, that's not all,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.000
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.920
That box at the top will take
you directly to our last video.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.040
You should go check that out.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.460
The other box
is going to show you

00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:38.205
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:39.700
And if you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.853
you'll be subscribed
to our channel,

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.520
and that way, you'll
never miss out on the fun.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.740
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.080
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.820
Talk to you then.
