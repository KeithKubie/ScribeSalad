KIM: Hi. I’m Sung Hu Kim. I work on the

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:16.390
Android team at Google. And I’m here to
interview Allan Hsu from imeem. So, Allan,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.599
maybe you could tell us a little bit about
your role and about imeem in general.

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:27.009
&gt;&gt; HSU: So imeem is a social networking site
based around music streaming. And on our site,

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:34.260
users can upload music and stream it on demand.
Our Android application allows users to listen

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.590
to stations based around their preferences
or listen to music that they’ve uploaded

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.010
to the system, kind of like a storage locker
without using space on the phone.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.640
&gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Great, so, you know, imeem has
been on Android since almost the very beginning

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.720
when the first device is shipped, and I know
that you guys are also planning some kind

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.360
of additional features and improvements in
the near future, maybe you could talk about

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.800
this.
&gt;&gt; HSU: So, the next release has got some

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.330
kind of Cupcake features. And, also, we've
just decided to do a little more integration

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.630
with the system in general. So, we’ve exposed
the search to other application so you can

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.130
launch media searches against the imeem system
from, you know, the media player on the phone

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.950
or any applications that supports it. We also
made the media player aspect of our phone

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.499
a little more integrated with the music on
the phone itself so you can use imeem to listen

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:40.039
to music on the phone. We've also got a desktop
widget and some other Cupcake features that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.819
we've got in the works and we've also got
like a visual refresh. We got a new look for

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.509
the phone that I think--or not for the phone,
but for the application that we think will

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.020
be a little bit of an improvement over what
we got right now.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.770
&gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Maybe you could focus a little
bit on a couple of the things that you talked

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.009
about. So, one thing you mentioned was media
searches from other apps, maybe you can kind

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.369
of walk through what would that look like
from the user's experience.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:14.220
&gt;&gt; HSU: So, I mean, one thing you can see
right now is, like, you press hold on a name

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.810
of an artist in the media player that comes
with the phone or on the platform...

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.799
&gt;&gt; KIM: Is it the long press?
&gt;&gt; HSU: The long press, yeah.

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:26.120
&gt;&gt; KIM: Yup.
&gt;&gt; HSU: It will pop up sort of a list of applications

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.010
you can use to search for that artist or the
name of that song, like the... and imeem would

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.290
show up there now.
&gt;&gt; KIM: So you basically launch a radio station...

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.970
&gt;&gt; HSU: Yeah, like a...
&gt;&gt; KIM: ...off the titles of the songs from

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.150
the media player.
&gt;&gt; HSU: If you got music on the phone then

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.250
you are, like, "Oh, I want to listen to more
of this artist or more music like this," you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.999
can search imeem right on the spot and launch
the radio station for that right there.

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.840
&gt;&gt; KIM: How easy or difficult was it to develop
that feature?

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.281
&gt;&gt; Alan: That one's really easy, and part
of that was because of the way of the platform

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:06.850
is put together. You know, when launching
a search like that isn't much different than

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.460
launching a search within the application
itself, so you just have to hook up a little

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.049
bit of glue and it's there. In general, that's
sort of a nice thing about the platform. It

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.260
allows you to do things easily and quickly
because of the way you're sort of encouraged

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.990
to develop things, makes it easy to do other
things like that later on just because it's

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:38.560
sort of like the disconnect between the different
activities, you know. There's just a distinction

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.969
that's made in terms of this activity gets
things this way from being tense that allow

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.959
you to do stuff like that.
&gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. One other thing that you mentioned

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.880
was the home screen widgets, can you talk
a little bit more about what that feature

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.960
would look like?
&gt;&gt; HSU: So, basically, from your home screen,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.510
you'll be able to see what music is playing
and you'll be able to pause the music or skip

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.859
tracks or launch imeem.
&gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. And then how easy or difficult

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.349
was it to build this?
&gt;&gt; HSU: It wasn't much harder than writing

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:23.740
another view. Your layout language is the
same, and the way you send data to that widget

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.340
is different but not much different than the
way you update views in your own application.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.630
&gt;&gt; KIM: Okay. Great. Maybe you could talk
a little bit about your experience developing

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.815
it on Android 1.5 with this new feature and
some of the kind of the clean up things that

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:44.120
you talked about. What are some of the things
that you like? What are some things that you

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.970
would want to have improved in the feature?
&gt;&gt; HSU: So, I'm pretty happy that the documentation

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:56.590
is much better. In Cupcake, that was one of
the big hurdles with the first version of

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.830
the application was that sometimes, to get
answers, I had to call somebody at Google,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.020
which, you know, luckily for us, we were able
to do. But not everybody knows people at Google,

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:18.061
so, you know, the documentation is a pretty
key aspect, I think. You know, other than

00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:21.840
that, you know, a lot of the features kind
of just build on top of the foundation that

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.930
was there on 1.0 and without really radically
changing anything. So, if you know how to

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.599
do something on 1.0, any new functionality
kind of just fits in with your view of how

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.630
things worked before.
&gt;&gt; KIM: Great. So, I guess, one final question,

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.899
when do we as users, when can we expect to
see these new features on imeem?

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:50.430
&gt;&gt; HSU: I think the Cupcake centric feature
release will be, probably, sometime soon.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.789
&gt;&gt; KIM: Okay.
&gt;&gt; HSU: Maybe within the next couple of weeks.

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.599
&gt;&gt; KIM: Okay.
&gt;&gt; KIM: You know, it's pretty close to ready,

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:04.110
but there's some other things we want to get
in, stuff we want to work on, kinks, things

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.810
like that.
&gt;&gt; KIM: Great. We're looking forward to it.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.280
Thanks, Allan.
