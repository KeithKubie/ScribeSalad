00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400
introduction I think from my point of
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.830
introduction I think from my point of
view and I think there are many

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840
view and I think there are many
 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.870
view and I think there are many
different points of view about

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880
different points of view about
 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.500
different points of view about
globalization and universities my point

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
globalization and universities my point
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.220
globalization and universities my point
of view is the following I think we're

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230
of view is the following I think we're
 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.100
of view is the following I think we're
in an historic era that has two very

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110
in an historic era that has two very
 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.509
in an historic era that has two very
powerful forces at work changing the

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519
powerful forces at work changing the
 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.600
powerful forces at work changing the
world one is the opening of markets

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610
world one is the opening of markets
 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.810
world one is the opening of markets
throughout the world and the rise of

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820
throughout the world and the rise of
 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.000
throughout the world and the rise of
capitalism and the rise of foreign

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010
capitalism and the rise of foreign
 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.569
capitalism and the rise of foreign
investment and the rise of trade at a

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579
investment and the rise of trade at a
 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.270
investment and the rise of trade at a
level that we have not really seen

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280
level that we have not really seen
 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.949
level that we have not really seen
before and I don't say this as an

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959
before and I don't say this as an
 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.360
before and I don't say this as an
unchallengeable good I think there are

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370
unchallengeable good I think there are
 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.750
unchallengeable good I think there are
many many good things about this

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760
many many good things about this
 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.470
many many good things about this
phenomenon but I also think that there

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480
phenomenon but I also think that there
 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.300
phenomenon but I also think that there
are many things many issues that are

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310
are many things many issues that are
 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.830
are many things many issues that are
raised by the forces of economics and

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840
raised by the forces of economics and
 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.930
raised by the forces of economics and
investment and I think it is the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940
investment and I think it is the
 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.110
investment and I think it is the
responsibility of universities to be

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120
responsibility of universities to be
 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.119
responsibility of universities to be
following whatever the forces are in

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129
following whatever the forces are in
 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.910
following whatever the forces are in
this case economic and to critique them

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920
this case economic and to critique them
 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.540
this case economic and to critique them
to evaluate them to review them and to

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550
to evaluate them to review them and to
 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.720
to evaluate them to review them and to
recommend what needs to be done i think

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730
recommend what needs to be done i think
 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.920
recommend what needs to be done i think

billion people connected to the Internet

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810
billion people connected to the Internet
 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.230
billion people connected to the Internet
and that's growing by a couple of

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240
and that's growing by a couple of
 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.300
and that's growing by a couple of
hundred thousand people every month I

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310
hundred thousand people every month I
 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.240
hundred thousand people every month I
mean those statistics are staggering but

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250
mean those statistics are staggering but
 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.360
mean those statistics are staggering but
extremely telling so you have these two

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370
extremely telling so you have these two
 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.000
extremely telling so you have these two
forces and you have other forces just

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010
forces and you have other forces just
 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.330
forces and you have other forces just
the interactions of people across the

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340
the interactions of people across the
 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.190
the interactions of people across the
globe that are happening because travel

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200
globe that are happening because travel
 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.890
globe that are happening because travel
is easier in

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900
is easier in
 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.249
is easier in
many respects but these are really

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259
many respects but these are really
 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.560
many respects but these are really
changing our world so that's the that's

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570
changing our world so that's the that's
 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.510
changing our world so that's the that's
the first sort of premise and the second

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520
the first sort of premise and the second
 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.740
the first sort of premise and the second
premise is that this looks like it's

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750
premise is that this looks like it's
 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.870
premise is that this looks like it's
here to stay now we know that there have

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880
here to stay now we know that there have
 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.439
here to stay now we know that there have
been points in history where there have

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449
been points in history where there have
 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.870
been points in history where there have
been greater interconnections over a

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880
been greater interconnections over a
 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.230
been greater interconnections over a
series of decades and then it has

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240
series of decades and then it has
 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.640
series of decades and then it has
exploded and set back the processes of

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650
exploded and set back the processes of
 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.240
exploded and set back the processes of
globalization that may happen here but

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250
globalization that may happen here but
 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.409
globalization that may happen here but
it's fair to say I think that this has a

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419
it's fair to say I think that this has a
 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.760
it's fair to say I think that this has a
chance of continuing to build and the

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770
chance of continuing to build and the
 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.330
chance of continuing to build and the
lives of our students will be very

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340
lives of our students will be very
 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.640
lives of our students will be very
different from the lives that we have

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650
different from the lives that we have
 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.420
different from the lives that we have
led and from the lives that our parents

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430
led and from the lives that our parents
 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.930
led and from the lives that our parents
and our families led I have a an aunt

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940
 
 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.689
 
who has never been on an airplane in her

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:52.699
who has never been on an airplane in her
 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.260
who has never been on an airplane in her
life I have another aunt who has never

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270
life I have another aunt who has never
 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.400
life I have another aunt who has never
traveled outside of California I mean

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410
traveled outside of California I mean
 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.490
traveled outside of California I mean
maybe that's a good thing I mean maybe

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500
maybe that's a good thing I mean maybe
 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.490
maybe that's a good thing I mean maybe
maybe all of us should wish for that I

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500
maybe all of us should wish for that I
 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.320
maybe all of us should wish for that I
but the I mean these are these are

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330
but the I mean these are these are
 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:14.800
but the I mean these are these are
amazing generational shifts so it I

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810
amazing generational shifts so it I
 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.820
amazing generational shifts so it I
think it's probably here to say and that

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830
think it's probably here to say and that
 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.089
think it's probably here to say and that
means that the world will look very

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:22.099
means that the world will look very
 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:29.830
means that the world will look very
differently in just a few decades and we

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840
differently in just a few decades and we
 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.770
differently in just a few decades and we
need I think to build the foundations of

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:32.780
need I think to build the foundations of
 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.310
need I think to build the foundations of
a global society just like in this

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:36.320
a global society just like in this
 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.560
a global society just like in this
country in other countries over the

country in other countries over the
 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.980

course of the last century two centuries

course of the last century two centuries
 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.180
course of the last century two centuries
we had to build up a national society

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.190
we had to build up a national society
 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.430
we had to build up a national society
with national policies national

principles national structures that
could cope with the greater

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:53.630
could cope with the greater
 

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.810
could cope with the greater
interconnectedness that was the result

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820
interconnectedness that was the result
 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.300

then comes universities and my view

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:16.909
then comes universities and my view
 

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:21.140
then comes universities and my view
universities do many many things and in

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:21.150
universities do many many things and in
 

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.709
universities do many many things and in
many ways some ways we don't even need

the outside world there's some parts of

the outside world there's some parts of
 

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:32.649
the outside world there's some parts of
what we do that are internal to our own
