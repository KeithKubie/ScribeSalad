00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660
- What are the ins and outs of unlocking this iPhone?

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.200
Surely, it's just one phone.  There's devil's advocate for you.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.880
- Well, the FBI started off in this case, saying they wanted to unlock just one phone.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.200
That was a phone that belonged to the government, anyway, and was used by a dead terrorist,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.840
and as he was dead, he had no privacy rights.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.620
But once we started to dig into it, it turned out that there had been dozens to hundreds of similar cases

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.460
where the FBI wanted Apple and others to create tools to get at stuff, and they weren't willing.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.080
And, clearly, this was the photogenic case that the FBI thought they could use to batter down the door.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.200
Now, it's an enormous expansion of government surveillance powers

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.560
because, traditionally in America,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.120
if the police got a warrant, that gave them the right to look,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.680
but it didn't give them the right to compel the suspect's neighbors or other people to help them.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.040
And, in particular, if you take the rights to order a company

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.620
to provide a weakened version of its software,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.400
there is a big problem about who else will want that weakened version of the software–

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.940
that golden key–and what they're going to do with it.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.440
- What is this golden key?  How would that work?

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.460
If you've locked something, you've locked it, haven't you?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.340
- Well, on an iPhone or an Android phone, or any other electronic device,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.440
the lock that a user can deploy to encrypt his data or her data using a password

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.760
is largely implemented in software on the device,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.080
and the software can be updated–and it typically is, once a month or so–

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.420
to have patches against whatever security vulnerabilities have been discovered.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.040
So, if you can somehow subvert or coerce the update process,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.100
you can turn the update into a golden key.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.140
And this, for law enforcement, must be very thrilling, but for everybody else, it's disastrous,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.300
because if people start worrying that software updates might give the government or a foreign government

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.420
access to their stuff, they'll turn it off.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.980
And the consequences of that for Internet security could be really, really serious.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.200
- So, I'm thinking of a real-world, non-digital example  of this.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.900
Is this like you've gone and bought a safe with very strong metal walls,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.220
and then the company who sold you the safe can turn those walls into jelly?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.200
- Well, yeah, if the company has got a secret 12-digit  engineering access code

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.940
for use by its own technicians only–when they attend

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.440
a customer for a bank whose branch manager has died and didn't write down the combination.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.880
And the safe manufacturer's technician can then enter this 12-digit magic code and unlock the bank vault.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.200
Well, that's very convenient if you're a safe manufacturer.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.080
But, then, if the FBI says, "We want you to give us this safe magic code because there's one of these

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.540
safes in the Chinese embassy," and you do so, right?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.820
And then that 12-digit code gets out because Mr. Snowden puts it in his latest batch of revelations,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.740
and then the Chinese and the Mafia all have this magic 12-digit code, then you're absolutely hosed.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.560
And there's an example of that from Juniper routers.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.660
Juniper make routers–you know, the telephone switches for the Internet.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.140
And some years ago, it seems the NSA got a backdoor on one of these routers,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.920
presumably because they got one of their people to get a job at Juniper,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.680
or they subverted someone who was already there.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.480
And, we learned from the Snowden documents that this backdoor existed.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.080
And what happened, then, was that the Russians and Chinese and others went looking for it and found it.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.960
And, now, Juniper routers,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.020
half of whose outputs are sold in the USA, are being used by bad guys overseas to attack America

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.320
far more than they are used by the American intelligence agencies to attack targets in China.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.500
And this is blow-back; this is what happens when you start abusing infrastructure and other trustworthy

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.480
facilities for your own intelligence purposes. It can come back and bite you.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.760
And that's one of the reasons why former senior American intelligence officials–

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.240
Hayden, Roberts and so on are now against encryption backdoors.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.120
A number of agencies have dreamed about and sometimes implemented NOBUS capabilities–

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.860
And there is a very long history of these "nobody but us" capabilities

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.660
suddenly becoming capabilities that many nations had.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.680
Another example is the atomic bomb.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.180
When the Americans used it in 1945,

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.920
they reckoned it might be decades before the Soviets figured out how to build one.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.880
But, of course, within three years, the Soviets had it, too,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.580
and we had the nuclear standoff of the Cold War.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.560
- Here in the UK, though, that's not going to affect us, is it?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.480
This is an iPhone in America, and it's American laws we're talking about.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.520
- The FBI case is really, really critical for Britain because of the Investigatory Powers bill

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.880
that's now going through Parliament.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.520
Now, the Investigatory Powers bill

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.540
gives the home secretary the power to order communications service providers

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.460
to help law enforcement with warrants.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.400
Now, in the old days, that just meant that British Telecom had to let in the chap from GCHQ

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.640
with his crocodile clips to attach a tape recorder to your phone line.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.280
But nowadays, that most communication is being handled by Facebook, Google, Yahoo!, Twitter,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.820
and so on, it's very, very different.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:35.320
And the bill has the facility for the home secretary to give a secret technical capability notice

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:42.080
to a services company saying that they must make available a certain wiretap or surveillance capability.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.040
Now, because foreign firms objected, they put a clause in the draft bill which says

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.680
that there's a defense if it's technically impractical to provide the facility, you don't have to do it.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.180
And, also, if it's against the law in the company's country of origin, you don't have to do it.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:09.620
But, now, if the FBI succeeded in compelling Apple to provide a golden key for Apple products in the US courts,

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.580
and Apple then make that golden key and use it only once,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.540
then Teresa May (UK Home Secretary) can put a secret order on Apple in the UK saying,

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.700
"We would really rather like to have one of these golden keys, too please. Kindly deliver it to GCHQ

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.680
within the next 30 days or go to jail, and you may not tell anybody that you've given us this golden key."

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.980
And what's going to happen, then, is that the French will do the same.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.740
Do Apple give a key to the French?  Well, perhaps, because the French are a civilized country

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.620
and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and so on.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.100
And then the Italians will want one, too.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.400
And–now hang on a minute, Silvio Berlusconi was in cahoots with the Mafia for many years

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.600
and abused state facilities to do the Mafia's bidding–do you really want to give it to the Italians?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.660
Well, perhaps, given European structures, you have to.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.380
And, if you give it to the Italians, the Greeks want one.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.480
And then the Egyptians want one.  And then the Saudis want one.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.920
And, pretty soon, just about everybody except the government of North Korea has got a golden key to your iPhone.
