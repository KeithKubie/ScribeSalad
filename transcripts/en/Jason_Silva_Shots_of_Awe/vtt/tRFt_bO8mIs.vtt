00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:05.630
This episode of "Shots
of Awe" is brought to you

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.030
by the Toyota Prius.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.109
Let's lead the way.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.550
So I'm a big fan of moments of
absolute aesthetic immersion.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.380
When you get sucked into a film.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.299
When you get caught up in an
environment that is completely

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.450
absorbing, and
you go into a kind

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.420
of trance, a kind of
liminal trance state.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.320
You enter that
magical borderland

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.550
between dreams and
reality-- the space

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.130
of archetype, the space of
dream, the space of myth.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.990
And so I recently picked up
a book by Allison Griffiths.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.430
And this book was about the
uses of instructive media

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.745
throughout history to evoke
mind spaces of ecstatic worship.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.530
So she basically
says that the IMAX

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.770
is the contemporary
equivalent of what

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.790
was once the Gothic Cathedral.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.760
That these were immersive
technologies that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.340
mediated our encounters
with transcendence,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.910
our encounters with these
spaces of ecstatic worship.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.840
And one of the things
that she talks about

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.200
is the revered gaze.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.160
Now, the revered
gaze is that moment

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.130
in which we're sitting
back in the IMAX theater,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.590
staring at the movie trailer
for "Interstellar" when they're

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.590
talking about how man is
going to leave it all behind,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.060
and transcend, and he wasn't
meant to stay on earth.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.500
And you're feeling that
cosmic awe, the wow,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.370
the buzz of science fiction
in an immersive environment.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.420
And it's just like, ah!

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.540
It's that feeling.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.000
Or when you're in
the Gothic Cathedral

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.020
and for whatever reason,
I'm not religious,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.429
but you're staring at the
beautiful colored glass

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.470
and the sun is coming in.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.460
And maybe you're listening to
some phantasmagorical music

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.070
that's tripping you out.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.040
That's the revered gaze.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.830
That is a place of
ecstatic catharsis.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.570
A moment of illumination.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.820
And these moments in which
we so fully lose ourselves,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.270
these ecstatic flow
states that shut down

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.300
the lateral prefrontal
cortex, shut down

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.200
to the sense of
self-awareness, it's

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.100
this apotheosis, this
death and rebirth.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.230
That's what we seek in
aesthetic experiences.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.460
It's what we seek in
transcendent experiences--

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.620
to smash our sense of
separateness in temples

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.840
of fragmentation in this
form of electronically

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.430
mediated Buddhism.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.440
It's something that is
intrinsic to the human desire

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.130
to dream, and to lose
ourselves in the imagination.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.440
And I think that the Oculus
Rift, virtual reality,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.270
surround sound, all these
ways in which we mediate

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.360
these encounters,
these new exotic forms

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.326
of instructive media that
will continue to emerge,

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:51.700
they have this
historical context

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.760
that we've been doing it
for hundreds of years.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.180
It's perfectly normal.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.460
It's something that's
inside us and is driving us.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.535
And, yeah, that's in a nutshell
why cinema is an altar.

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:09.880
That's why I love these
technologies of immersion.
