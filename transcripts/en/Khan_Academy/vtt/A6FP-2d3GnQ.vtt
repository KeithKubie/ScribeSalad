00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
We're on problem 129.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:10.480
On a recent trip, Cindy drove
her car 290 miles, rounded to

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.430
the nearest 10 miles, and used
12 gallons of gasoline,

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.830
rounded to the nearest
gallons.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.220
The actual number of miles per
gallon that Cindy's car got on

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.500
this trip must have
been between?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.040
So they want us to kind of say
these are the rounded numbers,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.610
now what were the actual numbers
between, and then from

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.720
that what's the range
of miles per gallon?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.530
So if this is rounded to the
nearest 10, then her miles had

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.570
to have been greater than or
equal to 285, because anything

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.080
285 or more would have
been rounded to 290.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:00.220
But then less than 295 because
anything less than 295 would

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.820
be would be rounded down,
but 295 itself would be

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.330
rounded up to 300.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.900
And her gallons had to have been
greater than or equal to

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.800
11.5 gallons, by the
same logic, and

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.900
less than 12.5 gallons.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.990
So what was the lowest possible
miles per gallon?

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.930
So the lowest possible miles
per gallon would have the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.240
lowest miles and the
highest gallons.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.440
You want to minimize the
numerator and maximize the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.960
denominator.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.040
So lowest possible miles
would be 285.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.300
And the highest possible
gallons, at least it'll

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.290
approach 12.5.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.320
So 12.499999 is the possible
number of gallons, so it'll

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.750
approach this.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.610
But it can never be exactly 12.5
gallons, so her miles per

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.930
gallon are going to be
greater than this.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.430
It would've been greater than
equal to this with like

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.260
12.499999, but since 12.5 can
never get there, we're going

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.820
to be greater than this in terms
of miles per gallon.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.700
And then the highest possible
miles per gallon is the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.910
highest possible miles,
which is 295.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.630
But we're never going to be able
to go twice quite there.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.720
We're always going to
be less than 295.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.530
And then the lowest number of
gallons-- going the highest

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.720
mileage with the lowest possible
gallons, you want to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.370
minimize the demonimator--
divided by 11.5.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.620
Let's see if that is a choice.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.530
I don't see that exactly, but
choice D looks interesting

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.910
because choice D says-- so they
say the actual number of

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.110
miles per gallon that Cindy's
car got on this trip must have

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.360
been between.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.590
Choice D looks close to what we
have because we have this.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:05.000
Choice D says between
284 divided by 12.5.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.820
That's going to be even less
than that, because you have

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.390
the 12.5 but the numerator's
less.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.410
So that's going to be even lower
than the range that we

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.440
have.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.920
And then on choice D,
295 divided 11.4.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.090
This number is larger than this
number, because you have

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.570
the same numerator and you have
a smaller denominator.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.290
So you're dividing by
a smaller number.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.910
So this number's larger.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.360
So if her miles per gallon is
between these two numbers, and

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.050
these two numbers are
between these two

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.540
numbers, then D is right.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.560
Her miles per gallon need to be
between 284 divided by 12.5

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.400
and 295 divided by 11.4.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.090
So it's choice D.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.990
Problem 130.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.230
Which of the following
inequalities is an algebraic

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.060
expression for the shaded part
of the number line above?

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.990
So this number line, let's
try to draw it.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.430
That's the line.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.510
And I'm not going to draw all
of the dots on it, but it

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.280
essentially starts at positive
3 and it goes backwards.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.530
Let's switch colors.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.980
It starts essentially from
minus 5 to positive 3.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.835
That's all of what
this includes.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.950
This includes minus 5 to
positive 3, then you have 2,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.590
1, 0, and then minus 5.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.390
So you could say that x is
less than or equal to 3

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.350
because it's filled in at
3, and greater than or

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.200
equal to minus 5.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.640
And that's not one
of the choices.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.480
They want it in terms
of absolute value.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.560
So how we can view this, this is
a range around some number.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.050
Whenever you're dealing without
absolute value, you're

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.390
essentially saying the distance
from some number.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.080
So this is a range
of minus 5 and 3.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.300
This has a length of 8,
so they're both 4

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.220
away from minus 1.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.950
Think about it.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.180
You could go 4 backwards
or 4 forwards.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.350
So one way to think about it
is the difference between x

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:19.480
and minus 1, and that might
be a negative or positive

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.302
difference depending on whether
we're positive or

00:05:21.302 --> 00:05:25.910
negative, depending on whether
we're above negative 1 or

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.850
below negative 1.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.850
But we just want the absolute
difference.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.000
We just want the distance
away from negative 1.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.510
And that's given by this, the
difference between any x and

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.960
negative 1.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.690
And we took the absolute value
in case x is less than

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.530
negative 1.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.410
The distance is going to be
less than or equal to 4,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.970
because if we go above negative
1 we're at most at 3,

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.170
which is 4 more than
negative 1.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.700
If we go below negative 1, we're
at minus 5 which is 4

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.540
less than negative 1.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.490
So it's less than
or equal to 4.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.210
So if you simplify this, you
get x plus 1, the absolute

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.450
value is less than
or equal to 4.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.990
And that is choice E.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.900
And this is a useful skill.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.725
You have probably taken the SAT
already, but in general, a

00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:10.490
lot of standardized tests think
of absolute value as a

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.870
distance in 1 dimension.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.350
So the distance along
the number line.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.620
So they're saying all of these
points, they're within some

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.890
range from 1 point.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.620
And you can say if you take the
midpoint of this, you're

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.610
at negative 1.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.500
And every point here's within
4 of negative 1.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.700
So the distance between every
point on this line, every x

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.300
that satisfies this and negative
1, the distance is

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.450
less than or equal to 4.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.720
Anyway, I kind of just did the
problem twice for you.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.630
Problem 131.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:51.390
A factory has 500 workers,
15% of whom are women.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:57.590
So 15% times 500 is
equal to women.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.190
If 50 additional workers are
to be hired and all of the

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.970
present workers remain, how many
of the additional workers

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.410
must be women in order to raise
the percent of women

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.780
employees to 20%?

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.480
So how many women workers
do we have right now?

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.720
5 times 15, we have
75 workers.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.830
15 times 500.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:31.610
We have 75 women right now.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.280
If we wanted to find the
proportion of women, it's 75

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.140
over 500, which is
once again 15.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.770
It's 15%.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.790
We're going to add a total of 50
workers to this population.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.480
And they want to know how many
of the additional workers must

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.560
be women in order to raise
the percent of women

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.770
population to 20%.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.180
So we're adding 50
total workers.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.740
So how many of those have to be
women in order for the new

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.740
proportion-- this is going to
be the new number of women,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.740
the number of women that are
added to the 75 that were

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.190
already there-- divided by the
500 workers who were there,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.940
plus the 50, some of whom
might be women.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.640
So this now has to equal 20%.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:21.930
We get 75 plus w over
550 is equal to 0.2.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.300
So we get 75 plus the number of
women that need to be added

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.340
is equal to 0.02 times 550.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.970
We multiply both sides
times 550.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:44.900
That equals 110.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.320
And then subtract 75
from both sides.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.010
Women has to be equal
to 110 minus 75.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:57.920
And that's equal to-- 25 plus
10-- that's equal to 35.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.680
35 of the 50 employees
have to be women.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.470
And that's what they asked.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.930
How many of the additional
workers must be women?

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.180
So that's choice E.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:14.810
Next question, 132.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.220
At a small snack shop, the
average arithmetic mean

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.750
revenue was $400 per day
over a 10 day period.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.440
So the average over
10 days was $400.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.600
During this period, if the
average daily revenue was $360

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.010
for the first 6 days-- so the
average of 6 days was $360--

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.390
what was the average daily
revenue for the last 4 days?

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.060
So we've done a lot of
problems like this.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.590
Hopefully this is a bit of
second nature if you've

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.080
watched the solution
to the other ones.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.500
But what's the average
of all of them?

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.020
It's the average of
the first 6 days.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.110
We can almost assume that the
first 6 days had exactly $360

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.240
in revenue.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.680
So their average times 6.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.580
So this would be the total
revenue of the first 6 days

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.950
plus what's the total revenue
of the next 4 days?

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.140
It's going to be the average
of the next 4 days times 4.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.690
That would be the total
of those 4.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.500
We're not saying that they all
have to be exactly the

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.550
average, but when you sum them
all up they're equal to the

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.320
average times 4.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.120
Now if you divide all of those,
this is a total of the

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.050
revenue all 10 days.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.580
If you take that sum and divide
it by 10, you get the

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.010
average for the 10 days.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.555
And that is equal to $400.

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:30.430
Let's simplify this
a little bit.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.725
Let's see what we could do.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:44.820
So we get 360 times 6 plus the
average for 4 days times 4 is

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:50.570
equal to 10 times 400,
which is 4,000.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.390
Before I get too involved in
multiplication, let's divide

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.720
both sides of this
equation by 4.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.990
So 360 divided by 4, that's 90,
times 6 plus this divided

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.320
by 4 plus A4 is equal
to 1,000.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.890
90 times 6 is 540 plus
the average of the 4

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.310
days is equal to 1,000.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.540
So the average of the 4 days is
equal to 1,000 minus 540.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.160
Which is what?

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.460
That's $460 per day.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.180
And that's choice D.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.260
And I'm out of time.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.010
See you in the next video.
