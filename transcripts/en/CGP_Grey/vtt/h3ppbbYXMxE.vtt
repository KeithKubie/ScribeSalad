00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.930
Hello Internet

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.940
In my last video about Pluto you may have noticed,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.630
that i said aloud the names of every planet except one:

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.530
This one

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.180
And that was no accident,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.330
but rather the result of carefull script editing.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.710
Because, where i grew up,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.170
i learned that the name of the seventh planet

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.430
is pronounced "yoo-Rain-us".

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.140
Of course to a kid "yoo-Rain-us" sounds an awful lot like "your-Anus",

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.140
which is how i and everyone i knew ended up saying the name.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.010
Which is 
funny when you're a child, but becomes a bit of a problem, if you grew 
up

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.990
and trying to teach scientific facts about the planet.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.180
for example:

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.740
Uranus has a ring around it.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.120
Astronomers have discoverd a dark spot on Uranus.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.780
Uranus is a gas giant.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.960
Uranus is surrounded by methane.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.400
There is a solution to this problem, the alternative pronunsiation of 
the name,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.990
wich goes:
YUR-in-us

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:44.239
And most scientists in public roles do use this pronunciation.

00:00:44.473 --> 00:00:46.657
But for me YUR-in-us is still problematic.

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.794
Sure, it's better then your-Anus, but it's still URINE-us.

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:52.801
And perhaps i'm just childish, but when someone else says YUR-in-us,

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:57.189
i still hear your-ANUS in my head and it just draws more
attention to the unfortunate name.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.917
The tragedy is, it didn't have to be this way.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:03.046
The seventh planet from the sun is unique because it's the first Planet we discovered.

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:09.691
For all of human history the sixth closest planets were big enough or bright enough to see with just our 
limited simian eyes.

00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:16.771
But the next planet was to dim to see until our telescope technology got good enough for british 
astronomer Wilhelm Herschel to spot it in 1781.

00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:24.500
Understandably though he didn't think he discoverd a new planet, since from the 
rise of modern humans 50 thousand years earlier until that Thursday no one ever had.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.427
But discover he did and so choose a 
name he must

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.940
and Herschel, being the good subject of the crown that he was,

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:33.566
christened his new planet "The Georgium Sidis", 
which means "The Georgian Star".

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:38.392
And the George in "The Georgian Star" was King George the third the reigning monarch.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.953
While King George liked the name, the rest of the world did not

00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:44.961
and decided that perhaps Herschel wasn't the best guy to name the 
new planet after all

00:01:44.977 --> 00:01:47.560
and quickly decided to come up with alternatives of their own.

00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:53.874
One suggestion was Neptun, which is confusing to us now, but at the time the planet that would become Neptun had 
not yet been found.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:57.757
A more obvious alternative was to name the planet Herschel after the man who discovered it.

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:04.750
Even in Great Britain the name "The Georgium Sidis" proofed a bit stuffy for some, so variance like "The Georgian Planet", 
or just "Georgium" were also used.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.358
Though never, as you might have heard, "George". 

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:08.307
Sidenote here:

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:15.632
While researching this video i found a lot of websites claiming that the seventh planet was almost 
named "George", but i was never able to find a primary source for this.

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:20.029
As best i could tell searching from documents 
from the time no one ever suggested this name.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.681
I checked with the Royal Institution who, since 1799, has been 
promoting sciences awesomeness from the heart of London and whose videos you should now go watch,

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:32.224
and they confirmed the 
name "George" was never on the table, because to so casual refer to the King at the time would have been disrespectful.

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:35.568
And disrespect a monarch is never a good idea.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:40.790
Especially one who is slowly loosing his mind from a genetic disorder, but that's a story for another time.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.221
Anyway, another real suggestion for the new planets name came from Johann Bode who suggested the greek god of the sky.

00:02:46.307 --> 00:02:53.626
When a colleague of Bode discovered the 92 element in 1789, he named it Uranium to support Bode's choice and try and 
end the debate.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.866
Perhaps because these two were German it might not have occurred to them how the word would eventually be corrupted in english. 

00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:04.106
Though it's also hard to know how english speakers in the 1780's and 90's 
would have pronounced the name. 

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:06.277
But since the word anus was in the language then, 

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:09.796
it seems unlikely, that this particular pronunciation would have been popular. 

00:03:09.905 --> 00:03:13.274
It may also have been pronunced with a flat "a" to sound like 
yoo-RA-nus, 

00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:16.007
or something more like the Greek name oo-RON-ohs. 

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:18.192
These names competed with each other over decades, 

00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:18.932
for example: 

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:22.572
still in 1823, the Encyclopedia Britannica list the planet as "Herschel",

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:24.463
notes the alternative names

00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:28.765
and then proceeds to carefully word the rest of the artikel to avoid naming the planet again. 

00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:33.969
With you a dear modern day 
viewer know that eventually this alternatives faded and left this name triumphant.

00:03:34.044 --> 00:03:39.587
Which leaves someone like me with 
my terrible pronunciation longing for history to have taken a different path.

00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:45.519
The name "Herschel" might have made the planet sound a bit like a boring accountant rather than a very intresting planet 
it actually is,

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.040
but this would still be a much better name than what we have.

00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:52.598
Neptune is obviously a fine planetary name 
though picking this might have just delayed the problem. 

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:59.060
finally "The Georgium Sidis" is a bit awkward and in sillier moments i wish that Herschel had just been more direct and 
named it "King George",

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:02.227
because how fun would that make it to teach kids the list of planets today.

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:06.308
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, King George and Neptun.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:13.090
In classrooms such an unusual name would change the planet from a thing to avoid to a starting point for a 
discussion about what makes that Planet different 

00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:17.249
and how astronomy and our view of the universe change and 
progress over time.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.401
But my impractical dreams aside we're stuck with this name,

00:04:20.598 --> 00:04:27.796
which for me means choosing between 
the pronunciation which comes naturally and is terrible, or the unnatural awkward one which is still unsatisfactory.

00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:29.269
So what's a man to do? 

00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:34.123
In the end, probably follow the lead of the Encyclopaedia Britannica and avoid the name when 
possible.

00:04:34.276 --> 00:04:38.387
Which is a sad fate for the planet in our solar system with such an interesting story to tell.

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:56.693
Seriously people, could we at least agree to switch the pronunciation back to the greek oo-RON-ohs? It's clearly so 
much better.
