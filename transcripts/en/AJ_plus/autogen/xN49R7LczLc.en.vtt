00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.399
- This is me holding,

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:02.257
- [Cameraman] Hold it, hold it.

00:00:02.257 --> 00:00:03.090
fileting

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.160
and eating

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.560
a scary, venomous fish.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.510
- The venom is inside those needles.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.110
- And this is not me hunting it.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.040
Hi I'm Yara and I'm in Florida

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.603
to learn about the lionfish.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.770
A terrifyingly, beautiful creature

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.710
that's actually destroying coral reefs

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.610
in the Western Atlantic.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.770
It's what's known as an invasive species,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.140
meaning it's an invader that's
not native to these waters

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.470
and it's basically eating
everything that moves.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.080
Including tons of helpful little fish

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.780
that keep the coral reefs healthy.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.583
Oh my god!

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.010
And because the lionfish doesn't have any

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.340
natural predators around here,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.830
it's population has exploded
over the past few decades.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.010
But conservationists have come up

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.370
with a unique campaign to fight back,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.833
encouraging people to eat it.

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.810
- It's very tasty table fare.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.440
- [Yara] Today there
are lionfish festivals,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.310
lionfish cookbooks,
lionfish hunting derbies,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.750
celebrity chef appearances,
supermarket partnerships

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.293
and even battle slogans.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.080
By hunting and eating
lionfish so the argument goes,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.150
you are helping save the coral reef.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.780
But how did this invader get here?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.900
How do you cook and eat a venomous fish?

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.620
And can you really eat them to beat them?

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.499
To find out, we decided to
go hunting for lionfish.

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:17.332
Boom!

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.030
So we are on our way, the
lighting here is better.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.030
We are on our way to Islamorada
also known as Islamorada.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.932
Also known as an island
from "Jurassic Park".

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:31.265
(Screaming)

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.050
- That was a joke for you.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.383
- To go out spearfishing for lionfish.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.242
(Sneezes)

00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:40.400
We are almost there.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.900
We're here in Islamorada,
trying to find our hotel.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.360
This feels like Jurassic Park.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.870
When the rain starts coming down,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.813
the T-Rex is unleashed into the wild.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.220
Over breakfast, I envisioned
the glorious day ahead.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.500
It's a sail and then this is the water.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.900
Those are my legs, they're
long like mermaid legs.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.140
Mermaids don't have legs.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.790
This is me heroically
spearfishing a lionfish.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.290
And here's the sun, it's blue.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.760
- [Tabish] You literally had yellow.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.750
- Okay so I obviously had
no concept of spearfishing,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.650
but that's okay.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.080
We met up with two people that do.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.680
Hey guys.
- Hey Yara.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.220
- That's Eric and that's Jack.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.570
Wave for like five seconds.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.930
Eric's been hunting
lionfish for over a decade.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.990
So he and Jack were going to
take us along on their charter,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.080
to show us how it's done.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.763
I am now boarding the charter.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.984
(dramatic violin music)

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.000
Oh God that's probably
not a good, there we go.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.290
So where we heading now?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.420
- We are heading out to one of my extra,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.580
special secret spots.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.040
- We struck something with the anchor.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.600
Have they legalized the
hunting of this fish?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.080
- Yes, every single other
fish that is legal to fish,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.180
there's regulations.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.130
Lionfish is open all the time,
no regulations, go get 'em.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.800
- And they're doing that essentially to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.010
- Control the populations.
There's not much else we can do.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.970
You can't catch 'em hook and
line because they don't bite.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.370
You have to go down there and spear them.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.950
They like to be on structure
and they don't move.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.880
- They cling to things.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.080
- They cling to things

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.860
and then they'll eat everything there.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.520
- But how exactly are these
fish such efficient killers?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.370
Let me explain or better yet,

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.620
let's have the "Planet Earth" guy explain.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.020
- [Narrator] In the coral reefs

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.910
off the Florida coast,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.910
there is a thriving ecosystem
of fish, big and small.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.097
But there is one creature
that does not belong,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.483
the lionfish.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.600
It's hypnotizing spines are full of venom

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.550
but that's not what it
uses to hunt it's lunch.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.940
Instead, the lionfish
slowly stalks it's prey,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.763
then without a moment to spare it strikes.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.490
The lionfish will eat anything

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.253
it can stretch its mouth around,

00:03:52.253 --> 00:03:56.020
including other lionfish
if it comes to that.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.490
Its stomach can fit more than thirty time

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:00.930
(Sneezing)

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.980
- Okay I'll stop, I'll stop.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.300
Lionfish are actually
native to the Indo-Pacific

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.740
where natural predators help keep

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.410
their populations in check.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.160
But as for how they got here,
it's hard to know for sure.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.470
The leading theory is
that some aquarium owners

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.090
dump these exotic pets into the ocean.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.470
Another story says a
giant hotel accidentally

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.330
emptied it's aquarium into the sea.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.570
Whatever it may have been,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.750
lionfish were first spotted
off the Atlantic coast

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.330
back in the mid 1980s.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.870
It wasn't a big deal initially,

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.860
but because they have no
natural predators here

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.080
their population multiplied rapidly

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.380
and soon they were being
spotted all over the place.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.890
I mean female lionfish can release

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.310
more than 2 million eggs per year.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.430
Now not all non-native
species obliterate ecosystems.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.100
But the lionfish does,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.350
which is why scientists call it invasive.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.380
It systematically wipes out
local prey and predators.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.410
And it's reduced some
native fish populations

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.980
by as much as 80% and some of these fish

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.750
are crucial to the
health of the coral reef.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.370
Like the ones that eat excess algae,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.270
allowing enough sunlight and
oxygen to reach the corals.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.880
Coral reefs are vital on so many levels.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.670
They host the highest density of species

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.590
of any underwater ecosystem.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.050
And they even help protect
us humans from floods

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.230
and storm surges.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.730
So if they shrink or disappear,

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.640
environmental disasters
could get much worse.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.223
All that destruction because
of this colorful, spiky fish.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.490
So we're back on the boat and
ready to hunt lionfish.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.230
Eric, I have a question for you.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.063
- Yes sir.

00:05:27.063 --> 00:05:29.440
- [Yara] What is this device
you have in your hand?

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.420
- This is our high-tech lionfish slayer

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.973
and all it is a three-barbed pole spear.

00:05:35.973 --> 00:05:38.170
Put it in the crook of
your hand like this,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.400
you reach down, pop.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.233
- [Yara] Dang wait

00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:42.066
can you do that again?
- Yeah

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:43.440
- You push a button, and you do that?
- No.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.870
You just reach down, grab
it, go up to the lionfish

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.703
and let it go.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.820
- So I don't have a scuba
license, which is okay

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.730
but that means I can't go
spearfishing with them.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.553
But what I can do is snorkel.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.773
Hold on I'm just gonna
go a little slowly.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.200
- [Tabish] It's cold?
- It is cold.

00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:08.990
This is excellent, I'm so good at this.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.640
Where are these guys?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.766
- [Tabish] Front, that way, that way.

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:13.633
- Oh God okay. Alrighty.

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:16.142
Well this snorkeling gear
isn't working the best.

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.393
(laughing)

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:19.473
I think I swallowed quite a bit of water.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.093
I'm gonna find them with this GoPro.
- [Tabish] Okay.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.510
I cannot see them, but I believe

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.250
they may be spearfishing the lionfish.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.380
Turned out, our divers weren't having

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.550
very much luck down there.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.210
Rough weather had made for murky waters.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.360
Did you guys find anything?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.707
- We didn't, the visibility is too bad.

00:06:42.707 --> 00:06:45.090
- But little did we know,
deep below the surface

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.033
on his third dive, Eric
struck the lionfish jackpot.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.360
- [Yara] And he wasted
no time spearing them.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.630
- [Tabish] Wow.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.610
- Yeah buddy, we got a haul
here. We got some big ones.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.610
- I'll take this up.

00:07:09.004 --> 00:07:11.970
- [Yara] Holy, alright. Holy Mother, okay

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.020
- [Eric] Watch your feet, they flop.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.080
- Holy mother okay, the question I have is

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.000
how venomous are these things right now?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.580
- Oh they're venomous four days from now.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.640
So we put them out (flopping)

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.720
- Jack, you have been stung before.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.553
Where did you get stung?

00:07:26.553 --> 00:07:28.240
- In the hand, it's
usually always in the hand.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.073
- What happened to your hand?

00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:31.410
- It swells up, big enough
you can't even make a fist

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.260
for a couple days.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.320
- It just is insanely, insanely painful.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.920
They're like hypodermic needles.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.410
When this thing dies, that
venom stays in these spines.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.900
- [Yara] Holy crap

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.000
Oh my god. It just ate that.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.830
- They've found up to 50 fish
like this in one stomach.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.440
- [Yara] Jesus they have
a voracious appetite.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.273
- [Jack] Voracious.

00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:53.530
- If you're a certified diver
and you're coming to the Keys,

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.980
this is a fun activity.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.450
We'll go out, we'll spear 'em,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.580
take them to the local restaurant,

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.500
they'll prepare it for ya.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.510
And you get to help the reefs
out by getting these things

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.550
out of there and fill your
belly up at the same time.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.930
- So who's winning here,
humans or the lionfish?

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.290
Well scientists agree that
completely eradicating

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.950
the lionfish from these waters
is impossible at this point.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.280
But studies have shown that hunting

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.580
and removing enough of them

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.210
can allow native fish
populations to bounce back,

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.200
at least temporarily.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.850
That's why conservationist have hosted

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.880
tons of lionfish hunting derbies.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.300
And led a campaign
encouraging people to eat them,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.920
and supermarkets to sell them.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.860
But how does one actually
eat a venomous fish?

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.080
We headed up the Florida
coast to a town called Deland,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.560
to meet with a chef who
was going to teach us

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.981
how to safely filet and eat a lionfish.

00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:34.222
- Hey.
- Hey guys! How are you?

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.118
- Nice to meet you. I'm Yara.
- How's it going? Hari.

00:08:36.118 --> 00:08:37.330
- So everything's like super natural.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.550
- [Tabish] The introduction is so natural.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.550
- Yes now it's natural. We
didn't have to actually fake ...

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.910
- Hari runs an awarding winning
restaurant called "Cress".

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.750
It's centered on the
idea of sustainability

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.260
and eating the invasive lionfish

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.760
is very much a part of that mission.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.883
- Have you ever eaten lionfish?

00:08:48.883 --> 00:08:51.890
- I have never eaten
lionfish, it looks uh ...

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.200
It doesn't look friendly.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.550
- So the venom for this
lionfish lives in these spines.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.100
- Let's de-venomize it.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.380
- So do you want to cut
them off, you don't have to.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.290
- No, no you know let's
do it big boy style.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.480
First we had to filet this thing.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.333
I am holding venomous spikes in my hand.

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:06.253
- Yeah you are.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.110
- [Yara] Then we pan roasted it.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.853
- A little bit of salt, pepper.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.270
This is the time to put the thyme.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.210
- Yes, I love puns.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.416
- Oh voila
- Okay

00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:21.420
- Turn it over.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.450
Lemon, dry white wine, butter –
And we also have a sauce now.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.913
We serve it with some
rice, some vegetables.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.470
- [Yara] Next up some lionfish ceviche.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.018
- Equal part lime juice, lemon juice, orange juice.

00:09:32.018 --> 00:09:33.168
The zest.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.770
I'm from India so I'm always sneaking

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.470
ginger and garlic into everything.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.360
Shallots, go for it.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.460
Extra virgin olive oil,
coconut milk, cilantro.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.520
We're just going to get the fish

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.840
and put some fish in there.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.270
Just want to submerge it all the way

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.660
so the acid has a chance to do its thing.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.000
And that's ceviche.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.260
- [Yara] Then some lionfish cakes.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.830
- I wanna smoke this whole
carcass and pull the meat out.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:57.663
- Oh we're gonna keep the spikes too?

00:09:57.663 --> 00:09:59.253
- Gonna leave everything in there.

00:10:00.752 --> 00:10:02.960
Our alley smoker, which
you smell a little bit.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.120
- Yeah, it smells like flavor.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.261
- Just try to get the big
chunks of meat that you can.

00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:09.100
- Oh I wanna make one of those.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.900
- [Hari] Flatten it up a little bit.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.003
- Nice.
- Tasty?

00:10:17.003 --> 00:10:20.470
- Mmmhmm. It taste very
terrestrial, the sturdiness of it.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.763
When you bite into it, there's
a little more pushback.

00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:28.070
Yeah this is really good.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.903
How is it?

00:10:28.903 --> 00:10:30.420
- Wow!

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.253
That's really good.

00:10:31.253 --> 00:10:33.150
- Does ceviche normally have coconut milk?

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.738
- No but Hari's ceviche does.

00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:35.710
(laughs)

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.120
- The creaminess is being
counter balanced by the acid.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.180
We gotta give you some too.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.920
Did it turn out like it normally does?

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.753
- Delicious.

00:10:43.753 --> 00:10:44.870
You know if you look at something

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.050
that's supposedly venomous
and you think when you eat it

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.230
it's going to be astringent,
it's going to be bitter

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.820
because maybe I'm eating poison.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.375
But clearly we've left the toxin out

00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:54.208
of whatever we're serving
- Right, it's just in the

00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:55.540
spikes.
- It's just in the spikes.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.940
As you can very well see, this is a great,

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.430
clean, white flaky fish.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.130
It's got a natural sweetness
and I think part of it

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.520
comes from the fact that
something's gonna taste like

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.390
what it eats.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.350
So they eat the young of shellfish,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.080
snapper, grouper, what have you.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.950
So they're eating people food.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.270
- You know, it's interesting.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.630
Humans are likely to blame
for the lionfish problem.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.630
Now, it's up to humans to make
sure the coral reefs survive.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.740
And human consumption can
generate more demand for lionfish,

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.140
which means more diving and more hunting.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.390
And maybe in the future there
will be more efficient ways

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.600
to remove lionfish, like this
specialized lionfish trap.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.973
Or this lionfish vacuum.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.610
Or maybe local predators
will learn how to eat them.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.443
- Life

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.503
finds a way.

00:11:38.503 --> 00:11:40.220
- [Yara] For now, if you
want to help the coral reef

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.600
and you eat meat try
some lionfish civiche.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.600
You won't regret it.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.470
Hey guys, thanks for making it this far.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.303
Okay, two things.

00:11:48.303 --> 00:11:50.080
One, yes I say holy mother a lot.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.350
And two, we actually did
eat the lionfish cake,

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.430
we just didn't film it.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.280
They were amazing. Anyway if
