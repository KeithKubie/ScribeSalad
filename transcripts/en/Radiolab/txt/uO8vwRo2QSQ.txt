Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is radio lab. Robert is traveling, uh, today. So it's just me and, uh, today we have a very different kind of story than we've ever done. Uh, it comes from a journalist and filmmaker named Luis trays. And an interesting thing kind of happened as we were reporting. This sounds pretty clear. Yeah. It's gotta be a landline. Luis and a, one of our producers, Tim Howard had, uh, called up this Guy Vladimir [inaudible], uh, who is a filmmaker himself, Cuban guy, exile. And the interview happened to be just a few hours after, um, Obama had made that big announcement today, the United States of America is changing its relationship with the people of Cuba and the most significant changes in our policy and more than 50 years that happened just before the interview. Hello? Is this Vladimir? Hey, we're recording. Yes, it's flooding me. Vladimir, how are you doing? This is Tim in New York, and we also have Luis. Hi. [inaudible]. It's a if Lewis, how are you Lewis? Good. Good. And love the news now. Yeah. Amazing News, right? I was crying. Really? Yeah, I was crying, man.

Speaker 2:          01:08          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:11          First of all, you know, I've been here in the United State for 20 years and I never, never think that I was gonna see the state. You know, really, we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries because east has been 55, 50 year, 53 years since the United States. You know, bro, the relationship with diplomatic relationship with the [inaudible]. Yeah. And nothing happened in Cuba. You know, everybody sees it the same.

Speaker 2:          01:42          No.

Speaker 3:          01:43          Everything is going to change.

Speaker 4:          01:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:56          today, a collaboration, uh, with, uh, a fantastic program. Radio and Volante Luis tress comes to us from them. This is a story that predates the stuff you've been hearing the news in many ways. It's maybe a tiny dark

Speaker 1:          02:11          amble too. All of that stuff. It's a story about Cuba, the power of music and a group of Cuban kids who decide to opt out in this crazy way that when Lewis Tris told us about it, we almost couldn't believe. So the reason we called up laddy is that we wanted to hear the backstory of all of this. Wow. I was pouring peanut Rio in 1964 tell me about what it was like for you to be a kid. I wasn't happy because in Cuba we didn't have any information. We didn't have any communication with anybody else. High Q1. Right. And anybody seen that we receive it was the, you know, the news that they go, I mean, want to give us to us [inaudible] he remembers listening to

Speaker 5:          03:00          endless field Castro's speeches on the radio. I remember when I was a kid in elementary school all the time they were teaching us that

Speaker 3:          03:08          Rochelle [inaudible],

Speaker 5:          03:12          what's the big country in the world? The big economy. And every scene we would hope east to be like, Dang. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          03:19          It was a given that he would get in line every year to get his story.

Speaker 5:          03:24          You know, are you only got three toys every year because of rationing. Exactly. And then every week he and his folks would wake up, they would go to the Knicks nearest church to throw eggs at the church building, throw eggs at the church. Why? Because we didn't believe in God, the government, they didn't believe in God. You know, that's,

Speaker 6:          03:42          that's how you showed you were a good revolutionary and Vladimir was just being a good boy. But when he turns 14 there comes a day when a friend takes him aside and shows him a video of led Zeppelin.

Speaker 5:          03:55          I remember that day. I remember like, do you remember what lights up on Song? It was costumer

Speaker 3:          04:02          [inaudible] cashmere. Oh yeah, yeah. Coaching was my first time and I hear the music. How did it, how did it make you feel when you heard cashmere? Whoa. Differ.

Speaker 5:          04:20          You know, you see role playing and you see you me page with those long hair. They moved on. They had,

Speaker 3:          04:28          I gave her a rabbit and the scene love, they say you must read different

Speaker 7:          04:43          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          04:43          And because his dad was completely changed, [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          04:49          completely changed my life. Let me tell you, completely changed my life. He's not sure why, but in that moment I went from English, Islam to Freaky, freaky and went to freaky. What is, what is freaky? So freaky. These are what Cubans call the most extreme metal heads. Hard rock punk rockers. We start waving

Speaker 5:          05:17          the close close with whole a long hair problem. Was that given the Cuban one radio station didn't put any rock music down. I remember when I was 19 years old, 20 years old, my father giving a Russian radio and he was a good at fam. We went to the, to the roof or some friends because in those rooms you can listen today. A station from Florida.

Speaker 3:          05:43          Yeah. Oh Man.

Speaker 5:          05:46          We've listened. Running style. A sympathy with the devil. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          05:52          Hello. Hello. Hello baby man.

Speaker 5:          05:59          Mighty man. You know we were decided though. Listen, Berryman and I said that I didn't like it in the beginning. Everything that came from there in English, it was good. You know, because I don't know that King of Muesli. Give us another

Speaker 8:          06:15          door.

Speaker 9:          06:17          Two ladies walking around with ripped jeans, long hair. And that's fine. It's a normal youth rebellion. But then in the late eighties everything changes.

Speaker 7:          06:29          Mr Gorbachev Open this gate.

Speaker 3:          06:37          [inaudible] Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall. The Wall Berlin Wall went down. They are here in the thousands. They are here in the tens of thousands and in reaction. Hey [inaudible] smoke the Casto government. Dugin [inaudible] [inaudible] says [inaudible] one thing or death.

Speaker 7:          07:04          The slogan is painted freshly all over Havana, socialism or death. Suddenly music you listen to became very ideological and if you listen to rock, you were listening to the enemy of the Cuban state. The United States government created a police presence in every neighborhood, every five blocks, and Vladimir says, the police found you and you had long hair. They'd beat us, kick us, send you away to work, putting sugarcane in the cane fields. That's like that booth in school. They'd often cut your hair against your will. He wasn't abused.

Speaker 10:         07:39          And just to jump in, this is the point in the story where things take a very, no other way to say it, a very punk rock turn, because into this cultural war

Speaker 9:          07:47          step's a guy named Papa Papa. We name me, he knew Popolo Papa Labella, you know Popo the bullet. I really want to say that he tried to embody that, that kind of bullet to your brain that wake up

Speaker 3:          08:05          [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          08:05          That's Bob Mariano. He's a professor at southern Oregon University. He went several times in the 90s to Cuba to interview papa who he calls the Kurt Cobain of the free keys. Yeah. He looked very intense.

Speaker 9:          08:18          Who was cocky and confident and just charismatic. Super Tall. Skinny. Yeah. He always wear a American flag. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. He like a Bandana. Use Holly User two friends [inaudible] his sous Diaz and Lisa Nandis who is also a bad native is [inaudible] Eh [inaudible] so Louis remembers the first time he met [inaudible] and it was on a night that uh, Communist Party meeting was taking place right outside his house. Outside the building. Outgoing

Speaker 11:         08:56          Gwen Papa's coming. He's coming in a bicycle and we, he's, hey a fly United state flat. He's coming on his head. Yeah, my father, my father going down a second deal. [inaudible] your father, your father, he had when he started going with the American flag on his head. [inaudible] I do crazy digging. You flat out row our you head in bubble say y y everyone outside the building. Silings

Speaker 5:          09:42          Papa was, it was a weird guy.

Speaker 7:          09:47          [inaudible] giving you a hug in the body. When we do, you can see video of Papo because Vladimir shot a documentary in 1994 where he interviewed Papo and some of the other freebies and in that documentary, papa talks about growing up poor father and he's an alcoholic, mother abandon [inaudible] by age 14 he's in the streets and a few years later he makes a decision that's really at the heart of this story from [inaudible] just to set it up so that you can understand the context yet what happened was that 1989 I think 1990 somewhere around there, the Cuban government is fighting in Angola. It's backing a leftist liberation movement and it's kind of a proxy war with the United States and in the late eighties Cuban soldiers started coming back home and some soldiers from the Cuban army they're wearing in Africa, they came with HIV,

Speaker 5:          10:50          HIV positive. Because of that, the government has all the [inaudible] tested with HIV. If you belong to a high risk group, you were tested. They went to the, to your place of war, they went to your apartment, they went to the school, they went to everybody. Wow. I remember if they went, they went to my ward and they test everybody over there and they run your station. 50 people's over there. Wow. Give me your blood. Give me your bro. Give me your broke. Give me your blood. Bloody says they would come in, take your blood and if they found that you were positive, the police came to you in the, in the police car, go straight to the cemetery. They just locked you up. Yeah, and I remember, I remember one day I was talking to him Papo and his wife. I said, look [inaudible] I want to leave free. Look, they're kicking me out. They're beating me out. They don't, they don't want me to leave like a rocket here. They are doing a lot of things to me. I'm going to do a lot of things. [inaudible] and he told me, look,

Speaker 6:          11:54          I went to this rock concert in via Clara. Papa told him I met up with these other Rutgers, they were HIV positive and I went and took a syringe, drew some blood from their arm and I put the needle in my own arm and I jammed myself with HIV. I get my tail, we would blow contaminated with you. Did HIV, you know, and I look at him said, do you know what you did? Do you know what you doing? You're going to die man. I ain't said to me, I don't care. That's crazy. That's crazy. He, he knew for sure that when he did that that he, that that was a death sentence for him. Yes. He knows Vladimir is not quite sure that the others that came after Papo really knew what they were doing but, but papa knew, remember he says Saas Helene's death and he proposed to me death is a dog.

Speaker 4:          12:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:56          when you don't have any more doors to open, death is a door coming up. That door gets wider, others walk through and for at least a beat, they find something besides that, something quite the opposite.

Speaker 4:          13:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         13:19          message one hey, my name is [inaudible] and Radiolab is supported in part by the [inaudible] foundation and have public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotlone.org Radiolab is produced by W NYC and distributed by NPR. And this method.

Speaker 1:          13:47          Hey, I'm Chad. I'm Rod. This is Radiolab. Yes. One, two, one two. Mike Chick. That's Lewis trace of radio on Bellante. Let's go back to his story about Cuba and music in the late eighties and nineties and so far a dude has made a crazy decision, dude named Popo to inject himself with HIV. Would you call the protest?

Speaker 6:          14:05          I think a papa would have called it a protest, but not the, the guys that came after

Speaker 1:          14:11          this is at a moment when there was a cultural work happening between the Castro government and anyone eat deemed antisocial, which included included kids with long hair who listened to rock. And it was also a moment where if you were found to be HIV positive in Cuba, you were forcibly quarantine.

Speaker 6:          14:26          So poppo injects himself and he gets sent to the sanitarium. And can you describe that place? Like what did he find? Well, he found a beautiful place in the middle of the [inaudible] countryside. Really? It's full of palm trees, very green, very lush farm animals roaming in. And you went there? Yes, yes I was there. I was there. And there are still farm animals. They would Romaine, a couple of cows and chickens. It's like kind of an idyllic place. So I went there to visit the last two rockers that still remain the place are some go way out and his wife Yolanda, and they're kind of like the keepers of all that went down in there, the memories. So I spent a couple of days with them and they, they walked me around and it's full of like these little housing units and you're saying this place was idyllic even back then [inaudible] are walking me through it and you're like, okay. So we would be walking around here 10 years ago and Nirvana would be coming out of here. TELECO would be coming out of the next house. Didn't see separately

Speaker 2:          15:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          15:51          no kidding. Yeah. So it was like a headbangers ball and the rear, you know, wait, why? How come they were able to have that freedom in the sanatorium but not outside. Initially the sanitarium system was under the military and it was more of a gulag. But in the late eighties, early nineties, the sanitariums went from the military being in charge to the Ministry of Health and medicine. And these were by all accounts, very progressive doctors, very concerned about their patients. They gave them all the food and medicine they needed and they were like, you want to rock out? Go ahead. So it was like a prison, but it was also kind of a little bubble of freedom. And strangely enough, they, they soon found out that they even had power. Nope. No police power. They didn't have before. Laddy told me the story. Um, patients who said the sanitarium could go out every 21 days for a day trip and some of the freak keys would go out and just by flashing their ID cards that said they were aids patients, police would leave them alone. I remember in two or three occasions that the police came after name and one of them have, say a Guineans, a Syringe, syringe full of blood, and Vladi says the guy took out the blood and waved it at the police and said, you want to come to me? Come in, came to me. And they were afraid of that.

Speaker 6:          17:24          And so word began to spread about what life was like inside the Santeria. And you have to keep in mind that outside Cuba was falling apart. Hard economic times in Cuba, the government today tightened red rationing and raised egg prices. It blamed delays in Soviet shipments to Cuba. Almost overnight after the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba was left without the massive subsidies that used to get that man

Speaker 5:          17:49          long lines for bread. Oh, a short temper. Or we were suffering that immersive survivors who never actually lived inside the sanitarium. He says that people outside were going hungry and he himself, I was waiting like a hundred pounds, 98 pounds. Oh my God. And things just kept getting worse. You'll see

Speaker 6:          18:11          hungry sunburn, dehydrated. 50,000 people leave Cuba. They managed to escape on a raft and make it to the Florida keys these days. More Cubans than ever are taking the risks.

Speaker 9:          18:21          It was the big group crisis, you know, in the Clinton era. But if you were in the sanatorium you were fine. Yeah, just being able to get milk and egg and beans. Valerie Yanno says that that was one of the big motivation for a lot of kids. Yes. I'm not going to be harassed. Yes, I'm free. And yes, I also get meals and it went from being a couple of self injectors, a couple of dozen self injectors to being hundreds. Hello.

Speaker 5:          18:53          And did the government know that this was happening?

Speaker 6:          18:55          Well [inaudible] there's this Swedish documentary from the time it's called Sociale East [inaudible] and in it there's this bishop of Abana [inaudible] [inaudible], his last name is [inaudible] and he says that he met some of the kids that were injecting themselves with aids and that at a state dinner he approached Fidel. He told him [inaudible] did these kids stare at during injecting themselves and, and [inaudible] [inaudible] couldn't believe it. Like what does [inaudible] say to you?

Speaker 5:          19:32          And then after that in the pharmacy, they don't sell cerise anymore. They put a low def [inaudible] in gather salvage HIV. You want to spend eight years in prison, but it didn't matter. It was like a movement

Speaker 3:          19:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         19:55          and all of a sudden you have all these bands forming across the island in different sanitariums in the biggest one at the mall in Santiago, La Vega. Let's go costs, which is like a half hour, 45 minutes south of five. I know you have the first group that gets formed, it's called [inaudible], which translates to HIV

Speaker 3:          20:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         20:19          but then in central of the island in this town called Santa Clara, you had the Cuban punk band is cornea and the scoria translates as scum, right? Scoria and according to Bob, if you look back to the eighties the people who were fleeing Cuba about Ceros the rafters, one of the responses of the Cuban government were billboards. That's at Camp Lai. Scoria [inaudible] let the scum leave. So to call yourself a score, [inaudible] call yourself that

Speaker 6:          20:48          is punk rock. And were these bands a big outside? The sanitorium too is Scoria is, I mean you can't talk about Cuban punk without, I mean a Skoda is like, so their tapes got out or something. Yeah, totally. It would have is next. I mean these bands are forming, kids are self-injecting does it just keep growing and growing? Yeah, but are we, I don't have [inaudible] yet. [inaudible] there's tape of uh, her son on Yolanda saying that it got to be so fashionable that kids started to think that in order to be a freaky you had to have aids. Yeah. I know that there was [inaudible] saying Amy [inaudible], which is, and the kids were saying that

Speaker 9:          21:35          really want it to be a rocker. In that time you had to have aids. It's like the, the fact that it went from 10 or 20 to 200 or more. It was obviously like this kind of just, um, joiner phenomenon of like, that's so cool. I'm going to do it too. And then [inaudible] [inaudible] there was even talk among some of the young people I met of thinking that, oh, eventually feed ELL and those guys will find a cure. You're going to find a cure for this. Cuba with a bell, one of the best health care systems in the western hemisphere. We're going to leave forever.

Speaker 6:          22:10          When everything started to change, when the first of them died

Speaker 4:          22:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          22:17          according to [inaudible], the first kid that died in [inaudible], the view was a guy named Manuel. We don't know his last name or his age. He was the first one. The second day I wanted to set a date, anybody to stop at one point in Hillary's documentary, which was made in 1994 [inaudible] that in two years [inaudible] about 18 people died [inaudible] and on their style scene, how you die because you don't die like a normal person and had a heart attack or anything. No, you transform yourself.

Speaker 7:          22:51          A lot of them went blind. Then they went insane. They started getting opportunistic diseases. You know how eats works. Seeing that as Dan sinking and my, what they did

Speaker 4:          23:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          23:04          did kids start saying they wish they hadn't done this? Well, when you see bloodies documentary and that Swedish documentary, sociologist one went to summit in 1995. Yeah. You definitely see the kids having deep regrets. You have one of them saying,

Speaker 7:          23:20          you gotta be entirely [inaudible]. I regret this. I regret it a million times. [inaudible] how about Papa?

Speaker 9:          23:30          Well, I don't, I never heard Papa, uh, ever questioned that he had done it.

Speaker 4:          23:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          23:39          and in that Swedish documentary, there's a scene towards the end where you see poppo and he's sick. He's real thin. His face is swollen.

Speaker 7:          23:48          I remember he's had like [inaudible] and stepping into an evangelical church. He's wearing a nirvana tee shirt, but he's become a fervent Christian man. He's found this community of Evan Delco Christians that accepts aids patients is still taunting the government because he says, oh, you still a rocker. And that he thinks that Christ is the perfect communist. More communists were like the Christians. That would be perfect. It's interesting though, because in that last video we also see him taking English classes.

Speaker 3:          24:29          Oh, you fine.

Speaker 7:          24:33          I know. And he's saying like, you know, I told him from the other patients in the sanitarium, they're like sick like me. They won't go out at night. They won't rock out till the early morning, but I'm like going know this is my life.

Speaker 6:          24:52          So he was sort of defined to the end. Yeah. C a [inaudible] and a few months later, or according to Gerson bubble started to bleed out from his mouth. He but do it online too. They lay down the an eyes book [inaudible] he had a parasite in his brain. He became a violet and he died from that disease. So it's like, I want him and he going, I'll say, yeah, part of me wonder. It's like, is this strong and fierce or is it just dumb and sad and maybe fear. It's also like, I can't figure out how to feel about this. Yeah. Well I think it can be all those things, right? It was dumb and stupid and immature and it was also nihilistic and an archaic. You think in the end it had any impact? Well, that's, that's hard to say. Um, it must have, it must have.

Speaker 1:          25:56          Here's how Lewis puts it. Not even five years after Papa died, things did start to shift in Cuba. Make it a bit what you will. But December 8th, 2000, Castro unveils a statue of John Lennon. That same year, Bob Mariano and a bunch of rock musicians including will Oldham, David Paho, they were given permission to play a bunch of rock shows in Cuba out in the open and at one of those shows and Pinar del Rio.

Speaker 7:          26:33          I announced, listen, we're going to send out this next number to Papa labella and the free keys

Speaker 3:          26:43          [inaudible] and uh, everyone sang along.

Speaker 1:          26:59          Now it would be impossible to draw any kind of cause and effect and say one thing led to another that would be ridiculous. But

Speaker 6:          27:06          Luis says that back when this free keys were streaming into the sanitorium, Cuba wasn't changing back then. It started to change precisely because of a hundred gestures big in small. He says around Cuba at that moment, there are all of these tiny, mostly silent protests taking hold. And then you have the Maliko Lasso, which was like the first serious civil disobedience that Castro had in in 94, where the mob in Havana rose up because they were so tired of the power outages. They were angry at their poor living conditions. They were leading the, uh, the city in rafts by the thousands, by the hundreds. Castro literally had to come down to the Cuban Malica and the beautiful, um, uh, seaside road that, that circles around Havana and he, he literally had to talk the mob down to, at this moment, you know, late eighties, early nineties, th there's this breeding ground of discontent all over Cuba. And I think the self injector movement is the best crystallization we have of that. Yeah. It's like the sort of a thousand points of light and this is the brightest point, right?
