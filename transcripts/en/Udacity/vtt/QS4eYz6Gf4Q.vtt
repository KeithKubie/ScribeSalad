00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.620
In persistent connections multiple HTTP requests and

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.260
responses are multiplex onto a single TCP

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.270
connection. Delimiters at the end of an HTTP request indicates the end of a

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.480
request and the content length allows the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.740
receiver to identify how long a response

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.730
is. So, the server actually has to know the size of the transfer in advance.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.330
Persistent connections can also be combined with

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.900
something call pipelining. In pipelining, a client

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.830
sends the next request as soon as it encounters a referenced object. So there's

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.560
as little as one round trip time for all referenced objects before they began

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.920
to be fetched. Persistent connections with pipelining

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.811
is the deafult behavior in, HTTP 1.1.
