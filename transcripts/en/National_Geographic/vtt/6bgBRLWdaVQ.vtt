00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:04.304
Derek Joubert:<i> Anybody who's
spent time under the stars</i>

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:07.307
<i> like this, in Botswana
 really understands.</i>

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.510
<i>Anybody who's listened to
 this call and knows it</i>

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.546
<i> will know why we fell
 in love with Africa.</i>

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:18.852
( leopard growls )

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.454
Beverly Joubert:<i> And if
the night sounds go quiet</i>

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.856
<i> it won't only be the
 leopard and the lions</i>

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.191
<i> that we will be losing.</i>

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.927
<i> It will be pretty much
 everything, all wildlife</i>

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.663
<i> and a huge part
 of our own souls.</i>

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.800
<i> So this is a pivotal
moment in time, and sadly,</i>

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.237
<i> the battle is against
 ignorance and greed.</i>

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:41.340
Dereck:<i> In Africa, this battle's
 gonna be fought</i>

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.308
<i>around three major species.</i>

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.612
<i>Elephants that we're losing
at a rate of five an hour</i>

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:49.782
<i>lions that we're losing at
 a rate of five every day</i>

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:54.487
<i>and the rhinos, we lose at
one every 6.3 hours, every day.</i>

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.991
<i>When these animals go extinct
 people will stop coming</i>

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:01.627
<i> and indeed,
 communities will suffer.</i>

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:03.763
<i> In fact, whole economies
 will go down.</i>

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:08.100 line:0%
( audience applause )

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.938 line:0%
And so, what we like to
face on is the beauty.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:16.742 line:0%
John Keats wrote that "Beauty
is truth and truth is beauty."

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:20.379 line:0%
And that's what we embody
in all our work, in our films.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.015
And the empathy that we have

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.950
when something unfolds
in front of us.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.354
And this little scene happened
a couple of months ago.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:32.558
Two lionesses wanted to cross
the river with their cubs.

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:35.794
But of course, they saw the
ripples of a crocodile going by.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.330
<i>And you could feel the tension.</i>

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.533
<i>And then of course, a little
 later, hippos came by.</i>

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.502
<i> So this really freaked
 the little cubs out</i>

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.736
<i>and they didn't wanna go.</i>

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.071
( audience laughter )

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:46.906
But, the lionesses
were determined

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.140
they needed to get across.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.875
And so, they managed
to get in the water

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.111
<i> and they got some of the
 cubs to follow with them</i>

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.546
<i> and straight away,
 the little cubs dodged</i>

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:56.315
<i>to their side of the bank again.</i>

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.817
<i> This took 12 hours,
 the whole day</i>

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:02.922
<i>and eventually, the lionesses
 got the cubs to go in.</i>

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.725
<i> But, only when they were
 midway did they realize</i>

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.660
<i> that only four cubs
 were with them.</i>

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.529
<i> But, they had to
 keep going forward.</i>

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.896
<i>And so, they went forward</i>

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:14.033
<i>got to the opposite side of the
bank, deposited those cubs</i>

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.802
only to hear on the other side,
the other cubs were calling.

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:19.505
And so, they had to re-confront

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:23.409
that crocodile infested
river and go back again.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.011
And of course, the
cubs on the other side

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.813
were thrilled to see their
mothers and wanted to play.

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.215
<i> But, the cubs--</i>

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.683
<i>their mothers now heard the
other cubs on the other side</i>

00:02:31.683 --> 00:02:33.285
<i>and so they were in a dilemma</i>

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.421
<i> and they had to try
 and sort this out.</i>

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.757
They crossed it
seven times that day.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:42.128
And eventually at dusk, they
crossed the one last time.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:43.830
( audience laughter )

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.265
And as they crossed
the one last time

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.601
the two little cubs
refused to go and

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.404
they had to leave these two cubs
on the other side and they went.

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:54.307
<i> And obviously, the
 tension in the vehicle</i>

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.909
between Dereck and I
was extreme.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.246
So, it was now gonna go into a
24 hour journey for these cubs.

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:03.449
And we waited and they waited

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.186
and at early dawn, the
two lionesses came back.

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.388
But this time, they were
almost glued together

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:12.225
<i> for their own protection
 and they were so silent.</i>

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:13.793
<i>And this is what happened.</i>

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:17.630
( instrumental music )

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:53.198
( audience applause )

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:54.333
We were thrilled.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.736
( audience applause )

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.672
So, we use beautiful
stories like this sometimes

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:00.807
to get our message across.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.708
And in this case,
we tweeted this

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.144
we used Instagram,
we used it on Facebook.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:07.480
<i>It went out to two million
 people immediately</i>

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.082
<i> because everybody was
 just engaged with this.</i>

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:12.184
We realized just the other day

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:15.354
that something quite magical
has started to happen.

00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:18.457
And in fact, people are now
taking to the streets.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:19.958
<i>This is a march for lions.</i>

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.827
<i>A global march that takes place</i>

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.630
<i> in 32 cities across
 the globe right now.</i>

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.131
<i>Who would ever have thought</i>

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:28.634
<i> that something like this
 could ever even happen?</i>

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:32.505
So, Beverly was talking about
the ignorance and greed.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.740
Something that happened
in Kenya recently

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.243
is really fighting ignorance.

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:45.851 line:0%
<i>As we stood at these piles
 of ivory being burned</i>

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:49.454 line:0%
<i>we stood in silent memory of
the elephants that we've known</i>

00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:51.424 line:0%
<i> and the ones that
 we will never know.</i>

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:54.026
 Beverly:<i> And I think,
 it's important to know</i>

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:58.731
<i>that inside these piles of
 ivory, 11 piles of ivory</i>

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:01.600
<i> was a lot of confiscated
 big cat skins.</i>

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.235
<i>Lions, leopards and cheetah.</i>

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:07.139 line:0%
<i>What's happening to elephants
is happening to the cats.</i>

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.074 line:0%
<i> And then who would've
 thought that</i>

00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:13.279 line:0%
<i>the military would be working
with us to protect rhinos</i>

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.449
<i> to relocate them to
a safe haven in Botswana?</i>

00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:22.021
<i>So, the goal is to combat greed</i>

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:25.858 line:0%
<i> and to secure large
 protected landscapes.</i>

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:30.396 line:0%
Derek:<i> With the big cat work</i>

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:32.665 line:0%
<i>we've had the opportunity
 to really focus</i>

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.733 line:0%
<i> on what works and
 what doesn't work.</i>

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:36.135 line:0%
<i> And we've come down
 to the notion</i>

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:40.039 line:0%
<i>that there are four major
 causes of declines.</i>

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.807 line:0%
<i> Twenty five percent
 of the declines</i>

00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:44.343 line:0%
<i>on the cats is habitat loss.</i>

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:49.348 line:0%
<i>So, it's ultimately important
to protect wild landscapes.</i>

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:52.551 line:0%
<i>Poaching is another major
pillar of these declines.</i>

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:55.755 line:0%
<i>And so, we spent four and a half
months paddling up the river</i>

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:58.824 line:0%
<i> from the Okavango to the
 northern river systems</i>

00:05:58.824 --> 00:06:02.628
<i> in the northern part of
Botswana, checking on poaching.</i>

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:03.863
<i> The good news is</i>

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.164
<i>this is the highest density
of elephants in the world</i>

00:06:06.164 --> 00:06:08.434
<i>and the poaching is very low.</i>

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:11.303
<i>The bad news is, they weren't
 always happy to see us.</i>

00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:13.439
( audience laughter )

00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:23.249
( instrumental music )

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:29.222
( audience laughter )

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:39.031
Beverly:<i> So, we've spent
 the last 35 years</i>

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:42.702
<i>filming and focusing all our
attention on the big cats.</i>

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:47.340
<i> Protecting these
 magnificent creatures.</i>

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.942
<i>How can you not be in awe?</i>

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:54.046
<i>How can anybody not be in
awe of this amazing lion?</i>

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:55.915
<i> But, they've led
 us on a journey.</i>

00:06:57.883 --> 00:07:01.988
So, six years ago, we were
shocked when we discovered

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:06.492
that we were losing
95 percent of all these cats

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:09.562
in just 50 years.
That's alarming.

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.931
And so that's where
we co-founded

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.500
the Big Cat Initiative
with National Geographic.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.304
<i> And as you can see, we
 now have great progress.</i>

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:21.740
<i> We have 91 projects
 in 27 countries.</i>

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.810
Many of them are right
through Africa.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.278
We've managed to give out

00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:30.016
<i> over three million US
 dollars in grants.</i>

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:33.385
<i> So, all our goal
 is to now protect</i>

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:36.188
<i> these last living and
 thriving big cats.</i>

00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:37.923
We need to be successful.

00:07:37.923 --> 00:07:41.594
One of the other big
pillars of decline is hunting.

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:45.998
So, we still lose 660
largely male lions a year

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.633
<i>to the hunting industry, and</i>

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.535 line:0%
<i> a lot of that
 comes into the USA.</i>

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:52.838 line:0%
<i> One point two million
trophies in the last 10 years</i>

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:54.239 line:0%
<i> into the United States.</i>

00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:55.674
So, we've reached out

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:58.210
and we've tried to do whatever
we can in this regard.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:03.048
And we've spoken to
governments around the world.

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:04.317
<i>We're already starting to see</i>

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.586
some very, very interesting
things at this crossroads.

00:08:07.586 --> 00:08:11.857
The US government has announced
that they will be restricting

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:14.560
lion trophies coming
into the United States.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.029
Similar conversations are
happening in Australia

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:19.965
in Netherlands,
the European Community.

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:21.867
Everything is now
starting to close down.

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:23.034
We've spoken to airlines.

00:08:23.034 --> 00:08:24.570
We started this
conversation with airlines.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.972
There are 42 airlines today

00:08:26.972 --> 00:08:29.442
that refuse to carry
hunting trophies.

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.844
So, we are having
quite an impact

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.279
and that's what we're
so pleased about.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.847
And then, we need to look
at the successes in Africa.

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:39.018
<i>There has been some policy
 changes in governments.</i>

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:41.787
Botswana stopped
all lion hunting

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.556
and then in 2011 stopped
all leopard hunting.

00:08:44.556 --> 00:08:47.726
Twenty-fourteen,
they decided no hunting,

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:49.395
<i> completely shut down.</i>

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:52.197
<i> Uganda followed in the
 footsteps of Botswana</i>

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:53.899
<i> and they stopped
 big cat hunting.</i>

00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:55.968
<i> And now, all hunting.</i>

00:08:55.968 --> 00:09:00.139
South Sudan followed and they
have now stopped all hunting.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.274
<i> A little different
 with South Africa.</i>

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:03.409
<i> South Africa has put</i>

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:07.145
a moratorium on leopards,
for a year.

00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:09.782
But that shows that we
can't be complacent

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:11.918
we need to drive forward.

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.520
The fourth big pillar,
of course, is communities

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.689
that live next to these
big wildlife populations

00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:19.658
<i> and are now in
 conflict with them.</i>

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:21.393
<i> We have a
 number of grantees that</i>

00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:24.697
<i>are working with communities
largely to reduce the conflict</i>

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:27.266
<i>with cattle communities like
the Maasai, for instance.</i>

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:30.970
One particular innovative
project that we came across

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:36.274
is in redirecting this
young warrior instinct

00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:38.377
to go out and to kill a lion.

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:40.812
<i> And we're trying
 to find with them</i>

00:09:40.812 --> 00:09:43.049
<i>new ways to direct that energy.</i>

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:45.717
<i>Even though, it's a very,
 very ancient activity.</i>

00:09:45.717 --> 00:09:48.320
( chanting )

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.325
( instrumental music )

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.465
So this is a race
against time.

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:35.433
What we have to do is
stop all killings.

00:10:35.433 --> 00:10:37.603
<i>We have to stop all conflicts</i>

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:40.839
<i> and we need to mount
 a major campaign</i>

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:43.709
<i> to stop all the trade
 in animal parts</i>

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.377
<i> for us to be successful.</i>

00:10:45.377 --> 00:10:47.479
Who would've thought that

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:51.450
within a year of Cecil, the lion
in Zimbabwe being killed

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.918
there would be marches
in the streets

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:55.120
there would be government
policies being changed

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.090
there would be airlines
stopping trophy hunting?

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.759
And so for us, there's
never been a time

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:04.430
when the path in this
crossroads has been clearer.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.497
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

00:11:05.497 --> 00:11:06.599
( audience applause )
