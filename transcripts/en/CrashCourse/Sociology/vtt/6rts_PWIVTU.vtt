00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
You’ve heard of “First World Problems,”
right?

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.680
Someone cracks the screen on their iPhone or gets the
wrong order at Starbucks, and then they go on Twitter
and complain about their hashtag First World Problems.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.000
So, you’re heard the phrase, but have you
thought about the implications of talking
about countries as First or Third?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.780
Where do these names even come from?

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.780
These terms are outdated, inaccurate, and
frankly insulting ways of talking about global
stratification.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.680
So how should we talk about global stratification?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:37.560
[Theme Music]

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.620
First, let’s deconstruct the idea of the
first, second, third world hierarchy;

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.500
see where it came from;
and learn what its implications are.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.620
The terms date back to the Cold War, when Western
policymakers began talking about the world as three
distinct political and economic blocs.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.040
Western Capitalist countries were labeled
the “First World”.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.280
The Soviet Union and its allies were termed
the “Second World”.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.620
And then everyone else – got grouped into
“Third World.”

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.019
After the Cold War ended, the category of
Second World Countries became null and void,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.000
but somehow the terms First World and Third
World stuck around in the public consciousness.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.600
Third World Countries, which started as just
a vague catch-all for non-aligned countries,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.100
came to be associated with impoverished
states, while First World was associated with
rich, industrialized countries.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.180
But in addition to being seriously outdated,
these terms are also inaccurate.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.520
There are more than 100 countries that fit
the label of “Third World,” but they have vastly
different levels of economic stability.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.680
Some are relatively poor, but many aren’t.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:42.000
So, lumping Botswana and Rwanda into the same
category, for example, doesn’t make much sense,
because the average income per capita in Botswana
is nine times larger than in Rwanda.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.960
Nowadays, sociologists sort countries
into groups based on their specific levels of
economic productivity.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.680
To do this, they use the Gross Domestic Product
or GDP, which measures the total output of a country,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.780
and the Gross National Income or GNI, which
measures GDP per capita.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.040
High income countries are those with GNI above
$12,500 per year.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.680
There are 79 countries in this group, including
the US, the UK, Germany, Chile, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, and more.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.740
As the name suggests, standards of living
are higher here than the rest of the world.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.060
High income countries are also highly
urbanized, with 81% of people in high income
countries living in or near cities.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.040
Much of the world’s industry is centered
in these countries, too – and with industry,
comes money and technology.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.520
Take cell phones, for example.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.760
60% of those in low income countries have
a cell phone.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.240
But in high income countries, not only does almost
everyone have a cell phone, but for every 100 people in
high income countries, there are 124 cell phone plans.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.140
The next category is the upper middle income
countries, defined as those with GNI between
$4,000 and $12,500 per year.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:52.360
There are 56 countries in this group, and they tend to have advancing economies with both manufacturing and high tech markets, such as China, Mexico, Russia, and Argentina.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.600
They’re also heavily urban, have access to public
infrastructure like education and health, and have
comfortable standards of living for most citizens

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.000
– not too different from what you’d
expect in a high income country.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.940
Now, you might notice that I keep talking
about how “urban” these types of countries are.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.360
Why does it matter how many people live in
cities?

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.380
Well, if you’re used to media depictions
of poverty in the US, you might think of it
as an inner city problem.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.740
But poverty worldwide is mostly rural.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.180
Agricultural societies produce less than
industrialized ones.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.840
Which brings us to our next grouping: lower
middle income countries.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.620
These have GNI between $1000 and $4000 per
year, and they include such countries as Ukraine,
India, Guatemala, and Zambia.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.840
Unlike the previous groups, only 40% of
people living in lower middle income countries
live in urban areas,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.340
and the economy is based around manufacturing
and natural resource production.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.620
Here, access to services, like quality health
care and education, is limited to those who
are well-off.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.500
For example, the maternal mortality rate is
5 times higher in lower middle income countries
than in upper middle income countries,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.500
and one-third of children under the age of
five are malnourished.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.020
Our final grouping includes the 31 countries
designated as low-income, which have yearly
GNI less than $1000 per year.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.820
These countries are primarily rural.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.940
Most of the world’s farmers live in these
countries, and their economies are mainly
based on agriculture.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.240
Not only do these countries face income poverty,
they also have greater rates of disease, worse
healthcare and education systems,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.260
and many of their citizens lack access to
basic needs like food and clean water.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.340
Here, 8% of children die before the age of
five.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.820
And among older children, more than one-third
never finish primary school.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.960
This type of poverty is very different than
the type of poverty that we see in high income
countries like the United States.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.460
That’s why, when talk about social stratification
on a global level, it’s important to remember the
distinctions between relative and absolute poverty.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.800
Relative poverty exists in all societies,
regardless of the overall income level of
the society.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.600
But absolute poverty is when a lack of resources
is literally life-threatening.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.440
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to talk about
two groups that are particularly vulnerable in
low-income countries: children and women.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.880
The results of child poverty range from
malnutrition to homelessness to children working
in dangerous and illegal jobs.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:05.200
UNICEF estimates that there are 18.5 million
children worldwide who are orphans, and an
estimated 150 million are engaged in child labor.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.800
Child malnutrition is worst in South Asia
and Africa, where one-third of children are
affected.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.900
And half of all child deaths worldwide are
attributed to hunger.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.000
Women also make up a disproportionate number
of the globally poor.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.340
70% of those living at or below absolute poverty
levels worldwide are women.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.580
Some of this is a result of women being kept
from working, due to religious or cultural beliefs.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.740
Some of it is because many women who do work
don’t get to control the fruits of their labor.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.960
Quite literally.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.740
Even though women in low income countries
produce 70% of the food, men own the land
that the women’s labor is done on.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.680
90% of the land in poor countries is owned
by men.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.840
And the poverty of children and the poverty
of women are connected, specifically by
reproductive health care.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.300
Poor access to reproductive health care is
part of the reason that birth rates are so much
higher in low income countries.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.240
And less money plus more mouths to feed equals
more child poverty.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.400
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.440
Women and children may be the most vulnerable
to global poverty, but poor societies have many
problems beyond malnutrition and poor healthcare.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.700
Including slavery.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.300
You might think of slavery as a problem from
long ago – I mean, the US was slow to abolish
slavery compared to other Western countries.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.120
But slavery is very much alive around the
world.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.880
The International Labor Organization estimates
that there are at least 20 million men, women,
and children currently enslaved.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.660
Now, all of these symptoms of global poverty
might make you think: What causes it?

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.680
One likely cause is simply the lack of access
to technology.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.180
And I’m not talking about, like, self-driving
cars.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:36.000
Being able to use simple things like fertilizer
and modern seeds, for example, can make huge
differences for families in low-income countries.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.420
Also, cell phones.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:44.120
The growing number of cell phones in Sub-Saharan
Africa has increased access to educational tools,
banking services, and health care resources.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.260
Another major cause of global inequalities
is population growth.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:55.160
Even with the higher death rates, the high birth rates
in lower income countries mean that the populations
in poor countries double every 25 years,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.660
further straining those countries’
economic resources.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.040
And this is directly related to a third reason
for global poverty: gender inequalities.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:10.020
The same cultural and social factors that prevent
women from working also tend to limit their access
to birth control, which in turn, increases family sizes.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.780
And that contributes to population growth
and slows economic development, as resources become strained.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.440
Social and economic stratification, both
within countries and across countries, are
also part of the story.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.520
Unequal distribution of wealth within a
country makes it hard for those stuck in
poverty to get out of poverty.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:32.760
And inequality across nations means that countries
with more economic power have historically been
able to subjugate less powerful nations through
systems like colonialism.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.880
Colonialism is the process by which some
nations enrich themselves by taking political
and economic control of other nations.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.080
Western Europe colonized much of Latin America,
Africa, and Asia starting more than 500 years ago.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.060
And as a result, much of the wealth and resources
flowed out of those regions and into European coffers.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.600
And colonialism isn’t some distant past.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.560
Most African British colonies gained their
independence in 1968.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.020
In other words, the Baby Boomers that you
know were alive when the UK still had colonies.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.419
So, it’s no wonder that so many colonized
countries remain low or lower middle income,

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.540
when they’ve only had a little over a half century
to begin building their own independent countries.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.380
And as colonialism fell, new power
relationships emerged that have made it harder
for poor countries to develop further.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:22.760
Neo colonialism doesn’t involve direct political
control of a nation; instead it involves economic
exploitation by corporations, for example.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:30.300
Corporate leaders often exert economic pressure on
lower income countries to allow them to operate under
business conditions that are favorable for the companies,

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.960
and often unfavorable for the citizens that
work for them.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.820
This is all difficult stuff to talk about, but there
is good news: global poverty is getting better.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.120
Life expectancy is improving rapidly in low
income countries.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.540
Between 1990 and 2012, life expectancy in
low income countries has increased by 9 years.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.900
And child mortality rates halved worldwide
in the same time period.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.440
How do we keep up this progress?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:58.640
If we want to tackle global poverty, addressing
the social, cultural, and economic forces that keep
countries mired in poverty will be the first step.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.940
Today we discussed the terms First and Third
World countries and the reasons why these
terms are no longer used.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.160
We also went over four types of countries:

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:13.220
high income, upper middle income, lower
middle income, and low income countries, and
the lifestyles of people within those countries.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.880
We talked about some of the consequences of
global poverty, including malnutrition, poor education,

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.580
overpopulation partially due to poor
reproductive healthcare, and slavery.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:27.100
Finally, we discussed some explanations for global
poverty, including technology, gender inequality,

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.660
social stratification, and global power
relationships like colonialism.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.380
Next week, we’ll discuss the main theories
behind global stratification.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:40.540
