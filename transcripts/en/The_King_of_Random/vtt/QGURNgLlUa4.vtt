00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.250
For this video, I’m going to show you a
faster, safer, and more convenient way,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.630
to cut your apples.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.020
To start, turn your apples upside down. You
can see the tops have a lot more surface area

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.250
than the bottoms, so by putting them face
down, they’ll be a lot more stable when

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.520
you cut them. Meaning less chance you cut
yourself, instead.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.609
Next, rather than cutting an apple into quarters,
like you were probably taught to do, imagine

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.240
a “tic-tac-toe” pattern with the center
of the grid lining up with the middle of the apple.

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.380
Cut along these imaginary lines, holding the
pieces together firmly at the top as you do,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.300
and just like that, your fruit snack is completely
sliced and ready to eat. The cool thing about

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.620
this method is that by keeping the pieces
together, it’ll actually stay good, for

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.120
a surprising amount of time.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.079
I opened this one 3 hours later, and you can
see it’s still in really great shape, and

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.140
ready to be eaten. So think about this. The
next time you’re packing a lunch, try snapping

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.079
a rubber band around the outside, and you’ll
have a healthy snack, ready to go in an instant.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.420
The best part is, you don’t even need an
extra baggie.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.039
Now if you’re serving your apple snacks
at home, here’s a cool little trick to try

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.870
with the corner pieces. Cut 3 diagonal slits
across the apple slice in one direction, then

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.930
spin it around, and cut 3 more slits the same
way, so they meet near the bottom. With a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.360
flick of your fingers, you can offset the
pieces, to make a fun, and decorative way,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.750
to serve healthy snacks in a way that everyone
will love.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.310
Of course, if you want to take your apple
artwork to the next level, you can easily

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.540
cut and rearrange one single apple, into an
edible apple swan. Look for how to make this in another project video.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.680
Now just for fun, I decided to compare apples
to apples, with 3 different methods, to see

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.189
the difference in how they brown over time.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.670
The pieces at the back are completely untreated,
and will be left out so they’re exposed

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.729
to the air. But I sliced these other two apples
“tic-tac-toe style” and bound them together

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.600
with rubber bands to protect them. The only
difference between these two, is that the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.200
one on the left, is treated with lemon juice.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.079
Some people say that the citric acid, in lemon
juice, will prevent your apples from oxidizing,

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.970
and turning brown. So let’s find out whether
or not that’s true.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.180
8-1/2 hours later, let’s take a look and
see whats happened to them.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.159
It looks like all the slices exposed to the
air did turn brown after all, and don’t

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.909
look nearly as appetizing. But by keeping
the slices held together with a rubber band,

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.369
the apple on the right only browned just a
little. And for sitting out nearly 9 hours,

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.100
it still looks impressively edible.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.920
If we peek inside at the one spritzed with
lemon juice, you can see it looks just as

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.950
fresh as the minute it was cut it, and still
tastes just as good as well.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.870
Now for one last experiment, I set up a time
trial to see which method of cutting the apples

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.160
really is faster. And just for your convenience,
I will speed it up a little.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.530
Amazingly, you can see all 8 slices, are cut
in only 10 seconds. And there’s very little

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.300
mess to clean up at all. On the other hand,
it’s nearly 5 times longer with the traditional

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.740
technique, and there are chunks of apple core
everywhere.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.940
Well now you now know a faster, safer and
more convenient way to cut your apples. That

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.010
will not only save you time, but won’t leave
much of a mess for you to clean up later.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.470
That’s it for now. If you like this video, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
