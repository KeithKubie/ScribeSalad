[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.800
BRUNO OLIVEIRA: Hello, my
name is Bruno Oliveira,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.244
and I'm an engineer in
the Play Games team.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:14.660
And in today's
"Dev.Bytes" episode

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.309
we're going to talk about
a problem that comes up

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.890
very often in multiplayer games.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.750
And that is, of course, how
do you choose who goes first?

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.090
Remember that multiplayer
is symmetrical.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.870
So no one is naturally special.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.870
There is no server or
anything like that,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.527
but sometimes, you need to
choose one of the players

00:00:29.527 --> 00:00:31.860
to have a special role, like
to be the judge of a match,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.360
to make the first
movie, or you need

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.380
to decide who's player one,
who's player two, and so on.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.249
So how do you do this?

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:39.790
Your first thought
looking at the API

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.067
may be, oh, let me use
the room's creator.

00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:43.900
So the player who is
the creator of the room

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.400
is going to be the
judge or is going

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.170
to make the first
move, et cetera.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.994
That's generally a bad idea.

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:50.410
That's a bad idea,
because there's

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.310
a funny thing that happens in
automatch, because automatch

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.400
really means we got a
whole bunch of rooms

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.250
and put them together
into a single room.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.215
So when you have automatch
players in the room,

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:01.020
there will not
necessarily be agreement

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.390
on who was the room's creator.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.262
So that doesn't
work as expected.

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:07.470
So you may think, OK, I'm
going to use the player ID.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.810
Right, so everyone
has a player ID.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.980
I'm just going to
sort the player IDs,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.530
and whoever has
the lowest player

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.030
ID is going to be
the first to play.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.649
Again, that's a bad
idea, because when

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.690
you have automatch players,
you don't have access

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.648
to the player IDs of
those automatched players.

00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:20.410
So that method
doesn't work either.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.910
OK.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.990
What if you just
used participant IDs.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.050
That's a slightly better
idea, because everyone

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.470
has a participant ID.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.790
However, that's
still not very good.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.631
And why?

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:30.130
OK.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.800
Let's suppose you're
doing something like this.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.640
So you got everyone's
participant IDs,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.560
which are these funny strings.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.140
You sort that list, and then
you pick that first player

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.850
on that list to start the
game, or to be the king,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.229
or to have that special role.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.020
Sure, that works, and
definitely everyone's

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.240
going to agree on who
has that special role.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.650
But here's the problem.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.620
A participant ID is not
really a random string.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.161
It actually has some
structure to it.

00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:52.640
It's encoded information.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.820
So suppose that I'm that
last guy over there,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.830
and I'm unlucky enough that in
every single match that I play,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.980
my participant ID
begins with a Z.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.745
So if I'm unlucky enough
that that happens,

00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:04.370
then no matter how
many matches I play,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.500
I'll never get to play first.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.470
I'll never get to be the king.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.344
I'll never get that
special role in the game.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:11.140
So the game might be
very boring for me.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.080
So we definitely don't
want that to happen.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.370
So one of the ways you can
solve that problem is you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.607
sort the list of
participant IDs as before.

00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:21.440
Then you pick the first
player on that list,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.600
but that player's not going
to play the special role.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.183
His only responsibility
is going to be

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:27.590
to randomly choose who's
going to be the king

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.250
or to play first.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.260
After choosing that using
some sort of fair method,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.320
all they have to do is then
broadcast to the other players

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.070
that selection.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.750
And then everyone's
going to agree

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.160
that player is going to
be the king or the leader,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160
and the choice was fair.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.700
So no one had the privilege
of being the king many times.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.140
And then everyone agrees,
and now all we have to hope

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.470
is that F029 is going to
be a wise ruler that's

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.390
going to lead your game into
an age of peace and prosperity.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.420
That was it for
today's "Dev.Bytes."

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.160
Thank you.
