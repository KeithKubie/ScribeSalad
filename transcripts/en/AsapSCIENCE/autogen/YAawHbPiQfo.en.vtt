 Want some pizza? We all love the good pizza pie to talk to, but it turns out there's a simple scientific solution to double your pizza experience! 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.880
 Everything depends on the area of ​​the circuit 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.720
 That equation you may have heard in your youth, where the area is equal to a square squared, where the radius represents the radius 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.460
 If we add some numbers, you may notice something interesting 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.520
 For example, since we measure pizza in Anchorage in North America, 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.460
 The 8-inch pizza area is about 50 square inches 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.100
 Simply take the radius of the pizza, if it is 4 inches in this case, put it in the equation and here it is! 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 But if we do the same thing with a 16-inch pizza, 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:49.820
 Which has a larger diameter twice, we find that although it is obvious it may seem twice as large, but actually has more than 200 square inches! 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.200
 It means pizza more than 4 times! 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.880
 This is because the area of ​​the circle increases with the radius box. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.980
 However, the price difference between an 8-inch and 16-inch pizza is often not even as low as the price 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.600
 Let alone multiply it four times. 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.600
 In fact, the NPA conducted a study on more than 74,000 pizza prices in America 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.780
 An interactive chart was created to determine exactly how pizza prices change with size 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.380
 How much is the amount of pizza you get when you require a large volume. 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.460
 For example, a 20-inch pizza has more space than a 14-inch pizza sandwich or six 8-inch pizza sandwiches 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.160
 They are an average of $ 9 cheaper than buying two 14-inch sandwiches and cheaper than $ 30 for six 6-inch sandwiches 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.320
 This is the pizza equation. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.800
 The more pizza you have, the more money you keep in your pockets 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.600
 But why is the pizza very delicious from the ground up? We have revealed the scientific secret behind the fact that pizza is the ideal food on ASAP thought
