00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:15.165
Do you have these 7 signs of emotional intelligence?

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.125
We all know what an IQ is

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:21.475
and that most of us fall within the average range.

00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:24.615
We use names like smart, intelligent, dumb,

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:27.145
idiot and stupid when talking about

00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:30.065
a person's level of intelligence. What

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:33.125
most people don't know is that we also possess an EQ,

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.045
or EI, which is our level

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:37.045
of emotional intelligence.

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:40.395
Emotional intelligence is typical to measure in numbers

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:43.255
because it is that thing inside us that recognizes emotions

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:46.575
in ourselves and others, then guides us to respond.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.955
Understanding emotions may seem unimportant or trivial

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:52.605
but in fact it is the opposite.

00:00:52.795 --> 00:00:54.755
It is widely believed by experts that

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.455
a person's level of emotional intelligence may be

00:00:57.455 --> 00:01:00.035
a better predictor of success and overall hapiness

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:01.435
than their IQ.

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:05.055
What is emotional intelligence?

00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:07.815
Having a high level of emotional intelligence

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:08.615
means that you can

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:11.955
accurately express your feelings and take responsibility for them.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:14.495
People often say things like ''You hurt

00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:16.825
my feelings and you shouldn't have''

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:20.225
which puts blame on the other person for the way you feel.

00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:22.545
A person with high EI realises

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:24.025
the feeling belongs to him

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:27.000
and responds with statements such as ''I was hurt by that''.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.920
Being emotionally intelligent means

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.595
that you can identify and manage not only your own

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:35.365
emotions but the emotions of others too.

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:38.055
It means you have awareness of your own feelings and

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:40.975
are able to balance emotion and reason.

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:43.975
You can recognize feelings and emotion in others and

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:46.745
show emapthy and compassion which is a crucial part of

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:49.745
all relationships - both business and personal.

00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:52.815
For example, a good leader has the ability to

00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:56.265
understand what motivates others and build on that motivation.

00:01:57.415 --> 00:02:00.115
7 signs you are emotionally smart

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:03.365
Although emotional intelligence is not completely understood

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:06.115
it has become increasingly know that it plays a

00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:08.425
critical role in our quality of life.

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:11.735
A person who is emotionally intelligent generally has better

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.515
physical health, a more positive outlook,

00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:16.455
fulfilling relationships and is more

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:18.845
successful than those with low EI.

00:02:19.975 --> 00:02:23.005
1: You can read non-verbal communication

00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:26.735
This means you are able to look at someone and know

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.585
by the look on their face, the way they hold their arms,

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:32.465
their posture or etc. and tell what

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:35.445
their mood is.

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:38.295
2: You are interested in other people and their feelings and thoughts

00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:41.085
When someone asks you ''What are you thinking about?''

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:43.515
it shows their interest and understanding.

00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:46.775
Emotionally intelligent people want to know and understand

00:02:46.775 --> 00:02:49.835
others and genuinely listen to their answers.

00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:53.835
3: You are emotionally resilient

00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:57.505
Bad things happen in life - you lose a good job,

00:02:57.505 --> 00:03:00.185
your significant other moves on without you.

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:02.985
You have setbacks and know there will be more coming.

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:05.995
However, you also know you are strong enough to

00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:08.075
persevere until better times come.

00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:10.595
You do not internalize failure.

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:14.585
4: You know where you need improvement

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:17.835
People with low EI make the world believe they know

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:19.895
everything and can do anything.

00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:22.815
When something goes wrong they put the blame anywhere but

00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:25.775
on themselves. If you have a high EI,

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:28.685
you know the areas in your life that need improvement.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.045
You are always learning and therefore always growing.

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:36.865
5: You are aware of your own feelings

00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:39.955
You know how you are feeling, what caused the feeling

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:42.295
and how to process and deal with the feeling.

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:45.185
Your feelings guide you towards finding a solution

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:46.875
rather than shutting you down.

00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:50.755
6: You avoid negative self-talk

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:52.905
When something does not go right,

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:55.625
even if it was by your own mistake, you do not

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:58.315
berate and belittle yourself. You are able to

00:03:58.315 --> 00:04:00.465
acknowledge what went wrong and explore

00:04:00.465 --> 00:04:03.225
your options for solving the problem, then move forward

00:04:03.225 --> 00:04:04.395
and do so.

00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:09.165
7: You pursue success

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.195
You have dreams and

00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:12.675
strategies to make those dreams a reality.

00:04:12.825 --> 00:04:16.045
 

00:04:17.095 --> 00:04:20.075
You set goals regardless of how long it takes you to meet

00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:21.075
each one.

00:04:21.355 --> 00:04:23.965
You deal with setbacks, adjust shortcomings

00:04:23.965 --> 00:04:27.165
and know that the only way you will lose is if you quit.

00:04:27.995 --> 00:04:30.835
How many of these qualities do you possess?

00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:34.245
The good news is that unlike brain intelligence, our IQ,

00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:37.305
emotional intelligence can be raised to some extent.

00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:40.405
Part of our EI is innate, part of it is shaped by

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.615
environment and another part is our attitude.

00:04:43.705 --> 00:04:46.285
Are you willing to learn to understand and conquer your

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.335
emotions? Are you interested in

00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:50.445
becoming a better problem solver?

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:52.705
Do you want to achieve your goals?

00:04:53.345 --> 00:04:55.995
Developing your emotional intelligence allows you the

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.175
opportunity to

00:04:57.175 --> 00:04:59.975
avoid miscommunications and misunderstandings.

00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:03.185
It deepens your relationships and helps you balance work,

00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:05.905
home and fun in a meaningful way.

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:07.785
Remember - the biggest determinate

00:05:07.785 --> 00:05:10.895
of success is measured by EQ, not IQ.
