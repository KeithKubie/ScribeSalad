00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
Have you ever met a friend’s parents and
realized that your friend was basically a
mini-me of their mom?

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.500
Not just because they both have brown hair
or a pointy nose.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.680
It’s how they talk, the way they both like
making silly puns, their attitudes and beliefs.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.840
Now the question is: How much of that
similarity is genetic,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.080
and how much is just a function of that fact that your
friend grew up with their mom, and pretty much learned
how to be a human being by watching her?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.880
This is the age old question: nature or nurture?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.000
Nature is the part of human behavior that’s
biologically determined and instinctive.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.200
When a baby latches onto your finger and won’t
let go, and it’s basically the cutest thing

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.440
in the whole world, it’s not because they
learned to do that – it’s natural.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.300
A lot of human behavior, however, isn’t
instinctive – it comes instead from how
you’re nurtured.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.211
The nurture part of behavior is based on the
people and environment you’re raised in.

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:45.570
And it’s this second part – the social
environment that determines human behavior

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.000
– that sociologists tend to investigate
and have many different theories about.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.740
[Theme Music]

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.780
To a big extent, we develop our personalities
and learn about our society and culture through a
social process – one known as socialization.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.960
Sounds legit, right?

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.500
But what happens if you don’t have people
around you?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.860
Social isolation affects our emotional and
cognitive development, a lot.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.220
To get a glimpse into how and why this is, let’s
go to the Thought Bubble to look at sociologist
Kingsley Davis’s case studies on Anna.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.540
In the winter of 1938, a social worker investigated a
report of child neglect on a small Pennsylvania farm and
found, hidden in a storage shed, a five-year-old girl.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.480
That five-year girl was Anna.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.200
She was unwanted by the family she was born into and was passed from house to house among neighbors and strangers for the first six months of her life.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.940
Eventually, she ended up being kept in a shed
with no human contact other than to receive food.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.120
Kingsley Davis observed Anna for years after
her rescue and wrote about the effects of this
upbringing on her development.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.560
When Anna was first rescued, she was unable
to speak or smile, and was completely unresponsive
to human interaction.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.540
Even after years of education and medical
attention, her mental development at age eight
was less than that of a typical two-year old.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.040
This is a story with both a sad beginning
and a sad ending.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.220
Anna died of a blood disorder at the age of
10.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:14.580
And Davis’ study of how isolation affects
young children was only one of many that have
shown how a lack of socialization affects
children’s ability to develop language skills,
social skills, and emotional stability.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.720
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.280
There are lots of different theories about
how we develop personalities, cognitive skills,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.660
and moral behavior, many of which come from
our siblings in social science: psychologists.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.860
Take Sigmund Freud.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.510
You’ve heard of him: Austrian guy?

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.500
Liked cigars?
Invented the field of psychoanalysis?

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.600
One of his main theories was about how personalities
develop.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.640
He thought we were born with something called
an id.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.300
You can think of the id as your most basic,
unconscious drive – a desire for food, comfort,
attention.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.880
All a baby knows is it wants THAT and it will
scream until it gets it.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.260
But then we develop the ego and superego to
balance the id.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.260
Ego is the voice of reason, your conscious
efforts to rein in the pleasure-seeking id.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.800
And your superego is made up of the cultural
values and norms that you internalize and
use to guide your decisions.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.210
So if the id is the devil on your shoulder,
the superego is the angel on the other shoulder,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.860
and the ego is the mediator who intervenes
when the angel and devil start fighting.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.980
Now, a lot of Freud’s work hasn’t stood
the test of time,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.370
but his theories about how society affects our
development has influenced pretty much everyone
who has researched the human personality.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.900
This includes Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget,
who spent much of his career in the early
1900s studying cognitive development.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.380
While researching ways to measure children’s
intelligence, Piaget noticed that kids of similar
ages tended to make similar mistakes.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.800
And this, to Piaget, suggested that there
were four different stages of cognitive development.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.200
First Stage: TOUCH EVERYTHING!

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.160
Babies learn about the world by grabbing things
and sticking them in their mouths.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.400
This curious, slobbery interaction with the world
is what Piaget called the sensorimotor stage –

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.480
the level of development where all knowledge
is based on what you can perceive with your senses.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.800
Around age 2, a child enters the next stage,
known as the preoperational stage.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.480
At this point, kids have learned to use language
and begin to ask questions to learn about
the world, rather than just grabbing stuff.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.100
Now they can think about the world and
use their imaginations – which leads to playing
pretend and an understanding of symbols.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.380
But thinking about the world is pretty much
limited to how THEY think about the world.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.320
Kids in the preoperational stage are pretty
ego-centric;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.680
if they love playing with trains and you ask them
what their dad’s favorite thing to do is, they’ll probably
say that he loves playing with trains too.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.760
It’s not until they reach the concrete operational
stage, around 6 or 7, that they develop the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.120
ability to take in other people’s perspectives,
and begin to make cause-and-effect connections
between events in their surroundings.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.460
And in the formal operational stage, at about
age 12, Piaget said, kids begin to think in
the abstract and use logic and critical thinking.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.440
Now, American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg later
expanded on Piaget’s model of cognitive development
to incorporate stages of moral development.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.100
Essentially, kids’ sense of what is “right” begins
in what Kohlberg called the pre-conventional stage,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.100
where right is just what feels good
to them personally.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.380
Next, they move to the conventional stage,
where what’s right is what society and the
people around them tells them is right.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.500
And then finally, children end up in the post-conventional
stage, where they begin to consider more abstract
ethical concepts than just right or wrong.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.960
So at a young age, a child doesn’t realize
that grabbing the candy bar they want at the
store is wrong – they just want it.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:10.100
But then, a combination of societal norms
and being scolded by their parents convinces
them that stealing is wrong, no matter how
much they want the candy bar.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.580
And over time, they learn that morals have
gray areas;

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.720
stealing is wrong if it’s just for fun, but
might be considered less wrong if you’re 
stealing to feed your family.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.660
Eventually, children reach a point where they’re
able to think about things like freedom and justice,

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.140
and realize that societal norms about
what’s right may not always line up with
these principles.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.700
Sure, laws against stealing candy may be just,
but what about laws that say only certain
people can get married?

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.199
Just because something is a law, is it right?

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.140
How you feel about that question may depend
on your socialization.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.320
And on your gender.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.440
Carol Gilligan, an American psychologist who
started out as a research assistant and collaborator

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.639
of Kohlberg’s, explored how girls and boys
experience these stages differently.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.200
She realized that Kohlberg’s original studies
only had male subjects – which may have biased
his findings.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.020
When she expanded the research to look at
both male and female children, she found that

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.100
boys tended to emphasize formal rules to define
right and wrong – what she called a justice
perspective.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.120
Whereas girls tended to emphasize the role
of interpersonal reasoning in moral decisions

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.899
– what she called a care and responsibility
perspective.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.749
Gilligan argued that these differences stem
from cultural conditioning that girls receive
to fulfill ideals of femininity.

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:19.560
She thought that we socialize girls to be
more nurturing and empathetic, and that influences
their moral interpretation of behavior.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.460
The next theory of social development I want
to focus on is from American sociologist George

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.840
Herbert Mead, who was one of the founders
of the sociological paradigm we talked about

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.520
a few episodes ago, known as symbolic interactionism.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.770
His work focused on how we develop a “self.”

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.629
What makes up the you that is inherently you?

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:37.300
Are you born with some inherent spark of you-ness?

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.569
According to Mead no!

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.520
Instead, he believed that we figure out who
we are through other people.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.700
All social interactions require you to see
yourself as someone else might see you –

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.440
something Mead described as “taking on 
the role of others.”

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.129
In the first stage of development, according
to Mead’s model, we learn through imitation

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.529
– we watch how others behave and try to
behave like them.

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:59.319
You see your mom smile at your neighbor, so
you smile too.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.439
And Mead observed that as kids got older,
they moved on to a new stage – play.

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.939
Rather than just imitating your mom, you might
play at being a mom, taking care of a doll.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.440
Assuming the role of “mommy” or “daddy”
is a kid imagining the world from their parent’s
perspective.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.520
The next stage of development is the game
stage, where children learn to take on multiple
roles in a single situation.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.939
What does that have to do with games?

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:25.920
Well, games use rules and norms, and require
kids to take on a role themselves, and develop
that role in reaction to the roles that others take on.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.980
Team sports are a great example of this.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.909
When you’re playing soccer, you need to not only
know what you’re going to do, but also what your
teammates and your opponents will do.

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:36.980
If you were ever the kid who ended up running
the wrong way on the soccer field because

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.860
you didn’t realize the ball had switched
possession, you know how important it is to
anticipate what other people do.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.100
The last stage, in Mead’s model, occurs
when we learn how to take on multiple roles
in multiple situations.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:53.420
In this phase, we weigh our self and our
actions not against one specific role, but against
a ‘generalized other’ –

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.240
basically, a manifestation of all of our
culture’s norms and expectations.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.360
Now, you might have noticed that all these
theories focus on childhood.

00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:03.879
So, does that mean that your personality is
set once you hit 18?

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.709
No, definitely no.

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:10.119
As anyone over 18 will tell you, you keep
growing well past high school.

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:14.729
And that’s why yet another theorist, German-born
psychologist Erik Erikson, came up with his

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:19.029
own eight-stage theory of development, that
goes all the way from infancy to old age.

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:21.939
He based these stages on the key challenge
of each period of life.

00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:25.249
When you’re a toddler, for example, your
biggest challenge is getting what you want

00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:30.540
– or as Erikson puts it, gaining autonomy,
which helps you build skills and confidence
in your abilities.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.339
But once you’re a young adult, you’ve
got plenty of autonomy.

00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:36.479
Now a bigger challenge is developing intimate
relationships.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.120
Falling in love, finding friends – there’s a reason
that’s the focus of every 20-something sitcom.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.280
And his list goes on.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.900
Every life stage from when you’re born to when
you die features different expectations that inform
what we see as markers of social development.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.920
Moving out, getting married, having kids – they’re
all societal markers of social development as an adult.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.560
But whether you feel like one or not, adulthood
will come for us all –

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.980
and it’s your socialization that will determine
how exactly you perform the role of “adult.”

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.720
Next week, we’ll talk about the different
agents of socialization that shape who we
really end up being.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.110
Today we learned about social development,
starting with the role of nature and nurture
in influencing a person’s development.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:18.740
We talked about social isolation and the importance
of care and human interaction in early years
for proper emotional and mental development.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.800
Then, we talked about five theories of development:
Freud’s Id, Ego, and Superego;

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.500
Piaget’s Four Stages of Cognitive Development,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.080
Kohlberg and Gilligan’s theories of moral
development;

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.840
Mead’s theory of self;
And Erik Erikson’s life stage theory.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:39.500
