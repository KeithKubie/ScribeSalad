00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.110
guarantee you it happens all
and I see it so people will come in in

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120
and I see it so people will come in in
 

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.790
and I see it so people will come in in
their swim trunks or their amazing suits

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800
their swim trunks or their amazing suits
 

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.770
their swim trunks or their amazing suits
and they'll do the beach cleanup and

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:14.780
and they'll do the beach cleanup and
 

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.330
and they'll do the beach cleanup and
then as we wrap everything up they're

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:16.340
then as we wrap everything up they're
 

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.950
then as we wrap everything up they're
picking up clothes and they go and jump

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:17.960
picking up clothes and they go and jump
 

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.780
picking up clothes and they go and jump
in the lake so I don't think there's a

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:19.790
in the lake so I don't think there's a
 

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.770
in the lake so I don't think there's a
better way to into volunteering

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:20.780
better way to into volunteering
 

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.020
