00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.019
Now in the previous lecture, I talked about how we can actually mathematically

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.950
represent the whole concept of smoothing applied to images.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.340
We looked at a specific instance of being able to smooth an image with a kernel.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.350
You may recall that in that lecture, we looked at how we

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.430
can actually mathematically represent this process of taking a kernel and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.140
applying it to a small region, a three by three one, in this sample image.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.781
While this was for just doing the averaging,

00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:31.267
we can also do this in general terms for any kind of an image.

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:35.510
And we came up with a term, or a mathematical formulation,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.440
which basically now let's you loop over the whole image, but

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.921
also provide non-uniform weights to each and every one of them to be

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:49.250
able to create a general equation of how we can do any kind of filtering.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.450
In the last lecture, I referred to this term, or this process,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.660
as cross-correlation, which was an attempt to basically loop over an image, or

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.060
as part of an image in this instance, and expand this over

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.300
the whole image with a kernel, which basically was not trying to change, and

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.790
put non-uniform weights to be able to impact the output image.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.100
And again, we would loop over the entire image this way.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.715
Now we want to actually start looking at this whole concept of

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:18.720
cross-correlation in a little bit more in detail
