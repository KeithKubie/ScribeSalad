Security is an important
but sometimes intimidating

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.429
aspect of web development.

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:07.099
If you didn't know what
HTTPS was before this lesson,

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.699
you should feel much more
comfortable with it now.

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.059
Most hosting services and CDNs
have support for TLS nowadays.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.630
And with more and
more browser APIs

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.140
being enabled for
HTTPS websites only,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.530
you should always use HTTPS for
your users' and your own sake.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.820
In the next lesson, we'll take a
look at the new HTTP/2 standard

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.539
and what that means for you
and your project's build steps.
