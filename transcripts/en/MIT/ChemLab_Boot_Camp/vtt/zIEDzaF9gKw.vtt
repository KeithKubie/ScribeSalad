00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
ANTHONY: There's going to be
some killing happening.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.632
Killing bacteria.

00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:34.152
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:34.152 --> 00:00:36.920
GUEST SPEAKER: If you've ever
taken antibiotics, you've

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.040
probably swallowed this
molecule, or something like.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.770
This is penicillin g.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.550
Today in 5.301, the students
are going to

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.930
split up into teams.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.480
Each team will react 6-APA,
that's this molecule, with a

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.250
different acyl chloride, making
a different kind of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.670
penicillin.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.790
Tomorrow, the teams will test
how good their penicillin

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.200
derivatives are at
killing bacteria.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.500
Phil hands out the different
acyl chlorides.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.790
Even though his instructions
are clear--

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.190
PHIL: Anything that has acyl
chloride on it, in the hoods.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.136
GUEST SPEAKER: Tengfei soon
notices something.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:15.420
ANTHONY: Do you smell it?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.850
LINA: Smells so weird.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.065
HANSOL: Smells bad.

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:19.630
ETHAN: It smells like
grilled artichoke.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.860
LEALIA: Potatoes and death.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.230
IKE: Like a rotten rose.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.970
PHIL: Old cabbage
into a juicer.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.040
JOHN DOLHUN: The acid chlorides

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.610
can be quite dangerous.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.980
ROO-RA: During lecture today,
he's like, yeah, if you inhale

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.780
too much of this.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.030
JOHN DOLHUN: If you breath
enough of them and get them

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.206
inside of your system, whoosh.

00:01:36.206 --> 00:01:38.160
ROO-RA: And we were
all like, ugh.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.450
JASON: I know it's coming
from my hood.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.570
If that's what you want
me to say, yeah.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.210
It's coming from my hood.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.440
I'm sorry that the acetyl
chloride that we're working

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.480
with smells like death.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.256
JOHN DOLHUN: Woosh.

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:49.660
GUEST SPEAKER: All the groups
complete the reaction and are

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.105
working out their finished
products.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.260
DAN: We were seeing the things
precipitating, change color,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.050
and separate into layers.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.075
Me and my partner Hansol, we
were doing it fantastically.

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:02.550
It was going perfectly.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.280
Until we were right
about to finish.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.150
And all we were doing was simply
getting the crystals

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.680
out of solution.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.039
And that's when we really,
really messed up.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.678
TENGFEI: Did you filter the
sodium sulfate out for

00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:14.928
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:17.094 --> 00:02:18.558
DAN: No.

00:02:18.558 --> 00:02:20.380
TENGFEI: What?

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.560
DAN: In the procedure, we
simply skipped the line.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.475
Skipped the line that
says, filter.

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:26.730
The product crystallized
into a goop.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.660
And the drying agent was still
in there in just one large,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.243
stinky, yellow goop.

00:02:32.243 --> 00:02:34.090
HANSOL: Oh.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.894
[BLEEP]

00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:41.852
DAN: OK, so how do
we save this?

00:02:41.852 --> 00:02:45.444
PHIL: Now they have to go back
and do another work up and

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:46.426
extraction.

00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:51.336
TENGFEI: There's no way to get
the sodium sulfate out.

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:53.300
PHIL: Not out of
the penicillin.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.080
GUEST SPEAKER: They have
to backtrack and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.280
redo several steps.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.190
PHIL: It's going to add another
half hour, hour onto

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.466
their work load.

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:04.670
DAN: During the process
of reacidification, we

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.010
added too much acid.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.140
Penicillin hydrolyzed.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.680
And so the NMR spectrum of
it, we had absolutely no

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.800
penicillin peaks.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.210
So the 4 and 1/2 hours in the
lab, we ended up with crystals

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.910
of essentially nothing.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.785
GUEST SPEAKER: Meanwhile, other
groups are doing well.

00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:28.095
IKE: The white stuff
is the crystal.

00:03:28.095 --> 00:03:28.940
That's the product.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.810
That's exactly what we want.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.320
PHIL: People have really
good samples.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.715
LINA: This lab went
really well.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.880
ANTHONY: Phil said it's going
take 2 and 1/2 hours if you an

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.010
expert chemist.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.740
And we're on our second
to last step.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.670
And it's been 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.410
So bam.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.846
He says he does all of this
in 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:03:48.846 --> 00:03:50.670
Bad Beep.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.640
But he also said that he
would run a column too.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.970
LINA: Don't you feel like you're
really learning things

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.820
as you go along?

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.570
IKE: From her.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.490
She's a monster.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.434
She's just goes [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:05.220
We're the first group
to get done.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.575
Thank you very much.

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:07.705
LINA: No, thank you.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:08.360
High five.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.350
IKE: [INAUDIBLE] good partner.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.155
Yeah.

00:04:11.155 --> 00:04:13.560
GUEST SPEAKER: Everyone's
excited to see whose brand of

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.410
penicillin will be the
best antibiotic.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.399
Find out next time on 5.301.
