00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.560
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, welcome everyone to
another Talks at Google event.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.950
We're very, very pleased to welcome to the
barrio, Adam Shankman.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.950
[applause]

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.470
I see you've got the horns sign down now.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.490
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.490
[laughter]

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.509
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, Adam, I gotta get this
list.

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:25.789
I gotta read from my notes here.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.230
So, Adam is a director, producer, a dancer,
an actor, and a choreographer.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.740
And we'll hopefully touch on each one of those--the
history of his career in this interview.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.670
And he's also been a judge and is continuing
to be a judge on a talent show.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.800
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I only judge for money.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.800
[laughter]

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.490
Otherwise, totally judgment-free.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.940
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You're totally judgment-free?

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.940
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Totally.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.960
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We'll see.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.960
On So You Think You Can Dance.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.960
[whooping]

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.490
And he's produced the 82nd Academy Awards,
which in and of itself is just a--.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.800
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: That was the Steve Martin
Alec Baldwin one.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.310
The good one.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.310
[laughter]

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.790
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: He's also directed television,
so episodes of "Glee" and "Modern Family."

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.460
And as well as several films I'm sure you're
familiar with, things like "Hairspray," "The

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.659
Wedding Planner," "Bringing Down the House."

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.969
And most recently, he's just finished up on
"Rock of Ages."

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.469
So, I think we're gonna quickly cut to a trailer
of "Rock of Ages."

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:17.469
[plays trailer]

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.469

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.469
[cheering]

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:20.469
&gt;&gt;Female Singer: Anyway you want it, that's
the way you need it.

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:21.469
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Tonight it's the Bourbon Room.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.469
Stacee Jaxx.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:48.479
&gt;&gt;Male #2: This place is about to become a
sea of swimming, ear-shattering music, and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.740
puke.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.939
So start drinking now.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.179
&gt;&gt;Male #3: [ ]. Now go.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.179
[rock music]

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.040
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Your first album gave birth to
some of rock's greatest anthems.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.579
What's it like to be the Stacee Jaxx?

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.579
[cheering]

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.680
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Stacee, you made it?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.450
&gt;&gt;Stacee Jaxx: Hey, man.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.110
&gt;&gt;Male #4: This is "Hey, man."

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.880
&gt;&gt;Stacee Jaxx: Hey, man.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:23.370
&gt;&gt;Male #5: When I was 
a kid, I wanted to be Stacee Jaxx.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.470
[singing]
"Heaven isn't too far away."

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.580
&gt;&gt;Stacee Jaxx: You're a singer and you have
real talent.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.890
&gt;&gt;Female #2: That stage is a pedestal.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.200
When you're up there, you're untouchable.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.040
[singing]
"Hit me with your best shot."

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.731
&gt;&gt;Female #3: This club is totally out of control.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.731
&gt;&gt;Stacee Jaxx: Our whole existence is riding
on Stacee Jaxx.

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:46.731
&gt;&gt;Female #3: We're gonna shut them down.

00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:47.731
&gt;&gt;Stacee Jaxx: Oh, my God.

00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:48.731
I just threw up.

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:49.731
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Where?

00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:50.731
&gt;&gt;Stacee Jaxx: In my pants.

00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:51.731
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Oh.

00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:52.731
&gt;&gt;Male #6: You want love?

00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:53.731
Go after it.

00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:54.731
I can guarantee you something more cool--fame.

00:02:54.731 --> 00:03:05.799
&gt;&gt;Female #2: You wanna get respect, you gotta
take that stage.

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:21.360
&gt;&gt;Male Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, the
icon of rock.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.010
Stacee Jaxx.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:51.769
&gt;&gt;Male #7: I'm gonna light this place on fire.

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:52.769
[rock music]

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.969
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Stacee Jaxx.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.180
It gives into the arts.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.180
[rock music]

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.180
[end trailer]

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Wow.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.180
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: That just made me nervous.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.180
[applause]

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.180
What have I done?

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.180
[laughter]

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I was amazed how quiet that
trailer was.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.180
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Very low key.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.180
So, what attracted you to the material at
first when you--"Rock of Ages?"

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.180
I mean, did you have long hair in 1987?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.180
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Well.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.180
Oh, God.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.180
I had horrible Jew-fro.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.270
[laughter]

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:22.180
And then, I got home from high school one
day and took a watermelon and filled it with

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.180
vodka and--

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.620
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's what you do.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.520
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: on a Wednesday after high
school.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.169
And I hope my parents are watching this.

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.360
And then we decided what a great idea, we
were gonna cut my hair.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.220
And I used to refer to it as the "Ellie Mae,"
because what they did is they had a giant,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.000
curly top and then it was shaved.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.169
And she actually went to the scalp at one
point around here.

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.360
And it was just like, long and curly back
here.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360
[laughter]

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360
So, I--.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.699
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Are you still friends with
these people?

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:54.699
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Guess what.

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.620
One of them is now the president of NBC.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.620
[laughter]

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.340
Jennifer Salke was actually the person.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.340
And--.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.490
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I wonder if that's on her
resume?

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.500
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.849
Hi, Jen.

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.350
But we are, but yeah.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.350
I mean, I grew up.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.620
My dad was in the music business.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.410
And I grew up literally on the corner.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.420
His office was at 92 hundred Sunset, which
is like Doheny, and it's the beginning of

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.420
The Strip.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.030
And my first concert that I went to, when
I was 12 years old, was at The Roxy, but it

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.660
was The Cramps.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.490
And the lead singer pleasured himself and
finished on stage at the concert.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.590
And I was like, "Wow.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.590
Music is weird."

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.590
[laughter]

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.450
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: He fulfilled his contract.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.100
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.340
But then, I was a huge Foreigner fan and a
huge Journey fan.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.340
And I started going to--.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.550
My first concert was actually David Bowie
at an arena.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.139
But anyway, so this was kind of my time.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:04.670
And what I remember about this time was that
it was the last period of our innocence, kind

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.349
of, because these people were running amok
like children and there seemed to be no consequences

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:11.509
for anything.

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:16.639
You would just throw a couch out of a hotel
window and it was like, "Yaaaah."

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.770
And you could have casual sex and there was
no AIDS.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.810
And you never heard the word "rehab."

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.919
And they were just doing mountains of drugs,
but it was just all in fun.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.500
I remember there's a brilliant documentary
called "The Decline of Western Civilization-The

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.940
Metal Years," that I literally stole everything
from this movie from.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.000
And there's an interview with Paul Stanley
from KISS and it starts tight.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.750
And he's clearly under a sheet and he's talking
and just about life and rock and roll.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.950
And then it pops out, why, he's literally
in bed with four girls, who are also naked.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.360
And that's how he just did his interview.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360
And that was normal.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.360
So, I thought, "OK.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.510
I totally get this."

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:06.650
So, me personally, this music was like really
the wallpaper of my life because--.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.010
And back when MTV actually played music videos,
every one of these things was on every second.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.819
So, whether or not you're listening to it
on the radio or had all the--.

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:16.880
What would they have been now?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.520
They would've been cassettes, or had the cassette.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.150
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: On your Walkman.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.150
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.150
On your Walkman.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.080
There was no way to avoid this music.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.840
So, it was so entrenched in my consciousness.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.860
And then, when they asked me to do it and
I went and saw the play, I was barely watching

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:41.229
the play because I was freaked out about how
out of their minds, the audience was just

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:42.811
crazy for it.

00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:46.980
They were practically eating their seats.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.379
And they were all straight.

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:49.539
In a Broadway musical.

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.169
And they knew all the words.

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:52.169
[laughter]

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.470
And I thought, "I'll never know an experience
like this again.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.110
This is an unheard-of moment."

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.840
And so, I thought if I can combine all of
my skills and get that kind of audience, it

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.780
would be an amazing experience.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.949
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And was it one of the biggest
challenges of actually working on this movie?

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:09.629
Just getting the songs out of your head?

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:11.270
I mean, if you hear the same songs--.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.270
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Oh, yeah.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.270
God.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.270
It's, well now--.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.270
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: every single one up there,
you just--.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.270
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Well, they're on the radio
all the time.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.760
I mean, "We're Not Gonna Take It" is now like
a hotel commercial--the theme song.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.190
So, and they use it as a bit about coffee,
about "we're not gonna take bad coffee anymore."

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.190
[laughter]

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.580
I'm sure that's what the song was originally
intended to be about.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.580
[laughter]

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.750
They went back to the roots.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:39.060
But the biggest challenge for me with this,
because it is jukebox musical and this is

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.930
the nature of jukebox musicals, is that the
songs are not written for a character.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:49.000
So, you have to mold everything around those
words coming out of people's mouths.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.100
I mean, in this movie, there's the production.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.570
There's the numbers that are presentational
on stage, and there's dialogue and there's

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.770
monologues--stuff going on in people's heads.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.790
So, it was just a matter of putting the right
words and keeping everybody who they are and

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.130
real.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.760
As real as you can be in this world.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.010
But by the way, this is a real world for me
because I actually do sing and dance regularly

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.410
in my life and am a true embarrassment to
the gym.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.410
[laughter]

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.290
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, where were you in 1987?

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:24.610
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: 1987, I was in New York.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.280
And I was more of like a club kid.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.570
Back then, I was more New Wave-y.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:35.370
But I got back to LA--I'm from LA--and I got
back to LA.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.630
Yeah.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:44.260
I had left school and I was a waiter and had
just started doing, I started working in theater--musical

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.260
theater.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.820
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: 'Cause you went to Julliard
at 18 and--.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.260
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.260
Yeah.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.339
And I dropped out soon after.

00:09:51.339 --> 00:09:53.874
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But you actually got in
without actually having had a dance class.

00:09:53.874 --> 00:09:54.874
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Having ever had a dance class.

00:09:54.874 --> 00:09:55.874
I know.

00:09:55.874 --> 00:09:56.874
I was a weird one.

00:09:56.874 --> 00:09:57.874
I was Flashdance.

00:09:57.874 --> 00:10:00.470
It was literally, it was me in leg warmers,
dancing.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.470
[laughter]

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.970
And I had never taken a dance class and they
let me in.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.940
And I got into every school that I auditioned
for without ever having had a dance class,

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.490
which all it means is I'm a good imitator.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.529
Do you know what I mean?

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:15.610
It's like I knew where to put my leg at the
right moment, whatever.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:20.120
But that was really crazy, that audition,
because they have a very strict ballet bar.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.870
And I didn't know what any of the words were.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.910
I kind of knew what a plie was, but past that,
I had never heard it.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.142
So, I'm just looking at everybody, trying
to just get past the audition.

00:10:27.142 --> 00:10:28.142
It was crazy.

00:10:28.142 --> 00:10:31.690
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And New York didn't really
hold you in sway?

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.420
And you, back home for?

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:39.890
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Well, honestly, I had just
done some summer stock and I had my first

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:40.930
relationship.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.380
And it ended really weirdly.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.899
He flipped out and so, I moved and my parents
said, "Just please come back home."

00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:50.660
And I moved back to LA.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.420
This was my dream to become a video music
producer.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.980
And then, I ended up working at a restaurant.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:04.570
And then, got in, I auditioned for another
Janet Jackson "Escapade" video, so I'm in

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.570
that.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.980
And then, I got in, I did the American Music
Awards for her, same thing.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.660
And then, I got in the Oscars that year, which
was the year Paula Abdul choreographed it.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.520
Yes, I'm a Paula Abdul dancer.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.520
[laughter]

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:25.630
And soon, right thereafter, I lied my way
into my first choreography gig and never looked

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.630
back.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.800
I was only 24 when I started choreographing.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800
So--.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.430
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And having grown up in Hollywood,
you probably had folks you knew, or friends

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.320
of parents, who were in the movie business
in some way, shape, or form.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.660
You never really though about movies as such,
or--?

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.149
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Well, I never wanted to be
a director.

00:11:42.149 --> 00:11:44.120
God, that never even occurred to me.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:50.700
But what the choreography thing what was really
cool was I had all these friends who are part

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:56.519
of a young Hollywood organization called Young
Artists United.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:03.589
And my friend Patrick, who actually started
Rock the Vote, was the head of this thing.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:07.181
And it was all people like Judd Nelson and
Sarah Jessica Parker and Robert Downey, who

00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:10.459
I lived with when they were together.

00:12:10.459 --> 00:12:14.670
They were my roommates.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.730
[chuckles]

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.170
They would go around to schools and preach
like not doing drugs and drinking.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.170
[laughter]

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.310
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: They did their research.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.660
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:29.949
And so, what started happening with all these
friends of mine is they started to just become

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:30.949
movie stars.

00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:35.670
And they started to ask for me on their movies.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:41.540
I was their friend who was the choreographer
and so, that was them flexing their new muscles.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.230
And so, that's how I started in the movie
thing.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.620
But before then, it was a lot of music videos--tons
and tons and tons of music videos.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.480
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But your sister is a producer
as well.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.279
Did you guys ever say, "Hey, when we grow
up, we're gonna dive in?"

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.279
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: No.

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:55.279
We never said that.

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.279
No.

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:57.279
We were more like saying, "I hate you."

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.279
"No, I hate you."

00:12:58.279 --> 00:12:59.279
"I hate you."

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.899
We were, she is five years younger than me.

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:07.029
She was working for a company and she produced
the movie "She's All That."

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:10.470
And she asked me to choreograph.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.449
And there's like a big prom scene and there's
some other weird stuff in there that I had

00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:15.790
worked on.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.290
And she thought I was good and she thought
I should be a director.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.240
And I said, "But I don't know what you're
talking about."

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.029
And I was actually, at that point, I had honestly
choreographed like, 70 movies in like, ten

00:13:27.029 --> 00:13:31.360
or eleven years, and a million TV shows and
commercials.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.360
And I was getting a fatigue from directors
that I found to be challenging that they couldn't

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.680
make decisions.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.720
And so, I pulled it together and I spent my
own money and made a short film.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.150
And the producer of that short film, without
asking me, submitted it to Sundance and it

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.150
got in.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.530
And the rest is history.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.530
[laughter]

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.110
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, it sounds like through
osmosis, just being exposed and on sets--

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.110
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Oh, yeah.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.140
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: all that kind of nuance
and the different roles within--.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.490
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I did not go to school for
that.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: the industry, you just got
exposed to it and took it on.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920
So, script writing.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.290
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Well, the best part is that
my parents--my mom's a shrink and my dad was

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:10.130
a lawyer--so my whole approach to actors is
assess and negotiate.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.680
[laughter]

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.720
And it's on a case-by-case basis.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.720
[laughter]

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720
It's how it's worked for me.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.730
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And as far as assess and
negotiate with regards to just every component

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.899
of the movie industry because it's always,
I think, from the outside, you pick up on

00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:28.440
different words as far as something being
green-lit and multiple producers versus an

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.300
executive producer and all these different
roles.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.279
And it seems just like, well, it's obviously
herding cats and it's extremely complex and

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:38.420
difficult, but how did you get comfortable
in each of those roles?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.470
So, for example, just getting to how scripts
work?

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.850
How script formats worked?

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.149
Act one, two, three, when certain types of
events should happen?

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:51.130
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Well, I'd been through so
many and I've seen so many people go up and

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.170
I've seen so many people come down.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.710
And being a crew member, as a choreographer,
I'm just a crew member.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.440
And knowing--.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.670
And you really get to know--.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.360
And by the way, as a choreographer, I am also
directing the actors in the scenes.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.310
I was hired to do a lot of scenes with the
leads in the thing 'cause scripts say "and

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.310
then they dance."

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.519
And so, that's where I come in.

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:14.009
So, I had already worked a lot with actors.

00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:16.420
I knew a lot of actors growing up.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.040
My dad represented a bunch.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.759
And I saw, I never learned anything from a
good director.

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:25.980
I literally never learned anything from a
good director.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:31.190
I learned a lot from the bad ones because
I was like, "God, I never wanna be that person.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.520
I never wanna treat people that way."

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.880
There's a long list of "I never want."

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.440
And so, but the good ones are just magic.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.130
Like, you don't understand what's happening.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.440
They're just creating something great.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:53.069
And when I started directing, I just, you
just go with your gut.

00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:56.160
It's all weird opportunities.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.170
And I never take it for granted that this
is my job and this is an opportunity and that

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.160
this is a privilege and that these people
are entrusting me with a bunch of money.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.850
And the actors are trusting me with their
careers.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:13.019
And I take it seriously in that I'm not better
than any of the project, the this, the actor,

00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:14.019
the any of it.

00:16:14.019 --> 00:16:19.730
So really, again in the assess and negotiate
thing, what I learned very early on is choosing

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:24.029
which swords you're gonna fall on because
there are so many battles that you wage.

00:16:24.029 --> 00:16:29.420
And some of them feel very personal and they're
not, but they feel like it.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.459
And certainly the more I've gone on, the more
I get frustrated because I feel like I've

00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:39.170
proven myself literally over and over and
over and over again in so many different areas.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:44.889
And but it is everybody's job to treat you
without trust.

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:47.889
It feels like they're all really behind you
until that moment, you know?

00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:48.970
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.860
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Then, it's just like a disaster.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.380
And then, I have a tough side.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.519
And I get--.

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:59.560
My eyes narrow and I can--.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.839
Once again, that's where the shrink and lawyer
part comes in, which is really good is because

00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:05.839
I go for everybody's Achilles heel.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.980
I go right for what's gonna hurt them the
most, you know?

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.980
[laughter]

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.841
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, as you shifted into
different roles, oftentimes you actually were

00:17:13.841 --> 00:17:14.841
doing two roles.

00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:15.841
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:17:15.841 --> 00:17:16.841
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, you'd choreograph and
you would direct.

00:17:16.841 --> 00:17:18.920
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Choreographing, directing,
producing--it's all part of it.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.290
I mean, and you can't really effectively--.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.850
I mean, let's put it this way.

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.500
"Hairspray" was much easier because I had
choreographed it for me because I was choreographing

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.580
for camera.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.220
So, when "Rock of Ages," I had, there was
only five weeks of prep and it was a much

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.310
bigger movie--same budget as "Hairspray."

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.350
It was literally, we were like, "You have
to back into a number."

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.970
And so, I said OK.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.410
And we did it.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:47.010
But I hired a very good colleague, who I think
is one of the greatest choreographers on Earth

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.010
right now.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.660
It's this woman, Mia Michaels, and she choreographed
it.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.300
And we have some Mia fans.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.300
[laughter]

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:02.930
And then, she's more of like, an artists-type
and wasn't used to working on strict production

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.920
schedules and "I need this now," and yadda
yadda yadda.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:11.760
On top of which, I was asking her to do stuff
that was so like she had never done before,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.350
which were sex.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.960
She does not sexualize anything and I have
all these strippers in the movie, boy band

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.330
choreography, which she was like--.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.710
I was like, "No, it actually needs to be the
Roger Rabbit.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.940
It needs to actually be--."

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.690
Like I want them to go like this.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.690
[laughter]

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:33.730
She was like, "I don't know who I am anymore."

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.760
And she'd cry and it was amazing.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.470
[laughter]

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.620
And so that was that.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:47.520
But that was hard because I would come in
to watch a rehearsal and I wouldn't be familiar

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.260
with all the stuff right away.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.260
But, you know?

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.030
That's what I do, so I was very quick to figure
it out.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.020
There were times when we would be shooting
and she hadn't finished the number.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.750
And so, she was making it up as we were going
along.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.080
And it was four o'clock in the morning and
I'm like, "Can you show me what's next?"

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.290
And she's like, "I'm not sure what's next."

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.080
And I was like, "Can we figure it out?"

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.080
[laughter]

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.610
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But oftentimes, those can
be the best moments for inspiration, right,

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.630
when you've just gone through the other side.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.980
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I mean, I, listen.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.540
I'm an adrenaline junkie.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.850
So, I live for that stuff.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:23.940
And actually, it's in the most dire, most
horrible moments that I go the most calm,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.940
you know?

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.840
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, back to being able
to preserve your energy so you can put your,

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.590
the most in the right spots--?

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.590
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.090
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: When you start to take on
producing, directing, and choreography, how

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:39.801
much more time would that add to a movie being,
when you're planning because you're on the

00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:40.860
set, you just--?

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.860
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: You know what?

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.780
I'm not really good at living in the world.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.440
I'm really good at living on set.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.230
And so, I'm just happy there.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.510
And so, it's all good.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.721
Do you know what I mean?

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:53.100
I would love to say, "Oh, it's so grueling."

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.100
It's not.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.440
I love it so much.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440
[laughter]

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.960
It's so much a better place for me.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:05.750
And me, running amok in the world, bad, bad,
bad, bad, bad.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:11.770
So, I just started writing my first screenplay,
which I was very excited about, that I actually

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:17.160
have the nerve to like, think that I could
look at a blank page and have something to

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.160
say.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.080
I imagine it's gonna be horrible, but I'm
excited.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.320
And like, I'm not talking about--

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.320
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You'd be old?

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.320
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: writing.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.090
I'm writing a children's book series, potentially.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.970
So, I've started doing that.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.430
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: In addition to the screen
plays and then you're also--.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.430
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.460
Well, that for some reason is much easier
for me.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.460
I don't know why.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.700
I don't know why.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.081
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Children's series.

00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:42.081
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Do you know why?

00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:43.081
[laughter]

00:20:43.081 --> 00:20:47.820
I come, like, a lot of my background is children's
theater, so I'm very versed in that.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.570
So, and it's weird 'cause I'm like a dirty
old man.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:51.570
[laughter]

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.570
So, it's weird.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.570
I mean, I'm not, but I-- [laughs]

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:54.570
[laughter]

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:55.570
Not really, but I'm like a person who's lived
in the world.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.570
Yeah.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.570
Yeah.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.570
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You just happen to choreograph
strippers.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.810
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I mean, but the strippers
in my movie are like Cirque du Soleil performers.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.590
They're like, they're non-strippers.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.410
They're professional pole specialists.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:08.410
[laughter]

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:13.310
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Now, trying to actually
control that environment, because to your

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:18.530
point, that time was so drugs, sex, and rock
and roll, and obviously, this is a look into

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.750
that at a window.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.470
Did some of that seep into the environment
on the set and you had to keep that control?

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:25.470
Or, were you enthusiastically--everyone was
super?

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.470
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Oh, God.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.470
No, no, no, no.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.470
Everybody's super.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.870
I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:40.330
When you're around Tom, there's just no room
for any of that--Tom Cruise.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.330
Tom.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.330
[laughter]

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.330
So, yep.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.330
Tom.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:50.260
He sets a bar of professionalism that is so
beyond anything you can possibly imagine.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.300
His enthusiasm, his energy.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.830
He's there two hours before the crew.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:02.560
It's embarrassing 'cause you're constantly
trying to live up to that, that standard of

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.390
professionalism and commitment.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.670
And that's my whole thing.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:08.670
It's like, "Look.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:13.350
My life is too short and living on sets, they
have to be happy sets or I'll kill people."

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.420
Like, you're happy or you're fired.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:23.590
It's basically my philosophy, so I insist
that it be a fertile, happy environ--.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.530
I mean, even when I was making "A Walk to
Remember," which is and then she died of cancer

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.250
movie, I was a happy set.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.250
[laughter]

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.170
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, I think that must
help bringing an ensemble cast.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.090
I mean, that's quite a cast.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.460
It's Paul Giamatti.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.480
It's Mary J. Blige.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.840
It's Tom.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.840
It's Alec Baldwin.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.840
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Everybody.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.840
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.910
It's, and everybody in a different level of
something and definitely big personalities.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.560
And but, in a musical, because it's none of
their forte--except for Catherine--that Catherine

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.260
Zeta-Jones.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.960
Catherine.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.660
[laughter]

00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:02.360
Other than Catherine Zeta-Jones, because they're
out of their comfort zone, everybody was really

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.650
into it and really, incredibly--.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.420
You know, it's a hard thing.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.420
You have to really rehearse.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:13.070
I mean, Tom Cruise literally willed a totally
different person onto himself--the way he

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.070
walks, his singing.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:19.120
He was singing four, five hours a day for
that many months.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.700
And I got scared he was gonna blow out his
voice.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.700
But it's insane.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.340
I mean, it's amazing the product that comes
out of that.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:34.400
For this, this movie is just like a party,
but the work that went into it was incredible.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.180
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And as far as discovering
what you're gonna do next, is your personal

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.260
screen play at the top of the list, or?

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.260
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Oh, God.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.260
No, no, no, no.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.260
That piece of crap is never gonna see the
light of day.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.260
[laughter]

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.260
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It's a good story.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.260
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: No, no, no.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.130
It's very, very cathartic and a lot of it
actually has to do with dealing with my demons

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.830
from when I was first coming out.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.630
And so, what could be more boring than that?

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:04.870
So, I'm in there doing that, but my next movie
is a movie called "This is Where I Leave You."

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.030
It's based on a Jonathan Tropper novel of
the same title.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.030
And what?

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.030
&gt;&gt;Female #1: [ ]

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:14.350
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah, Zac's doing it.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.350
Yeah.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.710
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Zac.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.080
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Oh, Zac.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.080
[laughter]

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.080
Yes.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.800
Jason Bateman, Zac Efron, Leslie Mann.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.830
I think Sudeikis, Malin Akerman.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:30.920
Goldie Hawn, after ten years, I got Goldie
playing the mom, who's basically playing my

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.740
mother, which is going to be fantastic.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.510
[laughter]

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:41.760
And she's a character who's just, or many,
many years, she was like the Erica Jong of

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.950
parenting--the books.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:47.710
Like, she was like the Dr. Spock, but hot.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.030
And in writing her books, she basically revealed
all the secrets of her family.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.550
So, her kids all hate her.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.910
But she's going on a book tour.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.590
And the father just died and she's just gotten
a giant boob job and she keeps trying to show

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.230
her boobs to the kids, like, during their
father's funeral.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.310
And it's, I cannot wait to get her out there
doing that.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.610
This is gonna be so cool.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.030
I'm so excited.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.030
[laughter]

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.030
But yeah.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.030
More casting announcements to come.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.720
And then, after that, I'm supposed to do a
giant green screen action adventure version

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.880
of "The Nutcracker."

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.970
'Cause I don't wanna take on the dancing version
because I'm not George Balanchine and that's

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:22.210
too scary.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:28.070
So, it's more like in the "Alice in Wonderland,"
"Snow White and the Huntsman" vein of "Nutcracker."

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.070
But like, yeah.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:33.350
I mean, I went from this "Rock of Ages" of
people like crazy singing and dancing to literally

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.960
a movie about people sitting in chairs talking.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.340
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And how does it go about
actually keeping in touch with the projects

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.180
as they're evolving to then finally say, "OK.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.900
I'm gonna be attached to this and this is
actually happening?"

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.070
'Cause oftentimes, you hear this stuff--

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.070
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.070
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: it's almost there.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.070
It's almost there.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.070
Oh, it's not.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.070
And then, it's back.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.070
And how do you--?

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.070
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Oh, I've had lots of movies
fall apart.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.070
I've had lots of them.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:58.830
I mean, a couple of my movies that I made
happened simply because other ones fell apart.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:03.040
And then, they slid one in 'cause I just wanted
to work.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.250
And, 'cause for me, it's perpetual school.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.240
I get paid to learn about how to keep doing
this.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:17.390
And there's reasons why names like "Cheaper
by the Dozen Two" are on my resume.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:18.790
You know about that?

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:23.510
I was supposed to direct "Four Christmases"
and that fell apart at Disney.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:28.850
And they literally were like, "Oh, we've got
this great family comedy and there's a spy

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.850
and it's good.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.020
And we're pay a lot of money."

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.020
[laughter]

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.000
And then, by the way, it's Vin Diesel.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.310
And I was like, "What are you talking about?

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.310
What do you mean I'm making a Vin Diesel family
comedy?"

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.310
[laughter]

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.090
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It was the "by the way"
after you signed something?

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.760
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I told the president of--this
is weird.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.820
The president of Disney at the time was this
brilliant woman named Nina Jacobson, who I

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.700
actually went to the same high school.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.360
And she just produced "Hunger Games."

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.600
And she was just like, "Yeah.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.440
You're gonna make this movie for me."

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.440
And my deal was there.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.740
Me and my sister had a deal with Disney at
the time.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.100
And I was like, "Oh, my God.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.210
I'm making a Vin Diesel family comedy."

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.210
[laughter]

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.400
"How much are you gonna pay me?"

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:19.260
I mean, it was, but it ended up being an incredibly
fun experience, that movie.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.110
That movie was, I can live with that one.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:26.750
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And is it, usually the contract
now is to get a director attached to something

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.210
first to get momentum after [ ]?

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.740
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: It's all different ways.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.550
It's director or actor attachments sometimes,
before directors.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:37.270
Because you know now, actors all have deals
and they're all producers and it's like, managers

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.290
are producers.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.760
It's all very, there's no one way it works.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.570
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And then, coming from an
engineering company, or at least personally,

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:49.290
sometimes you wonder about all the great movies
that Hollywood makes and all the not so great

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.290
movies.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:54.380
Is there a way to engineer it so you can somehow
produce more great ones and less bad ones?

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.850
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Not really.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:28:03.410
I mean, I haven't run a studio, so I don't
know exactly how the notions of quota and

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.940
all of that, or how that happens.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.190
But you can just hope for good scripts.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:16.720
I mean, I've basically, up until "Hairspray"
everything that I had done had at one time

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.110
been considered a very broken piece of material
and I had to go in and--.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.500
I was the fixer.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.500
And then, "Hairspray" was great.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.510
And then there was another one.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:32.680
And then, this was, "Rock of Ages" was pretty
funky because some of the construct of the

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.850
play, it was very breaking fourth wall.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.000
It was all narration.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.570
It was high camp.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.920
And it was stuff that I was like, "Well, to
emotionally get the audience invested, I'm

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.920
gonna have to--"

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Tweak the character.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.920
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.390
Do a little magic.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:52.150
And but, this one that I'm about to do is
just an incredible piece of material.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.290
So, I feel super lucky.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:55.820
Like, really lucky.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.860
Like, really, really lucky.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.070
So, like you don't get it how lucky I am.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.070
[laughter]

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:05.410
Like, I'm gonna talk to you really for a long
time about how lucky I am right now.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.170
No, but yeah.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.050
But quality control?

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.790
Hollywood's never been known for that.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.580
We're, that's not our game.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.620
We leave that to the Weinstein Company.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.720
We just, we cross our fingers and really hope
for the best.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.720
Let's put it this way.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.720
You know this.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.840
Nobody goes out trying to do shitty work.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.840
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yup.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.020
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: So, and these things are
very difficult and they're labors of love.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.710
And one, it is a year of your life and you
can find your life just passing you by if

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:35.990
you're making one of them.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:43.020
So, it's just like, there's a lot of trying
to be conscientious about what it is that

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.020
you're doing.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.020
OK.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.020
How great is this?

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.760
I had an assistant that quit.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.540
And he came up to me and said, "Well, I got
this opportunity to direct a movie."

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.250
And I was like, "Matthew, that is fantastic.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.250
What is it?"

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.370
He said, "Murder on Cheerleader Island."

00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.370
[laughter]

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.440
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Was that two, or--?

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.320
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: That is not a joke.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.690
That was actually the name of the project.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.730
And I said, "Don't tell me.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.480
It's about a series of murders on an island
during cheer leading camp."

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480
He's like, "Yeah."

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.280
And I was like, "Wow."

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.280
[laughter]

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.910
"I think you should take the opportunity."

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.700
[laughter]

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.890
'Cause everybody just wants to direct.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:26.820
They think, I was like, "But why do you wanna
direct if it's gonna be just like, 'Murder

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.010
on Cheerleader Island?'"

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.020
I mean, I get it, but really?

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.460
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I think we can start taking
some questions from the audience if anybody

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.800
wants to line up.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.590
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I'm very shy.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:37.590
So--.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.590
[laughter]

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.590
[pause]

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.740
Oh, he's not gonna ask me a question.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.110
He's going to the bathroom.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.110
[laughs] Awesome.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:47.250
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Can you just jump over to
the mic, so we can catch it on VC?

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.450
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.450
[pause]

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.850
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Went and saw "Rock of Ages" last
night.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:53.850
It was wonderful.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:54.990
Thank you so much.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.990
[applause]

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.990
It was a wonderful, wonderful show.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.990
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Thank you.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.780
I always get very nervous where I went and
saw it and--?

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.810
&gt;&gt;Male #1: My wife and I had a great time.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:03.810
So, thank you very much.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:04.810
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Ah, straight guy.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.820
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Sorry about that.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:06.820
Sorry about that.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.820
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.180
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Which leads into my questions,
because I have two sons.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.770
Well, actually I have four sons.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.310
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: How do you not know how many
sons you have?

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.310
[laughter]

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.990
&gt;&gt;Male #1: It's only about, it's the two oldest
that I wanted to mention.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.130
They're seven and six.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.380
And we have a tradition of watching musicals
all the time.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:29.420
And so, my question for you is doing so many
different musicals, you've had the "Rock of

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.450
Ages" project and "Hairspray" and then the
"Nutcracker" one, which I'm very excited to

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.450
hear about.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.230
What is the role--?

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:42.560
My boys really enjoy the classic Rodgers and
Hammerstein sort of stuff, or even the "West

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.560
Side Story" stuff.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.560
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Uh-oh.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.560
[laughter]

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.260
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Do those types of musicals exist,
or could they still exist in this world like

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.260
new material?

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.440
Can those things be rebooted in your thoughts?

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.320
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: You mean as films?

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.140
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Rebooted as anything.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.140
To expose--.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.140
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I mean, they are, they.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.420
&gt;&gt;Male #1: New material, updated material
to a younger generation.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.520
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I mean, they are endless.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.320
They're perennial on Broadway.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.980
I mean, there's constantly a new--.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:13.370
They just had a really successful run of "South
Pacific" and all of that.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.300
So, it's, they exist there.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:26.330
Making them now, I think, where they would
exist best and most is probably in cable now

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:29.360
because I don't think the studios want to--.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.980
I mean, they're making another "A Star is
Born."

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:41.540
Clint Eastwood is actually directing it, which
is fascinating.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.540
I don't know.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:46.310
I mean, there's always people coming up like,
"Let's redo Mame."

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.679
And I'm like, "Really?

00:32:48.679 --> 00:32:49.679
Redoing Mame?

00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:50.679
OK."

00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:51.970
And they were doing them on TV for a while.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:52.970
They did "Annie."

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:57.010
And Craig Zadan and Neil Meron are the producers
who actually were on "Hairspray" and had a

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.700
real nice run of those.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:06.980
But what audiences have a tough time, what
studios have a tough time with is financing

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.240
something that you don't feel a big audience
for.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:18.210
And it's safer to do something like on TV,
something like "A Sound of Music."

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:22.190
Well, first of all, why would you want to
remake something that is so brilliant.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.090
I don't wanna do that.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.150
People are always asking me, "Hey, why don't
we redo 'West Side Story'?"

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.740
And I'm like, "Why don't you go kill yourself.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.350
I have no interest in doing that."

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.470
[laughter]

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:38.790
But, I mean, the answer is kind of no in terms
of movie.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:43.920
They are trying to do a remake, and they haven't
for a while, of "My Fair Lady."

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.730
That's coming down the pike.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.000
I think Keira Knightley is who I heard.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.130
Is that right?

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:53.910
&gt;&gt;Male #1: And maybe I should clarify that
maybe it's not so much a reboot, but what

00:33:53.910 --> 00:34:00.280
if it's things that are in the same type of
genre, or I guess, the same--.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.410
"Rock of Ages," I can't take my seven and
six year old to.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:05.530
And it will probably be ten years before--.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:06.530
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: You can.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.000
You just have to take them out for popcorn
when Malin is having sex with her on the air

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
hockey table.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.240
&gt;&gt;Male #1: They'll be so full of popcorn,
they're not gonna make it home.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.240
[laughter]

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.240
But the--.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.929
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Wait till you see the extended
version, what I had to cut out.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:21.929
[laughter]

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.750
My sister called it the extends-ded version.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.810
[laughter]

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.930
But yeah.

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:29.740
I mean, listen.

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.570
"Hairspray," great for families.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:36.260
I mean, that movie did more for me with kids
than anything in the world.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:43.389
That was a huge deal for me 'cause it also
opened up parent/children, parent and child

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:48.520
conversations about racism, bullying, why
didn't they want Tracy?

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.820
'Cause that wasn't--.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.600
I mean, look.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.380
At the center of that story is a movie about
a fat girl who ends racism.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.380
How do you hate that movie?

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.570
You know what I mean?

00:34:58.570 --> 00:34:59.570
[laughter]

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.760
It's like, and get Zac Efron.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.130
So, that one was kind of easy.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:06.820
But I, you know what?

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:14.100
My godson, who's two and a half, if I can
get him away from the "Backyardigans," he

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.100
loves musicals.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.450
He loves all the old MGM musicals.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:19.460
He loves, and those are just, those last forever.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.950
So, the new ones.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.540
I mean, this one was sexy on purpose.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.160
But it's inherent to the world.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.520
But more are gettin' made.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.500
More are going to get made.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:36.770
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I have three somewhat related
questions about Tom.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.770
[laughter]

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.010
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I'm shocked.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:40.010
[laughter]

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.650
&gt;&gt;Female #1: So, why Tom Cruise for the role
of Stacee Jaxx?

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:48.960
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Because he was, he and Suri,
who basically rules that household, was a

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.850
huge "Hairspray" fan.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:56.650
And they watched it probably 300 times, apparently.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.270
And I met him at a party.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:04.170
Actually, at a one year old's birthday party,
literally sitting in one of those little baby

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.170
chairs.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.170
[laughter]

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.020
And he pulled up one next to me and started
talking to me.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.070
And he was like, "Hey, I'm Tom Cruise."

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.640
And I was like, "I know who you are."

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.640
[laughter]

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.590
"Why am I in a baby chair meeting Tom Cruise?"

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.740
And I actually stood up and it stuck to my
ass.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.790
[laughter]

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.810
And this is not a joke.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.910
That is a very true story.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:24.910
It made him laugh.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:29.170
He made some reference to wanting to do a
musical and I was like, "That's great and

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:30.800
that will never happen."

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.110
And then, this came along and I thought, "God,
if I could get the biggest movie star in the

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:39.330
world to play the biggest rock star in the
world, that would be an event."

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:44.850
And I certainly don't want to put out a musical,
put my name on something that's a musical,

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:48.870
that's my home, what I love the most, and
then not have people want to see it.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:49.870
Do you know what I mean?

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:54.380
So, I knew, it seems stunty, but it's still--.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.330
By the way, how many people here saw it?

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.270
Dude pulled it off, right?

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:05.110
I mean, like that was a lot of work that went
into that.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.280
And it was a gamble that payed off.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.910
&gt;&gt;Female #1: So, kind of a follow-up, how
difficult was it for him to get into that

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.050
role and what did he have to do?

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:16.740
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: We poured over, I sent him
every book known to mankind about those guys

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.740
in this period.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:24.330
And I talked to him endlessly about channeling
his intensity into being intensely lost.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:30.050
I wanted him just to like, not be a creature
of the world nobody says no to.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:36.870
And who, certainly Tom is not a stranger to
the notion of being a star.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:41.450
So, that was an easy in for him, but he, the
guy doesn't drink.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.130
To my knowledge, he never touched a drug.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.500
So, this is all very foreign.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.550
But he loved, it just made him laugh.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:54.130
The whole thing, he just thought it was so
weird that I was asking him to do a musical.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.371
And he just loved the opportunity.

00:37:55.371 --> 00:38:01.810
And especially being a father and Suri being
this incredibly creative, beautiful child,

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.270
he loved having music in the house a lot.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:07.930
So, it really, it did a lot in their family
life.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:14.320
Poor Katie has to listen to the guy sing now
every minute of the day, but the dude has

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.690
the loudest voice on the planet.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:17.690
[laughter]

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:18.690
Decibel breaking.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:23.160
&gt;&gt;Female #1: You touched on just a little
bit, but just in general, what's it like to

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.160
work with him?

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.580
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: He was the greatest experience
of my life.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:33.850
It was absolutely life-changing just in terms
of having to look at myself and just say,

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:38.160
"How present am I?"

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:43.330
And just really seeing, there's zero ego.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.980
There is just the work.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.880
And that is so inspiring.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.890
That is so inspiring.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:53.640
There's been a few actors that I've worked
with that have really taught me a lot.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.170
Michelle Pfeiffer was one of them.

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.750
Michelle.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.330
[laughter]

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:00.330
On and on.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:04.690
I've had the great pleasure of working with
people who really take what they do seriously.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.240
And I take what I do seriously because it's
all I do.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.150
I mean, this is amazing.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.520
I can't believe like I'm out of my editing
room or something like that.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.380
It's like, "Oh, wow.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.380
There's people."

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.570
So, it's great.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:18.910
It was amazing.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.750
He is as--.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.830
You know what's really funny about him?

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:27.380
When I look back now and think about the Oprah
thing and any of that stuff, that's real.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.890
Like, he gets that excited.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:31.990
He's like a kid.

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:36.510
He's guileless and just, he just loves stuff.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.590
And that's real.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:42.950
And so, sometimes, I was like, "You have to
stop liking this movie so much.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.420
Please, you're killing me, dude."

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.420
[laughter]

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.050
But he just never wanted it to end.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.050
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Hi.

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.430
First, my wife and I saw the movie last night.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:54.430
We loved it.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.430
It was fantastic.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:56.430
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Mm-hmm.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:59.210
&gt;&gt;Male #2: And this question may be a little
bit too close to your work for most people,

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.230
but I'm a product manager in the Ads group.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:06.840
I work on tracking how online advertising
affects people's activities in the real world.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.520
I was wondering if you could tell us anything
you're doing or that you know people in Hollywood

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.550
are doing with regards to integrating the
internet into movies and things in general?

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.550
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Oh, my God.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:20.680
It's a huge part of our discussions during
the marketing of a movie.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:32.850
They're now partially predicting openings
by Twitter activity, trending, certainly an

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:39.570
active Facebook page, anything that's interactive
with a greater audience.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:40.890
It's a big part of our discussions.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:45.060
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Do you do anything with things
that are more than just tracking ads, but

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.440
also live interaction?

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.520
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Aren't I doing it right now?

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.520
[laughter]

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.100
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Well, I'll give you a specific
example.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.180
In New York, there's a group called Punchdrunk.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.180
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Uh-huh.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.190
&gt;&gt;Male #2: And they do this live, interactive
theater example experience.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:05.970
And they're working on some things where you
integrate the live experience with the internet

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:10.660
experience, so that there's something happening
simultaneously.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.770
And there are other people who have done things
with voting systems and things like that.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:18.090
Is there anything experimental you know of
or anything that--?

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:22.040
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I don't know about it, but
I'm sure there is.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:32.130
A guy who I, a young director who I gave his
first job, he did the second and third "Step

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:33.590
Up" movies--Jon Chu.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.380
And he just did "GI Joe."

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.430
YouTube just gave him a whole channel.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:41.890
And that's all about dance stuff, material.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:44.950
And I know he's doing lots of different kinds
of work like that.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.130
He's really techy and really into it.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.790
And if anybody knows about it, it's him.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.830
He's actually, he's a pusher on that one.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:52.830
&gt;&gt;Male #2: OK.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:53.830
Thank you.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:56.370
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And I think that concept
of 360 degree media is really taking hold

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:02.191
because both in television, so I know you've
directed "Glee" and "Modern Family" and a

00:42:02.191 --> 00:42:04.230
lot of those experiences were like heroes.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.650
They existed outside of the film.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:08.440
So, you actually go to the website or you
go and experience something that's part of

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.790
the story line that's actually not just in
television.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.500
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I think that's fantastic.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.060
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You can look into the journey
of a film more and more because can give updates

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.800
from the set and really for fans to just participate
more.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800
It's so much easier.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.850
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:25.441
During the whole making of the movie, I was
doing the, I was trying to keep it as alive

00:42:25.441 --> 00:42:30.110
possible--tweeting a lot of pictures, doing
as much as I could.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:38.220
But we didn't do any live streaming stuff
because out of context, this movie could feel

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.220
weird.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.220
Do you know what I mean?

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.220
It looks a little odd.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.870
I mean, I think that audiences for this movie
aren't exactly gonna know what they're in

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:51.870
for when they go in because it is an unusual
hybrid of a movie.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:56.030
And it's hard to express the tone of the movie
in the advertising.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.410
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:58.410
Kind of?

00:42:58.410 --> 00:42:59.410
Weird?

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.990
Like, you don't really, I'm just assuming
from your reaction that it was better than

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.600
you thought it was gonna be.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.630
So, which I'm happy to take.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:06.630
[laughter]

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:07.630
By the way.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.160
So, that's all good.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.900
And that creates word of mouth.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.920
I'd rather have a low expectation with a high
result, you know?

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.270
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, I think that because
it has such a frame of reference that everybody--.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:20.980
You hear the songs and you automatically remember
and associate with those.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.930
And that brings both good stuff and possible
baggage, so yeah.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:24.950
I think that's good.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:25.950
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.020
And the same with cast members.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.020
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hi.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.020
Thanks for coming, by the way.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.020
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: My pleasure.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.020
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Yeah.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.020
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I'm loving this, by the way.

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.020
This is fun for me.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.370
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Comment.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.930
The school prom choreography in "She's All
That" was the best thing that ever happened

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:39.000
to me in sixth grade.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
So, it was awesome.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.140
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: That was me.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.140
[laughter]

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.770
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Thank you for that.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:45.400
[laughs] I love it.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.620
I love it.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.640
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yep, yep, yep.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.810
I had about two hours to put that whole thing
together.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:51.810
And I'm not kidding.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:55.020
That was actually, they literally brought
in the dancers.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:59.000
I taught them it in two hours in the lobby.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.130
It was the Cerritos Auto Square where we shot
that in like, Long Beach.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.900
And the next day, we were literally shooting
it all day.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.150
It was the craziest thing.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.520
I was just like, "Hollywood."

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.620
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Good times.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.620
Yeah.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:18.350
But my question is, Nicholas Sparks came a
few weeks ago promoting "The Lucky One."

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:19.350
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Uh-huh.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.850
&gt;&gt;Female #2: And I know he wrote "A Walk to
Remember."

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:22.850
I was wondering--.

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:23.850
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I have that song.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:24.850
I have two of them.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.850
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Definitely.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:30.310
So, I was wondering, what's the dynamics between
working with authors in movies that are adapted

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.310
from novels?

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.480
Like, what's that dynamic with working with
those authors as a director and things like

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480
that?

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Well, I can only speak to
mine.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Yeah.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.050
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: To my experiences, which
is during "Walk to Remember," that was, I

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:46.420
was very, very, it was very precarious because
I was changing the whole time period of the

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.220
movie and it was about his sister.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.600
So, I was very nervous about how he was going
to react.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.170
&gt;&gt;Female #2: 'Cause it was originally set
in the '40s.

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:57.540
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yes.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.540
Yeah.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:03.290
And so, what I made sure what I did--and I
did this actually with John Waters in "Hairspray"

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:08.380
and I'm doing it right now with Jonathan Tropper
on "This is Where I Leave You"--I have unending

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.200
conversations with them where I really keep
them in the loop.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.041
And they feel really appreciated and part
of the process.

00:45:15.041 --> 00:45:19.250
And I don't make any dramatic move without
talking to them.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:23.970
And it's not like what they say is gonna influence
me a lot because I have the story as I see

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.130
it in my head.

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:28.480
And once again, that's the only frame of reference
I can do it from.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:35.300
If I try to live in somebody else's box, it
just won't work.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.900
So, I just have Nick really close.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:44.460
I kept, and then "Last Song," I don't know
if you know the lore behind this, but this

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.810
was crazy.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.730
And this is so pure Nick.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:50.540
That Nick.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.360
[laughter]

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:58.590
That my, we got a call from Disney saying
Miley Cyrus, her favorite movie is "Walk to

00:45:58.590 --> 00:45:59.590
Remember."

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.720
And she wants to do a movie like that.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.720
"Do you have anything?

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.720
Can you come up with something?"

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.650
And my sister said, "Let me think."

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:07.070
And she literally had the nerve.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:14.750
She called Nicholas Sparks and he took her
call and she said, "Do you have anything you

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:16.270
could dust off?

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:18.450
Anything in your drawer that might--?"

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:25.400
He's like, "No, but I've been thinking that
my next book should be for young audiences

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.400
again.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.090
So, let me think about this."

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:32.140
And he called her back the next day and he
said, "I have it.

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:33.140
Here's what it is.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.450
And I'm gonna write the book and the script
at the same time."

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:36.450
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Thanks.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:37.450
Wow.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:38.590
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: "And I'm writing it for her.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:44.160
And I'll release the book right in time for
it to precede the opening of the movie."

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.530
And that's how that happened.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:47.270
And it literally just happened.

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:49.450
And I was like, that was crazy.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:54.381
Literally the book, "Last Song" was written
to make sure that Miley Cyrus had a movie

00:46:54.381 --> 00:46:55.780
version of it to be in.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.040
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Wow.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.290
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Yeah.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.290
Hollywood.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.290
Scary.

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:01.290
[laughter]

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:02.290
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Wow.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:03.290
Cool.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.620
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: So, but my thing is just
to keep them there.

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:09.180
And I've been very successful in terms of
my relationships with the authors as a result

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.070
of keeping, being very, very respectful.

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:17.170
John Waters sent me, after he saw "Hairspray,"
sent me the best email of my life.

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:20.130
He was driving back on the Acela train from
New York.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.730
He was going back to Baltimore.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:23.120
And he just wrote, "Just saw the movie.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.160
You've made me the proudest grandfather on
Earth.

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.160
Love, John."

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.440
And I was like, "I'm so happy."

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.440
[laughter]

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.440
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Cool.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.440
Thank you.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.900
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I think we have time for
one more question.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.020
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: I'll just be shorter in my
answers.

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.020
Sorry.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:45.100
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Do you have any examples or anecdotes
about the adversity faced being a untrained

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:49.250
dancer, choreographer and bursting into that
world?

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:50.250
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: The adversity of it?

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.780
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Yeah, like did you receive any
backlash from--?

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.820
&gt;&gt;Adam Shankman: Oh, oh.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:53.820
God, yeah.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.770
I was treated really badly by the--.

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:57.140
I was treated well by choreographers.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:00.369
I was treated very badly by the teachers because
I just had no training.

00:48:00.369 --> 00:48:03.020
And but they treated me because I was embarrassed
to tell them that.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.510
They treated me like I had like, 13 years
of terrible, terrible training that they had

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:07.510
to undo.

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:12.000
And I didn't want to expose the fact that
I had no training because then, it could have

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.070
created a fuffle in that how would they let
me in, all this stuff.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:22.850
And the Julliard philosophy is to break you
down and create the best technician possible,

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:24.440
so that you're technically prepared.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.440
So, yeah.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.850
I got beat up a lot.

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:28.200
I got beat up by the teachers a lot.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.200
That was hard.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.670
It was psychologically and emotionally very
hard for me.

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:33.910
I'm still clearly damaged as you can tell.

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:34.910
[laughter]

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:35.910
&gt;&gt;Female #3: But you made it.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:36.910
Thank you.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:37.910
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Very well.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.100
On behalf of Google, thanks everybody for
coming.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.100
[applause]

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:40.102
[rock ballad]
