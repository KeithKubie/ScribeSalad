As an institution of
higher learning, discovery,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.530
and service, it is critical
that we remain a community that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.940
accepts and encourages a
diversity of thought, heritage,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.800
and tradition.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.380
We must continue to be
a place that encourages

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.860
an open exchange of ideas.

As a public
university, our campus

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.200
is a public space, open
to all people of Arizona,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.330
where we must
support and respect

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.020
the constitutional rights of
students, visitors, faculty,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.610
and staff.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.000
Bear down, and go, cats.
