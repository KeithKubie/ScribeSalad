00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:01.805
- [Voiceover] All right, part b.

00:00:01.805 --> 00:00:06.453
A fresh zinc air cell is
weighed on an analytical balance

00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:10.029
before being placed in
a hearing aid for use.

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.085
As the cell operates,
does the mass of the cell

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:15.973
increase, decrease, or remain the same?

00:00:15.973 --> 00:00:19.973
Justify your answer to
part b one, or b i, b one

00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:24.297
in terms of the equation for
the overall cell reaction.

00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:26.178
So let's just think about
it for a little bit.

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:28.790
Does the mass of the
cell increase, decrease,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.427
or remain the same?

00:00:30.427 --> 00:00:32.273
Well, let's go to our
original reaction over here.

00:00:32.273 --> 00:00:33.806
This is our total reaction.

00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:37.637
The zinc is part of the metal air cell,

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:38.970
so that would contribute

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.053
to its weight beforehand,

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:45.431
and then it reacts with the oxygen.

00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:47.486
Well, where is this oxygen coming from?

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:49.959
Well, this is oxygen
is coming from the air

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:52.989
and essentially gets
incorporated into the zinc.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.089
So, before, the oxygen is in the air,

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.701
but then after the reaction,
after the total reaction,

00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.406
it gets incorporated with the
zinc, I guess I should say,

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:02.264
not into the zinc, of course.

00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:06.022
It gets incorporated with
the zinc as zinc oxide,

00:01:06.022 --> 00:01:09.389
and so now, the oxygen
is part of the cell.

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:13.261
Part, or contributes
to weight of the cell.

00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.678
So, contributes,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.070
contributes to

00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:20.070
the weight,

00:01:21.662 --> 00:01:22.749
the weight of cell.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.306
It doesn't contribute before the reaction,

00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:26.562
but it contributes after the reaction.

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:29.626
So our, the mass, and
I guess you could say,

00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:32.597
the weight, is going to increase.

00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:34.931
So I'll just write increase.

00:01:35.964 --> 00:01:39.903
And part two, we need
to justify our answer

00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:42.395
in terms of the equation for
the overall cell reaction.

00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:44.684
So let me just write the
overall cell reaction.

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:46.601
So, two zinc molecules

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.502
react with one molecular oxygen,

00:01:50.502 --> 00:01:52.169
one O_two, to yield

00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:54.648
two zinc oxide,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.368
two zinc oxide molecules.

00:01:59.368 --> 00:02:00.647
Well, what we could say is,

00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:05.471
is that this was not part
of cell before reaction,

00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:06.387
not part of

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.630
cell before reaction.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.279
It's coming from the air.

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.612
Before reaction.

00:02:16.242 --> 00:02:20.114
And then we could say, part
of cell after reaction.

00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:21.197
Part of cell

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.840
after reaction.

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:29.357
And we could write it
out in words, if we like.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:30.607
After reaction.

00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:33.878
And so I could say, oxygen,

00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:36.981
oxygen comes from air,

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:41.919
from, from air,

00:02:46.056 --> 00:02:49.827
air to be incorporated
into the zinc oxide,

00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:51.327
to be incorporated

00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:57.037
into zinc oxide

00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:03.277
which then contributes to weight of cell,

00:03:04.137 --> 00:03:05.593
or to the mass of cell.

00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:07.427
Which then contributes

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:12.194
to mass of cell,

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:13.027
to mass

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:16.648
of cell.

00:03:18.474 --> 00:03:20.134
All right, I think I feel
pretty good about that.

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.153
Now let's do part c.

00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:25.284
The zinc-air cell is taken
to the top of a mountain

00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:27.776
where the air pressure is lower.

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:31.143
Will the cell potential be
higher, lower, or the same

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:33.432
as the cell potential
at the lower elevation?

00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:36.260
Justify your answer to the first part

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.786
based on the equation for
the overall cell reaction

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:40.570
and the information above.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.476
Well, let me just write the
overall cell reaction again.

00:03:44.476 --> 00:03:47.981
So let me, the overall cell reaction.

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:49.126
I'll rewrite it again.

00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:51.626
So we have two zinc molecules.

00:03:54.132 --> 00:03:56.156
Let me write that a little bit neater.

00:03:56.156 --> 00:03:58.824
Two, and I wrote it messier.

00:03:58.824 --> 00:04:00.408
Two zinc molecules.

00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:03.033
One molecular oxygen.

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:04.447
We're going to have this
ingrained in our brain

00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:05.281
by the time this is done,

00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:07.235
I'm writing it so frequently.

00:04:07.235 --> 00:04:08.985
We get two zinc oxides.

00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:10.319
Two zinc oxides.

00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:14.002
And so what's going to happen

00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:15.652
if we go to the top of a mountain

00:04:15.652 --> 00:04:17.874
where the air pressure is lower,

00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:19.726
we have just fewer air
molecules in general.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:22.386
That means we're also going to
have lower oxygen molecules.

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:24.439
So we could say that the
partial pressure of oxygen

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.089
is going to be lower.

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:28.667
So we could say, partial pressure

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.258
of reactant will be lower.

00:04:31.258 --> 00:04:32.675
Partial pressure.

00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:36.823
There's just going to be fewer
oxygen molecules from the air

00:04:36.823 --> 00:04:39.987
being able to bump and react
with the zinc molecules.

00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:41.604
Well, actually, it's not
reacting with the zinc molecules,

00:04:41.604 --> 00:04:44.441
as we saw in the original reactions,

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.855
when we look at the half reactions.

00:04:45.855 --> 00:04:49.980
Fewer reactions from the air
just bumping in the right way

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.173
with the water molecules
and actually the electrons

00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:56.659
that are coming in through the circuit,

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:57.838
you're just going to have fewer of them

00:04:57.838 --> 00:05:01.137
bouncing around, being
able to do this reaction.

00:05:01.137 --> 00:05:04.673
So you could say partial pressure,

00:05:04.673 --> 00:05:07.089
partial pressure of reactant.

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:11.507
Or maybe I'll say partial pressure,

00:05:11.507 --> 00:05:13.343
or you could also do the
concentration of the reaction,

00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:14.676
there's going to be just, reactant.

00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:16.242
There's going to be less of it around.

00:05:16.242 --> 00:05:20.148
Partial pressure or we
can say concentration,

00:05:20.148 --> 00:05:21.815
concentration lower,

00:05:24.626 --> 00:05:25.459
lower,

00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:27.580
so lower,

00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:33.018
so lower cell potential.

00:05:33.018 --> 00:05:33.935
Lower cell,

00:05:35.864 --> 00:05:36.698
cell potential.

00:05:36.698 --> 00:05:38.315
So actually, I just did it in reverse.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:39.839
I answered part two first.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.517
And so part one is lower.

00:05:42.517 --> 00:05:45.075
So we're gonna have a
lower cell potential.

00:05:45.075 --> 00:05:46.825
Lower cell potential.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.573
It's really important to get
the conceptual understanding

00:05:51.573 --> 00:05:52.509
of why it's happening.

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.597
Remember, when we look
at the half reaction,

00:05:54.597 --> 00:05:55.876
what's happening,

00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:58.637
what is happening at our cathode,

00:05:58.637 --> 00:06:01.263
we have oxygen coming in from the air,

00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:04.866
and it gets into the kind of
pores of this porous substance,

00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:08.502
and when the oxygen,
the O_2 molecules bump

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:11.128
in just the right way with the water

00:06:11.128 --> 00:06:12.710
and the electrons coming in,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.337
they just kind of go together, and react,

00:06:15.337 --> 00:06:16.885
you get your hydroxide,

00:06:16.885 --> 00:06:18.535
for they react to form the hydroxide.

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:20.050
Now if you have less, you know,

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.508
at a lower elevation, you're
gonna have a lot of oxygen.

00:06:22.508 --> 00:06:24.326
You're gonna have a high partial pressure

00:06:24.326 --> 00:06:26.447
of the molecular oxygen.

00:06:26.447 --> 00:06:28.203
So there are a lot of them
(mumbles) moment in time

00:06:28.203 --> 00:06:31.444
are going to be available
to bounce around and react.

00:06:31.444 --> 00:06:33.296
But if you go to a higher elevation,

00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:36.056
you're just gonna have
fewer of these characters.

00:06:36.056 --> 00:06:39.491
So you're gonna have
fewer of these characters.

00:06:39.491 --> 00:06:41.848
So you're going to have a lower
partial pressure of oxygen,

00:06:41.848 --> 00:06:43.154
or you could think of
it as you have a lower

00:06:43.154 --> 00:06:46.125
concentration of oxygen inside the pores,

00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:50.713
so it's gonna be harder for
this reaction to move forward.

00:06:50.713 --> 00:06:52.363
And you can think about
the extreme situation.

00:06:52.363 --> 00:06:54.232
What if you were going to
a super high elevation.

00:06:54.232 --> 00:06:55.747
If you were eventually going into space,

00:06:55.747 --> 00:06:57.027
where you have very little oxygen

00:06:57.027 --> 00:06:58.835
or no oxygen at all, well then,

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.767
then the reaction's
going to stop altogether.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:04.835
So hopefully, hopefully that,

00:07:04.835 --> 00:07:07.636
that makes, let me just
go back to part c here.

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:10.159
I'm having trouble with my, oh,

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:12.986
this, then I go back to part c.

00:07:12.986 --> 00:07:14.403
And there you go.
