00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.880
TV ANNOUNCER: How
far out can you get?

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.380
That's the big question
in television today,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.330
and CBS has the big answer,
its fabulous new series

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.210
"Lost in Space".

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.500
NARRATOR: In 1965,
the CBS network

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.380
announced the
debut of what would

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.330
become television's
first prime-time

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.830
science-fiction series.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.880
TV ANNOUNCER: Wouldn't Dad
like to use this gadget

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.880
to beat that thruway traffic?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.750
NARRATOR: Set in the far
future of 1997, "Lost in Space"

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.170
told the story of a
family of space colonists

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.580
who become marooned
on an alien world.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.830
It underscored America's
growing acceptance

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.500
that mankind's
future was not here

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.540
on Earth but out in the
vast reaches of the galaxy.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.170
This trend continued when the
following year NBC premiered

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.880
"Star Trek", the epic saga of a
futuristic starship whose crew

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.080
is charged with
exploring the galaxy,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.620
seeking out new life
and new civilizations,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.580
and going where no man or
woman had ever gone before.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.920
Interestingly,
both programs would

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.460
appear in America's
living rooms years

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.460
before mankind would even
step foot on the moon.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.960
It is amazing that today
we are living in times where

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.790
only 40, 50 years
ago, people were

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.750
fantasizing about the future.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.620
And here we are experiencing
that said future--

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.750
not all of it, but many things.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.080
Where do we stand
50 years from now?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.000
I think science fiction
is a part of disclosure.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.500
Over time, science fiction
has become science fact.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.290
NASA ANNOUNCER:
Ignition sequence start.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.790
NARRATOR: Of course,
science fiction's role

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.420
in pre-envisioning what would
ultimately become the world's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.000
science fact was nothing new.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.790
But are many of today's
scientific wonders merely

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.500
the product of fertile
minds and wild imaginations,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.830
or do they have their
origins elsewhere,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.620
possibly light years away?

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.880
There's an interesting theory
the idea that certain profound

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.710
science-fiction writers may not
have just simply come up with

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.710
the ideas for their
stories on their own,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.710
or they may have
thought they came

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.960
with the ideas on their own.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.670
Perhaps there was an outside
force presenting it to them.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.540
Have science-fiction
authors and writers been

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.540
inspired by extraterrestrials?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.210
NARRATOR: Could
extraterrestrials

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.620
have given humanity
glimpses of its own future

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.210
through science fiction?

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.880
And if the creative
minds of the past

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.620
had been able to pre-envision
the incredible technologies

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.580
of the present day,
then should we also

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.380
regard the science
fiction of today

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.380
as a guide to where
mankind is headed next?

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.080
Where do we stand
50 years from now?

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.750
And if we're talking about
science fiction today,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.040
one recurring theme
is what happens

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.000
if we gain the ability to
upload our consciousness

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.580
to some type of a computer?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.330
Is it possible that our future
may lie in a digital realm?

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.250
I would not want my thoughts
to be uploaded to a computer

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.750
because then we
really become glass.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.710
This planet will cease to
exist within two seconds

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.420
if we all know each
other's thoughts.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.040
So there is a fine line we
have to walk between what

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.710
can and will ensure our
future and what can and will

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.210
be our assured annihilation.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.210
NARRATOR: According to many
ancient-astronaut theorists,

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.620
the visions of a bleak future
as depicted in today's science

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.880
fiction could, if
realized, prove as perilous

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.120
as they once seemed profound.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.540
But they also suggest that
the messages that mankind's

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.500
visionaries receive may not
be dire predictions as much

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.330
as they are warnings,
warnings intended to help

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.460
mankind avoid annihilation.
