00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.440
- Hello, everyone.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.180
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.900
I'm Kevin Belk.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.232
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:14.148
SETH MACFARLANE: Here?

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:14.620
Right here?

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.870
KEVIN BELK: You're right here.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.940
SETH MACFARLANE: Yeah.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.830
KEVIN BELK: Welcome
Seth MacFarlane,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.800
who is the show creator, writer,
executive producer, and star

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.500
of the show.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.730
Liz Heldens, executive producer
and writer, David A. Goodman,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.360
executive producer, Brannon
Braga, executive producer;

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.140
Howard Berger, makeup; and
Joseph Porro, wardrobe.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.200
So welcome everyone.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.337
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:40.170
KEVIN BELK: Welcome.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.070
So we have some featurettes.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.095
But first of all, congrats
on Season 2 pick up.

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:46.220
SETH MACFARLANE: Thank you.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.840
We'll start off really quickly.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.690
So Seth, we'll start with you.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.780
We know what you do on the show,
but talk about the genesis,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.000
where this idea came from.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.610
SETH MACFARLANE: I've always
been a huge fan of sci-fi

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.290
in many different forms.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.300
And it had been a while
since I had seen something

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.560
on television that was episodic
from start to finish, like

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.520
"The Twilight Zone," like "Star
Trek," where I was being told

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.160
a story, a brand new story
that had a beginning, middle,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.430
and end all on its
own on a weekly basis.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.120
And I miss that.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.239
And I kind of wanted
it back, because that's

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:29.280
what I remember watching.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.200
And there's a lot of great
serialized sci-fi out there,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.720
but there's really
nothing that presents you

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.719
with the new idea of the
week, and that was what

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.010
we're out to do with this show.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.730
And at the same time,
obviously, I come out of comedy.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.700
And you know, the other
thing I had not seen

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.790
was a sort of aggressive
casualization of life onboard

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.630
a spaceship, where people
kind of talk over each other

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.600
and behave in a not so formal
way, as I would imagine

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.250
is what day to day life is
like in the actual military.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.680
So it's where there's moments
of realism, where it's just

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.734
people behaving like
people, where they're not

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:15.650
always so buttoned up.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.770
So you know, those are sort
of the ingredients that

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.270
were, I think,
foremost in my mind

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.190
when I was coming
up with this idea.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.940
KEVIN BELK: Great.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.773
And Liz, we'll start
with you and go around.

00:02:24.773 --> 00:02:27.620
But just what are your roles
in the film, on the TV series,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.340
sorry.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.432
LIZ HELDENS: I'm a writer.

00:02:30.432 --> 00:02:32.765
SETH MACFARLANE: You're an
executive producer, too, Liz,

00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:33.160
for god's sakes.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.140
LIZ HELDENS: Executive producer.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.870
SETH MACFARLANE: She wrote
this episode tonight.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.495
KEVIN BELK: Oh!

00:02:36.495 --> 00:02:41.970
[CHEERING]

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.280
KEVIN BELK: Episode 109?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.090
JOSEPH PORRO: Oh, I'm
the costume designer.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.670
BRANNON BRAGA: I'm
a writer as well.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.240
DAVID A. GOLDEN: Writer as well.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.430
HOWARD BERGER: And makeup
and all the creatures

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.570
for the shows.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.154
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:04.154 --> 00:03:06.070
KEVIN BELK: OK, so we
have a featurette that's

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.153
going to get us into this.

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:09.804
So if we can cue up video one.

00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:11.578
Short.

00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:12.244
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:19.570
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.940
- The coolest thing
to me that we're doing

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.380
is we are doing model work.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.940
- Seth really wanted
a subconscious

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.180
feel of a real model, as opposed
to a computer generated one.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.780
We put the best of
both worlds together,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.670
designed it on the computer,
being able to print it out

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.890
from within, and then
we have this action

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.660
object that we could shoot.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.620
- It's not bad, right?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.090
- No, it's good.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.980
You paint some
flames on the side,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.720
maybe like a rainbow unicorn.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.470
You got something.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.300
- The more complex shots
of the Orville are CGI.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.590
But when you see the Orville
fly by, or if its a close shot,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.460
or if it doesn't have to do
something really acrobatic,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.180
those are models.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.540
We built an actual
model of the Orville.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.080
There's something that still
feels artificial and cartoonish

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.460
about a CGI spaceship.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.940
Even now there's nothing
that really smells

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.600
like a model that's real and has
been designed by human hands.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.720
As a sci-fi nerd,
that's probably--

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.080
might be the biggest
thrill for me.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.040
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.024
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:23.024 --> 00:04:23.940
KEVIN BELK: It is so--

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.570
SETH MACFARLANE: I'm
sitting right here.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.830
I could've just told you that.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.120
KEVIN BELK: It was on page 2.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.100
But no, it's so cool to
see models in action.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.183
I didn't realize that there
were models being used

00:04:33.183 --> 00:04:35.190
and such practical effects.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.360
And it's so, so cool to
see that brought back.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.140
It's really like an old
film thing that really

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.440
is replaced by CGI these days.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.990
So that was really important
for you to really have in there.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.120
So did that take some convincing
of executive producers at all

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.715
to go that route versus the CG?

00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:51.090
SETH MACFARLANE:
I mean, it was--

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.910
you can't do it for
the entire series.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:54.810
It's too costly.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.560
But for things like flybys
that you use every week, where

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.980
it's just establishing shots of
the ship, it actually becomes--

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.830
it's twofold.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.680
It becomes economically
helpful, because you

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.390
can reuse these same shots.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.920
And it just looks, you know,
it's actual light hitting

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.230
an actual surface, which is--

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.810
it is still-- particularly
on a television budget,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.790
it is still hard
to duplicate that.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.580
I mean, and our team
does a great job.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.350
They have fooled
me more than once.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.630
But I don't know.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.220
I had that ILM book
when I was a kid,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.584
and with all the pictures
of all the matte painters,

00:05:28.584 --> 00:05:30.750
and the model designers,
and the creature designers,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.340
and the set designers.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.310
And knowing that that thing is
actually real, and it's there,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.529
and you can touch it is to
me, I figure this is probably

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.820
the last time I'm ever going
to be able to do something

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.778
like this in my career.

00:05:42.778 --> 00:05:45.390
Because everything
is going to CGI.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.237
So it was a privilege to work
with somebody like Rob Legato,

00:05:49.237 --> 00:05:50.820
too, who I've been
a fan of for years.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.640
KEVIN BELK: That's so neat.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.900
And so for the writers, do
you guys when you guys--

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.110
when you guys come
into the show,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.370
and then when you got
onto the show, do you

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.140
guys find yourself
kind of backed up

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.390
against the wall a
little bit sometimes,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.050
where it's we want to do
this, but it's either not

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.883
in the budget, or we
don't have this set up.

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:05.670
Or how does it work with kind
of getting into the production

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.340
process and storytelling?

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.590
LIZ HELDENS: You know, we've
worked on TV for a while,

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.600
so you sort of understand when
you're breaking a story what

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.131
the limits are in terms of
what you can do on a television

00:06:15.131 --> 00:06:15.630
budget.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.660
But what do you sort of
see on this show, I think,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.990
is you see people
like Joseph and Howard

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.010
who bring their A game in a way.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.300
So you're seeing
costumes and you're

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.990
seeing makeup that
you really don't

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.710
see on other really
television shows.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.090
But yet this show is within
the budget of a normal show.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.420
And that same with our-

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.589
BRANNON BRAGA: This episode
was a great example.

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:40.380
Those aliens were--

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.860
DAVID A. GOLDEN: You want
to answer it, is that it?

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.620
BRANNON BRAGA: Well, you
weren't you weren't answering it

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.890
correctly.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.284
DAVID A. GOLDEN: All right.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.880
I thought this was
a great example of--

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.110
the script did not describe
what the aliens looked like,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.612
and these guys created something
amazing and very memorable.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.309
KEVIN BELK: Liz,
how about for you?

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:04.683
Particularly with this episode,
when you were writing it,

00:07:04.683 --> 00:07:06.270
did you work heavily
with Seth on it?

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.387
How did that work?

00:07:07.387 --> 00:07:09.470
LIZ HELDENS: We all broke
the episode in the room.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.570
And then we pretty much--

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.240
it was a pretty thorough break.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.790
And then I just went
away and wrote it.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.480
And then Seth fixed it.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.100
And then, now we're here.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.306
SETH MACFARLANE: I
don't have to fix much.

00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:28.520
We're begging her to
come back for season two.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.950
LIZ HELDENS: But I don't
feel like in the room that

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.580
there's ever any, I don't know,
Seth creates a pretty nice

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.400
space that I don't--

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.660
I mean, for me, I
never feel limitations.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.970
I always feel like
the story comes first,

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.860
the characters come first, and
then we'll figure it out later.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.440
KEVIN BELK: And what's the
lead time for a lot of this?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.940
Because it's
actually really crazy

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.529
to see each episode almost
get more and more complicated.

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:53.070
Especially when the
Krill episode was

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.980
the first time that I really--

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.770
BRANNON BRAGA: This
is highly unusual.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.607
Every script's
written ahead of time.

00:07:57.607 --> 00:07:58.940
LIZ HELDENS: Yeah, it's so nice.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.630
BRANNON BRAGA: Which
just rarely happens.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.510
So when we go into
production, the scripts

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:08.997
have been written and
vetted to a thorough degree.

00:08:08.997 --> 00:08:11.580
KEVIN BELK: Is that because of
the production time with makeup

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.081
and costumes and the wardrobe
and set making and everything?

00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:16.663
DAVID A. GOLDEN: Actually, this
was sort of driven by the fact

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.760
that Seth wanted to be
in the writers' room.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.660
And usually a star of a
show, if you're shooting,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.910
he wouldn't have been able
to be in the writers' room.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.584
So last year we wrote
all the scripts,

00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:28.500
and that gave us a lot
of flexibility in terms

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.640
of laying out the season.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.220
SETH MACFARLANE:
It's also, like, you

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.460
know, again, I haven't worked
in hour long live action

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.429
television before.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.110
And the idea of shooting
something and spending

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.169
12 to 14 hours a day
and killing yourself

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.870
to get it done on a
TV shooting schedule

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.690
and having it be something
that you haven't polished

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.430
to the point at which, you
know, the work is as good as you

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:59.157
can do, I don't think I could
make it through the day.

00:08:59.157 --> 00:09:00.240
Well, this is good enough.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.164
Now let's all stay here
14 hours filming it.

00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:04.330
No, you want it to be great.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:04.890
KEVIN BELK: Right.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.431
I mean, so you worked
in live action,

00:09:06.431 --> 00:09:10.275
obviously, before with
"Ted" and "A Million Ways

00:09:10.275 --> 00:09:13.460
to Die in the West," and now
with "Family Guy" and "American

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:13.960
Dad."

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.960
So what did you learn
from that previous work

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.459
that you brought
to this that helped

00:09:17.459 --> 00:09:22.370
you just get through the process
a little bit better and easier?

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.900
SETH MACFARLANE: Well, you
know, certainly VFX integration

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.249
is something that, with
"Ted," was, I mean,

00:09:27.249 --> 00:09:28.290
that was the whole movie.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.140
Was you're working with a
character who's not there,

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.620
and you have to shoot the scene
with a guy who's not there.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.430
So that was certainly
a big part of it.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.570
But it's also the planning.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.834
And dealing with a show
like "Family Guy," you know,

00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:42.750
it's an animated show.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.157
So you don't do coverage.

00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:48.490
You don't get this shot, then
this shot, then this shot.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.480
You get the shot that you
planned for, and that's it.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.730
So that's something,
coming out of animation

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.660
and going into visual
effects, heavy stuff,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.230
is kind of helpful.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.270
Because you do have to decide
before you even do the work.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.451
OK, this is the shot.

00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:06.700
You're not going to get to
cut to something different.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.700
And put, like, this is
the special effects shot.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:16.650
So animation conditions
you to work, making sure

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.680
that you're not going to change
your mind later on, that you

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.439
know how to plan scenes.

00:10:21.439 --> 00:10:22.230
KEVIN BELK: Gotcha.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.330
We were watching that
featurette video, too,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.306
for the wardrobe and makeup,
so let's take a look at that.

00:10:29.306 --> 00:10:29.972
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:29.972 --> 00:10:33.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.990
- To be able to create so many
characters that are tangible,

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.820
because nowadays
there's so much CGI

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.340
involved in filmmaking
and television shows,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.850
that you would actually have
practical makeups and creatures

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.452
and puppets and
mechanical heads.

00:10:47.452 --> 00:10:49.660
We were trying to do the
count of how many prosthetic

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.534
make ups we had done.

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:51.670
And it's over 5,000.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.740
Playing every single
day was more exciting

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.196
than you could ever imagine.

00:10:58.396 --> 00:11:00.020
When we first started
designing things,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.114
all I had was the script.

00:11:01.114 --> 00:11:02.780
The descriptions were
different than how

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.821
the creatures turned out.

00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:05.030
Bortus had a big evolution.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.440
The initial design process
was pretty long for Bortus.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.470
It was at least a
five month period.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.125
Once Peter Aiken was hired,
we brought him into KNB,

00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:13.320
and we life cast him.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.361
So we had his head, and
we could sculpt on that.

00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:17.360
And we went through a
couple different versions.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.680
We never quite hit it.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.267
I came down here, set up
a little sculpting area,

00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:22.850
and I just sat and
sculpted for, like,

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.350
three or four hours with Seth.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.900
And we finally hit on
what Bortus's look was.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.180
We went ahead, and we
designed it pretty simple.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.670
Peter would come in the morning,
and we'd get him prepped.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.416
And there was a cowl, and
his face would be exposed.

00:11:34.416 --> 00:11:36.290
And then we'd glue his
chin on, and then he'd

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.581
have a whole front of the face.

00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:41.060
What remains Peter is this whole
area here and his eye area.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.220
And the pieces are very
soft, and they were thin,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.025
so he was able to
maneuver his face.

00:11:45.025 --> 00:11:46.400
The first time we
had done it, we

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.600
had him sit in
front of the mirror

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.460
and just move around
and do expressions.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.865
You have to exaggerate
your facial expressions

00:11:51.865 --> 00:11:53.990
to some degree, and Peter
was really great with it.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.400
And as a makeup
designer, you want that.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.830
You don't want to have this
giant makeup on somebody,

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.150
and they can't act.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.962
He's just such a
great actor, and he

00:12:00.962 --> 00:12:02.170
brought that make up to life.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:10.810
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.340
KEVIN BELK: So how did you
convince Peter to do this,

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.680
that you're going to come
in every day for 14 hours

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.044
and wear this heavy
makeup or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:18.044 --> 00:12:19.210
HOWARD BERGER: It was tough.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.760
But he is so great, though.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.530
He was in for it.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.730
He's one of those actors
who, he understood

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.840
what the process was, and that's
half the battle right there.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.630
We do our job in the
morning, myself and Tami Lane

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.980
and Garrett Immel.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.830
And he goes through two hours
of makeup every day, probably

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.170
applied it like 60
or 70 times, I think,

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.880
through the course of the shoot.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.450
And he was always, always
there, and let us do our job,

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.610
and then he went to set
and brought it to life.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.110
And that takes a lot, you know.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.900
He never complained, was
really, like, the easiest guy

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.260
to deal with.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.920
KEVIN BELK: Joseph, how about
for you, with costuming,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.210
wardrobes in there?

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.240
What was the most difficult part
or the most exciting part also

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.115
for you when you were
creating these costumes

00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:03.920
and the main design
for the flight crew?

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.130
JOSEPH PORRO: Well, the alien
stuff they saw in this episode,

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.500
I can do that in my sleep.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.800
The crazy stuff is easy.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.490
The uniform, and it's
still a work in progress.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.861
We're still tweaking it.

00:13:16.861 --> 00:13:18.860
I don't know if I'll ever
be happy with it, even

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.170
on season 7, I'll probably
be doing something.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.920
But that was the biggest
challenge for me.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.990
And it's just these
high tech fabrics.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.690
When you're used to
building suits out

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.580
of wool, which form to the
body really beautifully,

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.255
and then you get a
high tech sneaker

00:13:37.255 --> 00:13:39.380
fabric, which is actually
what they're made out of.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.880
We had them all
custom made for us

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.230
in China, these fabrics
for these uniforms.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.170
So that was, I'd say,
the biggest challenge.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.870
And it's an ongoing work.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.670
But it's-- in eight
days, for him to pull,

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.567
and for me to-- we
have eight days.

00:13:57.567 --> 00:13:58.400
That's what we have.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.709
HOWARD BERGER: That's it.

00:13:59.709 --> 00:14:00.500
JOSEPH PORRO: Whoa.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.769
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:03.310
JOSEPH PORRO: Well,
it's not just us.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.510
I mean, I'm sure that's
every other department, too.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.970
But what's great
about this show,

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.360
and you guys can't see this
when you watch the episode,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.320
is behind the camera is one
of the best groups of people

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.600
I've worked in in 35 years.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.290
We actually like all our actors.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.220
They actually like us.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.900
And everyone says excuse
me if you do something.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.700
You know, it's just--

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.640
so we all are kind of psyched
to go in in the morning.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.001
We really look forward
to getting up at 4:30.

00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:34.834
HOWARD BERGER: Yeah.

00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:37.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.292
JOSEPH PORRO: Enough.

00:14:39.292 --> 00:14:41.750
KEVIN BELK: Well, I mean, when
you were building this crew,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.791
and you worked with a lot
of these people before?

00:14:43.791 --> 00:14:47.270
Liz, David, Brannon, you guys
worked together before right?

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.247
No?

00:14:48.247 --> 00:14:49.580
DAVID A. GOLDEN: Brannon and I--

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.900
I worked for Brannon on
one of the "Star Trek."

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.525
KEVIN BELK: OK.

00:14:51.525 --> 00:14:54.500
DAVID A. GOLDEN: But we'd
never worked with Liz before.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.785
JOSEPH PORRO: I worked
with Brannon on "Next Gen."

00:14:56.785 --> 00:14:57.770
He doesn't remember me.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.230
JOSEPH PORRO: On
season 1, and then

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.410
I did Salem with
him for three years.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.070
KEVIN BELK: And then what were
some of your guys' influences,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.960
I guess, when you're
putting together the show?

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.030
What, maybe when you were
growing up or whatever,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.290
when you're designing
this, and you're coming up

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.580
with the story and stuff,
what influenced you as a kid

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.729
to [INAUDIBLE] this
and create the series?

00:15:14.729 --> 00:15:16.520
SETH MACFARLANE: I
mean, for me, obviously,

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.634
I remember watching
the stuff that Brannon

00:15:19.634 --> 00:15:20.800
had written for "Star Trek."

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.800
I mean, there's this great,
great, thoughtful science

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.840
fiction.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.330
But you know, god, I
mean, I was also a big fan

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.470
of "The Twilight Zone."

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.053
I watched things
like "Night Gallery."

00:15:31.053 --> 00:15:33.970
Like, anything I
could find where

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:41.980
I was being told a story that
would keep me up that night.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:46.724
I remember reading a Stephen
King story called "The Jaunt."

00:15:46.724 --> 00:15:48.140
I think it was in
"Skeleton Crew."

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.200
And it kept me up
for, like, two days.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.950
This just blew my mind.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.700
And that's the
kind of stuff that,

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.570
in writing science fiction,
that I kind of look for.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:05.690
Is something that just sits with
me, you know, like a bad meal.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.170
And you know, it's tricky.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.830
And also to make
it human, to make

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.660
it something that feels like
it can exist in the real world,

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.680
and is not so exotic that
it doesn't take you out

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.010
of this kind of day
to day office life

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.385
that we're also
trying to create.

00:16:25.385 --> 00:16:27.343
KEVIN BELK: And we'll
kind of go down the line.

00:16:27.343 --> 00:16:30.400
But who were your influences,
Liz, when you were growing up

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.250
and got you into the
[INAUDIBLE] you do?

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.583
LIZ HELDENS: Yeah, I knew you
were going to ask me that.

00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:35.740
KEVIN BELK: Sorry.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.570
LIZ HELDENS: I watched
"Next Generation."

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.340
I watched "Star Trek."

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.010
And then I kind of put
that away and watched,

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.214
you know, me in my
20s, I just watched

00:16:44.214 --> 00:16:45.380
what everybody else watched.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.950
Like, you know, I just
watched all the HBO stuff.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.700
And then, when
this job came up, I

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.690
had forgotten all about
"Star Trek Next Gen,"

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.050
and then I found it again.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.680
And it was great.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.617
But I don't come
from, I mean, the work

00:17:02.617 --> 00:17:05.200
that I've done, I mean, the work
that I've done as a writer is

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.270
not like genre stuff.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.490
Like, I come from
"Friday Night Lights"

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:15.299
and super like feely,
feely emotional shows.

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:15.909
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:17.700
KEVIN BELK: This has
some of that in there.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.785
LIZ HELDENS: No,
it totally does.

00:17:18.785 --> 00:17:19.150
SETH MACFARLANE: It does.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.983
But I think that's--

00:17:19.983 --> 00:17:23.550
I mean that's what to me
you want in that room.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.589
I mean, ideally, you
know, you want people

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.260
in that room who don't come
from a sci-fi background

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.350
as well, who just are fucking
great at writing people.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.030
And you've got to have that.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.430
JOSEPH PORRO: I am a designer.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.570
So I do files.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.960
So I go, I'm all
through deviant art

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.760
and all these crazy websites.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.590
And I'm looking--

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.506
SETH MACFARLANE: What
are your favorite drugs?

00:17:44.506 --> 00:17:45.159
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:45.159 --> 00:17:45.950
JOSEPH PORRO: True.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.840
The late '60s [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.400
HOWARD BERGER: That's true.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.030
KEVIN BELK: Fair enough.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.114
How about for you, Howard?

00:18:00.114 --> 00:18:01.988
HOWARD BERGER: Yeah,
for me, it was I grew up

00:18:01.988 --> 00:18:03.130
on monsters and movies.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.060
So I grew up with the
classic universal monsters.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.390
And then TV was "Twilight
Zone" and "Night Gallery,"

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.230
absolutely.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.900
The green thumb one is the one
that got me, when they cut off,

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.720
and they--

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.350
and still scary.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.330
But just loved
monsters and films.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.820
And about eight
years old, I knew

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.100
I was going to grow up and
make monsters for movies.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.320
And I just worked towards
that my entire life.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.080
And you know, this is one of
the many great opportunities

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.510
I've had in my 35
year career now.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.690
So it's definitely one of the
most fun things I've ever done.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.580
JOSEPH PORRO: You know, him and
I did our first show together,

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.730
my first show as a designer,
first show of his makeup,

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.750
back in the mid-'80s.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.320
SETH MACFARLANE: Was what?

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.700
JOSEPH PORRO: I'm not going
to tell you the name of it.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.283
It's horrible.

00:18:45.283 --> 00:18:47.700
HOWARD BERGER: It's
called "Neon Maniacs."

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.160
I was 18 years old.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.970
Yeah, it was-- it's
a real-- it's great.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:51.470
JOSEPH PORRO: But it was--

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.511
HOWARD BERGER: Yeah, it
just came out on Blu-ray.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.030
JOSEPH PORRO: Let's
go back to 1980.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.363
SETH MACFARLANE: I'll
take your word for it.

00:19:01.363 --> 00:19:02.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.480
KEVIN BELK: David and Brannon?

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.040
DAVID A. GOLDEN: I watched
five hours of television a day.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.860
So whatever was on.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:12.660
Every sitcom, I was a big "Star
Trek" fan, giant, huge giant,

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.160
geek "Star Trek" fan.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.780
But sitcoms were also a big
part of what we watched at home.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.294
And I became a sitcom
writer because of that.

00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:23.460
SETH MACFARLANE: David wrote
for "The Golden Girls."

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.418
He won't tell you that.

00:19:24.418 --> 00:19:27.919
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:27.919 --> 00:19:29.460
DAVID A. GOLDEN: I
don't bring it up,

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.418
because I was also fired
by "The Golden Girls."

00:19:31.418 --> 00:19:34.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.420
KEVIN BELK: And Brannon?

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.240
BRANNON BRAGA: Any horror movie
I could sneak into as a kid.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:40.990
I liked horror.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.274
I was a big horror fan.

00:19:44.274 --> 00:19:45.690
KEVIN BELK: So
audience questions,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.400
I'm going to pass around this.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:48.900
Where is it?

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.190
Oh, right here, here we go.

00:19:52.297 --> 00:19:53.880
SETH MACFARLANE:
Google is not stuffy,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.690
like those other companies.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.149
AUDIENCE: We throw
our microphones.

00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:58.940
It's like, yeah, you
just can't see my face

00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.880
on that [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.024
Anyway--

00:20:01.024 --> 00:20:02.440
SETH MACFARLANE:
Now everyone else

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.260
is going to want to touch that.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.218
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know.

00:20:04.218 --> 00:20:06.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.310
This is awesome.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.230
We really appreciate it.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.320
So you guys do
realize that you've

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.460
made a better "Star Trek" than
all modern "Star Trek," right?

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.712
Like, this is a really,
really amazing experience

00:20:20.712 --> 00:20:21.420
going through it.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.790
This is actually the first
episode that I've seen,

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.820
and now I'm going to rush home
and watch everything else.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.030
But the question I
have is, how did you

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.030
go about getting network
approval to actually get this?

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.770
Because in my mind,
you have to, like,

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.190
admit some pheromone from
your body to go to Fox

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.222
and get this done?

00:20:39.222 --> 00:20:41.430
So I'm curious, like, what
that approval looked like?

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.810
What was the pushback?

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.190
What did you sort
of, like, where

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.780
was that happy
medium that you had

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.640
to reach to get this approved?

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.889
SETH MACFARLANE: You know,
it wasn't really that hard.

00:20:49.889 --> 00:20:53.250
I mean, Fox, in particular, the
way it was communicated to me,

00:20:53.250 --> 00:21:00.180
they had been trying to find a--

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.760
"Guardians of the
Galaxy" had been a hit,

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.350
the resurgence of "Star Wars."

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.870
They'd been trying
to find a sci-fi show

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.450
with a comedic element
that would work for them.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.490
And it's a hard thing to do.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.447
And generally, it's
done in the half hour

00:21:13.447 --> 00:21:15.780
format, which I always feel
like is part of the problem.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.170
Because you're already
one step removed

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.710
from reality, and
to me, the trick

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.862
was all right, keep
leaning into the comedy,

00:21:26.862 --> 00:21:28.070
and so it's making it harder.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.986
If we leaned a little
bit more into the drama,

00:21:29.986 --> 00:21:31.922
and let the comedy
just be garnish,

00:21:31.922 --> 00:21:33.130
then maybe that's the answer.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.460
But it really wasn't
that difficult. I mean,

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.110
they were excited by the idea.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.000
They felt like it was different.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.160
They liked that it was
episodic, because everything

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.310
is serialized now.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.200
And on a network, I
think, look, if it's

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.850
Netflix, if it's
Amazon, if it's Hulu,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.650
and you're getting
everything in one big chunk,

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.500
and you can binge watch
it, then it's great.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.540
It's hard for me,
sometimes, to invest fully

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.576
in serialized
programming on a network,

00:21:59.576 --> 00:22:01.200
because I got to wait
a week, you know?

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.100
I want to be told an isolated,
independent story, Rod Serling

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.139
style.

00:22:06.139 --> 00:22:07.680
But it was, I mean,
they were excited

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.960
by the idea from the get go.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:16.284
You know, nowadays, at least, at
Fox, the culture of the people

00:22:16.284 --> 00:22:17.700
that I work for
seems to be, look,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.130
we don't know where
the industry is going.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.150
You don't lose any more by
trying to be different and new

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.450
and do something that nobody
else is doing, so let's try it.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.500
KEVIN BELK: Great.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.430
Next question?

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.960
All the way back
there, back, back row.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.760
You got it.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.540
AUDIENCE: Hit
someone in the head.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.100
KEVIN BELK: You can
do it, throw it.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.810
DAVID A. GOLDEN: This
is very upsetting.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.310
Oh.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:45.330
I was wondering if you'd gotten
any kind of input or feedback

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.830
from people like William
Shatner or Patrick Stewart

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:50.820
on your show.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.280
Like, has there
been any reaction

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.850
from the original "Star Trek"
members or from "Star Trek

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:57.450
Next Gen?"

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.242
I was a big fan of that show.

00:22:59.242 --> 00:23:01.200
SETH MACFARLANE: I mean,
every once in a while.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.280
Obviously, Jonathan Frakes
directed on the show.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.480
Every once in a while, you
know, Marina Sirtis tweeted.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.634
I actually got a tweet
from Garrett, Garrett Wang.

00:23:11.634 --> 00:23:12.550
BRANNON BRAGA: Oh, no.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.207
What'd he say?

00:23:13.207 --> 00:23:14.790
SETH MACFARLANE: No,
it was very nice.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.140
It was very kind.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.630
But yeah, no, you know,
yeah, they've been great.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.690
I mean, you know,
Robbie McNeill,

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.010
Robert Duncan McNeill came
and directed on the show.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.970
There's a lot of people
who worked on those series

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.270
that we have crossed paths
with, and it's great.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.820
I mean, we're all fans.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.070
So it's cool to be
able to actually work

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.952
with these people.

00:23:35.952 --> 00:23:36.910
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:37.620
Thank you.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.340
KEVIN BELK: I think the
next question is right--

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.220
AUDIENCE: Shall I stand up?

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.350
So it seems like a
really cool opportunity

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.560
to create an entire
new universe in terms

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.260
of characters in the world.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:58.360
And all of the depth that you
can create for multiple seasons

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.690
and kind of create Easter
eggs and things that

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.010
are way out there.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.820
So what kind of challenges
did you find doing this?

00:24:10.239 --> 00:24:11.239
SETH MACFARLANE: Anyone?

00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:12.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.090
SETH MACFARLANE:
Well, I mean, look,

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:20.910
"Star Trek," obviously,
it's model of a spaceship

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.140
as opposed to a sailing
ship is something

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:28.695
that emerged from science
fiction prior, from the 1930s,

00:24:28.695 --> 00:24:29.320
from the 1940s.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.194
I mean, there were other
shows that did that.

00:24:31.194 --> 00:24:34.880
But they really were
the ones that kind of

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.042
put a memorable stamp on it.

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:39.000
And so the tricky thing
is, all right, anything

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
you do that deals with a
crew on a spaceship traveling

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.970
through space, you're
working in that territory.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:54.200
And "Star Trek" and "Star
Wars" have trodden those paths

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.300
so heavily that
it is a challenge.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.970
And so my solution
was really not to try

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.030
and twist myself into a
pretzel trying to all right,

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.710
you know, maybe, you
know, trying to do

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.000
something so exotic and new.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.458
I just kind of
embraced, all right,

00:25:09.458 --> 00:25:10.660
this is a bridge of a ship.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.260
It's a crew on a spaceship.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.010
Let's start there.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.680
What can we do that's
new from that point.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.750
And a lot of it was tone.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:22.724
A lot of it was the thing of
putting the two command chairs

00:25:22.724 --> 00:25:24.890
next to each other with the
captain and the ex-wife,

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.220
instantly turns this into--

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.040
it's now you're getting
into "Cheers" territory,

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.660
and that I haven't seen.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.020
But it's a fun challenge
to try and find

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.290
the idea of an all-male
species, of Bortus.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.800
And I haven't seen that before.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.460
The idea of the Krill being
a technologically advanced

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.580
species that still clings
to their religion very,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:56.030
very heavily is something that
this way I hadn't seen before.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:00.140
And it's trying to
find new ways to,

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.200
look, the basis of your
series is the universe.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.459
And so you should
never run out of ideas

00:26:06.459 --> 00:26:07.750
if you're doing your job right.

00:26:10.984 --> 00:26:12.363
Up here?

00:26:12.363 --> 00:26:13.782
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:13.782 --> 00:26:14.728
LIZ HELDENS: Oh.

00:26:14.728 --> 00:26:16.150
AUDIENCE: Aww.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.120
JOSEPH PORRO: And
we need a new mike.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.490
AUDIENCE: Does that, like, bump
really loud when I slant and--

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.230
that's awesome.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.337
This thing's cool, Google.

00:26:24.337 --> 00:26:26.170
KEVIN BELK: We didn't
invent it, by the way.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.360
We just bought it, right?

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.600
Yeah, we just bought it.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.022
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:33.022 --> 00:26:35.230
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask
David a question, actually,

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:36.484
if that's OK?

00:26:36.484 --> 00:26:38.144
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:38.144 --> 00:26:40.060
KEVIN BELK: They are
also people on here, yes.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:40.890
You can ask them.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:41.556
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:26:41.556 --> 00:26:43.040
Because you wrote
for "Futurama."

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.540
And--

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.050
DAVID A. GOLDEN: I did.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.220
AUDIENCE: --you wrote
an episode called

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.450
"Where No Fan Has Gone Before."

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:46.930
DAVID A. GOLDEN: I did.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:47.410
Thank you.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.285
AUDIENCE: Which I've
heard good things about.

00:26:49.285 --> 00:26:51.980
I don't know if
you want to say--

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.960
So you wrote for another sci-fi
show with comedy and feels,

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.460
right?

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.960
And I was just
curious if you could

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.827
talk about the experience at
"Orville" versus "Futurama."

00:27:01.827 --> 00:27:03.910
DAVID A. GOLDEN: Well, the
difference at "Orville"

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:09.130
is we-- well, thank you for
bringing up that credit.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.980
Actually, Seth got me
the job on "Futurama"

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.960
after "Family Guy" was
canceled In its third season.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.790
And he called them and got me
that so I owe him that, too.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.620
But the difference
on this show is

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.510
we break the show as a drama.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.990
That the stories
that we tell are

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.950
starting from a place of what
are the dramatic elements.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.810
And when you're breaking
a show in animation,

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:38.715
you're really much more
focused on what's the comedy.

00:27:38.715 --> 00:27:40.590
And so I think that's
the biggest difference,

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.810
that the core of this
show is much more related

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:48.310
to one hour drama, even
though there are, obviously--

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.130
this episode was
a flat out comedy.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:55.000
But in general, that's, I
think, the biggest difference.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.120
Otherwise, a lot
of similar things.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.310
What's the character's story?

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.090
How are people
going to be involved

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.067
and giving the audience
what they want.

00:28:05.067 --> 00:28:06.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.480
KEVIN BELK: Time for one more?

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.060
So I know all of you
have been in the industry

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.690
for a long time, longer
than I've been alive.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:18.957
So I guess--

00:28:18.957 --> 00:28:22.187
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:22.187 --> 00:28:23.270
SETH MACFARLANE: Fuck you.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:29.842
Sorry about that.

00:28:29.842 --> 00:28:30.550
Sorry about that.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.466
DAVID A. GOLDEN: You
know how to make friends.

00:28:32.466 --> 00:28:34.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.460
AUDIENCE: On the
most basic level,

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.480
I want to know how
you deal with burnout.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.810
How you sustain the
level of productivity

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:48.250
you're able to have in this
industry working in it so long.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.870
And like, I work
in entertainment.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:50.980
I'm doing my own thing.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.850
And I experience burnout working
a couple of years on a thing.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.466
Like, how do you do it?

00:28:56.466 --> 00:28:57.382
SETH MACFARLANE: That.

00:28:57.382 --> 00:29:02.277
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:02.277 --> 00:29:03.860
SETH MACFARLANE: I'm
only half joking.

00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:08.090
I don't know.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.210
You know, you got
to take a break.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.480
I mean, for me I get really--

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.800
I know it's coming.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.110
And it's usually if
I've gone a long period,

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.780
like if I've gone, like,
you know, longer than eight

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.410
months or so without a break,
I start to get really, really

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:28.130
ornery, and just a little cranky
and a little short with people.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.510
And it's not who I am.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:33.050
So that is always
the indication,

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.100
OK, you're going
into asshole mode.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.110
It's time to take a vacation.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:42.550
But you just have to make time.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.042
You know, take weekends off.

00:29:45.042 --> 00:29:47.250
DAVID A. GOLDEN: Working
with good people helps, too.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.600
If there's a lot of really
talented people around,

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.330
you can sort of doze off,
and let someone else do it.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.480
And I am saying it jokingly.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.850
But it is really
true on this show.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.290
Everybody is a really
talented group.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.980
And so when you're collaborating
with people, many of whom

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.410
are more talented
than you are, it

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.994
does help keep you
from burning out.

00:30:06.994 --> 00:30:08.410
HOWARD BERGER:
Yeah, definitely, I

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:14.170
think with us on the makeup,
hair, costumes, and all that,

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.860
we just were feeding each other.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.850
So even though we would have
three AM calls, which is always

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.590
Monday was 3 AM.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.619
And we would still get up.

00:30:22.619 --> 00:30:23.410
And I'd see Joseph.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.710
And I'm always curious
to see what Joseph

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:25.630
was going to wear every day.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.410
Because he wears something
different every day.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.284
But it would feed us.

00:30:28.284 --> 00:30:30.340
And we would just
play off of each other

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.420
and with Brannon and David and
Seth and the cast, you know?

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.190
And for the make up
department, we're

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.140
the first people
that greet the cast.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.630
So we keep the energy high.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.159
And that way, it
starts them off right.

00:30:43.159 --> 00:30:44.950
And then we're the last
people to see them,

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.330
and we end the day high as well.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.789
And then it's a
great day for them,

00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:50.330
and they look forward
to coming back.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.040
So it's being with
these great people.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.290
SETH MACFARLANE: Are you
actually an early morning

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.581
person, or is it something
that you just had to, like--

00:30:55.581 --> 00:30:57.697
HOWARD BERGER: No, I
am a morning person,

00:30:57.697 --> 00:30:58.780
but I've now developed it.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.830
Like, that's it.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:00.730
Like, I'm up.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.204
If I don't have to get
up, I'm up at 5 AM.

00:31:03.204 --> 00:31:04.120
SETH MACFARLANE: Yeah.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.203
HOWARD BERGER: It's crazy.

00:31:05.203 --> 00:31:05.930
It's ridiculous.

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.870
Like I was up at
4:30 this morning.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.520
Like, OK, what am
I going to do now?

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.260
SETH MACFARLANE: No, it's-- if
you were not the greatest guy

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.420
in the world and so talented
and I didn't love you so much,

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.795
I would want to
fucking kill you.

00:31:14.795 --> 00:31:16.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.180
HOWARD BERGER: Thanks, Seth.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.050
KEVIN BELK: And to wrap up just
very quickly, maybe go around.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.830
But what's the biggest lesson
you learned from season one

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.230
that you'll take with
you to season two?

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.685
JOSEPH PORRO: I don't know
if we're ever truly happy.

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:30.940
We always are, like, maybe we
could've just moved-- you know,

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.861
that's who we are.

00:31:31.861 --> 00:31:33.610
SETH MACFARLANE: That's
a very good point.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.180
JOSEPH PORRO: And that's why we
like to get up and work 18 hour

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:37.750
days.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.509
And there's a high
with the hard work.

00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:42.050
We just really like
what we're doing.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.480
SETH MACFARLANE: We're a bunch
of self-loathing people who are

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.570
just freaking never--

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:45.915
JOSEPH PORRO: And most
of us are divorced.

00:31:45.915 --> 00:31:46.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.611
JOSEPH PORRO: Yeah.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.660
SETH MACFARLANE: Honestly, for
me, I think more than anything

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.790
else, it's tone.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.000
And you know, I've
said this earlier.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.560
But it's, like, I've
seen a lot of shows

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.110
that have tried to do
the sci-fi comedy thing

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.490
and crash and burn.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.596
And it's a thing
that-- in movies, I

00:32:06.596 --> 00:32:07.720
think it's a little easier.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.010
Because it's a one off.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.510
It's big and splashy,
and you're not

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:15.070
being asked to invest in people
who aren't always surrounded

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.330
by amazing special effects.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.760
Sometimes you're just
standing in a room talking.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.850
And It's got to feel real.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:24.110
And if it's too funny,
the stakes go away.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:27.500
And if it's too serious, then
the show becomes too dark.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.510
So for me, it's tone.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:32.500
And I feel like,
interestingly, like we've

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.550
leaned, in recent episodes,
a little more into the drama

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.820
than I thought we would,
but it's kind of working.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:45.080
And I follow a lot of feedback
online, as much as I can.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.920
I love hearing what people
are saying about the show,

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.810
and I really do
take it to heart.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:57.340
And that seems to be the overall
sentiment is, like, look,

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.759
we're buying these stories.

00:32:58.759 --> 00:32:59.800
We're into these stories.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.310
We're buying the
sci-fi of it all.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.140
You don't have to throw a pie
in somebody's face once a page.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.790
We'll stay with
you, which is great.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:10.030
Because that's what's
fresh about it for me, too.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.880
And so tone is
really the big thing

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.190
that I've learned a
lot about this season.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.940
KEVIN BELK: Great.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.773
Well, thank you guys
so much for being here.

00:33:17.773 --> 00:33:20.440
"Orville" is on Fox,
Thursday at 9-10 Central.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.970
So thanks so much, guys.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.720
[APPLAUSE]
