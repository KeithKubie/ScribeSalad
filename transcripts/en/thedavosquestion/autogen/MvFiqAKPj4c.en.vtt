00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189
through social media and wireless
 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.969
through social media and wireless
networks so I look at our business and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
networks so I look at our business and
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770

access to health care today will provide

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
access to health care today will provide
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.510
access to health care today will provide
that access through wireless networks

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
that access through wireless networks
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.730
that access through wireless networks
and where they might have access we can

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
and where they might have access we can
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.950
and where they might have access we can
actually do things to help reduce costs

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
actually do things to help reduce costs
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.929
actually do things to help reduce costs
or give people the ability to better

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939

manage their chronic diseases like
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.100
manage their chronic diseases like
diabetes so I think wireless will have a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
diabetes so I think wireless will have a
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.859
diabetes so I think wireless will have a
tremendous impact on the globe it's

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
tremendous impact on the globe it's
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.080
tremendous impact on the globe it's
already the largest platform that human

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
already the largest platform that human
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.359

history has ever created and that's just

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
history has ever created and that's just

on voice I think the impact of providing

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
on voice I think the impact of providing
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.410
on voice I think the impact of providing
data connectivity and access to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
data connectivity and access to
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.929
data connectivity and access to
information will even greater so thank

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
information will even greater so thank
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.689
information will even greater so thank
you for your question
