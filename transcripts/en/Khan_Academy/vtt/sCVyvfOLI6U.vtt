00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.090
Let's see if we can write
the fraction 11 over 25,

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.450
or we could call
11/25, to see if we

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.000
can write that as a decimal.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.200
And we're going to round it to
the nearest thousandths place.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.780
And so another way of
viewing this is 11 over 25,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.740
this is the same thing
as 11 divided by 25.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.520
So we can literally divide 25
into 11, and whatever we get,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.100
that is going to be the decimal
representation of 11/25.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.518
And since we're going
to go into the places

00:00:30.518 --> 00:00:32.059
less than the ones
place, we're going

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.170
to go into the tenths
place, the hundredths place,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.570
and the thousandths place,
let's add some zeroes to this 11

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.700
right over here
after the decimal,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.750
and now let's start to divide.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.723
25 doesn't go into 1.

00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:45.880
25 doesn't go into 11.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.490
25 does go into 110.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.950
So 25 goes into 110 four times.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.850
4 times 25 is 100.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.010
So it goes into it four times.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.430
Let's keep the decimal up here.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.231
So we'll write 0.4.

00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:03.910
4 times 25 is 100.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.890
And now we can subtract
110 minus 100 is 10.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.870
And now we can bring
down another 0.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.550
25 goes into 100
exactly four times.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.607
4 times 25 is 100, and then
you subtract, and you get 0.

00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:24.690
So we actually didn't even
have to round this one.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.600
This fraction is exactly 0.44.
