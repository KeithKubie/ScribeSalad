00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.074
Let's look at the inverse of multiplication, division. What if we want to

00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:08.556
represent the log of a quotient? We know that division is just repeated

00:00:08.556 --> 00:00:12.772
subtraction, so using that knowledge, how do you think we might represent

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:18.626
natural log of 3 over 7? Remember, ln is just the same as log base e, so in

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:23.214
this slot, please make a prediction of how you would rewrite ln of 3 over 7 in

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:29.440
terms of natural logs. Think back to the product property, and how this might

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.732
be different for division instead of multiplication.
