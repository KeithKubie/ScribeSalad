00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:03.010
- [Instructor] Right over
here, we have the recipe

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.176
for super cake, which you
want to make for your guests

00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:09.505
that are coming over for dinner tonight.

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:11.630
But this recipe right over here,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.608
this is for 32 people.

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:15.775
This would serve 32 folks.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.278
But, you only have 16 guests coming over.

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:23.877
So, if you only have
16 guests coming over,

00:00:23.877 --> 00:00:26.181
what should be your ingredients here?

00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:29.149
How much of each of these
ingredients should you have?

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.316
I encourage you to pause the
video and think about it.

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:35.843
Right now, we're gonna think about, well,

00:00:35.843 --> 00:00:38.757
we're gonna have a slightly
smaller super cake.

00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:39.924
Smaller super,

00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:43.520
super cake.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.148
You might have reasoned that,

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:48.247
"Look, if we're going to
have half as many guests,

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:49.908
"then each of the ingredients,

00:00:49.908 --> 00:00:51.836
"we should just have half as much."

00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:52.804
And you would be right.

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:55.364
Instead of eight eggs, for
our smaller super cake,

00:00:55.364 --> 00:00:56.852
you could have four eggs.

00:00:56.852 --> 00:01:00.989
Instead of six cups of flour,
in our smaller super cake,

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.293
you could have three cups of flour.

00:01:03.293 --> 00:01:05.205
Instead of six cups of sugar,

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:07.873
you could have three cups of sugar.

00:01:07.873 --> 00:01:10.093
I'm just taking half of
each of these numbers.

00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:12.502
Instead of two cups of butter,

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:15.132
you could have one cup of butter.

00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:17.715
Instead of six teaspoons of baking soda,

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:20.815
you could have three
teaspoons of baking soda.

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:23.607
And, last but not least,
instead of two cups of water,

00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:26.757
you could have one cup of water.

00:01:26.757 --> 00:01:28.733
Now, this will work and this is actually

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.986
how you should adjust recipes.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:34.017
But there's something
interesting about what's similar

00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:35.386
about these two recipes.

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:39.117
The recipe for the main super
cake that feeds 32 people

00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:43.143
and the recipe for the smaller super cake.

00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:45.906
And that's the notion of ratios.

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:47.508
The ratios between ingredients

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:50.027
or the ratio of how much of an ingredient

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:52.635
you need for given guests.

00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:57.371
For example, you can see here
that for every eight eggs,

00:01:57.371 --> 00:01:59.321
you have six cups of flour.

00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:01.209
So, let me write this down.

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:02.042
So, for

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.733
every

00:02:06.037 --> 00:02:06.870
eight eggs

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.530
we have six cups of flour.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.363
We have

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:15.895
six cups of flour.

00:02:18.562 --> 00:02:21.512
Which can be expressed as a ratio of,

00:02:21.512 --> 00:02:24.345
the ratio of eggs to flour is 8:6.

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:30.376
Which is, once again, interpreted
as for every eight eggs,

00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:31.937
I have six cups of flour.

00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:34.770
If I said for every six cups
of flour, I have eight eggs,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.687
I would've written 6:8.

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:39.844
So, the order here matters.

00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:41.582
But here I'm saying the ratio

00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:46.345
of eggs to flour, of eggs
to cups of flour is 8:6.

00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:50.071
For every eight eggs, I
have six cups of flour.

00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:52.510
Well, what about for the smaller cake?

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.427
Well, here,

00:02:55.686 --> 00:02:57.353
for every four eggs,

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.006
for every four eggs,

00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:04.725
we have three cups of flour.

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:05.558
We have

00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:07.517
three cups

00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.174
of flour.

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:13.660
So, what would this ratio be?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.628
Well, for every four eggs,

00:03:16.628 --> 00:03:18.961
we have three cups of flour.

00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:23.142
So, the ratio of eggs to flour is 4:3.

00:03:24.063 --> 00:03:27.239
Now, turns out that these
are the exact same ratio.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.284
If you have eight eggs for
every six cups of flour,

00:03:30.284 --> 00:03:32.629
or for every eight eggs
you have six cups of flour,

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.858
that's the same thing
as for every four eggs,

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:36.396
you have three cups of flour.

00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:38.615
What you're just doing is
taking each of these numbers

00:03:38.615 --> 00:03:40.766
and you are dividing it by two.

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:43.349
So, you could say the
ratio in either case,

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.402
the ratio of eggs to flour,

00:03:45.402 --> 00:03:46.946
let me write this down.

00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:47.779
The ratio

00:03:49.177 --> 00:03:50.010
of eggs,

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:52.841
eggs,

00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:57.075
to two cups of flour.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.483
Let me write two

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.027
cups of flour.

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.368
Cups of flour.

00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:08.274
In either case is,

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:11.282
is four eggs

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.230
for every three cups of flour.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.976
This is going to be
true for either recipe.

00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:20.920
You have the same ratio.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.137
If you have eight eggs here,

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.193
so, for every four eggs, you
have three cups of flour.

00:04:25.193 --> 00:04:28.170
Well, that means your going
to have six cups of flour.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.481
This is why ratios are helpful.

00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:32.728
This recipe has a
different number of eggs,

00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:33.976
a different number of cups of flour,

00:04:33.976 --> 00:04:36.518
a different number of cups of sugar.

00:04:36.518 --> 00:04:39.856
But the ratios between the
ingredients are the same.

00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:43.600
So, you will be able to have
a cake that tastes the same,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.649
that essentially is the same cake

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:48.149
but just is a different size.
