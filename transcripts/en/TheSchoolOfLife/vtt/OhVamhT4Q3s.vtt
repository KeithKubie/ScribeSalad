00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.060
Though we tend to think of atheists as not only unbelieving

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.940
but also hostile to religion,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.840
we should remember a tradition of atheistic thinkers

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.480
who've tried to reconcile a suspicion of the supernatural side of religion

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.460
with a deep sympathy for and interest in it's ritualistic aspects.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.320
The most important and inspirational of these

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.240
was the visionary, eccentric, and only intermittently sane

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.240
French 19th century sociologist, August Comte.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.820
Comte was born into a strict Catholic family in Montpelier in Southern France in 1798.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.380
As a young man, he received a highly progressive education

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.500
and became obsessed with the idea of building a new kind of France based around science and republicanism.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.200
His family violently disagreed and broke off relations with him

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.700
so he went to live in Paris, where he became a student of, and later, secretary to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.420
the Utopian thinker, Henri de Saint-Simon.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.720
But Comte had a quarrelsome nature and fell out with Saint-Simon, failed to get a university post,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.700
and for the rest of his life, maintained a precarious existence

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.600
writing dense, often unreadable, works about the reform of humanity.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.200
He was not entirely sane and spent long periods in asylums,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.320
and in 1827, attempted suicide by jumping off the Pont des Arts in Paris.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.680
In 1844, he fell deeply in love with a married woman called Clotilde de Vaux

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.900
but the relationship was never consummated.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.560
After her premature death, Comte made his love for Clotilde

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.760
into one of his center pieces of his thinking on religion.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.480
Though a deeply eccentric man,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.800
Comte did manage to gain the trust and interest of the important British philosopher, John Stuart Mill,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.400
who admired his efforts around religion, and helped Comte to be better known in Britain.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.580
Comte's thinking on religion had as it's  starting point, a characteristically blunt observation

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.560
that in the modern world, thanks to the discoveries of science,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.080
it would no longer be possible for anyone intelligent to believe in God.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.600
Faith would henceforth be limited to the uneducated, the fanatical, women, children,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.720
and those in the final months of incurable diseases.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.860
At the same time, Comte recognized, as many of his more rational contemporaries did not,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.080
that a secular society devoted just to financial accumulation and romantic love

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.900
and devoid of any sources of consolation

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.560
transcendent awe of solidarity,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.880
would be prey to some untenable social and emotional illness.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.840
Comte's solution was neither to cling blindly to sacred traditions,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.220
nor to cast them collectively and belligerently aside,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.860
but rather to pick out the more relevant and secular aspects

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.980
and fuse them together with certain insights drawn from philosophy, art, and science.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.860
The result?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.520
The outcome of decades of thought and the summit of Comte's intellectual achievement was a new religion:

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.660
a religion for atheists,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.480
or as Comte termed it, "A Religion of Humanity":

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.600
an original creed expressly tailored to the emotional and intellectual demands of modern men and women,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.780
rather than the inhabitants of Judea or northern India in 400 B.C.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.520
Comte presented his new religion in two volumes:

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.180
the "Summary Exposition of the Universal Religion"

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.040
and the "Theory of the Future of Man."

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.940
He observed the traditional faiths

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.560
tended to cement their authority by providing people with daily, and even hourly,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.540
schedules of who or what to think about.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.120
Rotors typically pegged to the commemoration of a holy individual or supernatural incident.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.760
So Comte announced a calendar of his own,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.800
animated by a pantheon of secular heroes and ideas.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.640
In the Religion of Humanity,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.840
every month was to be devoted to the honoring of an important field of endeavor;

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.960
for example: marriage, parenthood, art, science, agriculture

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.360
and every day to an individual who had made a valuable contribution within these categories.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.060
Comte was impressed by the way the traditional religions

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.000
had disseminated moral guidance, for example:

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.660
dictating principles on how to conduct oneself in a marriage, or fulfill one's duties to the community.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.360
And he lamented the modern, liberal governments,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.860
in their desire to prove inoffensive to all constituencies,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.080
had settled on merely offering factual instruction

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.020
before letting people out into the world to destroy themselves and others

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.620
through their egoism and self ignorance.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.040
Therefore, in Comte's Religion of Humanity, there would be classes and sermons

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.200
to help inspire one to be kind spouses, patient with one's colleagues,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.060
and compassionate towards the unfortunate.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.580
Comte also recognized how badly we all need consolation

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.220
and proposed that his girlfriend, Clotilde, take the function previously accorded within Catholism

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.840
to the Virgin Mary.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.660
Portraits of Clotilde were to be placed everywhere in the new religion,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.980
and when one was down, one was invited to share one's sorrows

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.820
and weep in front of his vision of kindness and sympathy.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.360
Because Comte appreciated the role that architecture had once played

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.240
in bolstering the claims of traditional religion,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.780
he proposed the construction of a network of secular churches,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.800
or as he called them, "Temples for Humanity."

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.640
He suggested that each one be paid for by a banker,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.680
whose bust would appear above the door in recognition of his generosity.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.360
Rather than resenting bankers,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.320
Comte thought it was wiser to coax them into supporting good causes.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.880
Inside the temples of humanity, there would be lectures, singing, celebrations, and public discussions.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.440
While around the walls, sumptuous works of art would commemorate the greatest moments

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.680
and finest men and women of history.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.920
Finally, above the west-facing stage, there would be a large aphorism written in golden letters,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.600
invoking the congregation to adopt the essence of Comte's philosophical religious world view:

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.840
the statement, "Connais Toi Pour T'ameliorer"

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.200
(Know yourself to improve yourself.)

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.940
Regrettably, Comte's complex, thought provoking, and often deranged project

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.180
was felled by a host of practical obstacles.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.040
Ridiculed by both atheists and believers, ignored by public opinion, devoid of funds,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.360
Comte fell into despair and self-pity.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.820
He took to writing long and frightening letters in defense of his scheme

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.440
to monarchs and industrialists across Europe, including Louis Napoleon, Queen Victoria,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.180
the Crown Prince of Denmark, three hundred bankers, and the head of the parish sewage system.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.980
But few offered money, let alone replies.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.600
Without seeing any of his proposals take hold,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.160
Comte died at the age of 59, in 1857.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.220
Nevertheless, like Jesus, Comte was well served by his followers,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.120
and in the decades after his death,

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.780
his religion made some notable advances.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.620
The Chapelle de L'humanite was opened at 5 Rue Payenne in Paris, where it still stands to this day,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.560
and became a well known venue for secular baptisms, funeral services, weddings and sermons.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.440
Comte's religion crossed the channel,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.800
where it acquired 5,000 adherents,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.180
led with rare energy by a former Oxford don.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.300
In 1878, with the help of a legacy from an aunt,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.100
this don opened the Church of Humanity in Lamb Conduit Street in London,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.720
where secular services were held every morning.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.720
Comte's religion had even greater success in Brazil,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.620
where it was put into practice by some students that Comte had taught in Paris in the 1840s.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.540
El Templo de la Humanidad opened in Rio in 1890,

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.400
and others followed in São Paulo and Curitiba.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.040
Unfortunately, infighting among the leadership

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.500
connected to doctrinal squabbles about the place of Western authors and their liturgy,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.200
meant that the movement failed to grow into a truly popular religion.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.980
And yet it acquired a small and permanent place in Brazil's spiritual life.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.860
To this day, every Sunday morning in Rio de Janeiro,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:49.200
at 74 Rua Benjamin Constant audiences, who make up in intensity of what they lack for in numbers,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.640
arrive at the Templo de Humanidad to draw sustenance from the teachings of a Parisian sociologist's

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.020
unusual secular religion.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.280
Whatever its shortcomings, Comte's religion is hard to dismiss entirely,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.660
for it identified a psychic space in atheistic society,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.300
which continues to lie fallow and to invite resolution.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.400
Comte's work was an attempt to rescue

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.140
some of what is beautiful, touching, reasonable, and wise

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.540
from what no longer seems true.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.260
For these reasons and more it remains extremely timely.
