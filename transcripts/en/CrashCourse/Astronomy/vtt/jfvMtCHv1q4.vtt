00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.120
Stars in the sky look pretty. Flickering,
intense diamonds dotting the velvety night.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.680
But make no mistake: They are churning cauldrons
of violence, barely constrained thermonuclear

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.000
generators, creating enough energy to vaporize
the Earth a thousand times over.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.690
Their lives depend on it. Heck, our lives
depend on it! But in their case, how they

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.540
live, and how long they live, depends on that
creation of energy.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.060
And in this Universe, nothing lasts forever.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.320
Very roughly speaking, we can divide stars
into two groups: low mass stars and high mass

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.520
stars. That line lies around eight times the
mass of the Sun, and the reason for that is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.989
something we’ll get to shortly. Things get
VERY exciting at the high end, but for now,

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.469
let’s take a look at the low mass end of
the scale. Things are simpler there.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.180
Stars make energy in their cores by fusing
hydrogen into helium. This is actually a pretty

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.030
complicated process with lots of steps, but
in the end four protons plus some other ingredients

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.630
get turned into one helium nucleus. Each
time this happens a little bit of energy is

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.970
released, but in the core of a star it happens
countless times every second. It adds up to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.270
a LOT of energy: enough to power a star, in
fact.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.380
The rate at which hydrogen fusion occurs depends
on how much pressure the star has in its core.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.010
A higher mass star squeezes hydrogen harder,
so it fuses far more quickly. The rate is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.280
so much higher, in fact, that even though
they’re a lot bigger than low mass stars,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.720
high mass stars run out of hydrogen fuel in
their cores more quickly! The lower mass a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.850
star is, the longer it lives.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.310
In the lowest mass stars, cool red dwarfs,
the rate is so slow they last a long, long

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.390
time. But there’s more to it than that.
They fuse hydrogen only in their very centers,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.090
and their cores aren’t very big. Outside
of this small region the gas is convective,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.180
which means the hot stuff rises all the way to
the surface, cools, then falls back to the core.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.780
That’s important, because it means the entire
star is available for fuel. Both hydrogen

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.120
and helium rise up through the star and then
fall back down. The star can’t fuse the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.800
helium, but the hydrogen that makes it back
to the center is just more grist for the mill.

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:19.499
Even after a long, long time, these stars
can still shine as the hydrogen mixed throughout

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.059
the star eventually makes it down to the center.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:28.599
So how long can a really low mass red dwarf
last? A trillion years. A trillion! The Universe

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.559
itself is less than 14 billion years old,
so even the oldest red dwarf stars are basically

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.059
infants. They’re just barely getting a start
in life, and they’ll look pretty much the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:42.279
same for the next, oh 990 billion years or so.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.120
Eventually, though, they do run out of fuel.
When one does, the star itself will be nearly

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.900
pure helium (plus whatever heavier elements
it was born with), and fusion will cease.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.440
It’ll then cool, which will take many more
billions of years. Finally, it will be a cold,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.040
black, dead star. And for them, that’ll
be pretty much that.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.280
Or so we think; the Universe is far too young for
any of these red dwarfs to have run out of fuel yet.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.120
That’s true for stars at the lower end of
the mass scale, up to roughly a third of the

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.860
mass of the Sun. But stars with more mass than that,
stars more like the Sun itself, work a little differently.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.299
Their cores are bigger, and hotter, and denser.
The different conditions inside them means

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.439
the material in them doesn’t convect, the
hot stuff doesn’t rise away from the core.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.580
What’s in the core stays in the core.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.879
Outside the core there is a very deep and
active convection zone, but that doesn’t

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.409
interact with the material in the core itself.

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.540
This means that not only do stars near the
Sun’s mass use up their fuel more quickly

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.360
than red dwarfs, they have relatively less
fuel to work with as well. Depending on their

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.220
mass, their lives aren’t nearly as long.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.299
For the Sun, that total lifespan is about
12 billion years, give or take. The Sun is

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.959
nearly five billion years old now, so it’s
approaching middle age. Its life is similar

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.739
to other stars of similar mass, so let’s
take a look into the far future. Will our

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.800
Sun go gently into that good night?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.560
Ever since the Sun was born it’s been fusing
hydrogen into helium in its core. The helium

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.900
is trapped there, unable to be used as fuel,
and is building up in the core like ash in

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.109
a fireplace. As it does, the density in the
Sun’s core slowly increases. When you compress

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.329
a gas it heats up. That means, every day,
the Sun’s core gets a wee bit hotter.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.370
That extra heat works its way out through
our star, heating up the outer layers, too.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.050
A hotter gas shines more brightly, so the Sun
has been steadily increasing in brightness too.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.610
It’s an incredibly slow but inexorable process; the Sun’s
increased in luminosity by about 40% since it was born.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.230
And it’s not done. Helium is still building up in its
core and eventually it’ll run out of hydrogen to fuse.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.340
Without fuel, fusion in the core will stop.
Helium can be fused into carbon (and a little

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.780
bit of oxygen and neon), but it has to be
incredibly hot to do so, and the Sun’s core

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.909
won’t be anywhere near those conditions.

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.770
Still, half the Sun’s mass is bearing down
on the core, so even though fusion stops,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.080
the core will continue to contract and heat up.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.960
It’ll get so hot that the temperature outside
the core will get to hydrogen fusion temperatures.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.909
Like igniting a match by holding it near a
flame, the hydrogen outside the core will start

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:12.469
to fuse. That’ll occur in a shell surrounding the core, 
adding its heat to the outer layers of the Sun as well.

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:17.080
When you heat a gas it expands. The Sun’s
outer layers will do just that, and our star

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.630
will grow to well over twice its current size.
Astronomers call a star like this a subgiant.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.060
Not only will it grow, but its color will
change! The Sun will be giving off more total

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.719
energy than it does now, but its surface area
will increase so much that the amount of energy

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:37.199
radiated per square centimeter will go DOWN.
There’ll just be a lot more square centimeters.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.520
This means ironically that the surface will
actually cool; the Sun’s temperature will

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.360
go down. Cooler stars are red, and so the
Sun will be too.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.139
But the core still isn’t done. The details
are complicated, but the core continues to

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.939
contract and heat up. It gets so hot that
the outer layers swell even more, and the

00:05:54.939 --> 00:06:02.779
Sun can bloat up to a fantastic 10 to 150
times its present size! It will then be a red giant.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.280
Red giants are fantastically bright because
of all the energy percolating up from their

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.719
interiors, coupled with their enormous size.
When it turns into a red giant, the Sun will

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.659
increase its luminosity by an incredible 2000
times.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.699
That huge increase in luminosity does more
than just make the Sun bright, though. As

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.479
a red giant, the Sun will be so swollen that
the gravity at its surface will drop substantially

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.499
from what it is now. The force of gravity
holding it down is weak, but the force from

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:33.460
all that light blasting out from below is
strong, easily overpowering gravity. Material

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.780
on the surface will get blown off like a leaf
in a hurricane. Think of it as a super solar wind.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.639
That means the Sun will shed mass, a lot faster
than it does now. While it’s a red giant,

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.990
it’ll lose fully a third of its mass.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.330
At some point, the core contracts and heats
up so much that the conditions will finally

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.500
be primed for helium fusion. Suddenly, helium
is converted into carbon, releasing a lot of energy.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.340
In a weird twist, due to a lot of very complicated
physics, the core itself winds up expanding,

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.140
absorbing most of that energy.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.540
In the end, less energy is pumped into the
outer layers, so the Sun’s outer layers contract.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.289
The Sun shrinks. The outer layers get dense
again, which warms up a bit, and the Sun turns

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:19.650
from red to orange. It’s still pretty big,
more than 10 times its current day size, and

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.790
puts out 20-50 times as much energy as it
does now.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.350
But then we see a sort of reboot of what’s
happened in the core before. This time, though,

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:32.159
helium is fusing in the core, and the carbon
is building up like ash. Once again, the core

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.990
starts to contract and heat up.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.419
This dumps more energy into the outer layers,
they expand and cool, and the Sun turns into

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:44.360
a red giant AGAIN. This time it’s even brighter
and bigger, and loses even more mass, shedding

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.960
over half of what’s left.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.120
In the meantime, helium fusion isn’t very
stable, to say the least. It swings wildly,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.680
increasing and decreasing its rate by huge
amounts on very short timescales. The Sun

00:07:55.689 --> 00:08:01.149
will probably undergo a series of tremendous
paroxysms, epic eruptions as the helium fusion

00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:07.129
spikes, creating huge surges in energy production.
It’ll lose even more mass each time.

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:11.180
Finally, though, we approach the endgame.
The Sun doesn’t have enough mass to squeeze

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.800
carbon atoms enough to fuse them. They build up in
the core until there’s no more helium, and fusion stops.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.180
On top of that… well, there’s nothing
on top of that. By this time the Sun will

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:26.719
have literally blown off all its outer layers.
It’s essentially a naked core: a hot, intensely

00:08:26.719 --> 00:08:29.930
bright super-compact ball, not much bigger
than Earth.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.010
We call this a white dwarf. Its fate is sealed:
It can’t generate energy, so it’ll cool

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:41.410
and fade over the next few tens of billions of years.
At that point, we can safely say the Sun is dead.

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:46.300
… BUT, that’s not always the case for
all stars. Some, with more mass than the Sun,

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.000
still go through another phase before dying.
They form what are called planetary nebulae,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.500
and these are so amazing and beautiful that
they rate their own episode, which, along

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.410
with more fun stuff about white dwarfs, we’ll
get to next time.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.640
So that’s it for the Sun. But what about
US?

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.910
Of course, the Earth won’t fare very well
during all this. It’ll get cooked before

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.449
the Sun even becomes a subgiant, and by the
time the Sun is a red giant we’ll be good

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:13.949
and fried. The average temperature on our
planet will be so high that it’ll melt rocks,

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:19.670
and in a sense it’ll look much like it once
did so many billions of years before, when

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.260
it first formed: a molten ball of rock.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.350
But it gets worse.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.699
When the Sun expands, it’ll reach a radius
very close to the size of the Earth’s orbit

00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:31.769
now. Does that mean our planet itself will
be consumed by the Sun?

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:37.110
Maybe not. As the Sun expands, remember, it
loses mass. That means its gravitational pull

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:42.100
will weaken, and Earth will move out from
the Sun, into a bigger orbit. If things work

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.600
out right for us, the Earth will back off
faster than the Sun expands, and we’ll avoid

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.630
finding out what it’s like to be inside
a star.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.899
Due to a quirk of physics, if the Sun loses
more than half its mass, its gravity will

00:09:53.899 --> 00:09:58.389
decrease so much the planets will no longer
be gravitationally bound to it, and they’ll

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:02.269
be flung into interstellar space. I’m not
sure that’s any better for us.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:06.240
Either way, the Earth will have been long
dead, and hopefully humanity will have figured

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.199
out the trick to interstellar travel by that
time. All those Earth-like exoplanets around

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:13.719
younger stars will look pretty nice in a billion
years or two.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.980
Mind you, this isn’t happening any time
soon. The Sun won’t become a subgiant until

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.959
it’s nearly 11 billion years old, over 6
billion years from now. The first red giant

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:27.790
stage happens when it’s over 11.5 billion
years old, and the second stage a half billion

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.839
years later. This is a long, long time coming.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:35.810
If the Sun had more mass it could avoid this
fate. A star with about 8 times the Sun’s

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:41.930
mass can: It has enough mass to squeeze those
carbon nuclei hard enough to fuse them together.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.560
Those high mass stars have a much different
and far more explosive fate than lower mass

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.280
stars like the Sun…and trust me, we’ll
cover that in lots of fun detail soon.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.620
And while this all sounds very bleak, not
all is lost. This is all part of the natural

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:02.300
cycle of the Universe, and in fact we wouldn’t be here
at all if it weren’t for the way stars live and die.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.300
Be thankful for what you have -- and that we
can not only observe it, but understand it, too.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.440
Today you learned that very low mass stars
live a long time, fusing all their hydrogen

00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:16.680
into helium over a trillion years. More massive
stars like the Sun live shorter lives. They

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.960
fuse hydrogen into helium, and eventually
helium into carbon (and also some oxygen and

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.100
neon). When this happens they expand, get
brighter, and cool off, becoming red giants.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.020
They lose most of their mass, exposing their cores,
and then cool off over many billions of years.
