00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.049
&gt;&gt;Hi this is Wilmot Allen at the World Economic
Forum at Davos 2009. I'm the young globap

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.369
leader at the World Economic Forum, and also
CEO at Monroe Enterprises. Which is a management

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:19.560
consultancy to emerging markets, principally
to Africa outside the United States. I just

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.460
attended an awesome summit on Africa, and
I wanted to make one recommendation to the

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.230
World Economic Forum. That in light of the
tremendous investment presence that China

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.330
has developed and developing in Africa. I
wanted to suggest that in 2010 or perhaps

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.200
at one of the regional conferences this year.
That there could be an event that could bring

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.800
together business leaders from Africa and
China to dialogue.
