00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.856
So far in this lesson we've discussed sensory memory, short-term or working

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:08.090
memory, and long-term memory. We've also discussed the differing areas of the

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.226
brain that are associated with different types of memory such as implicit or

00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:16.360
explicit memory. One thing we haven't touched on yet is how emotions can play a

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.060
role in remembering a particular life event. Now think back to your own life

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.998
and an emotional situation that you remember. Whether graduating from high

00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:29.266
school or college, or your first date, or even the funeral of a loved one. Why

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.594
is it that we can remember details of these events, but we can't remember what

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:38.172
we wore to the gym two days ago. Well as it turns out, emotions play a key role

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:42.820
in remembering and retrieving information. Let's go take a closer look at this.
