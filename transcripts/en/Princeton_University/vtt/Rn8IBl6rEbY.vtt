MATTHEW RITGER: The title 
of my dissertation is

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.440
"Objects of
Correction: Literature,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.940
and the Birth of
Modern Punishment."

BRADIN CORMACK: I've had the pleasure 
of advising Matthew Ritger along

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.980
with my colleagues, Leonard
Barkan, Sophie Gee, and Nigel

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.700
Smith.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.760
MATTHEW RITGER: I study the 16th and 
17th century, which for most people

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.070
means either
Shakespeare or Milton.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.440
But I study the way that
literature of that era

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.500
was related to the carceral
history of the same era.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.300
BRADIN CORMACK: Matthew is immensely
creative and imaginative.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.690
He's extremely disciplined
as a reader and critic

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.980
and historian.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.900
He's voracious in his reading.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.570
MATTHEW RITGER: The beginning of the 
idea that you could use work training

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.410
and work discipline and
use temporary punishments

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.310
as a way of reintroducing
people to the workforce, that

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.768
began in this period.

00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:54.310
And that began at
these places called

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.170
the houses of correction,
and at this place

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.340
called Bridewell in London.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.280
So that's Bridewell
palace/prison.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.500
And you can see the
two courtyards that

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.090
became the prison
cells, and then you

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.240
can also see the long gallery
heading north-south there.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.490
And that long gallery
with the giant windows

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.040
was, on the one hand,
the famous aspect

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.110
of the palace that would seem
to be so ill-suited to becoming

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.610
a prison.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.452
But because they were
creating workshops,

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:18.910
and because there's
no electricity,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.670
and they need the light,
the workshops actually

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.190
were in these double-paneled
hall of incredibly tall windows

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.640
so that they could
work on their projects

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.260
and have the light to do so.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.080
I think when you're a graduate
student, you spend so long just

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.540
having to have faith
that your ideas are good,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.130
or that they will be rewarded,
or that the work you do

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.780
matters, but that there are
really few opportunities where

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.170
someone steps back
and really stands

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.210
behind your work in such a way.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.870
And so that feels
baffling and amazing.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.520
