00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.960
You can’t just go making propellantless
rockets, we have laws in this universe!

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.639
Hello impossible dreamers, Trace here for
DNews.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.189
Occasionally in science news, the same story
will rear it’s head, cause a big fight,

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.750
and then sink back down below the waves again.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.220
One such story is about the EmDrive [em-drive],
a type of propellantless thruster technology

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.910
that skeptics call the "impossible drive."

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.939
There are a number of different kinds of these
experiments collectively called: resonant

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.350
cavity thrusters, but this one has gotten
a ton of press as people try and figure out

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.800
if we can someday fly through space without
actually expelling anything.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.840
The EmDrive device itself is so simple it
almost seems like a prank.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.860
It’s basically a closed cone attached to
a magnetron (the same thing in your microwave

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.879
that makes… microwaves).

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.710
According to the inventor of the EmDrive,
Roger Shawyer, it works by bouncing microwaves

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.970
around inside the sealed cone.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.050
The waves carry momentum, and when they hit
the reflective surfaces of the cone they impart

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.039
their momentum to that surface.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.200
They exert more force on the large area of
the cone, creating thrust, and somehow the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.660
drive allegedly would move in the opposite
direction.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.160
The thing is, no one has yet proven it actually
works.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.760
Thus the moniker, "impossible!"

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.300
See, this explanation leaves many physicists
all hot and bothered, because to them it appears

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.340
the impossible drive is violating one of the
fundamental laws of physics: Newton’s Third

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.410
Law… the one that states for every action
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.530
By not releasing any propellant, there’s
no action so how could it have a reaction…

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.020
aka -- move forward.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.400
We’ve known Newton's Third Law for over
300 years and it’s the basis for all propulsion

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400
technology.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400
Want a car to move forward?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.780
Spin the wheels to friction your way forward.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.870
Want your boat to motor?

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.750
Push against the water with a propeller.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.530
Want your rocket to reach Mars?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.030
Explode a whole bunch of fuel and shoot it
out the back.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.470
So, the way the impossible drive is supposed
to work, is nothing gets out.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.550
The microwaves just bounce around inside the
cone somehow creating thrust.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.280
If it obeyed Newton’s Third Law, the microwaves
could put some pressure on the inside of the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.160
cone and bounce around, but it would go precisely
nowhere.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.350
But, if it disobeys Newton's Third Law, and
actually causes movement, then we’ve got

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.610
to rethink how we understand the universe.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.460
Shawyer insists his EmDrive doesn’t violate
the Third Law.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.860
His explanation is since the waves are traveling
at relativistic speeds, they exist in a separate

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.010
frame of reference and make the EmDrive an
open system, even though no microwaves are

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.010
escaping.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.080
Yeah, I don’t understand that either.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.980
Some studies attempting to prove the thing
works have had trouble measuring every possible

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.920
source of motion, and once the resultant thrust
was suspiciously close to the margin of error.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.730
To figure it all out, a study was presented
at the Joint Propulsion Conference in 2015.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.400
The researchers wanted to find any and every
error in measurement that was plaguing the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.490
study of the impossible drive -- anything
from magnetic interference to heat movement.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.140
At the end, they found some great results,
but still throw in our favorite phrase -- more

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.870
research is needed.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.150
So why don't we just launch one?

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.530
Then we'll know, right?

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.069
Well, Guido Fetta, CEO of Cannae Inc, a man
named after two Star Wars characters almost

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.700
-- invented a similar resonant cavity drive,
and wants to do just that.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.360
Fetta is planning to launch his design inside
a cubesat, likely in 2017.Typically these

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.880
satellites stay aloft for about 6 weeks before
falling back to Earth.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.240
If it lasts longer… that means it’s actually
propelling itself!

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.520
If it stays up for 6 months, we’re talking
about a revolution in spacecraft propulsion.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.290
If resonant cavity drives work, then gone
will be the days of heavy fuels lugged back

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.700
and forth from the ground.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.280
Instead, electricity can be harvested from
solar panels to power the magnetron!

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.300
They’d coast on the sun’s rays!

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.880
It’d be like getting free lunches all the
way to Mars.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.950
That being said, if the cubesat comes down
after 6 weeks?

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.970
Well, then we know Newton’s laws are still
pretty good.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.349
For now, the EmDrive is just theoretical,
but what about other possible rocket designs

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.590
for the future to help send us to Mars and
beyond?

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.190

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.739
Does the Impossible Drive blow your mind?

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.739
What do you think about it?
