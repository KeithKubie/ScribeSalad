00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.500
&gt;&gt;Troy: And here we go; Super Bowl 45 is underway.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.890
&gt;&gt;Joe: A fake hand-off arches a pass down
the near side. He's looking for Nelson. Over

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.290
the shoulder catch, it's a touchdown!

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.640
[crowd cheers]

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.989
[trumpets play]

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.290
First and 10, back to pass, Roethlisberger
and it's intercepted. It's picked up by Collins.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:29.640
It 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.400
is a touchdown!

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.170
[crowd cheers]

00:01:39.170 --> 00:02:00.630
&gt;&gt;Troy: Up in the middle. Dangerous pass kicked
off.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:19.700
&gt;&gt;Joe: Line drives down the middle; Jennings
touchdown!

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.470
[crowd cheers]

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.560

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560
&gt;&gt;Joe: Hand off to Mendenhall, Hines stepping
in for the Steeler touchdown!

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560
[trumpets play]

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560
[ inaudible] sack, Zombo brings him down.

[trumpets play]

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560
[inaudible] Roethlisberger, hands off the
ball. Oh, and a fumble on the play by Mendenhall,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560
scooped up by the play by Green Bay's Bishop,
that corner of the end zone, Jennings eight-yard

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560
touchdown pass by Rodgers.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.560
[crowds cheer]

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.560

Pittsburgh.

[trumpets play]

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560
The Green Bay Packers have won the Super Bowl.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.560
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We have Frank Supovitz
with us here today, from the NFL. He made

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560
that happen. And he is currently the Senior
Vice President of Events at the NFL and he's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560
been involved with some of the most prestigious
and high-profile events that you guys see

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.560
every year, both in the US and internationally.
In addition to the NFL, he's worked with organizations

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.640
such as Radio City Music Hall and the NHL.
And he's produced events ranging from the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.180
Super Bowl, the Pro Bowl, the NFL Draft, and
the international series that gets played

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.010
in London. And he's also produced events like
the NHL All-Star Weekend, the NHL Draft, the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.270
Stanley Cup Finals, and even such events as
the Bicentennial of the US Constitution, the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.950
opening ceremonies of the US Olympic Festival,
and the Goodwill Games. Frank was inducted

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.500
into the Event Industry Hall of Fame in 2006.
He was featured on the truTV series, NFL Full

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.129
Contact, last year. And he's also the author
of two books on event management that are

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.850
pretty much textbooks in the industry. And
the list just goes on and on from there. So,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.390
without further ado, I'm going to this over
to another fellow Googler from the NYC office,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.959
Michael Anderson, and he's gonna introduce
you to Frank.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.180
&gt;&gt;Frank: First of all, thanks for having me
here, all of you. It's really a pleasure to

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.709
be at Google and if you've enjoyed NFL football
and you enjoy that brand, I have to tell you

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.860
that Google's a part of my life, too, both
professionally and personally. And I'm delighted

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.700
to be here and honored to be here. And I think
that probably a lot of you went through college

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.349
not knowing exactly what you wanted to do,
or thinking you knew what you wanted to do.

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.940
Some of you may have gone for law and ended
up doing something else. I ended up in the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.970
sciences because I studied what I loved and
if that's what you did, you did the right

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.280
thing, I think, in that I got to do what I
loved. I actually, while I was in college,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.580
I'm a city university guy. I'm from here.
How many of you are from New York? A majority,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.479
many of you. Not the majority, OK, but I'm
a city university guy. I went to Queens College.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:29.360
I took biology there. I just wanted to get
into academia, research, and teach down the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.440
line. I wasn't looking to be a doctor or anything.
I just enjoyed what I got in to. And while

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.600
I was there, I was ushering at Radio City
Music Hall in the 1970s. And it was an incredible

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.010
opportunity because while I was ushering,
or actually, when I just got out of college

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.610
and I was still an Usher Captain at the time,
the company changed. It went from something

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.031
that your parents will remember, some of you
may remember when they did a movie and a stage

00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:05.310
show as one ticket, and that's what I was
ushering at. That was the format when I was

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.040
ushering there. When 1979 rolled around, they
decided to become what they are today, which

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.470
is a multi-disciplinary entertainment center,
where they do live events, they do some film

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.370
premiers and special events and concerts and
that sort of thing. And I was offered a management

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.160
position there and it's just an incredible
place to work and a great place to learn the

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.231
entertainment business. And I was learning
from the ground up, so I said, "You know what?

00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:32.560
I'm gonna put the science thing on hold for
a little bit. I'm gonna see how this works

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.710
out." And ultimately, it did work out pretty
well, because by the time I left there in

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.800
1989, I was the Director of Special Events
there.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.910
&gt;&gt;Michael: Fantastic. And then you moved on
to the NHL at that point and got to see the

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.910
leagues expand quite a bit--

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.910
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.139
&gt;&gt;Michael: from just the Big Six, a smattering
of Canadian teams, to really expand down to

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.530
the Sunbelt and other areas, so.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.610
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah, and that was really a natural
outgrowth, interestingly enough, from the

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:07.850
Radio City years, because Radio City at that,
in the I would say about 1984 or so, decided

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.060
that it was gonna take some of its production
experience, the things that it could do inside

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.310
the building and do things outside the building.
So, serve other clients, other events, not

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.930
necessarily in the theater itself. And the
first event I worked on there was actually

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.900
a half-time show for the Citrus Bowl.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.139
&gt;&gt;Michael: Um-hmm.

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.900
&gt;&gt;Frank: And then that ultimately became a
half-time show for the Super Bowl, Super Bowl

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:37.600
22 in 1988. So I really started to get a lot
more sports work in there. I worked on the

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.240
Olympic Festivals as, I think, Sam mentioned,
and the Goodwill Games and those types of

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.310
things. So, at that time, the event industry,
much like your industry, was really nascent.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.550
It was very, very new. So what ended up happening
was, there were people who were doing events

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.710
because they were PR agents or they were marketing
agents or something like that. But very few

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.400
people were event people; people who actually
shaped these things, themed them, organized

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.970
them for a living every day, 24/7. Radio City
got in on that very, very early. When the

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:20.289
NHL came calling, they were outsourcing all
of that. So in 19-, it was the '91-'92 season,

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.610
where they actually decided to have an event
department of their own. They had a meeting

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.880
planner and an assistant. I came in to help
bring all of the events that they do, whether

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.710
it's the All-Star game, you see some of the
entertainment that we had done--

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.710
&gt;&gt;Michael: Sure.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.840
&gt;&gt;Frank: which is very, very similar to what
you see as a half-time show at Super Bowls,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.389
we were doing that out on the ice during All-Star
games. So what you saw were Bare-Naked Ladies

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:46.970
out there, the group obviously, not the concept.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.970
[laughter]

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:55.860
And again, we were throwing that stage out
there in a hurry. We only had the time in-between

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.320
periods to be able to stage a quick couple
of numbers and then flood the ice and then

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:07.340
get the players back out there. So, what they
also did, what the NHL also did, was start

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:14.039
to enhance their draft. And they looked at
the NBA and the NFL, what they were doing

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:20.669
on television. And what the NHL did was made
it a bigger live event. So what you see there,

00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:25.450
at the NHL Draft, which is really intriguing
and very different from what we do at the

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:31.240
NFL, you see all those table that are kind
of go from right to left, that's a media riser.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.229
That's where all the writers are that are
covering the event, and what you see in-between

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:41.130
there and the stage is actually all of the
teams having a table of 21 people around it.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.860
So, all the war rooms, for those of you who
watch the draft, the NFL draft, all those

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:51.810
war rooms are actually each of those tables
at the NHL. And they're actually making deals

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.040
between the tables.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.470
&gt;&gt;Michael: So it's a big, open forum, in other
words.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.130
&gt;&gt;Frank: It is. And what's amazing is, with
all the secrecy that teams have and who they're

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.660
gonna draft, how they're gonna draft, what
they're gonna do. The drafts are amazing things

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.970
because they're business meetings. That's
really what they are. They're player selection

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:12.200
meetings. The NFL was able to take it from
something that happened in a ballroom, to

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.600
create a television show out of it and now
it's on ESPN and NFL Network and it's the

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:25.529
highest rated non-sports event on ESPN every
year. So that's coming around again in April.

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:32.680
We also did an award shows at the NHL. This
one, I think that's Nickelback, if I remember

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.190
right, in that particular year.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.680
&gt;&gt;Michael: A lot of Canadian bands.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.500
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, you know, that's, that, I think,
is the key difference between the NHL and

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:47.160
the NFL. The NHL has a great following here
in the States, but its life and religion in

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.160
Canada.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.700
&gt;&gt;Frank: And in the United States, the NFL
holds that position. So I've been blessed

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.990
to be able to work on both sides of the border
on brands that were really, really important.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.040
&gt;&gt;Michael: There's you and Sammy in the Cup.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.510
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yup. Sammy's in the back. Sammy and
I have worked together for ten years in two

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:13.070
different leagues. One of the things that
people don't know about the Stanley Cup presentation,

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:19.360
if you watch hockey at all, is the on-ice
presentation that everybody's come to know,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.120
has always been the players lifting the Cup
over their heads and skating around with it.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:30.839
And the trophy itself has this kind of mythology
around it. We're starting to create that at

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:39.950
the NFL, too, but in a different way. And
what you've seen since 2006 is the Vince Lombardi

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:45.060
trophy, which is our Super Bowl trophy, was
just kind of presented by the broadcaster

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.459
to the commissioner to the owner of the winning
club. Now, we have this whole walk-out, where

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:55.060
there's a blue or red carpet that comes out.
We get a Hall of Famer. You saw Roger Staubach

00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:01.020
in the video bring out the trophy. And now
what's happened spontaneously is the players

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:07.149
all reach out and try to touch it as it comes
on up. So, it's creating its own piece of

00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:12.430
production, if you will that people are now
waiting to watch. It used to be, when the

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.709
game was over the television went off. People
left the stadium. Now, more and more people

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:21.970
are staying to see it 'cause it's pageantry,
it's exciting, its entertainment, and it's

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:22.970
meaningful.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:30.430
&gt;&gt;Michael: Fantastic. Gonna fast forward ahead
a little bit. You end up at the NHL, summer

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:35.540
of 2005, I don't have to remind anybody what
a terrible time that was in the Gulf region

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:41.459
with Katrina. So you're now at the NFL in
2005; in charge of events production. You

00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:45.541
were then tasked with raising money for that
region for the NFL. Tell us a little bit about

00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:46.579
what that must have been like.

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:50.700
&gt;&gt;Frank: You know what? That was a period
that I was being paid, but you didn't have

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:58.589
to pay me. It was really an incredible experience.
The Saints were obviously unable to play at

00:11:58.589 --> 00:12:02.760
Superdome. It was a place of last refuge during
Katrina. Everybody knows the horror stories

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:09.649
there. It was a horrible period for that city.
I was actually in Los Angeles finishing off

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:15.019
the kick-off to the 2005 season. We had an
event that was looking forward toward the

00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:21.060
40th Super Bowl. We did it at the LA Coliseum,
which is where the first Super Bowl was played.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:27.740
So we had this big concert out there. It was
part of a television show on NBC and I got

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:34.230
a call during rehearsal that the league was
thinking about doing a telethon to help the

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:41.230
Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, which was helping
to revitalize New Orleans or help people get

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:46.579
back on their feet right away. So it was just
a few weeks after the storm, quite honestly.

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:50.120
And so, I had to hurry back as soon as the
show was over. I got out on the redeye. We

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.870
went back. We spent the next ten days inventing
a telethon. And what, I think, is interesting

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.860
about it is I had never done a telethon before
and there was nobody I was working with who

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.730
had done a telethon before. But what we did
know was there's an entertainment piece, there's

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.639
a piece that has to be produced, and then
there's a fulfillment piece, which is how

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:13.330
do you raise the money? You always remember
people getting on the telephone whenever you've

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.370
seen a telethon. They were all there answering
the phone and how do those payments happen?

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:23.760
We didn't know any of that. So we were actually
very, very lucky. Our friends at Ticketmaster,

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.170
which, obviously, work with almost all of
our teams, have call centers all over the

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:33.139
country. So we were able to work with them.
Nobody knew it was Ticketmaster that was actually

00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:39.540
taking the calls. We promoted an 800 number
during a Monday night football broadcast.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.610
We actually, for those of you who may remember
this, we actually moved the Saints game to

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:50.610
the Meadowlands here in New Jersey. They played
at Giants Stadium. They played a home game

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:56.690
against the Giants at Giants Stadium. So we
actually took all the Giants staff and moved

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.970
them out of the building, basically. And Sammy,
in the back, produced the game for the Jumbotrons

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.100
and we wanted to make sure it was a Saints
home game. There were a lot of people from

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:12.550
New Orleans there. We flew a number of people
there. And it raised millions and millions

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:18.870
of dollars, which was an incredible thing.
Fast forward a year and now we're back at

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.399
Superdome and it's ready to open again. Nobody
ever expected that you'd be able to finish

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:29.079
off a building that had been so incredibly
badly damaged. And it was incredibly damaged.

00:14:29.079 --> 00:14:36.839
It was essentially not an indoor stadium anymore
after the storm. So it had to be repaired

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:41.540
up to the point where it's habitable again,
where people could actually be in the building.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:48.300
We could hold a ball game there, and we did.
We were able to do an enormous event, which

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.649
if you talk to people in New Orleans they
really think that was the night that changed

00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:59.139
how New Orleans saw itself. The Saints were
always a big part of New Orleans culture,

00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:05.779
but they became really a beacon of hope and
something to rally around, which obviously

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:10.829
got paid off in the Super Bowl last year.
But we had the Goo Goo Dolls outside, whether

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:17.300
you had a ticket or not. You can come on out
and enjoy the show. They sang Better Days

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:23.029
as part of the television show. U2 and Green
Day on the inside kicked off the ball. New

00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:26.910
Orleans won; we didn't arrange it that way.
They had to do that on their own. They played

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.910
the Falcons--

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.910
&gt;&gt;Michael: I remember that, they played the
Falcons.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.649
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah. They played the Falcons. And
it was an incredible night. And you still

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:38.769
hear it. That's the night we knew it was gonna
be OK to be in New Orleans again.

00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:44.540
&gt;&gt;Michael: Fantastic. And the NFL, I'm sure,
it was a huge coup for you to play such a

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.790
central part of helping to turn that region
around.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.670
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah. It was very, very rewarding.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:52.740
&gt;&gt;Michael: Let's talk a little bit about the
Pro Bowl. I know friends of mine and I always

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.769
say to them, "Hey, you gonna be watching the
Pro Bowl this year?" They go, "I'm not gonna

00:15:55.769 --> 00:16:00.100
watch it." And yet, when the rating came out,
the ratings are huge, especially the last

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:07.339
two years. Last year, the Super Bowl was in
Miami. The Pro Bowl was in Miami. Again, it

00:16:07.339 --> 00:16:11.940
was held this year, a week before, and it
was moved back to Hawaii. What played into

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.940
that?

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:20.500
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, we're always trying to figure
out what the next thing is and how you continue

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.889
to grow your product, how you continue to
grow your brand. We knew that the Pro Bowl

00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:31.079
was kind of a little bit of a lost child.
All-Star games in other leagues have a different

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:32.079
reason for being.

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:33.079
&gt;&gt;Michael: Sure.

00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:39.639
&gt;&gt;Frank: They're mid-season. Their championship
games are usually best of seven series. You

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:43.880
never know where they're gonna be until two
days before they happen. So if you're going

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:50.269
to have a corporate opportunity to thank your
sponsors, to thank your fans, all of that,

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:55.079
that's gonna be at an All-Star game and an
All-Star weekend. That's what the NHL did.

00:16:55.079 --> 00:17:00.380
That's what the NBA and Major League Baseball
does. The Pro Bowl isn't that because we have

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.740
a Super Bowl where we know that's gonna be
somewhere four years ahead of time. So, if

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:11.389
the Pro Bowl is after the Super Bowl, its,
you've just done the biggest thing ever and

00:17:11.389 --> 00:17:17.350
then you just trail off into an All-Star game
and everybody goes, "Why?" So we were getting

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:23.329
three ratings, four ratings on network television
and it was less than it should have been.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:28.380
So last season, not this past season, but
the season before, we moved it to the week

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:34.460
before. We moved it to Miami, which is where
the Super Bowl was, Super Bowl 44, and played

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.080
it in the same stadium just to see what it
would do; what the dynamics, what dynamics

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:45.010
would be different. We sold 20 thousand more
tickets and really, that's a function of the

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:50.960
size of the stadium. Hawaii's Aloha Stadium
is only 50 thousand, 70 thousand in Miami.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.419
But the ratings went up 40%.

00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:54.419
&gt;&gt;Michael: Wow.

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:58.799
&gt;&gt;Frank: And ESPN broadcast it so it was actually
an artificially low rating because when you're

00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:03.281
on cable, the ratings are just generally gonna
be a couple of points lower. Well, ratings

00:18:03.281 --> 00:18:09.120
went up 40% and I think everybody here knows
nothing goes up 40%. No ratings of anything.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:16.400
If anything, ratings go down except for Super
Bowls, somehow. So we said, "OK, we've got

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.299
something." It's now a point in viewing for
our fans. What we also did, because it was

00:18:22.299 --> 00:18:28.570
in Miami where the two teams that would be
playing in the game would be, in the Super

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:33.400
Bowl game would be, we were able to get the
quarterbacks down there. We got Peyton Manning

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:38.850
down there and Drew Brees. They were part
of the introductions. They were also kind

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.210
of the halftime interview and if you saw it,
it was just magical television. These are

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.020
the two guys who would be battling it out
in the Super Bowl the next week and they were

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:54.070
just having an awesome time on the sidelines,
talking with ESPN. So this year, we had already

00:18:54.070 --> 00:19:00.110
had a deal with Hawaii to go back and we had
that deal for the next year as well. We said,

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:06.990
"Why don't we leave it on that previous weekend?"
because it obviously created some television

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.990
appointment viewing.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.990
&gt;&gt;Michael: Sure.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.780
&gt;&gt;Frank: We did that. It was incredibly difficult
to manage. We could talk about that if you'd

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:18.140
like in a little bit, but because Super Bowl
now, Pro Bowl was now five thousand miles

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:23.470
away the week before; same group of people,
many of the same people having responsibility

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:31.730
for both and the ratings went up again, another
9%. So it's a proven quantity that with the

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.210
right promotion and the right scheduling,
Pro Bowl, although it's not our best product,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:43.090
and we know that, it’s not a competitive
game. It's two-hand touch at best. But it

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:48.039
is something that the fans want to see because
we're getting eight and nine ratings now.

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:55.610
&gt;&gt;Michael: Right. So it's Super Bowl, eight,
nine, ten days ago, that ends and it’s almost

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.419
like there is no off season for the NFL.

00:19:57.419 --> 00:19:59.039
&gt;&gt;Frank: Actually, Super Bowl never ends,
either.

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:04.400
&gt;&gt;Michael: Right. Everyone's looking ahead
to the NFL Draft. Tell us a little bit about

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.429
that as far as you being the event producer,
how you're involved behind the scenes.

00:20:08.429 --> 00:20:15.240
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, the draft, as I mentioned,
is really a unique event of anything you might

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.140
see on television. It is a business meeting.
I mean, at its core, that's what it is. And

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.960
it’s a business meeting that became a television
show that became a live event. And the live

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:31.700
event piece of it is really, it's been open
for a while to fans, but not in the size it

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:39.830
is now. I think it grew into what it is now,
in 2006, when it went to Radio City. And OK,

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:46.470
I knew how to do an event at Radio City, but
I was afraid of it because it’s such a massively

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:53.340
huge building. And this picture shows you
how big one person on the stage really is.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.340
[laughter]

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.450
It is kind of, how do you fill that place?
How do you keep things going? And one of the

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:03.650
things that we do with it, which I think is
cool, is we've got two different broadcasts

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:09.780
going; NFL Network on one side, ESPN on the
other. We're showing those feeds on the video

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.390
screens and then we have little radios that
we give everybody when they come in so they

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:21.250
can hear the commentary from one or the other.
So you're not really disturbing the essential

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.230
mission of the draft, which is to select players.
You're not disturbing the television broadcast

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.320
by hearing other things in your ear.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.320
&gt;&gt;Michael: Right.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.390
&gt;&gt;Frank: We keep music going and those kinds
of things. We've got trivia going to keep

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:39.700
people excited for what's essentially 14 hours
of meeting over three days.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.700
&gt;&gt;Michael: Wow.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:46.610
&gt;&gt;Frank: But you're able to actually get all
of what you would get at home right there

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.020
because you're able to hear the feed more
privately.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.250
&gt;&gt;Michael: Which has really enhanced the fan
experience.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:57.169
&gt;&gt;Frank: It really has. This is, it's a free
event and frankly, if we charge for tickets,

00:21:57.169 --> 00:22:03.179
we'd sell it out. It’s just, people line
up the night before. Around midnight, we start

00:22:03.179 --> 00:22:05.049
giving out wristbands so they don't spend
the night there.

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:06.049
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:09.340
&gt;&gt;Frank: We wanna keep them off the street.
Then they go off, they get some rest, they

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.130
come back the next day and we seat them for
a very highly-rated television show.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:18.690
&gt;&gt;Michael: This is gonna be a good segue into
my next question and that is, how do you go

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:23.050
about selecting Super Bowls? We're talking
about New York. What is the process for that?

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.669
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, Super Bowls are really, the
site of the Super Bowl is determined by the

00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:34.320
32 owners of the NFL; the 32 team owners.
We oversee the bid process for that. It's

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:40.580
a process that takes about six- to eight months.
We issue what you see there, the covers for

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:45.360
the bid specifications that we send to any
team, or any region, that's interested in

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:51.300
hosting it. It is a very exhaustive book.
It’s almost as big as the release I signed

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.559
for Google just a little while ago.

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.970
[laughter]

00:22:54.970 --> 00:23:02.330
It's about 240 pages of stuff you have to
know, questions you have to answer, things

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:09.130
you have to make sure that you have in order
to host a Super Bowl. And then the teams,

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:14.710
we actually work with all the teams that do
wanna pitch for Super Bowl. We're agnostic;

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.900
our job is to take each of the proposals that
are being developed and make them the very

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:24.900
best they can be. So we don't have any interest
in one particular city over another. We'll

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.700
assign an account executive, if you will,
who will help shepherd them through the process,

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.820
so that when the owners get the opportunity
to vote on where the Super Bowl's gonna go,

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.330
they have an incredibly hard time, because
you'll have three or four great proposals

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.330
to choose from--

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.330
&gt;&gt;Michael: Sure.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.080
&gt;&gt;Frank: and then they'll be able to make
the determination on, "Geez, is this a warm

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.190
weather year that we think we should go to?"

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.190
[laughter]

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:52.650
Or, "Should we be going to a city that supported
the building of a new stadium?" For example.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.070
&gt;&gt;Michael: Where are the next three Super
Bowls?

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:58.760
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, the next, of course, we just
left Dallas/Fort Worth, Arlington/Irving,

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:05.080
and North Texas. We're going off to Indianapolis
next year; another new building, spectacular

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.890
new building, very, very different, right
in the middle of an urban area. So it's got

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.520
its own little challenges in terms of, and
you'll see on, when we talk about the Super

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:21.060
Bowl app, what we have to do to an area to
host a Super Bowl. It’s not just the stadium

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:27.679
itself. Then we go to New Orleans, which will
host its tenth Super Bowl. It'll be tied with

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:29.340
Miami for that.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.340
&gt;&gt;Michael: Fantastic.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.270
&gt;&gt;Frank: And then we come here to Newark,
New Jersey, and play the first Super Bowl

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.270
outdoors.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.270
&gt;&gt;Michael: Nice.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.520
&gt;&gt;Frank. In 2014.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:41.900
&gt;&gt;Michael: Wow. What challenges were learned,
I suppose, from North Texas as far as weather

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.211
goes that you might help prepare you for Newark,
New Jersey?

00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:49.299
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, the lessons that we learned
in North Texas are many and varied. Some of

00:24:49.299 --> 00:24:53.860
you have read about them and I'm not even
gonna comment on some of them, but weather

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.799
is something that you can't predict. And it’s
not anything you can do anything about. You

00:24:57.799 --> 00:25:03.179
just have to be prepared for it, whatever
Mother Nature throws at you. We had an unusually

00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:09.150
challenging environment in North Texas. There's
a belt of cities in the United States that

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:15.910
are prone to ice. Snow, you can get past.
I mean, we all drive in it, or we all get

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:23.790
in cabs or buses or whatever. Ice stops you
totally. There's just nothing you can do to

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:28.150
navigate around ice. Well, luckily, we had
an ice storm on Tuesday, Monday night into

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:34.120
Tuesday, which is media day. And that's when
we get all the players and teams and personalities

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.410
to the stadium to be interviewed by the three
thousand or so media who are there. We were

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:45.419
able to get that done, but we had, along with
the Texas Department of Transportation and

00:25:45.419 --> 00:25:51.770
others, a very, very robust plan to clear
the streets of ice and snow if those things

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:58.690
should happen. Well, imagine if you will a
market that's 16 hundred square miles and

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:03.221
it gets hit by an ice storm right before you
need to have an event at the stadium. We had

00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:09.080
to be very selective working with TexDOT in
what streets were gonna--

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.080
&gt;&gt;Michael: Sure.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.020
&gt;&gt;Frank: get cleared and when they were gonna
clear. The schools were closed from Tuesday

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:19.900
until this past Monday. I mean, it’s just,
it never melted because it was 16 degrees

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.760
for a solid week. So they're used to having
an ice storm or snow storm that melts; it

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:30.809
goes away, have a nice day. And in our case,
we got hit with an ice storm on Tuesday, deep

00:26:30.809 --> 00:26:38.700
cold all the way through, a prediction of
a dusting of snow on Thursday night, which

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.710
became a half a foot of snow when we woke
up in the morning. The teams still got to

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.890
their indoor practice facilities, the media
still got to where they needed to go, but

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:54.679
it was really, really, really slow. The effect
that we had following that was something that

00:26:54.679 --> 00:27:00.669
again, nobody could predict. While we were
clearing the stadium of grounds of ice and

00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:05.640
snow, parking lots of ice and snow, ice was
avalanching off the stadium.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.779
&gt;&gt;Michael: Wow.

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:11.529
&gt;&gt;Frank: In four corners of the building and
a few people got hurt. We had to seal off

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:16.820
those areas and on game day, there was still
literally, wreckage underneath each of the

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.270
corners of the building where the tents had
been destroyed, where there was gonna be merchandise

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:25.970
and concessions and Portolets and all that
sort of stuff. And on game day, we had only

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:32.490
60% of our gates open because there was still
snow coming off the side of it.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.600
&gt;&gt;Michael: So you saved the day.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.000
&gt;&gt;Frank: No, I didn't save anything. The fact
of the matter is, that we, in very close cooperation

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.020
with the City of Arlington and their fire
department, we were able to put more firefighters

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:49.710
on, so that we would have a safe environment.
They'd be able to direct people to exits and

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.870
those types of things because they couldn't
use the exits that were designed into their

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:54.870
building.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.919
&gt;&gt;Michael: I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit,
just cause--

00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:56.919
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah.

00:27:56.919 --> 00:27:59.429
&gt;&gt;Michael: I wanna make sure some of the Google
employees here have some time to ask some

00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:04.789
questions about technology and other things;
football questions. So, day of Super Bowl.

00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:07.590
The day arrives. Where are you? What are you
doing?

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:14.399
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, most often, I would get up
into what's called NFL control, which is up

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:19.940
on top of the stadium. And we're gonna see
it in a little bit. We're going through a

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:20.940
bunch of things, but--

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.940
&gt;&gt;Michael: Sure.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:27.361
&gt;&gt;Frank: it's a control center that we build
specifically for Super Bowl. If you think

00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:32.110
of it in terms of Mission Control at NASA,
it’s very similar. There's a flight director

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.200
that would be me in this particular case.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.200
&gt;&gt;Michael: Mm-hmm.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.700
&gt;&gt;Frank: He's talking with any number of individuals
who have specific responsibilities for one

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:46.750
thing or another. So, there might be one gentleman
who's worried about all the security checkpoints

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.960
and how they're operating; another person
on stadium operations; another person who

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:57.630
I can get to in a hurry, who's controlling
audio and the video screens and those types

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:01.790
of things; another person who's dealing with
transportation. Where are the buses? Are the

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:06.320
officials in? Where are the teams? Where are
the owners' buses? How are the parking lots

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.029
filling? All those types of things. So there
is, it's really cut into a bunch of pieces.

00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:18.419
Medical is up there. PR is up there. Broadcasting
is up there. We have the Chief of Police on

00:29:18.419 --> 00:29:23.150
one side of me and the security department
on the other. So, anything related to the

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:29.029
operation of game day is actually emanating
from there. And that particular shot that

00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:33.490
you saw was actually shot about 11 o'clock
in the morning, because I'll get there around

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:39.840
10-10:30 and I won't leave there until well
after the game; probably about 10:30-11 o'clock

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.840
that night.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.860
&gt;&gt;Michael: Wow. I don't imagine you get much
sleep leading up to those--

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.570
&gt;&gt;Frank: No, you get none.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.570
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:48.570
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:53.840
&gt;&gt;Michael: Tell us, as anyone might imagine
who's been involved in the events that things

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.630
happen. Things don't always go the best. Tell
us what you might describe as like the biggest

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:03.149
event "save" you've had to be involved with
for the Super Bowl, or for any kind of NFL

00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:04.149
event.

00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:07.730
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, event saves suggest that you
succeeded so we'll talk about those things

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:12.060
instead of the things that don't succeed although
you do learn a lot about the things that fail.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:22.281
We're gonna show you a video clip of how tense
it can get at an NFL control on game day.

00:30:22.281 --> 00:30:26.940
TruTV, last year as I think Sam mentioned,
did a--

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:27.940
&gt;&gt;Michael: Mm-hmm.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:34.770
&gt;&gt;Frank: six-part documentary on how NFL events
are managed. And they did an episode on Super

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:39.730
Bowl 44 last year. And they captured a lot
of things behind the scenes in real time,

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:44.210
which was kind of interesting. It was actually
interesting for me to watch it deconstructed

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:51.529
as other people have seen it. I know how I
live it. In this particular case, we're dealing

00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:57.130
with something you never, ever, ever see on
television, which is you have a football game.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:03.580
You have, in the case of the Super Bowl you
have a 28-minute halftime. You're gonna have

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.179
a 12-minute concert production that happens
in the middle of it, which frankly, if you

00:31:07.179 --> 00:31:12.110
were doing it normally, you'd have three or
four days to set it up. We have seven minutes

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:17.600
to set it up and have it work. And then we
have about seven minutes to get rid of it

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.330
so that we can get the game going again. And
what's really important and what I have to

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:27.289
do, is, and I attend all the rehearsals to
make sure that I understand how the show is

00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:31.440
coming together, whether or not the crew is
gonna be able to get it off on time. Sometimes,

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.980
actually, I have to stop the clock, the half
time clock, which is also seen in the locker

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:41.990
rooms, so that the players know what's going
on, the coaches know what's going on because

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:46.110
you wanna make sure that you don't have these
enormous, in the case of the Rolling Stones

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:51.059
in 2006, these enormous pieces of stage rolling
out of the same tunnel that the players are

00:31:51.059 --> 00:31:55.491
gonna head in to hit the field. So it’s
a little bit of traffic management, but it’s,

00:31:55.491 --> 00:32:01.019
imagine traffic management where you're trying
to predict what's gonna happen five minutes

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:04.690
in the future 'cause once those stages are
moving and the players are moving, there's

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.059
nothing I can do to stop them.

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:07.059
&gt;&gt;Michael: No.

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:12.820
&gt;&gt;Frank: So, you wanna make sure that you
get this traffic management thing done. The

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.560
other is, television is gonna be ready when
the television is ready.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.560
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.790
&gt;&gt;Frank: And with commercials running three
million dollars for a 30-second spot, you

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:26.150
don't wanna be 30 seconds late. That's a three
million dollar mistake. So it is somewhat

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:30.860
pressure-filled in that respect and this will
show you a little bit about what we had to

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.919
do to see that happen.

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:35.919
&gt;&gt;Michael: Great.

00:32:35.919 --> 00:32:36.919
[plays video clip]

00:32:36.919 --> 00:32:37.919
&gt;&gt;man: Quick as we can guys, quick strike,
quick strike.

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:40.830
&gt;&gt;man 2: And there was only so much time for
the whole half time, we knew the set-up was

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.360
gonna take about nine and a half minutes.
We knew how long the actual performance was,

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:52.140
which was about 12 minutes. So that only left
us seven minutes and some change. And so,

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:59.741
we're trying to beat that.

00:32:59.741 --> 00:33:05.890
&gt;&gt;man: Here come the players.

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.760
&gt;&gt;man 3: This is where we get problems right
now.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.600
&gt;&gt;Frank: 3:30 on the half time clock. 3:30.
Colt's players emerging from the tunnel.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.250
&gt;&gt;man: We gotta pick up the pace. We're going
too slow. Come on, guys. Keep the line moving.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.500
&gt;&gt;Frank: I don't think we're gonna get them
out. Stage is still in the middle, coming

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.500
out slowly.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.500
&gt;&gt;man: Come on, guys.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:28.419
&gt;&gt;Frank: It was a very, very tight timing.
Staging is now on the Saints side of the 50-yard

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:32.010
line. 47, 46, 45. Get going.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.210
&gt;&gt;man: OK.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:37.390
&gt;&gt;Frank: Colt's players emerging from the
tunnel.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.539
&gt;&gt;man 2: Come on, guys. We got players coming
out, let's go.

00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:41.539
&gt;&gt;man: Come on, guys.

00:33:41.539 --> 00:33:42.860
&gt;&gt;Frank: You want the players to have the
exact amount of time in the locker room that

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.860
they expected.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.330
&gt;&gt;man: Let's take over the game, guys. Let's
take it over.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.330
&gt;&gt;man 2: Damnit. They're stuck. This does
not look good.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.330
[crowd boos]

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:54.320
I don't think we're gonna get them out. There
we go.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.059
&gt;&gt;Frank: Thank goodness. We were able to get
the last piece of staging off just as the

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:00.390
clock hit zero.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:01.390
&gt;&gt;man: OK, go, go, guys.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:05.120
[crowd cheers]

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:19.770
We are off the field. Look at that. Right
to the second.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:20.770
&gt;&gt;Frank: It worked. Sigh.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:21.770
&gt;&gt;Sammy: And it's only your ass if it doesn't.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:22.770
&gt;&gt;Frank: Hey, I would've gone out on a high,
right?

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.040
&gt;&gt;Male Announcer: And welcome back to Sunlife
Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.040
[end of clip]

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.600
&gt;&gt;Frank: And none of that timing, by the way,
was made up on the original episode. That

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.700
really happened that way. That was all real
time. And it really came down to the final

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.700
second. And I had to make, see the problem
that I have, is I have to make that decision

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:43.649
five minutes before that happened, to stop
the clock. Once the players are out there,

00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:44.649
there's nothing I can do.

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:45.649
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:48.340
&gt;&gt;Frank: Or once they're out of the locker
room, there's nothing I can do and the Stones

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:54.149
show, in 06, I knew that they were not gonna
get that thing done in time. I just knew it.

00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:58.820
I knew it from watching the rehearsals. The
other thing is, remember, 2006 was played

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:06.320
in Detroit. All of those stage pieces were
coming from Comerica Park across the street

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.251
and there was snow and ice and everything
else on the way. I knew in my heart it was

00:35:11.251 --> 00:35:17.680
never gonna happen on time. I held the clock
for about 90 seconds, but it happened about,

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.640
I would say with seven minutes left on the
clock, so nobody was ready to come out of

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:27.420
the locker room and I just radioed the locker
room and told them, "We're gonna be holding.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:32.520
Don't come running out quite yet." Cause that
was the same tunnel. Here, in Miami, you had

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.109
the abilities to use two different ones.

00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:35.109
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah.

00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:39.510
&gt;&gt;Frank: Ford Field in Detroit has only one
and the players come in the same way as that

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:40.510
stuff coming out.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:41.660
&gt;&gt;Michael: Call it instinct. Many years of
event experience.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:45.160
&gt;&gt;Frank: And you know what? Part of it is
and part of it is you know that it's gonna

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.060
be better on game day, generally, because
the adrenaline is pumping through these--

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.060
&gt;&gt;Michael: Sure.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.950
&gt;&gt;Frank: guys who are pushing this stuff.
I mean, it's hundreds of people down there

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.160
trying to get this stuff off, but it really
is a traffic management issue.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.260
&gt;&gt;Michael: And you guys all think it’s hard
to get two thousand people up to the 8th floor,

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:05.950
to the Google Express, so just think of that
next time you're waiting for the elevator.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:12.460
So this year's Super Bowl. Most watched program
of all time. Congratulations. Ten of the top

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:19.640
eleven programs in history were Super Bowl
the most watched programs. Pressure for you?

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:25.640
&gt;&gt;Frank: A little bit. Not as much as you
think, though. That's not why, if you do what

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:33.030
we do for a living, it's part of the scenery.
You're doing it to do it the right way, not

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:38.839
to do it the right way in front of more or
less people. If we were doing this for 18

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:44.920
people, I'd be just as concerned about how
something was gonna be presented as if it's

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:54.270
160 million people, which is what it was last
Sunday. The only show that's ever been in

00:36:54.270 --> 00:37:00.089
the top ten that wasn't a Super Bowl in terms
of the most widely viewed programs of all

00:37:00.089 --> 00:37:04.820
time, is the 1983 finale episode of M.A.S.H.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.820
&gt;&gt;Michael: Wow.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.829
&gt;&gt;Frank: Which is now number three. It had
been number one up until two years ago; Super

00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:15.800
Bowl 44 was the first one to beat it. Super
Bowl 45 beat Super Bowl 44, so now M.A.S.H.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.790
is number three. It is something, though,
that you take very, very seriously and for

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:27.040
all the things that we've been talking about
this afternoon. It is something that, if you

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:32.940
mess up, a whole lot of people find out about
it at once. It's not something I go, "I hope

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:33.940
nobody caught that."

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:34.940
[laughter]

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.940
&gt;&gt;Michael: No, I don't imagine--

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.940
&gt;&gt;Frank: There's no such thing.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.470
&gt;&gt;Michael: Now that we have terms like wardrobe
malfunction, it leaks into our daily language.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:45.869
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah, or missing seats. It's just
everybody finds out about it at once. If that

00:37:45.869 --> 00:37:51.730
were to happen at another event, nobody would
hear about it. Here, everybody hears about

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:52.730
it.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.579
&gt;&gt;Michael: We're gonna go into Q&amp;A in just
a second, but before we did, I wanted to give

00:37:55.579 --> 00:37:57.690
you a chance to talk about the Super Bowl
app.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:03.020
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah. We, you know, we probably live
in the Stone Age compared to you. I mean,

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:08.880
you guys are the vanguard of technology, clearly.
There's a couple of things that we did this

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:16.420
year that I think increased our tech-savvy
capability of being able to deliver a good

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:21.790
product. One of the things, which is really
low-tech, but just mega, was the screen at

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:26.430
Cowboy Stadium, which is the biggest thing
you've ever seen. One of the most amazing

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:33.160
things that I've ever seen, actually I yelled
at Sammy for doing it, but before media day

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.849
we were running a loop on the screen. So as
people came in they had something to watch.

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:45.990
Nobody was in the building yet and they showed
a clip of the Metrodome roof collapse back

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.863
in December. You've seen it on your computer
screens; you've seen in on YouTube, you've

00:38:49.863 --> 00:38:53.570
seen it on TV. Until you see it on that screen,
holy smoke.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.570
&gt;&gt;Michael: Wow.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:58.270
&gt;&gt;Frank: I mean, it looked like a James Cameron
movie. It was just unbelievable.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:02.650
&gt;&gt;Michael: Something else. We're set up here
if you want to show it.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:10.420
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah, please don't. We also got into
the app business and we provided these, this

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.420
app.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.810
&gt;&gt;woman: You might want to close your eyes.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:13.810
[laughter]

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:20.800
&gt;&gt;Frank: This app for free to any fans or
partners who wanted it and that was to familiarize

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.140
people with Super Bowl before they got there.
So there were a couple of things we did. One,

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.240
which was very interesting, was we provided
so much detail that the Arlington Police Department

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.320
started to freak out that there was just too
much that people knew about what we were doing.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:40.160
One thing I wanna show you is this. There's
a red line. You see it down here? We're a

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.890
National Security event level one and we're
the only annual event in the country that

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:50.030
is that, has that designation. What that means
is that there's an extraordinary amount of

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:57.220
federal security help; everything from a temporary
flight restriction over the stadium, from

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.340
two hours before the game until an hour after.
Nothing can fly over. That's why you don't

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:07.700
see blimp shots anymore from the Super Bowl;
haven't for years. We sometimes can get a

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:13.589
plane, a police plane or chopper and put a
camera on it so that you can see something.

00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:18.840
This year, we couldn't get that done. They
didn't have the equipment for it. But you

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:26.910
also have to go through security checks, just
like an airport. So we have about 130 Magnetometers

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:31.589
that are installed just for that one day.
And that's the metal detector you go through

00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:35.950
when you go to the airport. We have to load
in, in this particular case, 104 thousand

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:41.290
people in three hours, and go through all
of that, which sometimes goes very well and

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:45.530
sometimes doesn't go as well. But that's that
red line around here. What you also have to

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:50.520
do is, everything you need on game day, has
to be in there. So, any kind of equipment

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:56.680
materials all has to be in there before Friday
night, when the Feds lock it down. They sweep

00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.740
it, lock it down, nothing else comes in except
for people who are ticketed the next day.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:07.210
So, this app was actually created, not for
the police, but it was created for the people

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:11.310
who would be coming to the game. And what
was cool about it is it gave you the opportunity

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:15.870
to see everything you needed to, or wanted
to know about, everything from where your

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:22.079
parking fields might be to where your seat
might be. You can actually do into the stadium.

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:26.960
If you wanna know where the best nachos are,
they've got that. You can actually, we're

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:32.880
gonna go back in, you can actually go to the
section that you're sitting in and see what

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.550
the field's gonna look like from there, which
is kinda cool. So you can compare your ticket

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:42.770
to what's going on. You can, there are other
things that go on around town, 'cause Super

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:47.000
Bowl is the game, but it's also ten days’
worth of events. I mean, there's a lot going

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.940
on. You can go to downtown Dallas, in this
particular case. I just went to the stadium.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:01.770
There we go, downtown going to Dallas and
compare where you are, where your hotel might

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:06.940
be. You can go into the Convention Center,
which is where our interactive football theme

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:11.480
park, called NFL Experience is, and you can
explore that a little bit. That one wasn't

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:18.550
in 3D like the stadium was, but you do have
the opportunity to find out where the attractions

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:22.780
are and where the events are that are going
on that day. You won't see any of them pop

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:26.040
up because they're all gone, clearly.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.040
&gt;&gt;Michael: Like magic.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.800
&gt;&gt;Frank: But it shows you where the bathrooms
are and everything else. You can actually

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:38.020
also, and this was fun, find the restaurants
in the area as well. And then also get the

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:43.270
little reviews of the various restaurants
that you might wanna go to. So it was a great

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:48.470
opportunity for people who have never been
to North Texas and that would be most people

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:52.230
who went to Super Bowl because it's never
been in North Texas before, the people who

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:58.390
do go every year. And you're able to find
pretty much anything you want in the course

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:07.220
of that week. We actually also have a similar
scenario for Fort Worth, which was 40 miles

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.599
away cause that's where the AFC was staying.
The NFC was staying in Dallas. So that gives

00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:16.900
you a little glimpse as to what the Super
Bowl app looked like. We made that available

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.590
about ten days before the game.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:19.590
&gt;&gt;Michael: Very cool.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.620
&gt;&gt;Frank: And people could download it from
the iTunes store for free.

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.700
&gt;&gt;Michael: I guess we've come a long way since
Broadway Joe and Super Bowl 3.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.700
[Frank laughs]

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.700
&gt;&gt;Frank: A little bit.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.710
&gt;&gt;Michael: Yeah, yeah. We've got just about
five minutes left, so I'm gonna open this

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:36.510
up to the Googlers. Please use the microphones.
This is your chance to ask Frank about anything

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:41.580
about the NFL, or the Super Bowl, or anything
technology related. Some of you have mentioned

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.089
you're interested in hearing more about the
first down line, things like that. So let's

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.250
open it up to Q&amp;A.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:54.680
&gt;&gt;Female Audience #1: Hi. So part of what
I do at Google, I work in marketing, is event

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.600
planning and running events. So I'm yet to
figure out what's the best way to approach

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.961
it. Is it to go in having a strategy for every
possible situation, or are you the kind of

00:43:59.961 --> 00:44:02.609
person who recommends going into it, what
happens is gonna happen and we're gonna deal

00:44:02.609 --> 00:44:11.501
with 
it when we get there, cause you can't drive

00:44:11.501 --> 00:44:12.501
yourself crazy planning for everything?

00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:15.599
&gt;&gt;Frank: You actually can drive yourself crazy.
It's really easy and for me, it's a local

00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:16.599
trip.

00:44:16.599 --> 00:44:19.349
[laughter]

00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:24.300
You do have to have a scenario for a lot of
different things that are likely to happen.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:29.609
You have to have the demeanor to be able to
handle things that happen that you didn't

00:44:29.609 --> 00:44:34.660
expect. So let's talk a little bit about some
of the contingencies that we have when we

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.780
think about a Super Bowl. One of the things
we do, again, because the very, very public

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:45.839
nature of what we do, we actually hire a guy
to come in and throw scenarios at us about

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:52.849
ten days before. It would include everybody
who's at NFL control. Sitting behind them

00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:58.339
is everyone we would be talking to. So whether
it’s by radio or by written-down line, or

00:44:58.339 --> 00:45:04.079
by other methods that they would have to actually
execute something, are also in there. We have

00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:10.060
law enforcement in there and the fire department,
EMS and everybody else. And this gentleman

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:15.650
will, is very familiar with Super Bowl. He
will survey the stadium, look for weak spots

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:25.270
in things, and toss scenarios at us that could
range everything from an ammonia truck spill

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:30.540
downwind or upwind of us, to a weather issue
or something like that and then we have to

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:36.890
respond in real-time. It's about a four-hour
exercise; it's very, very intense and very

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:43.350
scary, but not nearly as scary as game day
when you're actually there. And it also builds

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:50.339
the team so that everybody sees how everybody
else reacts to situations and they understand

00:45:50.339 --> 00:45:54.630
each other’s competencies and strengths
and you work through the problem together.

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:59.590
And you'd rather do that before the event
than during the event. During the event, sometimes

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:04.030
you have that, too. But you've already had
that experience once and you know who everybody

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:12.640
is and who people are looking to for decision-making.
So I would say anything that is likely to

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.360
happen, you should have a plan for. And that
could be everything from what happens if the

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:23.940
airports close because of a weather event,
how you're gonna route people, what happens

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.920
if there's a building failure, you have to
move it to another facility, do you have a

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:33.230
back-up for that, those kinds of things. But
yes, you have to, contingency plans are huge.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:38.050
The snow and ice contingency plan, we never
expected to use in North Texas. Never expected

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:45.380
it. Should've been 60 degrees. It wasn't;
it was 16. And we had plows and salters and

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:52.579
sanders and all of that. Not enough to cover
16 hundred square mile area, but at least

00:46:52.579 --> 00:46:57.180
the routes that we needed taken care of on
any given day, we had a plan for that.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.320
&gt;&gt;Female audience #1: Thanks.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.320
&gt;&gt;Frank: OK.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:05.820
&gt;&gt;Male audience #1: I think there's been a
focus on increasing the presence of the NFL,

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.109
internationally and globally. What would you
say you've done maybe outside of traditional

00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:14.220
broadcast media to facilitate that with technology?

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:20.099
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, the first answer is a low-tech
answer. The first answer is, we actually play

00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:27.319
games in London. We play one a year. That
may grow. It's been incredibly successful.

00:47:27.319 --> 00:47:34.480
We started our international regular season
games in Mexico City in 2005; sold 103 thousand

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.890
tickets for that. You're looking at a game
that was played in London. They loved the

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:43.970
cheerleaders, they loved the game. We got
90 thousand people at Wembley Stadium; it's

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:48.810
a sell-out every year. It's like the event,
it's kind of must attend. And I think that's

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:52.700
what makes it very special. If you were doing
it eight times a year, it's not quite as special.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:59.440
Once a year, it becomes very big. What it
has done, is actually both fed and been fed

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:09.050
by digital media and broadcast media. So we
have a very robust site in London, or in the

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:18.880
UK, called NFLUK.com, where you can go and
actually watch games in progress over there,

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:24.559
where you can't see. It's almost like the
Red Zone idea, but you have the opportunity

00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:29.589
to be able to see different pieces of games
as they're occurring and that's huge. Now,

00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:30.670
are you familiar with Red Zone?

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:31.670
&gt;&gt;Male Audience #1: Mm-hmm.

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:35.900
&gt;&gt;Frank: Red Zone. How many people don't know
what Red Zone is? Red Zone is a very cool

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:41.619
thing. What we've done, because every one
of our games is televised somewhere, even

00:48:41.619 --> 00:48:49.180
if you don't see it here, is in Culver City,
California, there's a control center where

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:54.470
they actually have a host who brings you from
game to game so any play that could potentially

00:48:54.470 --> 00:49:00.490
score is what's on at that particular moment.
It really is, I mean, television crack.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:01.490
[laughter]

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:04.720
Honestly, you can't stop watching it. You
just can't because like, "Oh, my God, there's

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:10.660
gonna be a, oh, my God there's gonna be a
score." We actually introduced Red Zone into

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:16.119
every stadium this year. Actually, Sammy oversaw
that project so that every stadium, every

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:22.859
team has the ability to use Red Zone during
stoppages, during quarter breaks, during half

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:29.609
time, and during pre-game. Red Zone was used
in London for the very first time at Wembley

00:49:29.609 --> 00:49:35.160
Stadium and it was so successful that when
we showed it, people actually applauded. Like,

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:39.440
they saw a game that was happening in the
United States at the same time as what they

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:45.839
were seeing live in London and they just thought
it was the most amazing thing they'd ever

00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:51.280
seen. So some of the answer is a little low-tech
answer. I'm not the hardware and software

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:56.059
guy. I can tell you what we applied to it
and those are the kinds of things we apply.

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:57.270
&gt;&gt;Male Audience #1: OK. Thanks.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:58.270
&gt;&gt;Frank: OK.

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:00.380
&gt;&gt;Male Audience #2: In 2004-2005, the NHL
had its lockout.

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.380
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yes.

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:05.280
&gt;&gt;Male Audience #2: So did that influence
your decision to leave the NHL for the NFL?

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:11.480
And I guess the follow-up to that is how do
you work jointly with the league during a

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.680
lock-out? I know that the NHL really had to
reinvent themselves afterwards. The NFL has

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.940
an impending lock-out that could possibly
wipe out the upcoming season. So, how do you

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:22.730
work jointly with the leagues during labor
stoppages?

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:26.920
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, let me answer your first question
first, and I think there were three or four

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:31.670
in there, so I'm gonna try and get to them
all. It did not influence my decision. It

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:39.700
happened to be coincidental. The job that
I currently hold became available, actually

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:46.750
just before the lockout; the NHL lockout.
And I was actually up in Toronto as the director

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:52.680
of operations for the World Cup of hockey
at the time. And it was just an incredible

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.640
opportunity if you have the opportunity to
work for the NFL, like Google. If you can

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.309
be associated with the best brand at what
you do, you do it. I mean, you wanna be able

00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:08.090
to put that on your shingle. So it was related,
I guess, in a sense that it happened to be

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:17.630
at a time that I could do it, but it wasn't
the reason why I did it. Labor issues are

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:25.080
tough and challenging literally for everyone,
including the fans right down to the hot dog

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:29.859
vendors. It doesn't matter who it is. Sports
is part of the American culture. Super Bowl

00:51:29.859 --> 00:51:34.320
is part of the American culture. NFL games
on Sunday, you just say, "What are you doing

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:39.670
on Sunday?" during the season, regardless
of where you go, there's a game on TV and

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:48.800
people are watching it. So, it is a very,
very challenging time. What it is is if you

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:54.270
have the resources to be able to do it, it's
a good time if you're not otherwise producing

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:59.819
things. And we will be and we hope to be playing,
quite honestly. We hope to have a deal with

00:51:59.819 --> 00:52:04.970
the players very soon. The sooner the better.
You have the opportunity to look back at the

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:12.540
things you are doing, and you have time to
make them better because, Michael said it

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.349
before, there is no off season for us. We
go from one event to the next to the next

00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:19.760
to the next and when people say, "Well, when
do you take time off?" I say, "It's a Tuesday

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.150
in July between two and four in the afternoon."
I mean, that's really, we're just cranking

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:29.569
all the time. Super Bowls, we're working on
four at a time in various stages of preparation.

00:52:29.569 --> 00:52:38.510
So what you try to do if you're me, what you
try to do is take a step back and look at

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:48.980
what you're doing and just try to make it
a better product at the end of the day.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:49.980
&gt;&gt;Male Audience #3: OK, thanks.

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.980
&gt;&gt;Male audience #3: Hi, how's it going?

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:51.980
&gt;&gt;Frank: Good.

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.980
&gt;&gt; Male audience #3: It was fun growing up
in Ireland. Took part there and followed the

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.500
NFL and there was technology change that happened
then, and another technology that's happening

00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:01.680
now. At the time, technology was that it moved
from free to air broadcast on Channel 4, and

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680
it moved to Sky.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680
&gt;&gt;Frank: Right.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.910
&gt;&gt; Male audience #3: And this scoupered a
fair generation of fans. We get a lot of people

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:08.910
watching.

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:09.910
&gt;&gt;Frank: That's right.

00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:12.869
&gt;&gt;audience #4: We're now hitting a situation
where the majority of college graduates are

00:53:12.869 --> 00:53:20.359
choosing to not get cable from cable TV. How
are NFL dealing with the move to most people

00:53:20.359 --> 00:53:23.390
watching most video on the Internet?

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:27.569
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, I don't think most people are
watching most video on the Internet yet when

00:53:27.569 --> 00:53:28.569
it comes to NFL product.

00:53:28.569 --> 00:53:32.150
&gt;&gt; Male Audience #3: If you look at the trend,
the trend is only going one direction.

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:33.700
&gt;&gt;Frank: Not when it comes to NFL product
though.

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.790
&gt;&gt; Male Audience #3: That's cause you have
control.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:42.000
&gt;&gt;Frank: Right, that's true and that's kind
of nice. What's interesting is while there

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.940
is that trend; our television ratings have
never been stronger. So you're right, we do

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:53.130
control that and we control it very strictly.
We have a certain number of rights holders;

00:53:53.130 --> 00:54:00.940
CBS, NBC, ESPN, and Fox. And they each have
their little piece of pie. But what's different

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:08.119
about sports is they're a point in viewing.
You're going to go to where you can view it,

00:54:08.119 --> 00:54:12.940
at least for the time being. That's the culture.
You know it's at 4 o'clock on a Sunday, or

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:19.150
it's at 4:15 on a Sunday, or it's at 8 o'clock
on a Sunday. Whatever it happens to be, if

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:24.350
you have an interest in watching it, that's
where you're gonna go to watch it. And what's

00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:31.980
counterintuitive about the trend today, our
trend and the trend toward digital media that

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:40.080
are not digital broadcasts, is that everybody's
ratings are falling, except ours, which is

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:45.520
just absolutely fascinating: Pro Bowl ratings,
we talked about, never been bigger; regular

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:52.120
season ratings, never been stronger; Playoff
ratings, never been bigger; Super Bowl, most

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:58.109
watched television program of all time. So
I can't tell you what the future holds for

00:54:58.109 --> 00:55:05.770
how we're going to deliver content, but obviously
there is some digital, new digital platforms

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:06.770
in our future. There's no question about that.
Thank you.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:07.770
&gt;&gt; Male Audience #3: Thank you.

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:12.930
&gt;&gt;Sammy: To follow up on that really quickly,
if you live outside North America, you can

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:18.200
get all of our games streamed with a product
that we offer. And also, if you live in North

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.970
America, if you have the DirecTV package,
you can get as well. So you get every game

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:26.500
plus the Red Zone channels. So I know when
I'm at home, I'm watching over the air broadcast,

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:31.710
but lucky job that I have, I can get the package
in North America and I watch all the games

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:32.820
on my laptop.

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:38.570
&gt;&gt;Frank: The other thing that's intriguing
about your question is the question, I'm gonna

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:43.230
turn the question around a little bit. When
you're home, you have access to a lot more

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:49.500
information than you do at a stadium. And
that's a battle we're fighting right now because

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.839
as many of you know, we have a blackout policy,
which is if the game is not sold out, it doesn't

00:55:53.839 --> 00:56:02.859
get broadcast in that market. It may get broadcast
elsewhere, will get broadcast elsewhere. So

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:06.630
we want to make sure our stadiums are full,
because a full stadium makes for good television,

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:10.250
it makes for a more exciting environment,
and it’s a better environment in the stadium

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:16.190
as well. You don't want empty seats, or at
least, larger swaths of empty seats. So what

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:22.920
we've been grappling with, is trying to figure
out how to deliver the content in the stadium

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:27.819
that you would be missing at home. And right
now, there's enough ways of doing it, but

00:56:27.819 --> 00:56:34.490
the pipes aren't big enough, as you know.
People have Smart Phones, people have iPads,

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:40.809
people have and we want to deliver all the
content to them that they can, but right now

00:56:40.809 --> 00:56:46.180
there's just not enough capacity in a stadium
of 80 thousand to be able to handle all the

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:51.230
demand for that. So the Red Zone effort that
we talked about putting in the stadium, that

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:56.200
was part of trying to deliver that. Putting
more stats up on the matrix boards, because

00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.990
people are just nuts for Fantasy Football
now. So we're putting a lot more fantasy stats

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:05.609
on the boards that you'd be sitting at home
going, "OK, what happened? What happened in

00:57:05.609 --> 00:57:11.020
the New Orleans game?" We're trying to get
that to people and delivering it to them in

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:15.650
a macro way. What is gonna happen eventually,
it's gonna be delivered in a micro way as

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:23.579
well, which is now and there is a hardware
solution to this, but it’s not universal

00:57:23.579 --> 00:57:29.349
yet. You wanna watch that replay, it’s not
the replay necessarily that I'm showing you

00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:36.500
on the Jumbotron. It’s the five different
camera angles you wanna see and you can control

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:42.250
time and you can control your content. That's
coming. But it's gonna take a better way of

00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:45.680
delivering that content in order to make it
really useful for people.

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:49.390
&gt;&gt;Michael: Fantastic. Well, it looks like
we're out of time. We went a little bit over.

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:54.819
So we thank you so much for your time and
good luck with the upcoming draft and hope

00:57:54.819 --> 00:57:55.869
you have a great season.

00:57:55.869 --> 00:57:56.910
&gt;&gt;Frank: Thank you. It's been great being
here.

00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:57.039
[applause]
