00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.880
These two equations can be solved as a system of equations if we know the

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.764
values of the area and the perimeter. Throughout this lesson, we'll usually see

00:00:09.764 --> 00:00:14.180
the equations written like this. Here A just stands for area, which is usually

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.795
a number. And P stands for perimeter, which is also a number. But this equation

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:24.993
is pretty important, it turns out P will usually be an even number. And that

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:29.874
usually happens, since we have two ws and two ls. So if w is odd, or if l is

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:35.486
odd, this number will still wind up being even. So, let's take every number and

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:41.075
divide it by 2, since the perimeter will usually be even. So if we divide p by

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:47.196
2, 2l by 2 and 2w by 2, we get this new equation. Now, it may seem like we'll

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:51.430
have to work with fractions here. But keep in mind that P will usually be an

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.510
even number, so P divided by two will just be an integer.
