Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay. So we're talking about alkenes and in particular today we're going to be talking, continuing to talk about polymerization in the context of things that nature makes, what are called, which are called ice of paranoids. And then we'll talk about the properties of polymers and then go onto a settled liens. Uh, we're talking about electronic files being the things that attack a double bonds in particular ones where the electro file is carbon, like the sigma star of something with a leaving group on it or the, with an electronegative negative group on it, or a cad I ion. And we're talking about the synthesis of Turpines and steroids. So there's a key, a molecule called ISO Penn Tino Pyro, phosphate, pyro. Phosphate is this thing with two fos versus linked by an oxygen, right? And it turns out you can do an alcoholic rearrangement. I mean, when I say you, I mean you, I mean the enzymes in you do it.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Okay? So you can get from Iso Penn, Tino pyro phosphate, uh, to, uh, to die methyl allium pyro phosphates, which he knows involves a shift of a hydrogen, uh, Al illegally. Okay? Now, the reason you do that is to make it better for sn. Two reactions. If you look at the relative rate for displacement of chloride by Ayah done an acetone, if you call it one for purple chloride, if you make allium chloride, so you put a double bond to make that bond, the carbon chlorine bond Alec, it goes up by almost a hundred fold a factor of 90. And if it's a benzene ring instead of just a regular old double bond, it goes up another factor of two and a half. Okay, so apparently this an adjacent unsaturation, that new double bond is especially good at at uh, in state, in stabilizing after the transition state.

Speaker 1:          01:59          So at the time when chloride is leaving and iodide is coming in, the double bond is able to interact with that orbital. That's bonding simultaneously, that pentavalent carbon, a transition state. So both sn two as well as sn one where you draw a resonance structure for that kind of interaction for the cat eye. And it's good to have it, Alec. So notice that this shift is Lle shift from ISO Penn Tino pyro phosphate to die methyl alcohol. Pyrophosphate resulted in getting the leaving group to be alcoholic so that it'll be easier to displace. Now why do you do that? Okay, so you can take as a nucleophile then if you have this really good leaving group, you can take as a nucleophile the ice of Pantene. Oh pyrophosphate. So it's a carbon that's serving as the nuclear file, right? So you make a new bond, get a cad ion, right?

Speaker 1:          02:53          But the cat eye and can be lost by losing a proton next door to make a new double bond. What you'll notice is a new aloe lake functionality with the leaving group, right? So you've put two of these things together and you have the same kind of functionality you had at the beginning. Okay? And that thing is called Gera Neal pyro phosphate because it's related to Geraniums as we'll see. Notice that the starting material has five carbons. Now having put two together, you have 10. Okay? So if you take Jared annealed pyro phosphate and uh, I samurais the double bond, then it's in a position for the other double bond in the same molecule to be the nucleophile, right? So you can do that and get that cat eye on right now. What could that cat eye and do? Well, of course it could do the same thing it did before and lose a proton. Right? And that gives Lyman nene and I made it a sort of yellow green, you know why?

Speaker 1:          03:57          Cause it made a little bit like lemons or limes that lemon grass oil is Lyman. Ian in Asian cooking has that. Okay. If you bend it up, then you can see another possibility. What other possibility do you see? If I draw the confirmation more like that? I don't, I got an idea, right? The double that double bond could add to the vacant orbital along the carbon like that, uh, Markovnikov addition. It's not what, what, why is it not so good on her eye forms a four membered rings. There's going to be some rings strain there, but it does happen, right? And if you lose the Proton, now you'd get a compound called Beta pinene. Guess what kind of trees that comes from? Okay? Okay. Now you could also do an anti Markovnikov addition, which doesn't form quite as strained to ring, right? If you do that.

Speaker 1:          04:54          And then they had water and lose a proton to the carbon cat eye and you get, uh, uh, after oxidation camphor, which of course, now all of these things have in common that they have very characteristic odors. Lemon, the Pinene Turpentine Camphor, right? So these things are called turpines essential oils. Terpene is from Turpentine, right? That's where pioneer pioneer's, the major constituent of Turpentine. Essential oils. Does it mean you need them? What it means is they have an essence. They have an odor. So these see tens are volatile and your nose responds to them. So these are essential oils, uh, okay. And notice their see tens terpenes or see tens. But now you can do more of the same. If you start with your journey, you'll pyrophosphate that you had before, you could add another ISO Pentane oh, pyrophosphate and yet a thing that's called farnesyl. Pyrophosphate. Right? And things that come from that, like the compounds that came in from the sea 10 we're called turpines. These are called sesquiterpenes. Do you know what [inaudible] means? You know what assessed with centennial is

Speaker 1:          06:09          Sasquatch? Anybody? It means one and a half, right? So it's one and a half turpines 15 it's actually three of the ice of Penn. Dino pirate phosphates. But the name terpene came first. Okay? So for example, carry awfully in which is in clove and hemp and rosemary is a Sasquatch terpene. Okay? Now two of those things can come together and now this reaction is different because it's not the double bond attacking. It's two of these Alec positions coupling with one another. It's a different kind of reaction. We're not going to talk about it, but at couples to give this, which is squalene or shark liver oil. Okay? And you'll see the new bond in the middle. It's symmetric about the middle. Now you can do interesting things with squalene. What kind of terpene in would you call it? Incidentally? Squash lead.

Speaker 1:          07:03          If you take two fifteens you get 30 right? So what are you going to call it? Is it a mano terpy Sas Suite, terpene. Diterpene, right. It's a trite terpene to one and a half since three, right? So this is a trite derpy, but there are a lot more important try turpines well, more important. They come from this. So this one is a starting point. Okay, so they're squealing and I'm going to twist it around into a special con formation like that. Now, what allows me to do that enzymes, right, that hold these things in particular shapes and now I'm going to react with oxygen and do an EFP oxidation. Of course, it's not just, Oh, it's a, it's something like the reagents we talked about, except it's done biologically, but we're not interested in the particulars of the biological reagents, but it makes an EFP oxide notice that it's able to do it selectively. It gets only that double bond among all those. Right? And now you've protonate that. And what will it do? Can you see a way this can become more stable? What's, what's makes it unstable? Yeah, the ring strains. So how do you get rid of the rings strain? Yeah. Which way are you going to

Speaker 2:          08:22          break it?

Speaker 1:          08:27          Yeah. You're either going to break this bond or this bond or this bond. One, two, three, two. Why Two?

Speaker 2:          08:36          Stability. Pardon me? Why better stability?

Speaker 1:          08:43          No, so what's happened? These electrons that are shared between Oh and carbon are going to come onto the oxygen bottle, right? It's a tertiary carbocat ion. If you break it your way. Okay, so we'll do it that way. Okay. Now what's that going to do? Anybody got an idea?

Speaker 2:          08:58          Okay. Now what have we been looking at? Attacking double bonds. We're looking at carbon cat ions attacking double bonds. Any possibilities? You see? Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:17          Now you're going to form a bond between this cat eye and then either the bottom one or the top one. Which one do you want to go

Speaker 2:          09:22          to? Bottom or top. If you have a cat I and they had into an lt white long. Who? Who would say that's a good idea?

Speaker 1:          09:40          Mark on the cough would say it's a good idea. You're right. Okay, so we do look at my coffee in the competition. Okay, what happens next?

Speaker 2:          09:49          No? Well you got an idea. Do the same thing again. Do another mark in the competition. Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:58          What's next?

Speaker 2:          10:06          Wrong

Speaker 1:          10:07          this time it's an anti Markovnikov addition because of the way the molecule is held there. Okay. Okay. But now you're set up to do another one, a Markovnikov coffin.

Speaker 2:          10:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:22          And now you might think you'd use that last double bond and make another ring since you're on a roll here. Right. But you don't. And the reason is the way the molecule is held so that that one's not in position to do the trick, but something else happens that's noticed. That's nice and stable. It's a tertiary cad ion, but there's another tertiary cat eye and available. Do you see how to get to it?

Speaker 2:          10:46          Sebastian? You got an idea? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:50          How can I get from this cat iron to a different tertiary cat eye and one that we'd be just the same.

Speaker 2:          10:55          Sable Hydra chip.

Speaker 1:          10:58          Okay. So that's tertiary, but we can do a hydride shift and get another tertiary one.

Speaker 2:          11:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:07          And the ideas for the next one?

Speaker 2:          11:10          Yeah. Lauren, you got an idea?

Speaker 1:          11:14          We have a nice stable tertiary cat on it. We could go back there probably any, any other possibilities?

Speaker 2:          11:20          We're getting a tertiary one.

Speaker 1:          11:22          Oh, the one on the left. You could do another hydride shift. Okay, so that's tertiary to what's next. Arvin, do you got an idea?

Speaker 2:          11:31          You might as well just do like the math. You can be a mess out here. They're not side shift. Yeah. Okay, good. Next. Antonio other notified shift.

Speaker 1:          11:44          Oh boy. We're really going into town now. What?

Speaker 2:          11:50          Hydride shift. Obviously right,

Speaker 1:          11:54          wrong. This time the proton just gets lost. So it goes that way. The Arrow, right? It makes a double bond and the proton goes away. Now that stuff is La Nostra Raul, and that's the sort of the source of cholesterol and all the steroid hormones. You remember these few things we showed last time that Barton was, look looking at all these steroids. They have a six membered, six members, six membered ring than a five membered ring and something substituted at the top. They all come from here.

Speaker 1:          12:31          So these are triterpenes. Now that's a cute story, but one wonders whether it's true. Okay? And we'll show how, you know it's true that once we get to Nmr spectroscopy a week after next probably. Okay. But you'll have to hold your breath until that. So there's these ice preens then you can think about rearranging those double bonds. Notice that ISO Penn Tino pyrophosphate has this c five unit in. But if you're, if you do that, you could make two new bonds. I'm not talking about cad and anti and mechanisms, just schematic here. So if you have two ice Sabrina's, you could link it together like that. And that's Geranium oil rose oil, right? Or, or you can have two ice supreme and put them together like that. And that's menthol. Or You could have four of them and put them together like that. And that's retinal. The aldehyde over on the right.

Speaker 1:          13:32          So that's the thing that's involved in vision or that absorbs light in your eyes. So it's a a tetramer. Okay. Or you can take 30,000 die supreme means and link them together like that. And that's latex. The Latin word latex just met a liquid, but now it's always applied to this particular liquid, the SAP that runs out of these trees that have a, a Brazilian sis and there's a real romantic story about this and how, uh, you know, explorers stole seeds from Brazil, which was trying to keep them and took them to England and grew them in queue and then sent them to southeast Asia to make rubber plantations like this and that the rubber plantations in Brazil failed because they, that once you put the trees all close together so that you could harvest them efficiently rather than sending slaves out into the Amazon to find a tree here in a tree there.

Speaker 1:          14:24          Then it turned out they got a disease that killed all the ones down in South America. Henry Ford had a real disaster with that. But anyhow, you get that SAP and we showed you the PSAP last time and we made a rubber ball with it like this. Okay. Now that stuff was called by the Indians could choke and in fact that's the name and for, for a rubber in French. So people tried to find a use for it in the west, know the, the natives made balls, they made a galoshes, you know, you put your foot down in latex and let it dry and then you've got a rubber boot. Uh, so they, there were lots of things, but it was difficult to work with. Thomas Hancock and England developed a thing called a masticator to try to chew it up to make it so you could make different things with it.

Speaker 1:          15:11          And Charles McIntosh and Scotland in 1823 sandwich the, the rubber between cloth layers to make waterproof, you know, that's what you call a waterproof jacket and Britain as a Macintosh. The we, the reason you had to Sacha sandwich it was because the stuff is really sticky. I had a piece I was going to bring that I made last time and I forgot to, but it's really sticky stuff. So that's not so good. Right. It gets really gooey in the heat and it's brittle in the cold. So there's a fairly narrow temperature range where it's useful. Okay. Until Charles Goodyear in 1839 figured out the product, the process of vulcanization, which made this stuff, uh, useful. So this is his own description from his autobiography in 1855 of the discovery of Balkanization, he actually, he was really nuts about rubber. Incidentally, the word rubber was coined by, uh, by priestly, the guy invented, discovered oxygen, right.

Speaker 1:          16:17          And you know why? Because you use it for an eraser to rub out pencil marks. So rubber. Okay. Uh, but anyhow, uh, good year really loved rubber in this book. He printed several copies on paper, but other copies he printed on rubber, which have now all stuck together and you can't open any of the pages. But anyhow, in describing his discovery, he said he, that is himself. Speaking of the third person here, he was surprised to find that the specimen being carelessly brought into contact with a hot stove charged like leather. So he was trying to figure some way to make it not be sticky. So he thought you could put a powder on it to keep it from being sticky. And the powder he'd try was trying was sulfur, but he was in Woburn mass when he was doing this and he dropped it on a hot stove and it charred, whereas usually it melted, right?

Speaker 1:          17:11          So he, this surprised him. So he got his friends and relations. It says he endeavored to call the attention of his brother as well as some other individuals who were present and who were acquainted with the manufacturer of gum elastic to this effect as remarkable. And unlike any before known since gum elastic always melted when exposed to a high degree of heat, the occurrence did not at the time seemed to them to be worthy of notice. It was considered as one of the frequent appeals that he was in the habit of making in behalf of some new experiment. So they, they're tired of all his inventions. Right. But, uh, he showed it to Benjamin Solomon at Yale and Solomon wrote, having seen experiments made and also performed them myself with the India rubber prepared by Mr. Charles Goodyear. I can state that it does not melt, but rather chars by heat.

Speaker 1:          18:03          And that does not stiffen by cold. But retains its flexibility with cold even when laid between cakes of ice. So this is what a good year, who didn't have much money needed in terms of a, a serious endorsement to go out and try to get some capital to, to commercialize this. So he got a patent and this is the beginnings of the patent and he says he claims combining said gum with sulfur and with white LED's. So it was the form of triple compound. The lead's not used anymore in combined in combination with the foregoing the process of exposing the India rubber fabric to the action of a high degree of heat. He had made a whole bunch of raincoats, sort of Macintosh style and it put them in the, in the uh, closet during the summer to bring out when they got rainy again. And when he went to get them, they were just all one big gooey mass.

Speaker 1:          18:51          So this was really a appealing to him to patent this though he could make fabric from it. This is 1844 seven years later was the crystal palace exhibition in London, that try of industry in the West in the Victorian period. So there was this, these industrial displays of the best products from all over the world. And here only seven years after the patent, we find Goodyear's vulcanized court where he's pushing the beauties of rubber and you see there's a desk and that desk is made of rubber and it still exists. It's in a museum up in Waterbury. He made everything out of rubber. You can't believe all the things he made out or he proposed making bills for currency out of rubber so that you could wash them without destroying them. A lot of these things didn't catch on Sony. I latex was a po.

Speaker 1:          19:45          Is this polymer? What do you do when you heat it with sulfur? Well, you have several chains next to one another and no one knows exactly how it works, but somehow it joins adjacent chains with sulfur to make cross links between these polymer chain. So probably there are radical addition reactions to double bonds, radical Lilach substitutions. So you get maybe this Al [inaudible], which attacks the sulfur and then that adds to the other double bond, some something like this. But anyhow, it makes cross links in the chains. So how does that affect the physical properties of the polymers? Remember the problem is that it gets gooey when it's hot and brittle when it's cold, which is not what you want in a coat. So we're going to study this a little bit and we're going to follow a really, uh, important scientists who published this in 18 three description of a property of Qucik or Indian rubber with some reflections on the cause of Alaska. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          20:40          of this substance. So this was done by John Gfe who lived 1757 to 1825 of was a very interesting person. He, he was, uh, he tutored John Dalton for example. He lived up in the Lake district in England and Wordsworth wrote of him in this a poem excursion. No flower blooms throughout the lofty range of these rough hills, nor in the woods that could from him conceal its birthplace non who's figure did not live upon his touch touch. Because when guff was three years old, he had rheumatic fever and went blind. Right? So he was, he was a great scientist though, blind. So everything he had to do by, uh, by touch or description of someone else. So all of these studies of rubber, he did blind. Okay. So here's the beginning of this. He lived in Middle Shaw House near Kendall in 18, two he said to substance called Qucik or Indian rubber possesses a singular property, which I believe has never been taken notice of in printed, at least by any English writer.

Speaker 1:          21:41          Okay. So here it goes on and he says, uh, I made a piece of Coochie, a little heavier than an equal bulk of water, the temperature of which was 45 degrees. The vessel containing the resident water was then placed on the fire. And when the contents of it were heated to 130 degrees, the COO chook floated on the surface. What does that say about the density of cooked Chook and the influence of heat on it and pardon? It got well, it got less dense, right? Cause you know water gets less dense when you heat it up. So when it was cold at sank, when it was hot, it floated. So it must expand when you heat it more than water does. Okay, so he didn't. Rubber makes it expand more than water. Okay, that's the first that, that's not a great surprise. That's not the important thing.

Speaker 1:          22:37          Experiment one is the important thing here. He says, hold one end of the slip of, of the rubber, thus prepared between the thumb and forefinger of each hand. Bring the middle of the piece into slight contact with the edges of the lips because he has to do it by touch, right? Taking care to keep it straight all the time, but not to stretch it much beyond its natural length. After taking these preparatory steps, extend the slip suddenly and you will immediately perceived something. So we're going to repeat his thing, but I need a balloon there. Okay? So everybody takes their balloon and we'll do what gfes says to do here. Okay? So hold it between your thumb and finger and put it against your upper lip and stretch it a little bit. Okay? And now having stretched a little bit, stretch it as hard as you can while it's against your lip. You notice that anything who's a sensitive as John Gfe here, what happened? And what's really interesting is you stretch it pretty far and not much happens, but the last inch makes a difference. You notice that

Speaker 2:          23:46          what happened, Lauren?

Speaker 1:          23:49          He got really warm, not the first part of the stretching, but at the very end of the stretching is everybody onto that.

Speaker 2:          23:59          Okay,

Speaker 1:          24:01          good. So that's what he noticed, right? And you can read all of it. He said here if you want to. Okay. Then he tries another experiment here. He says, if one end of a slip of cu chook be fastened to a rod of metal or wood and await be fixed to the other extremity in order to keep it in a vertical position, then what will the Thong do? So let's try that one. So here's a piece of coot Chook and we'll get it so you could see it here.

Speaker 2:          24:29          Uh, let's see.

Speaker 1:          24:32          Yeah, you can see it a little bit, but what needed some light?

Speaker 2:          24:39          Just a few. And we'll put this on here. So we're going to stretch it. That's what he says to do. No, I had more. What? I tried this. I had more light before. Let's see if I can do better now I'll turn on this, uh, this light. There we go. Except that the thing is blocking it.

Speaker 1:          25:20          You get it into focus. Okay. So I have, you know, lines on paper there and you can see how much it stretched.

Speaker 2:          25:27          Okay. Forget it just a little bit.

Speaker 1:          25:31          Now what he's going to do is heat it.

Speaker 2:          25:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:35          So what does what you do when you heat it? So what's going to happen to the way we see the weight? It just bolt just halfway down below one of those lines.

Speaker 2:          25:46          Okay. What's going to happen when I hit it? I'll hit it with this thing. Which way will it move? It'll expand, right? So let's give it a try. Is it going down? Did it do anything?

Speaker 1:          26:20          It may be that it's, I think my slide it out a little bit here so that it's not rubbing against the rod there.

Speaker 2:          26:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:40          So how do you think Derek triples? Okay, let's, what's going to happen if I cool it off,

Speaker 2:          26:48          it shouldn't go back. Let's watch.

Speaker 1:          26:57          So it's expanding when it cools and it's contracting slowly when it heat.

Speaker 2:          27:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:14          This is weird, right? It expands when it cools and contracts when it heats. So we're going to have to deal with that. So heating a tightly stretched piece of rubber makes it contract. Okay, so if stretching rubber generates heat. That's what we did here. Let's think a second. What's going to happen when it contracts if we let it go back?

Speaker 2:          27:52          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:54          Okay. Well we have several possibilities. Okay. It could be that the heat comes from friction of the molecules rubbing by one another. If that's, so what would happen when we let it can track Carl and he, well, he is way right? On the other hand, if he comes from some other cause, contraction may do the opposite and absorb heat. So what we're going to do is stretch our rubber band is, or our rubber as far as we can and go like this to get it back to room temperature while holding it tightly, tightly stretched. Cause remember this phenomenon happens only at the very end. Then we're going to put it against our lip.

Speaker 2:          28:33          All right, and do that.

Speaker 1:          28:39          What do you find? Which of these isn't one or two? Did it get hot when it contracted or you get cold?

Speaker 1:          28:52          Both. Oh, cold. Okay. Yeah, that's pretty dramatic isn't it? You know, GFE claims to have been discovered this, but in fact I discovered it. My nephew was having a birthday and I was blowing up balloons that I happen to do that. I thought, wow, that's really something. Then I found, then I found out I had been scooped by two centuries. Okay, so how does this work? What the heck is going on with these polymers now? If you've been to the Yale health center, so what do you see? If you go upstair up in the Yale health center and look out toward the campus, this is what you see. A rather questionable view from the Yale Health Center. But right here is something that's very interesting and if you get up and look at it, that's the two of them have Charles Goodyear because he was a native of new haven, even though he discovered vulcanization and in a Wolburn mass and died in New York, a pauper, incidentally popper, because he got involved with lawyers, people tried to, uh, everybody, his brother tried to break his patent.

Speaker 1:          30:07          So he hired Daniel Webster who was secretary of State and, and put on the most expensive, uh, defense that ever happened, have a patent and still he lost his shirt. Okay. But, but so he didn't know how it worked, but maybe he can find out now because there he is. And if you go to that, that obelisk there and then down just a little bit farther, you get to this guy and that guy could tell him probably, and conceivably did talk to him because this is j Willard Gibbs who died, who got his bachelor's degree at Yale in 1858. So two years before Goodyear died. So they could have met, but I don't think they did. Right. Gibbs could have given him some idea about what was going on with rubber, but the person who really could have done it, the person are over here, right here are two gravestones that have different designs. The one, they're both people from this chemistry department. One is John Gamble Kirkwood who was a physical chemist and a theorist about polymers. Right. And his, uh, his gravestone tells everything he did. Uh, not everything, but quite a few things. The awards he got and so on. Uh, but next to his is the tomb of Lazarus on soccer. His friend and colleague and the, his tomb says Nobel laureate, right? His wife died 15 years later and the stone was re to put her name on it as well. And also to put on a footnote.

Speaker 1:          31:43          Okay. So they could, they could, perhaps they're commuting down there with Goodyear now and telling him what's going on with this. It has to do with statistical mechanics. You remember that's what Gibbs did because statistics is what makes rubber contract after you've stretched it. If you have a chain all stretched out like this, there's only one way to arrange it between the two ends, right? But if you, if you contract it like that, you can have it that way or that way or that way or that way or that way. Right? There are a zillion ways to have it if it's contracted. So statistics, entropy says it wants to have a shorter distance between the ends. So even though it might be most stable in terms of heat, that is the best con formation when it's stretched out, entropy will contract that again. So if you have a whole bunch of these polymer chains and you start to stretch them out, they're all tangled around and as you stretch they get more and more parallel to one another.

Speaker 1:          32:46          And finally they'll get so near, some of them will get near one another enough to crystallize just locally. I mean these aren't like diamonds, right? But little local units of the thing are together and when they come together like that, they got their lower and energy so they give off heat. So when you stretch it at first, that doesn't make any difference. But the very last bit of the stretching causes this crystallization and he comes out, right? So there's local con crystallization, which contributes rigidity, right? And releases heat, right? On the other hand, when you let it, if you put heat in, it will melt these crystals and entropy will cause it to contract, right? And that, uh, so, so then it'll allow statistics to make the material contract like this and you'll go backwards. So it's actually entropy that brings rubber back to its original shape.

Speaker 1:          33:50          Okay. So fixed irregular cross links between adjacent chains prevents crystallization. So it doesn't become brittle when it's cold because it doesn't crystallize. And uh, it also prevents it from being goofy when it's hot. How does that happen? Well, the gooeyness has to do with the, with the flowing of the molecules. So how, but if you have something that's all tangled up like this, how can it possibly, how can you move a molecule, right? If it's got to be really complicated shape, the way it happens is very interesting. It's a process called reputation. Like a reptile. This was an idea of a French physicist who got the Nobel prize for this kind of thing. Okay. So suppose you try to move the chain length wise, right? What will happen is like a carpet, when you try to move a carpet, you make a little wiggle in it, right?

Speaker 1:          34:46          A little hump, and then you can move the Hump along without moving anything else. And it would go on and on all along the chain and finally get to the other end where it would be like that. And finally the other end could move, right? So it sort of crawls or goes like a snake through all this tangle of other polymers. Right? Now what does vulcanization have to do with that? Right? If you have crosslinks between the chains, then they can't slide by one another. So you can't do reputation. So this stuff doesn't flow and become gooey when it's hot and that's what vulcanization does. So there's no flow when hot and it inhibits crystallization, so it's not brittle when it's cold. There's also vulcanization that happens in the, uh, as I look around, I'm not sure that any of you have practice this, but you've heard of it.

Speaker 1:          35:43          I'm sure. Here's a Robin Kelly. I got permission to use this by talking to Robin Kelly's mother. And she tells me that Robin Kelly is now a student at Harvard law school. This was from some years ago, but Robin Kelley did Irish dancing and she wanted her hair to look like this for Irish dancing. So she vulcanized that, right? So here hair has sulfide groups coming out and they linked to other chains. So it's crosslinked, it's vulcanized to begin with. Okay. That holds the chains next to one another in shape, right? So what she did first was reduced the dye sulfide cross links by excess basic self, uh, hydro, uh, thiol. So these are the two files that are commonly used for that. And notice that the sh is much more acidic than, than hydroxide. So if you have basic RSH, you have s rs minus, right? Okay. So that can be do an sn, two reaction on sulfur and break that bond. And that one can attack another Thile take its hydrogen, right? And then that, that Theo laid an ion can do another displacement. So what's happened,

Speaker 2:          37:01          okay,

Speaker 1:          37:01          is that we've reduced,

Speaker 2:          37:05          yeah,

Speaker 1:          37:05          the, the dye sulfide links to make it to r a s h groups, right? And now you can do the same thing again and again and again, right? And now the chains are pliable and can be moved past one another. So now she puts the soft spikes in and curls her hair up tight and changes its shape, right? And now she's got to make new cross links again to vulcanize it, right? So she's got it like this. Now she oxidizes the thiols back the dice all with hydrogen peroxide. Now look at the Bond Association energies that, oh, Aho Aho members are very, the, the oil was a very weak bond, but the SS bond is not so weak and that sh bond is weak compared to, Ooh. So it's much favorable to start on the left and go to the right. It's favored by 30 kilocalories per mole.

Speaker 1:          37:59          So if she puts in peroxide, right with thiol, she'll get out the new cross links and alcohol, right? So you get the new cross links holding the chains together in the shape you want them to be. So now our hair is vulcanized in that everything's fine. She can go Irish dancing. Okay. Now another way to hold the chains together with cross links is to have ionic groups on them. And these ions tend to get together with counter ions in clusters. So that serves as a cross link, but it's not a permanent cross link. The covalent bonds are, right? So it's possible if you warm it to break those at have and make things flow. So this is thermo plastic. You heat the polymer and you can reshape it and then you cool it and it's got the new shape, right? So there's after warming and they got malleable cross length.

Speaker 1:          38:53          This is a father, uh, Newland at Notre Dame university who figured out how to polymerize, not the thing that had methyl up here, which was the biological ISO preed unit, but the one that has chloro. So that gave a new compound called neoprene, which had different properties and they're all of these different, uh, uh, polymers that have been made and this list of according to how much they cost, they get very expensive for flouro silicon. Uh, how heat resistant they are. Uh, that low temperature, the maximum temperature you can use them, but also how they, how they last oxidation, whether they're substitutes, uh, subject to weathering by ozone, how strong they are. So natural rubber is nice and strong at a, it resists abrasion and tear. It's very resilient. This is after, uh, after crosslinking it after vulcanization, but it's only fair on oxidation or Ozon.

Speaker 1:          39:50          You've probably seen rubber that's been around a while are old telephone lines, the rubbers falling off because ozone has gotten to it, right? So there are others that have, that have a variety of properties. I also wasn't important. One that's not listed here is how they interact with uh, oil or something like that. Natural rubber is very bad with oil, but some of these others, uh, like neoprene is much better. So the, you know, designing a, a tire for your car is a very complex thing to mix different polymers to get exactly the properties in different parts of the tire that are necessary. Now there are other ways of doing polymerization as well. For example, styrene, you could imagine these double bonds going together with a radical doing addition to the double bond and notice that as I drew at there, it's random whether which ended, the styrene got attacked, but it would also be possible to imagine that it always goes head to tail. Always the same way. Why would that be advantageous always to go this way?

Speaker 2:          40:55          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          40:55          because in fact, that's what it does. It goes just head to tail. Why? Why don't you do additions like this where you add to the center and leave that radical?

Speaker 2:          41:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:09          Why do you want to leave this radical instead?

Speaker 2:          41:14          Amy?

Speaker 1:          41:16          It's secondary, but much more important.

Speaker 2:          41:19          Yes,

Speaker 1:          41:20          it's been Zelig. It's like al the lake. It has the double bonds to, to interact with the SOMO. Right? So both for both reasons, it does that even if it were a methyl group, it would tend to do this because it would be secondary the way Amy said. But with fennel, that's ever so much more so. So that's 13 kilocalories more stable than adding the other way. Okay? Now there's also the question of tactility, which we talked on before. So, uh, you can have ISO tag, even though these are all head to tail. Notice that the, the methyl group is on every other carbon. But you can have ice, a tactic, Cindy, a tactic where I stacked the, they're all the same. A tactic. They alternate and a tactic is random. And that's what you get. You get right. The regio chemistry is always head to tail with the free radical.

Speaker 1:          42:09          But the stereo chemistry is random. So it's a tactic. But you can get ISO tactic polypropylene from Ziegler, not a catalyst that we talked about. Uh, two last lecture or the lecture before. And Cindy tactic. Remember I've used this fancy Kaminsky catalysts that comes from one side than the other than one side than the other. And it has a mirror plane. So you change the configuration each time. Okay. But there's another question of selectivity when you have two different monomers in there. So for example, methyl methacrylate and styrene. So you could have block coat polymers where you have a bunch of one coming together and then a bunch of the other one in a single chain. Right? But another possibility is to have them strictly alternate a, B, a, B, a, B. Right? And you can do that. And the reason you can do it is because of the rates of adding different radicals to the alkenes.

Speaker 1:          43:05          So if you have that particular radical at the end of the chain, right, the rea, it adds to styrene faster than they heads to methyl methacrylate that this, this unit here was methylmethacrylate that added to a radical there. So now it's at the end of the chain and it would prefer by a factor of two to one to react with its own kind there. Pardon me? To react with styrene rather than with its own kind. Right? Now, what would you expect if you have styrene as the, as the last radical, right? Notice what's interesting here. I was wondering what this one was here. It's this.

Speaker 1:          43:46          Okay. Okay. That's now notice it's a factor of two in the other direction. One radical. Each radical prefers to react with the other monomer. Isn't that interesting? That's why it goes a B, a, B, a, B. Why should that be? This isn't surprising because the this rack, this radical is resonance stabilized as Amy was telling us. Okay, so that's, that's the fastest of all these reactions and it's a good radical. So that's reasonable. But why does this one prefer not to form the good radical, but the form what appears to be the less good radical. Okay, so here, here's our radical starting and it can add to this to give that and that that turns out it would be something like that. And this 20th kilocalories per mole exothermic, that's great. Right? But if we start with it, but if we react with the other alkene, right, then it gives this, which is less stable, right? This one doesn't have as much Al Lilly or Benzoic stabilization that you have down here. Okay. But it's faster. So it's faster to go to the higher energy product. That's not the Hammond postulate. Right? Why? What? Why is it twice as fast to go to the less stable product? So the transition state for one looks like that, the transition state for the other, it looks like that, right? What's good about the bottom one?

Speaker 2:          45:19          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          45:19          there's the top one. There's the bottom one. And notice in this one the, the carbon eel is good at stabilizing high homos. So you can have a resonance structure with a minus charge here and a plus charge here. You can't do that up here as well. This isn't specifically good at stabilizing and ions. All right. So you can have these resonance structures here that you can't have there.

Speaker 2:          45:45          Right?

Speaker 1:          45:47          So the ionic resonance structure, you could say, stabilizes the transition state, or if you wanted to talk about it in terms of orbitals, you'd say that the c double bond o gives an unusually low Lumo, so that's good when the SOMO is not so low.

Speaker 2:          46:02          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          46:02          and this special stability applies only at the transition state. Once you formed this bond, then you can't have a resonance structure like that. So the product is not stabilized by that kind of thing. But the transition state is, which is what makes these things turn around and go, a, B, a, B, a, B. Okay. Now I was going to go onto acetylene, but we'll do that next time.
