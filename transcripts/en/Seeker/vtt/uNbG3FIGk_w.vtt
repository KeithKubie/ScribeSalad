00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.300
Domestic violence has been in the news a lot
lately - but how common is it?

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.670
And is there a way to identify perpetrators
before they strike?

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:17.310
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you’ve
been paying attention to the news lately,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.189
then you’ve probably heard about this whole
Ray Rice fiasco, which is sadly, just one

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.980
of the domestic violence cases currently surrounding
the NFL.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.140
What you may not be aware of, though - are
the actual statistics regarding these kinds

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.140
of issues.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.190
According to a new study from the University
of Michigan, 1 in 5 men in the United States

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.460
reports having committed violence against
their spouse or significant other.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.989
Violence against women, specifically, accounts
for almost 320,000 outpatient health visits

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.410
and 1,200 deaths every year.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.870
That’s nearly $8.3 billion spent on medical
and mental health services alone.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.920
But the scariest statistic of all?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.540
In this country, domestic violence is more
common than diabetes.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.789
This particular study included a nationally-representative
survey sample of 530 men with an average age

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:04.789
of 42.

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:11.040
“Intimate partner violence” was defined
as pushing, grabbing, shoving, throwing something,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.079
slapping or hitting, kicking, biting, beating
up, choking, burning or scalding, or threatening

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.750
a partner with a knife or gun.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.180
So, pretty severe stuff.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.220
What’s especially eye-opening about these
findings, is that male aggression towards

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.610
a partner, is associated with certain warning
signs - signs that often pop up during routine

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.830
health care visits.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.450
Irritable bowel syndrome, insomnia, substance
abuse, and a history of either experiencing

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.159
or witnessing violence as a child - are all
things that male aggressors experience more

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.600
frequently than others.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.979
According to lead author Vijay Singh, the
issue of domestic violence is one that “cuts

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.939
across all communities, regardless of race,
income, or any other demographics."

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.740
Most of the efforts up until now, have focused
on screening and improving outcomes for female

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.740
victims.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.250
But very little work has been done to actually
identify male perpetrators.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.329
Which is why this study is so important.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.910
It shows just how much of an opportunity we’re
missing, to identify aggressive behavior in

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.470
the primary care setting, and potentially
intervene.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.830
Now - switching gears for a second, I wanna
remind everyone out there watching this, that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.690
I host another another show here on Discovery
called TestTube.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.300
It’s a lot like Dnews - but more focused
on current events; however there is still

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:34.750
some science stuff in there, like this episode
I hosted about why it’s so difficult to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:42.920
actually eradicate disease.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.340
You can find that, along with many other episodes,
over at youtube.com/testtubenetwork.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.730
And in the meantime, if you guys have any
questions, comments, anything you wanna say

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.610
about this episode - let us know in the comments
below.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.830
Otherwise, thanks for watching!
