you very much your your work using phage

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880
you very much your your work using phage

example of her translational research

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
example of her translational research
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.759
example of her translational research
would work when you say I

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769
would work when you say I
 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.839
would work when you say I
yes because I suppose I started I wasn't

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
yes because I suppose I started I wasn't
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.830
yes because I suppose I started I wasn't
actually thinking about doing

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
actually thinking about doing
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.319
actually thinking about doing
translational work at the time I started

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
translational work at the time I started
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.080
translational work at the time I started
the work so it was much more a sort

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
the work so it was much more a sort
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.690
the work so it was much more a sort
interest in how one might create new

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
interest in how one might create new
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.540
interest in how one might create new
molecules in general so I I didn't

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550
molecules in general so I I didn't
 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.010
molecules in general so I I didn't
actually in my earlier work with protein

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
actually in my earlier work with protein
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.270
actually in my earlier work with protein
engineering I'd just been more

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
engineering I'd just been more
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580

interested in understanding how enzymes

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
interested in understanding how enzymes
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.080
interested in understanding how enzymes
and things work and then I started

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
and things work and then I started
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.610
and things work and then I started
moving to antibodies again to try to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
moving to antibodies again to try to
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.260
moving to antibodies again to try to
understand how antibodies worked and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
understand how antibodies worked and
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180
understand how antibodies worked and
then I realized the power of very

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
then I realized the power of very
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790
then I realized the power of very
evolutionary technologist to create

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
evolutionary technologist to create
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.220
evolutionary technologist to create
large repertoires of them and to select

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
large repertoires of them and to select
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.860
large repertoires of them and to select
them and of course I think there are two

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
them and of course I think there are two
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.679
them and of course I think there are two
components to the work that were really

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
components to the work that were really
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.410
components to the work that were really
very important the first was the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
very important the first was the
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.530
very important the first was the
generation of repertoires and making

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
generation of repertoires and making
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.210
generation of repertoires and making
sure those repertoires were as efficient

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220
sure those repertoires were as efficient
 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.219
sure those repertoires were as efficient
if fully folded proteins and then

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
if fully folded proteins and then
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.160
if fully folded proteins and then
secondly the way of displaying them on

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
secondly the way of displaying them on
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620
secondly the way of displaying them on
the use of the phage which George Smith

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
the use of the phage which George Smith
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.200
the use of the phage which George Smith
had provided pointers to so so and of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
had provided pointers to so so and of
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.550
had provided pointers to so so and of
course having so if it wasn't as if I

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
course having so if it wasn't as if I
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560
course having so if it wasn't as if I
thought the very beginning right I need

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
thought the very beginning right I need
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.810
thought the very beginning right I need
to create pharmaceutical antibodies you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
to create pharmaceutical antibodies you
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880
to create pharmaceutical antibodies you
kind of start working along a different

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
kind of start working along a different
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.990
kind of start working along a different
route and then you find yourself

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
route and then you find yourself
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.080
route and then you find yourself
gradually being you know seizing

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
gradually being you know seizing
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.789
gradually being you know seizing
opportunities as they come up and those

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
opportunities as they come up and those
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.870
opportunities as they come up and those
opportunities were well opportunities to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
opportunities were well opportunities to
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.940
opportunities were well opportunities to
actually overcome a really difficult

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
actually overcome a really difficult
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.370
actually overcome a really difficult
problem which was how to make human

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
problem which was how to make human
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.010
problem which was how to make human
antibodies against human self antigens

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
antibodies against human self antigens
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.440
antibodies against human self antigens
and so realized that we could create

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
and so realized that we could create
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.570
and so realized that we could create
this by by using evolutionary technology

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
this by by using evolutionary technology
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.850
this by by using evolutionary technology
some sense is a bit Hallett bit like how

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
some sense is a bit Hallett bit like how
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.320
some sense is a bit Hallett bit like how
the immune system works you could also

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
the immune system works you could also
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.710
the immune system works you could also
regard it as the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720
regard it as the
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.450
regard it as the
I mean you could think in terms of early

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460
I mean you could think in terms of early
 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.200
I mean you could think in terms of early
evolution but if you think about the way

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210
evolution but if you think about the way
 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.150
evolution but if you think about the way
in which the immune system works that is

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160
in which the immune system works that is
 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.520
in which the immune system works that is
an evolutionary system so we effectively

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530
an evolutionary system so we effectively
 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.030
an evolutionary system so we effectively
what we did is we started to rationalize

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
what we did is we started to rationalize
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.030
what we did is we started to rationalize
this in terms of how how can we mimic

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040
this in terms of how how can we mimic
 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.010
this in terms of how how can we mimic
the immune system which is a new

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020
the immune system which is a new
 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.160
the immune system which is a new
evolutionary system to make to make

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170
evolutionary system to make to make
 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.770
evolutionary system to make to make
human antibodies but without all the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780
human antibodies but without all the
 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.240
human antibodies but without all the
checks and controls the immune system

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250
checks and controls the immune system
 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.530
checks and controls the immune system
would have that prevent you from making

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540
would have that prevent you from making
 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.260
would have that prevent you from making
and yourself antibodies quite so how can

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270
and yourself antibodies quite so how can
 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.410
and yourself antibodies quite so how can
you mimic and then direct correct yes

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420
you mimic and then direct correct yes
 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.440
you mimic and then direct correct yes
um yes or what is very important in all

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
um yes or what is very important in all
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.540
um yes or what is very important in all
of that isn't there's no that one

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550
of that isn't there's no that one
 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.500
of that isn't there's no that one
doesn't really know where the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510
doesn't really know where the
 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.270
doesn't really know where the
opportunities are going to arise so you

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280
opportunities are going to arise so you
 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.980
opportunities are going to arise so you
have to do lots and lots of basic

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990
have to do lots and lots of basic
 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.820
have to do lots and lots of basic
research in order to be in a position I

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830
research in order to be in a position I
 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.830
research in order to be in a position I
certainly agree with that I mean it's so

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840
certainly agree with that I mean it's so
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.810
certainly agree with that I mean it's so
- so my strategy my personal strategy

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820
- so my strategy my personal strategy
 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.840
- so my strategy my personal strategy
has been to do the basic research Alette

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850
has been to do the basic research Alette
 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.870
has been to do the basic research Alette
and but to be mindful of opportunities

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880
and but to be mindful of opportunities
 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.020
and but to be mindful of opportunities
that may arise in other words not to say

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030
that may arise in other words not to say
 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.180
that may arise in other words not to say
oh well that's applied I'm not going to

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190
oh well that's applied I'm not going to
 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.449
oh well that's applied I'm not going to
do it my own view has been yeah actually

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459
do it my own view has been yeah actually
 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.970
do it my own view has been yeah actually
if I just did the basic research and I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
if I just did the basic research and I
 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.520
if I just did the basic research and I
came up with a very interesting method

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530
came up with a very interesting method
 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.350
came up with a very interesting method
and I didn't take it any further then

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360
and I didn't take it any further then
 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.150
and I didn't take it any further then
people would say well it's just a

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160
people would say well it's just a
 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.680
people would say well it's just a
curious you know it's a very clever

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690
curious you know it's a very clever
 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.690
curious you know it's a very clever
little system he's got there but you

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700
little system he's got there but you
 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.050
little system he's got there but you
know it's a bit of a curiosity really so

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060
know it's a bit of a curiosity really so
 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.940
know it's a bit of a curiosity really so
I thought actually one needs to prove it

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950
I thought actually one needs to prove it
 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.620
I thought actually one needs to prove it
you need to drive it all the way through

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630
you need to drive it all the way through
 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.190
you need to drive it all the way through
and so I certainly enjoyed let me just

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
and so I certainly enjoyed let me just
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.900
and so I certainly enjoyed let me just
linking showing off I've just had the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910
linking showing off I've just had the
 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.699
linking showing off I've just had the
University people here trying to

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709
University people here trying to
 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.220
University people here trying to
coordinate all the incoming calls it's

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230
coordinate all the incoming calls it's
 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.830
coordinate all the incoming calls it's
like a seed we can't actually get any

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840
like a seed we can't actually get any
 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.229
like a seed we can't actually get any
all the phone lines I can imagine you're

all the phone lines I can imagine you're
 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.479
all the phone lines I can imagine you're
a scientist you're an inventor you know

a scientist you're an inventor you know
you're an administrator

have to say why does the public give

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849
have to say why does the public give
 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.730
have to say why does the public give
he's willing for a large sums I mean

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740
he's willing for a large sums I mean

amount into zoom into humanities and the

amount into zoom into humanities and the
 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.460
amount into zoom into humanities and the
reason for that is that the public

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470
reason for that is that the public
 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.439
reason for that is that the public
believes some good will come of it and

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449
believes some good will come of it and
 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.020

if we want to maintain credibility with

if we want to maintain credibility with
 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.689
if we want to maintain credibility with
the you know public in general and we

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699
the you know public in general and we
 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.159
the you know public in general and we
have to show that from time to time

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169
have to show that from time to time
 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.800

um yes indeed exciting things will

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810
um yes indeed exciting things will
 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.529
um yes indeed exciting things will
happen and particularly things that are

are in need for the public good so I

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509
are in need for the public good so I
 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:51.760
are in need for the public good so I
think it's terribly important

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770
think it's terribly important
 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.469
think it's terribly important
that scientists don't ignore the

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479
that scientists don't ignore the
 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.309
that scientists don't ignore the
opportunities that may come from their

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:57.319
opportunities that may come from their
 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.529

people say well applied research that

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580
people say well applied research that
 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.770
people say well applied research that
has no place in academia and I I'm not

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780
has no place in academia and I I'm not
 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.680
has no place in academia and I I'm not
sure I agree with that but yeah there is

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690
sure I agree with that but yeah there is
 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.300
sure I agree with that but yeah there is
a bit of an obsession now that you put

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310
a bit of an obsession now that you put
 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.300
a bit of an obsession now that you put
the focus on application and it'll be

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310
the focus on application and it'll be
 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.270
the focus on application and it'll be
right projects for application and I'm

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280
right projects for application and I'm
 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.939
right projects for application and I'm
not saying that's a bad thing

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949
not saying that's a bad thing
 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.649
not saying that's a bad thing
but I think that sometimes if you want

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659
but I think that sometimes if you want
 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.659
but I think that sometimes if you want
to make big leaps it's sometimes more

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669
to make big leaps it's sometimes more
 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.159
to make big leaps it's sometimes more
effective to be a little bit more D

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.070

focused so that you actually focus on on

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080
focused so that you actually focus on on
 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.260
focused so that you actually focus on on
some basic research and you give the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270
some basic research and you give the
 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.879
some basic research and you give the
people the freedom to and perhaps they

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889
people the freedom to and perhaps they
 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.939
people the freedom to and perhaps they
expect them to be responsible and if

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949
expect them to be responsible and if
 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.110
expect them to be responsible and if
they don't want to take up the

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120
they don't want to take up the
 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.760
they don't want to take up the
opportunity themselves at least alert

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770

other people to them so that these the

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860

their inventions are are and can

their inventions are are and can
 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.520
their inventions are are and can
actually be exploited so I think we kind

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530
actually be exploited so I think we kind
 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.740
actually be exploited so I think we kind
of have a duty as scientists to do that

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750
of have a duty as scientists to do that
 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.920
