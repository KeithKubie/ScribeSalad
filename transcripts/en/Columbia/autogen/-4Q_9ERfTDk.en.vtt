let's find an avalanche and it became
pretty clear that the one in tunnel

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890
pretty clear that the one in tunnel

was it the most deadly of the season it

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600
was it the most deadly of the season it
 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.510
was it the most deadly of the season it
was also one in which there were a lot

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520
was also one in which there were a lot
 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.270
was also one in which there were a lot
of survivors and witnesses and most

avalanches kill the people that set them

avalanches kill the people that set them
off and they don't have a lot of

off and they don't have a lot of
 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.660
off and they don't have a lot of
witnesses so it's one thing to find an

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670
witnesses so it's one thing to find an
 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.460
witnesses so it's one thing to find an

avalanche it's another thing to report
 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.890
avalanche it's another thing to report
it how do you report on an avalanche

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900

the first thing I did was besides doing

the first thing I did was besides doing
 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.350
the first thing I did was besides doing
some very basic going back and see what

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360
some very basic going back and see what
 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.730
some very basic going back and see what
was written about this was to make a

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740
was written about this was to make a
 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.040
was written about this was to make a
couple calls to people who were in the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050
couple calls to people who were in the
 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.550
couple calls to people who were in the
Avalanche and I'd started calling them

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560
Avalanche and I'd started calling them
 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.410
Avalanche and I'd started calling them
and I didn't know what kind of response

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420
and I didn't know what kind of response
 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.820
and I didn't know what kind of response
i would get certainly it had been two or

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830
i would get certainly it had been two or
 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.590
i would get certainly it had been two or
three months since the Avalanche I would

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600
three months since the Avalanche I would
 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.650
three months since the Avalanche I would
assume that they were tired of thinking

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660
assume that they were tired of thinking
 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.960
assume that they were tired of thinking
about it talking about it they didn't

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970
about it talking about it they didn't
 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.150
about it talking about it they didn't
know me from anybody and here's another

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160
know me from anybody and here's another
 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.710
know me from anybody and here's another
guy just another reporter calling him

can we go over it all again and
 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.510
can we go over it all again and
fortunately on the first two calls were

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520
fortunately on the first two calls were
 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.600
fortunately on the first two calls were
making Michelson and John snifter both

media and they've responded to my

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800
media and they've responded to my
 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.310
media and they've responded to my
request within an hour or two and I had

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320
request within an hour or two and I had
 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.220

going minute by minute through what

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070
going minute by minute through what
 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.550

happened that day and you know at the

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560
happened that day and you know at the
 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.380
happened that day and you know at the
time I assume that I would be able to

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390
time I assume that I would be able to
 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.790
time I assume that I would be able to
get hopefully a few people to talk about

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800
get hopefully a few people to talk about
 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.860
get hopefully a few people to talk about
the Avalanche but I'm very proud of the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870
the Avalanche but I'm very proud of the
 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.300
the Avalanche but I'm very proud of the
fact that in the end all of them we

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310
fact that in the end all of them we
 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.350
fact that in the end all of them we
figure out who was there which was a

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360
figure out who was there which was a
 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.450
figure out who was there which was a
trick in its own and in the end they all

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460
trick in its own and in the end they all
 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.880
trick in its own and in the end they all
spoke but I do think it it took a

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890
spoke but I do think it it took a
 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.260
spoke but I do think it it took a
certain amount of trust and it certainly

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270
certain amount of trust and it certainly
 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.990
certain amount of trust and it certainly
this is a horrible analogy snowball to

some extent that i talked to them and
 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.800
some extent that i talked to them and

when I went to make the next call for
the next person they were certainly

were 911 calls there were some ways I

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150
were 911 calls there were some ways I
 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.120
were 911 calls there were some ways I
could sort of construct a timeline and

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.130
could sort of construct a timeline and
 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.320
could sort of construct a timeline and
that's what I did first is basically

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.330
that's what I did first is basically
 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.459
that's what I did first is basically
took all the information from the

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:41.469

this we think there's something

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360
this we think there's something
 

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.410
this we think there's something
potentially powerful and and we're going

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420
potentially powerful and and we're going
 

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.900
potentially powerful and and we're going
to go pretty big on this we think are

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:05.910
to go pretty big on this we think are
 

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.010
to go pretty big on this we think are

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:32.750
 
 

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.180
 
okay so I'll just run through the

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:35.190
okay so I'll just run through the
 

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.800
okay so I'll just run through the
presentation of it give you a little bit

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:36.810
presentation of it give you a little bit
 

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.380
presentation of it give you a little bit
of the backstory it does start with this

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:39.390

Katherine Spangler edited she was the
 

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.680
Katherine Spangler edited she was the
main video editor on the piece and so

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:54.690
main video editor on the piece and so
 

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.720
main video editor on the piece and so
with the the top of the piece we just

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:56.730
with the the top of the piece we just
 

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.950
with the the top of the piece we just
try to keep things as minimal as

being tossed over and over and over it
 

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.230
being tossed over and over and over it
was like being in a washing machine I

idea here was to not have separate
 

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:29.030

here we show you a reconstruct basically

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.030
here we show you a reconstruct basically

of the Avalanche it was something that

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:51.940
of the Avalanche it was something that
 

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.450
of the Avalanche it was something that
we created from data actually so we show

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:54.460
we created from data actually so we show
 

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.310
we created from data actually so we show
you where the skiers were on the

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320
you where the skiers were on the
 

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.260
you where the skiers were on the

mountain
 

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:03.990
mountain
and include some contour lines and so we

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000
and include some contour lines and so we
 

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.520
and include some contour lines and so we
added a little sound to sound actually

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:05.530
added a little sound to sound actually
 

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.560
added a little sound to sound actually
is there's a little data component of

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:07.570
is there's a little data component of
 

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.120
is there's a little data component of
the sound is ticking off every time it

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.130
the sound is ticking off every time it
 

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.990
the sound is ticking off every time it
it crosses another hundred feet a little

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000
it crosses another hundred feet a little
 

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.450
it crosses another hundred feet a little
annotation on the speed so you get the

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:21.460
annotation on the speed so you get the
 

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.970
annotation on the speed so you get the
idea and you know it started with with

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:23.980
idea and you know it started with with
 

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.130

this actually I think the source we
 

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.710
this actually I think the source we
worked with with someone John found was

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.090
us the Swiss group that does Avalanche
 

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.240
us the Swiss group that does Avalanche
research and they they do modeling of

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:33.250
research and they they do modeling of
 

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.670
research and they they do modeling of
avalanches and we had a lot of

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680
avalanches and we had a lot of
 

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.440
avalanches and we had a lot of
information you know the physical

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:37.450
information you know the physical
 

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.210
information you know the physical
attributes of this we had that sort of

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:39.220
attributes of this we had that sort of
 

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.880
attributes of this we had that sort of
width of the crack and the depth and we

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:41.890
width of the crack and the depth and we
 

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.550
width of the crack and the depth and we
had this very detailed elevation model

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560
had this very detailed elevation model
 

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.160
had this very detailed elevation model
so we knew the slope and variations in

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:47.170
so we knew the slope and variations in
 

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.740
so we knew the slope and variations in
the slope and so we passed them our data

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:49.750
the slope and so we passed them our data
 

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.870
the slope and so we passed them our data
and the model that we created and they

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880
and the model that we created and they
 

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.700
and the model that we created and they
started to actually create a animation

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:53.710
started to actually create a animation
 

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.330
started to actually create a animation
out of it and so they gave us the

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:57.340
out of it and so they gave us the
 

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.510
out of it and so they gave us the
velocity and the height of this at

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:00.520
velocity and the height of this at
 

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.490
velocity and the height of this at
different at different positions down

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:02.500
different at different positions down
 

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.130
different at different positions down
the slope of the mountain and then we

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:05.140
the slope of the mountain and then we
 

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.580
the slope of the mountain and then we
mapped that to our 3d model you can sort

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:08.590
mapped that to our 3d model you can sort
 

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.380
mapped that to our 3d model you can sort
of see the stages of it here and then we

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:10.390
of see the stages of it here and then we
 

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.700
of see the stages of it here and then we
started to kind of style eyes it and

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:11.710
started to kind of style eyes it and
 

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:15.090
started to kind of style eyes it and
simplify it so that it became something

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.100
simplify it so that it became something
 

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.580
simplify it so that it became something
that was understandable and then we you

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:17.590
that was understandable and then we you
 

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.120
that was understandable and then we you
know included scales and annotation to

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.130
know included scales and annotation to
 

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:26.810
know included scales and annotation to
make it a little bit more meaningful

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820
 
 

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.780
 
that was it

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:31.790
 
 

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:40.330
 
thank you so we'll take a few minutes of

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:40.340
thank you so we'll take a few minutes of
 

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.980
thank you so we'll take a few minutes of
questions in avalanche and then open it

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:41.990
questions in avalanche and then open it
 

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.480
questions in avalanche and then open it
up to all the entire panel all right

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:46.490
up to all the entire panel all right
 

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.450
up to all the entire panel all right
there's an avalanche of questioners here

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:49.460
there's an avalanche of questioners here
 

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.630
there's an avalanche of questioners here

yeah of course everyone saw this when it
came out and people are still continue

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440
came out and people are still continue
 

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.500
came out and people are still continue
to talk about it simply because we

00:16:59.500 --> 00:16:59.510
to talk about it simply because we
 

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.960
to talk about it simply because we
haven't seen it duplicated yet can you

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:01.970
haven't seen it duplicated yet can you
 

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.700
haven't seen it duplicated yet can you
talk to us a little bit about maybe

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:03.710
talk to us a little bit about maybe
 

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.640
talk to us a little bit about maybe
Steve what are the challenges costs

into making a project like this and why

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:11.540
into making a project like this and why
 

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.780
into making a project like this and why
maybe it is such a special thing right

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:13.790
maybe it is such a special thing right
 

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.210
maybe it is such a special thing right
now and you know we haven't seen

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:16.220
now and you know we haven't seen
 

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.650
now and you know we haven't seen
something like this since last December

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:19.660
something like this since last December
 

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.260
something like this since last December
well there were a lot of challenges

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:22.270
well there were a lot of challenges
 

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.190
well there were a lot of challenges
although at the time it didn't seem that

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:24.200
although at the time it didn't seem that
 

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.110
although at the time it didn't seem that
difficult we had a lot of time to work

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120
difficult we had a lot of time to work
 

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.280
difficult we had a lot of time to work
on it there was no real peg and we kind

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:30.290
on it there was no real peg and we kind
 

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.900
on it there was no real peg and we kind
of kept pushing back the publication

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:31.910
of kept pushing back the publication
 

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.060
of kept pushing back the publication
date because we were developing assets

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:34.070
date because we were developing assets
 

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.120
date because we were developing assets
and you know became more and more

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.130
and you know became more and more
 

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.290
and you know became more and more
confident that they were going to be

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:38.300
confident that they were going to be
 

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.000
confident that they were going to be
good and that we had a good idea for how

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.010
good and that we had a good idea for how
 

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.330
good and that we had a good idea for how
we were going to put it all together I

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:42.340
we were going to put it all together I
 

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.470
we were going to put it all together I
think you know the challenge in

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480
think you know the challenge in
 

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.580
think you know the challenge in
repeating is that you know we turn

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:48.590
repeating is that you know we turn
 

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.870
repeating is that you know we turn
around stories pretty quickly even

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880
around stories pretty quickly even
 

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.760
around stories pretty quickly even
stories that have a lot of people

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:51.770
stories that have a lot of people
 

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.350
stories that have a lot of people
working on them even stories where were

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360
working on them even stories where were
 

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.150
working on them even stories where were
you know creating a lot of multimedia

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:55.160
you know creating a lot of multimedia
 

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.470
you know creating a lot of multimedia
and you know with this piece it was sort

00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480
and you know with this piece it was sort
 

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.030
and you know with this piece it was sort
of a luxury to have the amount of time

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:01.040
of a luxury to have the amount of time
 

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.530
of a luxury to have the amount of time
that we did and so it led us you know

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:05.540
that we did and so it led us you know
 

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.310
that we did and so it led us you know
try things out and and have those things

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320
try things out and and have those things
 

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.000
try things out and and have those things
not work and with other projects we're

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.010
not work and with other projects we're
 

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.680
not work and with other projects we're
having to turn them around so quickly

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:14.690
having to turn them around so quickly
 

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.020
having to turn them around so quickly
that it's hard to experiment the degree

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.030
that it's hard to experiment the degree
 

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.470
that it's hard to experiment the degree
that we did with with this project yes

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480
that we did with with this project yes
 

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.750
that we did with with this project yes
and that's it I have absolutely no

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:22.760
and that's it I have absolutely no
 

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.330
and that's it I have absolutely no
digital training and I'm a reporter but

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:25.340
digital training and I'm a reporter but
 

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.980
digital training and I'm a reporter but
every time I look at this project I

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:26.990
every time I look at this project I
 

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.440
every time I look at this project I
wonder what did John branch do and I see

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:29.450
wonder what did John branch do and I see
 

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.540
wonder what did John branch do and I see
that there was a huge team that was

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:31.550
that there was a huge team that was
 

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.100
that there was a huge team that was
supporting him but as far as we are

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:33.110
supporting him but as far as we are
 

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.260
supporting him but as far as we are
concerned when there is this growing you

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:35.270
concerned when there is this growing you
 

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.110
concerned when there is this growing you
know concern about being a one-man army

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120
know concern about being a one-man army
 

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:38.780
know concern about being a one-man army
and

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:38.790
and
 

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.730
and
able to produce something like this what

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740
able to produce something like this what
 

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.200
able to produce something like this what
what can you do what can the skills can

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.210
what can you do what can the skills can
 

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.700
what can you do what can the skills can
you learn just produce something as

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:43.710
you learn just produce something as
 

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.820
you learn just produce something as
terrific as that and yeah how do you go

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:46.830
terrific as that and yeah how do you go
 

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.880
terrific as that and yeah how do you go
about it well I mean there were maybe a

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:49.890
about it well I mean there were maybe a
 

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.550
about it well I mean there were maybe a
dozen people working on this so you know

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:52.560
dozen people working on this so you know
 

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.990
dozen people working on this so you know
there was a video editor there was a

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000
there was a video editor there was a
 

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.150

photographer Ruth crimson great
 

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.590
photographer Ruth crimson great
photographer there were 3d modelers and

00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600
photographer there were 3d modelers and
 

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.580
photographer there were 3d modelers and
animators you know which which path

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:04.590
animators you know which which path
 

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.280
animators you know which which path
would you like to go down I mean the and

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:07.290
would you like to go down I mean the and
 

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.760
would you like to go down I mean the and
you know of course it's it was all tied

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:10.770
you know of course it's it was all tied
 

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.890
you know of course it's it was all tied
to what John was doing I mean that none

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900
to what John was doing I mean that none
 

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.110
to what John was doing I mean that none
of this would have happened if you know

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120
of this would have happened if you know
 

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.700
of this would have happened if you know
we didn't have a great story um we you

opened up and gave us a start creating

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:29.310
opened up and gave us a start creating
 

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.340
opened up and gave us a start creating
some of the multimedia elements I think

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:31.350
some of the multimedia elements I think
 

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.690
some of the multimedia elements I think
I was like a crucial things so uh you

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:35.700
I was like a crucial things so uh you
 

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.210
I was like a crucial things so uh you

should probably try to be boring like 10
 

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.810
should probably try to be boring like 10
years later because if you can help it

00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820
years later because if you can help it
 

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.960

because uh I'd imagine these some of
 

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.000
because uh I'd imagine these some of
these graphics that took days or weeks

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.010
these graphics that took days or weeks

back story when we started to talk about

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480
back story when we started to talk about
 

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.320
back story when we started to talk about
the multimedia for the project I mean we

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:35.330
the multimedia for the project I mean we
 

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.840
the multimedia for the project I mean we
when we when we launched we behave the

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:37.850
when we when we launched we behave the
 

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.880
when we when we launched we behave the
way that we ordinarily do we wanted to

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:39.890
way that we ordinarily do we wanted to
 

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.320

make a model of the mountain we thought

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:41.330
make a model of the mountain we thought
 

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.640
make a model of the mountain we thought
there was a graphic that we be that

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:42.650
there was a graphic that we be that
 

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.140
there was a graphic that we be that
would be separate from John's piece that

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.150
would be separate from John's piece that
 

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.970
would be separate from John's piece that
we would make some kind of a simulation

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:45.980
we would make some kind of a simulation
 

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.190
we would make some kind of a simulation
of the recreation of the Avalanche and

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200
of the recreation of the Avalanche and
 

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.470
of the recreation of the Avalanche and
you know we started to see video and

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480
you know we started to see video and
 

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.470
you know we started to see video and
some of the photography and and the the

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480
some of the photography and and the the
 

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.300
some of the photography and and the the
models the graphics that we were making

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:58.310
models the graphics that we were making
 

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.950
models the graphics that we were making
started to improve and we kind of

00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960
started to improve and we kind of
 

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.480
started to improve and we kind of
realized that they they were going to be

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:01.490
realized that they they were going to be
 

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.390
realized that they they were going to be
pretty strong and started to talk about

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400
pretty strong and started to talk about
 

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.890
pretty strong and started to talk about
what we were going to do with all of

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:05.900
what we were going to do with all of
 

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.180
what we were going to do with all of
this material and you know the idea

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:10.190
this material and you know the idea
 

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.310
this material and you know the idea
service that we would try to bring them

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320
service that we would try to bring them
 

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.530
service that we would try to bring them
all together and and we thought that

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:14.540
all together and and we thought that
 

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.310
all together and and we thought that
meant you know changing some of the

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320
meant you know changing some of the
 

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.060
meant you know changing some of the
written story that we would want the

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:22.070
written story that we would want the
 

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.210
written story that we would want the
multimedia to be like to be like

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:25.220
multimedia to be like to be like
 

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.950
multimedia to be like to be like
connective tissue to be a part of the

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960
connective tissue to be a part of the
 

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.130
connective tissue to be a part of the
story and so we sort of presented this

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:30.140
story and so we sort of presented this
 

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.010
story and so we sort of presented this
idea to joe sexton who was the sports

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:33.020
idea to joe sexton who was the sports
 

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.750
idea to joe sexton who was the sports
editor and Jason sulman who's who is now

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760
editor and Jason sulman who's who is now
 

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.970
editor and Jason sulman who's who is now
the sports editor and said look you know

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:36.980
the sports editor and said look you know
 

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.560
the sports editor and said look you know
in order for this to work in order to

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:38.570
in order for this to work in order to
 

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.730
in order for this to work in order to
bring all of this together and make it

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:39.740
bring all of this together and make it
 

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.190
bring all of this together and make it
means editing it means us editing the

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200
means editing it means us editing the
 

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.280
means editing it means us editing the
multimedia so that it so that it so that

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:45.290
multimedia so that it so that it so that
 

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.570
multimedia so that it so that it so that
when you experience it it is like

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:46.580
when you experience it it is like
 

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.660
when you experience it it is like
reading and it means us editing your

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:49.670
reading and it means us editing your
 

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:53.320
reading and it means us editing your
words so that they they lead you into

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:53.330
words so that they they lead you into
 

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.940
words so that they they lead you into
the multimedia

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:55.950
the multimedia
 

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.620
the multimedia
natural way and Joe section said no way

00:22:59.620 --> 00:22:59.630
natural way and Joe section said no way
 

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.899
natural way and Joe section said no way
that was it and so then it took a couple

00:23:02.899 --> 00:23:02.909
that was it and so then it took a couple
 

00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:06.680
that was it and so then it took a couple
of weeks you know to let him Mull it

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:06.690
of weeks you know to let him Mull it
 

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.970
of weeks you know to let him Mull it
over and I think ultimately I don't even

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980
over and I think ultimately I don't even
 

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.470
over and I think ultimately I don't even
know how he became convinced that it was

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480
know how he became convinced that it was
 

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.740
know how he became convinced that it was
maybe a good idea but he said yes and

seventeen thousand words but it just
 

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.890
seventeen thousand words but it just
sort of evolved that way and and i think

multimedia in the end nothing changed I
 

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.960
multimedia in the end nothing changed I
don't know if that's happened since then

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:44.970
don't know if that's happened since then
 

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.430
don't know if that's happened since then
I'm involved in a couple projects now

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440
I'm involved in a couple projects now
 

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.169
I'm involved in a couple projects now
that I could potentially see we would

00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179
that I could potentially see we would
 

00:28:48.179 --> 00:28:50.030
that I could potentially see we would
write it before the multimedia yeah that

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:50.040
write it before the multimedia yeah that
 

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.410
write it before the multimedia yeah that
was my question is like how does it

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:51.420
was my question is like how does it
 

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.510
was my question is like how does it
change your compositional process now it

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520
change your compositional process now it
 

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.730
change your compositional process now it
hasn't I'm working on something now see

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740
hasn't I'm working on something now see
 

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.930
hasn't I'm working on something now see
if I were talking about before this that

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:56.940
if I were talking about before this that
 

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.390
if I were talking about before this that
I could see I'll go into a writing it

00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400
I could see I'll go into a writing it
 

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.640
I could see I'll go into a writing it
you know maybe it's a bunch of vignettes

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:01.650
you know maybe it's a bunch of vignettes
 

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.320
you know maybe it's a bunch of vignettes
and I'm picturing how it would work in

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:03.330
and I'm picturing how it would work in
 

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.030
and I'm picturing how it would work in
multimedia as opposed to one long

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:05.040
multimedia as opposed to one long

narrative I think we're right at that

00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:08.309
narrative I think we're right at that
 

00:29:08.309 --> 00:29:10.880
narrative I think we're right at that
cusp I think this is an interesting time

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:10.890
cusp I think this is an interesting time
 

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.290
cusp I think this is an interesting time
because as a reporter's I think we are

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:12.300
because as a reporter's I think we are
 

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.280
because as a reporter's I think we are
now you know I've always thought about

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:13.290
now you know I've always thought about
 

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.140
now you know I've always thought about
how would you know what we do to add

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.150
how would you know what we do to add
 

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.380
how would you know what we do to add
video to this or a photographer what

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:18.390
video to this or a photographer what
 

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.120

kind of graphics would be useful in this

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:20.130
kind of graphics would be useful in this
 

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.980
kind of graphics would be useful in this
but as Steve showed that used to be

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:21.990
but as Steve showed that used to be
 

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.440
but as Steve showed that used to be
separate little things and now we're

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:24.450
separate little things and now we're
 

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.790
separate little things and now we're
blending them together you have to think

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:25.800
blending them together you have to think
 

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.180
blending them together you have to think
about

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.190
about
 

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.769
about
going to work out and I think we're kind

00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779
going to work out and I think we're kind
 

00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:28.909
going to work out and I think we're kind
of at that point and opie interesting to

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919
of at that point and opie interesting to
 

00:29:28.919 --> 00:29:30.649
of at that point and opie interesting to
see over next what five or ten years as

the web did not work on this exclusively

00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559
the web did not work on this exclusively
 

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:47.960
the web did not work on this exclusively
I mean there were other projects that we

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:47.970
I mean there were other projects that we
 

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.960
I mean there were other projects that we
were juggling it was 2012 so we had a

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:50.970

said 16 people worked on this for six
 

00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:08.360
said 16 people worked on this for six
months some of those people worked on it

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:08.370
months some of those people worked on it
 

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.879
months some of those people worked on it
for a few days some people will do off

00:31:10.879 --> 00:31:10.889
for a few days some people will do off
 

00:31:10.889 --> 00:31:12.169
for a few days some people will do off
and on over the course of a couple

00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179
and on over the course of a couple
 

00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:14.330
and on over the course of a couple
months I was probably only one that was

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340
months I was probably only one that was
 

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.249

unfortunately we happen to work

00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:20.519
unfortunately we happen to work
 

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:22.610
unfortunately we happen to work
someplace where we didn't the two of us

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620
someplace where we didn't the two of us
 

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.720
someplace where we didn't the two of us
at least didn't have to worry about the

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:23.730
at least didn't have to worry about the
 

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.110
at least didn't have to worry about the
cost of it somebody above us did I don't

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120
cost of it somebody above us did I don't
 

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.610
cost of it somebody above us did I don't
know we maybe just didn't tell them what

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620
know we maybe just didn't tell them what
 

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.990
know we maybe just didn't tell them what
we were doing I don't know exactly how

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000
we were doing I don't know exactly how
 

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.460
we were doing I don't know exactly how
it all worked out I don't think

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:31.470
it all worked out I don't think
 

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.529
it all worked out I don't think
anybody's added up how much did this

00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539
anybody's added up how much did this
 

00:31:33.539 --> 00:31:35.359
anybody's added up how much did this
cost I don't know if there's a way to

00:31:35.359 --> 00:31:35.369
cost I don't know if there's a way to
 

00:31:35.369 --> 00:31:36.169
cost I don't know if there's a way to
add that up

00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179
add that up
 

00:31:36.179 --> 00:31:40.249
add that up
and I certainly know that we are not

00:31:40.249 --> 00:31:40.259
and I certainly know that we are not
 

00:31:40.259 --> 00:31:42.169
and I certainly know that we are not
going to try to write stories to make

00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179
going to try to write stories to make
 

00:31:42.179 --> 00:31:44.330
going to try to write stories to make
money you know we see this in a much

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340
money you know we see this in a much
 

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.759
money you know we see this in a much
broader picture than that you know if

00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:46.769
broader picture than that you know if
 

00:31:46.769 --> 00:31:49.129
broader picture than that you know if
you had to go out and sell a story to

00:31:49.129 --> 00:31:49.139
you had to go out and sell a story to
 

00:31:49.139 --> 00:31:51.499
you had to go out and sell a story to
make money for the New York Times most

00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:51.509
make money for the New York Times most
 

00:31:51.509 --> 00:32:06.590
make money for the New York Times most
of our stories would not get written so

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600
of our stories would not get written so
 

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.450
of our stories would not get written so
the lessons learned i think extend

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460
the lessons learned i think extend
 

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.850
the lessons learned i think extend
beyond the graphics department or the

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860
beyond the graphics department or the
 

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.980
beyond the graphics department or the
video desk of the photo desk to the

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:12.990
video desk of the photo desk to the
 

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.779
video desk of the photo desk to the
newsroom generally i mean it goes back

00:32:14.779 --> 00:32:14.789
newsroom generally i mean it goes back
 

00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:16.609
newsroom generally i mean it goes back
to what John was saying or he's now

00:32:16.609 --> 00:32:16.619
to what John was saying or he's now
 

00:32:16.619 --> 00:32:18.409
to what John was saying or he's now
thinking about stories a little bit

00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419
thinking about stories a little bit
 

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:22.639
thinking about stories a little bit
differently I think the project and some

00:32:22.639 --> 00:32:22.649
differently I think the project and some
 

00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:25.549
differently I think the project and some
of the some similar projects that we've

00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559
of the some similar projects that we've
 

00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:28.330
of the some similar projects that we've
done since then have caused reporters to

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:28.340
done since then have caused reporters to
 

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.570
done since then have caused reporters to
want to be involved in the creation of

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:31.580
want to be involved in the creation of
 

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:36.169
want to be involved in the creation of
visual elements and and has you know

00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179
visual elements and and has you know
 

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:37.970
visual elements and and has you know
generated discussion around the newsroom

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980
generated discussion around the newsroom
 

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.669
generated discussion around the newsroom
about how you know the value of those

00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679
about how you know the value of those
 

00:32:40.679 --> 00:32:43.759
about how you know the value of those
elements and so I think the the lessons

00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:43.769
elements and so I think the the lessons
 

00:32:43.769 --> 00:32:45.409
elements and so I think the the lessons
learn are just sort of shift in the

00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419
learn are just sort of shift in the
 

00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:47.090
learn are just sort of shift in the
culture the newsroom so there's not

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100
culture the newsroom so there's not
 

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.730
culture the newsroom so there's not
we're still obviously going to be

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740
we're still obviously going to be
 

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.489
we're still obviously going to be
generating thousands and thousands of

00:32:52.489 --> 00:32:52.499
generating thousands and thousands of
 

00:32:52.499 --> 00:32:56.539
generating thousands and thousands of
words near times but you know I think

00:32:56.539 --> 00:32:56.549
words near times but you know I think
 

00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:57.739
words near times but you know I think
there's going to be a lot more

00:32:57.739 --> 00:32:57.749
there's going to be a lot more
 

00:32:57.749 --> 00:32:59.779
there's going to be a lot more
consideration sort of given to the value

00:32:59.779 --> 00:32:59.789
consideration sort of given to the value
 

00:32:59.789 --> 00:33:03.499
consideration sort of given to the value
of visual sort of interactive journalism

00:33:03.499 --> 00:33:03.509
of visual sort of interactive journalism
 

00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:07.899
of visual sort of interactive journalism
going forward yes you just talked about

00:33:07.899 --> 00:33:07.909
going forward yes you just talked about
 

00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:10.310
going forward yes you just talked about
you just said that you don't write

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320

stories to make money which is kind of a
 

00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:13.700
stories to make money which is kind of a
comfortable position you put yourself

comfortable position you put yourself
 

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.710

and because if small newsrooms want to

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720

they need to make money and I wondered
 

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:22.519
they need to make money and I wondered

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840
revenue because I think advertisement
 

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.989

would kind of decreased quality of the
piece and so I mean there's the model of

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360
piece and so I mean there's the model of
 

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.580
piece and so I mean there's the model of
the edifice has for you pay per article

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:36.590
the edifice has for you pay per article
 

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.759
the edifice has for you pay per article
what other ways could you think of a

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:40.769
what other ways could you think of a
 

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:43.489
what other ways could you think of a
what do you think or possible to make

00:33:43.489 --> 00:33:43.499
what do you think or possible to make
 

00:33:43.499 --> 00:33:47.539
what do you think or possible to make
those stories on generate money and do

00:33:47.539 --> 00:33:47.549
those stories on generate money and do
 

00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:49.570
those stories on generate money and do
to finance them

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:49.580
to finance them
 

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.160
to finance them
yeah my point about the money I want to

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:52.170

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.840
yeah my point about the money I want to
be clear is that I don't think we would

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:53.850
be clear is that I don't think we would
 

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.340
be clear is that I don't think we would
be in a good position if we set out to

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:55.350
