00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.520
Meeting other game developers

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.080
you see how much raw passsion

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.920
there is out there.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920
You just want to share your

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.000
knowledge and soak up the

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.720
inspiration.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.280
Playing games is very different

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.360
from making games.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.360
We had to learn a lot and it was

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360
a lot of hard work.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.880
You have to keep working on the

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.000
same game for a long time.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.160
You have to learn how to code.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.720
It's not just dreaming and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.680
playing games.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.560
Hi my name is Gerald Tock

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.400
and i'm the CEO of Inzen Studio

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.080
in Singapore.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.200
Dark Dot is a hybrid game

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.760
of sorts.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.280
It's a classic "shoot'em up"

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.800
but instead of just fast paced

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.640
movement, we slow it down by

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.360
having a tactical element that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880
uses shape manipulation.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.200
Indie Developers Day taught us

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.600
how to tie our ideas

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.440
to the data

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.840
and really dig deep into

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.640
understanding how users respond

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.440
to changes.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.040
Just recently, analytics helped

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.040
us to test out a new

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.040
store listing

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.160
which increased our downloads

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.400
by 25 percent.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.560
Being able to fully understand

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.480
what the platform offers

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.320
connects us better with

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.160
our players.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.120
Now we have more than 200,000

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.920
downloads, and the editor's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.720
choice award.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.640
My name is Yogie Aditya

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.560
and i'm the CTO of Niji Games

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.680
based in Yogjakarta.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.760
We knew we wanted to make a good

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.320
puzzle game.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.760
That was most important.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.000
after many months we built a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.280
game we love playing

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.520
and launched it on Google Play.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.720
Everybody thought Cute Munchies

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.280
was great.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.240
We were getting downloads and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.920
5 star reviews, but nobody would

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.000
keep playing the game.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.200
Google told us about how to give

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.520
the user reasons to play longer

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.320
and more often.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.320
They showed us how to implement

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.880
the game save feature and the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.520
Google Play game services.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.440
We tried to optimize the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080
store listings and the icons

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.440
the downloads increased

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.520
93 percent and the revenue

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.560
increased by 51 percent.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.360
and user retention improved in

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360
the first week.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.720
Now we can think about the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.440
future, about making more

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
complex games.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.880
My name is Vinh Nguyen

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.160
and my friends and i make games

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.360
for V-Games in Vietnam.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.320
It took 2 years to develop

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.960
Gungun.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.000
We were building the game we

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.880
wanted to play.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.840
But we ended up with almost

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840
no revenue.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.280
We thought about building

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.960
another game, but what if

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.320
we failed again.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.080
We decided to keep trying

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.360
we had to make it work.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.720
We met a mentor from Google

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120
he said our game was great.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.520
but we needed to build in ways

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.320
to make money.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.680
We added a VIP package for

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.200
paid users, and allowed users to

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.960
buy any mobiles and characters

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960
directly.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.840
Right away, our revenue

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.760
increased 100 percent in

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760
one day.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.280
We ended up number 2

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280
on the Play website.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.080
It's the passion of our staff

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.800
that comes through

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800
for us always.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.040
We have cosplayers, artists and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.640
playful spirits in the company

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.520
that inspire our

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.640
design philosophy.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.120
Don't worry about being indie

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.080
If you try and have passion,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.000
you will find a way.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.880
We are playing a bigger

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.520
game now.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.920
But we are still playing.
