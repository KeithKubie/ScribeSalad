00:00:00.805 --> 00:00:04.744
Who do you look up to?

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.084
I definitely look up to people

00:00:08.084 --> 00:00:12.087
who are being very good mentors in my career,

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:13.165
in different companies,

00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:15.422
in previous experiences.

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:18.485
So, today, like I did in the past,

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:23.782
always people that were very truthful to their principles,

00:00:23.782 --> 00:00:26.369
people who were very willing to teach,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.761
to give ideas,

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.832
that were, really,

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:31.512
I think people who really understood

00:00:31.512 --> 00:00:32.766
that being a good manager

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.736
is not about being able to develop good work,

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.436
but it's about developing good resources.

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:42.464
So, I think one of the biggest achievements for a manager

00:00:42.464 --> 00:00:44.527
is not so much reaching your goals

00:00:44.527 --> 00:00:46.645
in terms of objectives and budgets,

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.767
but really the ability to develop a good team.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:52.384
To develop resources is something that is invaluable.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:55.521
Nowadays, talents are something difficult to find

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.189
and difficult to retain.

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:58.457
And so, if you have a manager

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.772
that is highly successful in this role,

00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:01.997
I think you have a person

00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:04.462
who is really valuable to an organization.
