00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:02.313
- [Voiceover] So in the last video

00:00:02.313 --> 00:00:03.937
we started working on the analysis

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:07.431
of an RLC circuit that
had a forcing function,

00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:10.075
and the math for doing
that gets really hard.

00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:12.578
And so what we decided to
do was see what happens

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:16.249
if we limit ourselves to
using just sinusoidal inputs,

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.191
inputs that look like sines and cosines.

00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:20.824
So I wanna continue the introduction

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:23.346
to the sinusoidal analysis technique

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:27.513
and just give you a preview of
where we're headed with that.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.996
So when we make this limitation
to sinusoidal inputs,

00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:36.579
there's a big prize at the end.

00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:41.698
And the prize is that the
differential equations

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.830
turn into algebra.

00:00:49.398 --> 00:00:50.942
That's the reason we're doing this.

00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:53.375
It just basically because really simple,

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:55.626
just like the resistor
circuits that we used to do,

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:56.693
they were all algebra.

00:00:56.693 --> 00:00:57.982
There was no calculus.

00:00:57.982 --> 00:01:00.246
We're gonna turn these
kinds of differential

00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:03.102
equation circuits into algebra.

00:01:03.102 --> 00:01:05.159
So if we're able to convert this circuit

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.377
into an algebra problem instead
of a differential equation,

00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:11.369
that means we could use
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.732
We could use Kirchhoff's Current Law.

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:15.899
We could use node voltage.

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:23.708
The node voltage method or
the mesh current method.

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:26.639
Just like we did for resistors.

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.133
And this whole set of techniques then

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.186
automatically gets applied to circuits

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:33.378
that have inductors
and capacitors in them,

00:01:33.378 --> 00:01:35.506
just like we learned how
to do with resistors.

00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:37.733
It's a major simplification.

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.769
So let me draw this circuit
over here again real quick,

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:42.006
the one we were looking at earlier.

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:42.839
We have V.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:46.120
We have an inductor here.

00:01:47.098 --> 00:01:50.015
We have a resistor and a capacitor.

00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:55.808
So for V, in, we're gonna limit ourselves

00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:57.938
to just sinusoids.

00:01:57.938 --> 00:01:59.884
So that means that the input
is gonna look something

00:01:59.884 --> 00:02:02.551
like A cosine, omega t plus phi.

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:09.384
Phi is a phase angle.

00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:11.517
And we're gonna represent this in a way

00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:12.350
that looks like this.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.989
This is gonna get transformed or changed

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.478
into something that looks like this.

00:02:16.478 --> 00:02:19.740
It's gonna be called
A at the angle of phi.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.740
This is an angle symbol.

00:02:22.927 --> 00:02:25.442
And this is referred to as a phasor.

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:28.442
This has a name this way of writing.

00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:34.182
This way of writing down sinusoids.

00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:35.556
If I have a sinusoid that looks like

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.012
this is a function of
time, I could write it

00:02:37.012 --> 00:02:41.179
as a phasor where I say V
equals A at an angle of phi

00:02:43.492 --> 00:02:46.342
and understood is that
there's this omega t term,

00:02:46.342 --> 00:02:49.089
this cosine omega t term nearby.

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:50.357
So the other thing we're
gonna learn about is

00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:52.607
how to transform a circuit.

00:02:56.917 --> 00:03:00.723
So we can use this sinusoidal
steady state analysis.

00:03:00.723 --> 00:03:03.554
So the inductor, it
gets transformed from L,

00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:06.011
instead we write down SL,

00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.820
where S is that same natural frequency.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.878
Whenever we have a resistor,
we write down just R,

00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:15.550
just like we usually do, and
whenever we have a capacitor,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.217
we write one over SC, and again,

00:03:19.773 --> 00:03:22.387
this S is the same thing as we had before,

00:03:22.387 --> 00:03:24.220
the natural frequency.

00:03:26.812 --> 00:03:29.421
And in a future video, we'll justify

00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:33.194
why we could make this
transformation and what this means.

00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:35.938
The big payoff here is I'm
gonna write a KVL equation

00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:38.286
around this loop and watch what happens.

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:41.509
Watch how easy this is, it's amazing.

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.418
So let me real quick I'm gonna just

00:03:43.418 --> 00:03:45.190
indicate signs of these voltages.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.943
There's the inductor voltage.

00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:48.662
There's the resistor voltage.

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:50.672
There's the capacitor voltage.

00:03:50.672 --> 00:03:52.998
And here's the voltage on V, in.

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.107
Like that, we'll give it that polarity.

00:03:55.107 --> 00:03:58.088
It's not obvious yet, but I
get to use these quantities,

00:03:58.088 --> 00:04:00.237
SL and one over SC,

00:04:00.237 --> 00:04:03.103
just like they were a
resistance value in Ohm's Law.

00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:04.811
And watch how this happens.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.795
I'm just gonna write KVL around this loop.

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:11.128
And what I get is that V, in

00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:17.295
is equal to the voltage
across the inductor

00:04:17.295 --> 00:04:20.173
plus the resistor plus the capacitor,

00:04:20.173 --> 00:04:21.420
and I can write it like this.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.503
I can write SL times i plus R times i

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.502
plus one over SC times i.

00:04:36.337 --> 00:04:37.861
And if I can write that again,

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.377
I'll write that one more time,

00:04:40.377 --> 00:04:42.210
it's i times SL plus R

00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:49.683
plus one over SC.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.365
All right, that was a
straightforward application

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:55.565
of Kirchhoff's Law.

00:04:55.565 --> 00:04:56.866
Now if we look at this expression here,

00:04:56.866 --> 00:04:58.586
look at this right here,

00:04:58.586 --> 00:05:00.533
this is the characteristic equation.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:04.450
We just wrote down the
characteristic equation.

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:09.175
Characteristic.

00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:16.534
We just wrote down the
characteristic equation

00:05:16.534 --> 00:05:20.701
of this circuit using these
transformed components.

00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:23.696
Now what I wanna do next,

00:05:23.696 --> 00:05:26.369
we're gonna actually get a new concept.

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:27.666
I can write an equation like this.

00:05:27.666 --> 00:05:30.166
I can say V, in, divided by i,

00:05:31.554 --> 00:05:34.821
I'm just gonna take i over
this side of the equation here,

00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:37.654
equals SL plus R plus one over SC.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.217
This is an interesting idea.

00:05:44.217 --> 00:05:46.592
Here is a ratio, right here.

00:05:46.592 --> 00:05:49.938
This is a ratio of voltage to current.

00:05:49.938 --> 00:05:53.016
Now if this was just a plain resistor,

00:05:53.016 --> 00:05:57.598
V over i for a plain ole
resistor, is what, is R.

00:05:57.598 --> 00:06:00.806
That's an expression of Ohm's Law.

00:06:00.806 --> 00:06:03.986
So now I have another expression over here

00:06:03.986 --> 00:06:05.547
for something that's written in terms

00:06:05.547 --> 00:06:08.735
of my component values and this natural,

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:12.138
this frequency S that's going on in here,

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:15.771
and this is gonna lead us to
a general idea of resistance

00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:17.854
that is called impedance.

00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:24.999
So that's what this is right here.

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.662
This is this ratio of voltage to current

00:06:27.662 --> 00:06:31.745
and the symbol usually
used for impedance is a Z.

00:06:34.137 --> 00:06:37.419
So this is where we're headed
over the next several videos.

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:38.993
To justify what we're doing here,

00:06:38.993 --> 00:06:40.298
we need to go through some steps,

00:06:40.298 --> 00:06:42.503
and so what we're gonna do
in the next couple of videos

00:06:42.503 --> 00:06:45.003
is we're gonna do some review.

00:06:47.872 --> 00:06:49.423
So here are the things we're gonna review.

00:06:49.423 --> 00:06:52.506
We're gonna review some trigonometry.

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:56.896
So cosine and sine and those functions

00:06:57.905 --> 00:06:59.272
and what they mean, especially

00:06:59.272 --> 00:07:01.505
when they're functions of time.

00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:04.922
We're also gonna review Euler's identity.

00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:13.431
Euler's identity is important,

00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:15.340
because it's the thing that allows us

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.266
to relate e to the jx and we
get some sort of relationship

00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:22.933
to sine of x and cosine of x.

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:29.457
And if you remember when we were solving

00:07:29.457 --> 00:07:32.697
differential equations,
this was always the form

00:07:32.697 --> 00:07:34.467
that was the easiest solution

00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:36.824
to come up with, e to the something.

00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:39.468
And if we're limiting
ourselves to sines and cosines

00:07:39.468 --> 00:07:42.428
for inputs, we need to have a way to make

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:44.415
a really easy way to solve equations.

00:07:44.415 --> 00:07:47.141
So Euler's identity is the trigger

00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:49.308
that allows us to do that.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.492
Now when we use Euler's identity,

00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:54.105
we're gonna get this little complex number

00:07:54.105 --> 00:07:55.293
that keeps coming up.

00:07:55.293 --> 00:07:58.460
So we're gonna review complex numbers.

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:08.487
That's the three review topics.

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:12.931
And then we're gonna move
on and we're gonna do

00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:17.098
after that, we'll define
something like these phasors.

00:08:19.322 --> 00:08:22.489
Then we'll look at the transformation.

00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:31.155
So that's SL and R and one over SC.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.143
Phasor is the idea
where we change a cosine

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:41.149
into something at a phase angle.

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:45.316
And then finally what we get
to do is we get to solve.

00:08:48.018 --> 00:08:49.058
So that's the sequence of events.

00:08:49.058 --> 00:08:52.231
That's what's coming up over
the next couple of videos.

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.514
It's a really powerful technique

00:08:53.514 --> 00:08:56.180
for handling some very
complicated circuits

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.677
and getting it to do what we want.
