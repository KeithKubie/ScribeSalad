a hint of comedy or something but I mean
it does take it so very seriously and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
it does take it so very seriously and
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.039
it does take it so very seriously and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
kind of moving a little bit my seats
 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.380

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.810
which I mean it's I get it and I don't
think it's necessarily directly trying

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
think it's necessarily directly trying
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730
think it's necessarily directly trying
to address the Holocaust this is what

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
to address the Holocaust this is what
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919
to address the Holocaust this is what

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
you go as a visitor old district which
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.320
you go as a visitor old district which
is like you know you see the bodies on

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
is like you know you see the bodies on
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.860
is like you know you see the bodies on
the ground

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
the ground
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.960
the ground
and stuff I mean we've seen whatever

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970
and stuff I mean we've seen whatever
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.270
and stuff I mean we've seen whatever
Terminator and stuff like that is

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.759
Terminator and stuff like that is
something about this one did seem

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769
something about this one did seem
 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.380
something about this one did seem
particularly unsettling and maybe it's

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
particularly unsettling and maybe it's
 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.210
particularly unsettling and maybe it's
just me maybe like nobody else thought

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220
just me maybe like nobody else thought
 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.400
just me maybe like nobody else thought
about it but for me it was like really

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410
about it but for me it was like really
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.250
about it but for me it was like really
uncomfortable um but again it's trying

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260
uncomfortable um but again it's trying
 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.080
uncomfortable um but again it's trying
to make you gritty and real it's I I

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090
to make you gritty and real it's I I
 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.910

don't think they're trying to like say

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920
don't think they're trying to like say
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.860
don't think they're trying to like say
anything or be in bad taste or anything

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
anything or be in bad taste or anything
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.690
anything or be in bad taste or anything
like that at all I think it's more just

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
like that at all I think it's more just
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.900
like that at all I think it's more just
to be thing yeah for some reason just

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910
to be thing yeah for some reason just
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.820
to be thing yeah for some reason just
really made me uncomfortable but it

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830
really made me uncomfortable but it
 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.680
really made me uncomfortable but it
really sits with her just looking over

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
really sits with her just looking over
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.660
really sits with her just looking over
these bodies and the impact it has on

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
these bodies and the impact it has on
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.339
these bodies and the impact it has on
her and that's kind of the best way to

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349
her and that's kind of the best way to
 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.770
her and that's kind of the best way to
sell up the film a lot of it is just

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780
sell up the film a lot of it is just
 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.220
sell up the film a lot of it is just
reacting to stuff it's you don't see a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230
reacting to stuff it's you don't see a
 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.080
reacting to stuff it's you don't see a
lot of what's going on above it's more

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090
lot of what's going on above it's more
 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.960
lot of what's going on above it's more
than reacting down below which in most

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970
than reacting down below which in most
 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.610
than reacting down below which in most
movies I would find really boring and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
movies I would find really boring and
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.140
movies I would find really boring and
I'd be like why are we seeing the action

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150
I'd be like why are we seeing the action
 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.089
I'd be like why are we seeing the action
why are we seeing all this stuff but I

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099
why are we seeing all this stuff but I
 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.559
why are we seeing all this stuff but I
think because the acting it is strong

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569
think because the acting it is strong
 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.710
think because the acting it is strong

at again from the angle is one of the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
at again from the angle is one of the
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.830
at again from the angle is one of the
reasons I enjoy these movies they're

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840

happen and with this one it's like that
 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.580
happen and with this one it's like that
would've happened if they cut like maybe

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590
would've happened if they cut like maybe
 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.860
would've happened if they cut like maybe
five minutes earlier and people probably

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870
five minutes earlier and people probably
 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.629
five minutes earlier and people probably

thinking myself and cut but then it
 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.170
thinking myself and cut but then it
keeps going and it doesn't ruin anything

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180
keeps going and it doesn't ruin anything
 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.300
keeps going and it doesn't ruin anything
but the same time I'm thinking like oh
