00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.840
All right, problem 79.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.060
What is the domain of
the function shown

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.920
on the graph below?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.610
That sounds like fancy word.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.380
But a function is just a rule.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.550
It's just a rule that
maps from one set

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.690
of numbers to another.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.510
And the set of numbers that it
maps from is the domain.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.210
And the set of numbers that
it maps to is the range.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.080
So if this is the set of numbers
of the domain, this is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.310
set of numbers of the range, the
function tells us how do

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.090
we get from this number, some
place in domain, to that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.470
number, some place
in the range.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.180
So in general, the domain is all
the numbers for which this

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.900
mapping, or this function,
is defined.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.840
OK, so let's see, so the
domain is where is this

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.090
function defined?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.440
And in general, when you plot it
on the xy-axis, the domain

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.710
is all of the x values that
you're defined over and the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.100
range is all the y values.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.400
So the function is a mapping
from x to y.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700
So let's see where it's defined
when x is equal to 4.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.030
It tells us we're mapping from
x is equal to 4 to y is equal

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.600
to negative 1.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.710
So it's defined for x is equal
to 4, for x is equal to 5, for

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.710
x is equal to 2, and it's
defined for x is equal to 1.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.360
So it's defined for all
of those numbers.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.320
That's the domain.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.590
This function is not defined.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.540
We don't know what happens when
x is equal to minus 2.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.800
It's not defined.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.590
It doesn't tell us what
y equals here.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.300
So these are the only
numbers for which

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.330
this function is defined.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.290
It tells us that 4 maps to
negative 1, that 5 maps to

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.850
negative 2, that 2 maps
to minus 5, and that 1

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.800
maps to minus 4.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.920
That's all it tells us.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.245
And this is actually
the range.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.080
And that's the domain.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.530
So let's see, 4, 5, 2, 1.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.910
This is the domain.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.919
That's the set of all
numbers for which

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.980
this function is defined.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.580
This minus 1, 2, 5, and 4.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.590
This is the range right here.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.470
Choice B is the range.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.120
All right.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.062
I think we're on the
last problem.

00:02:23.062 --> 00:02:24.990
This is going to be a lot
of cutting and pasting.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.232
I don't know if it's
going to fit.

00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:29.210
I have to shrink it.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.876
OK, they say which of the
following is not a function?

00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:33.126
That's fascinating.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.410
OK, I copied it.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.240
And now I have pasted it.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.860
And it did all barely
fit on this page.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.780
So which is not a function?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.720
And remember, what I said
in the beginning.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.600
I don't have space below here.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.340
Let's think about what a
function is and then we could

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.850
look at the graph.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.760
So a function is a mapping
from one set to another.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.320
From set A to set B.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.470
Where A is the domain
and B is the range.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.300
And this is important thing to
realize about a function.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.460
So if this is set A, and if this
is set B, that for any

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.590
value in set A, it only maps
to one value in set B.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.900
You cannot have this.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.790
You can't have one value in set
A going to this value and

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.040
going to another value.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.010
So that would not make
it a function.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.590
If we say x is the domain, if
this is the set of all values

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.960
we can put into x, and this all
the set of values that can

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.600
go into y or that can be y,
then one value of x can't

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.210
produce two values of y.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.260
You can have it the
other way around.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.500
You could have two different
values of x producing the same

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.960
value of y.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.070
And we'll think about
what that is.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.490
That's completely valid.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.680
You could have two numbers.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.650
When x is equal to 2 and x is
equal to 7, you can still have

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.640
y equaling the same thing.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.700
Say this is x is equal to 5.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.280
X is equal to 5 could
be y is equal to 7.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.630
Or x is equal to 5 could
be y is equal to 8.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.360
We don't know that.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.860
So let's see.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.100
Let's think about how we can
visually think about this.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.800
For every value of x, we only
have one definition for y.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.010
And people often call that the
vertical line test. At no

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.460
point on this graph can I draw
a vertical line and it

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.580
intersects it twice.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.210
If a vertical intersects it
twice, that means for a given

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.800
value of x, this function
defines two different y's.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.890
Not going to happen.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.490
Now this function does
for any given y have

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.890
two different x's.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.930
Like that point and
that point.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.810
That's OK.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.850
That's completely fine.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.680
So for example, when x is equal
to minus 1.5 and x is

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.730
equal to 3, they point
to the same number.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.490
That's completely OK.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.990
As long as one of these
doesn't point to

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.390
two separate numbers.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.290
So that magenta is what that
first graph is doing.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.330
Same thing here, for any
given y we can have two

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.040
x's pointing to it.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.740
And they're just fine.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.200
That's completely fine
for a function.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.726
Now, we talk about function
inverses, well I don't want to

00:05:16.726 --> 00:05:17.730
get too complicated.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.460
That's completely fine.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.200
If we do the vertical line test,
at no point can we draw

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.020
vertical line and get, for any
given x, two separate y's.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.760
Same thing for here.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.080
Actually here, we have a
complete 1:1 mapping.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.560
For any given x,
there's one y.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.110
I think here it should be clear,
that if I were to draw

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:48.560
vertical line, let's say right
there, for x is equal to 1, it

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.840
has two definitions.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.520
Even better, for x is equal
to 0, y could be

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.250
minus 2 or plus 2.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.460
So that's the case
that we said.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.550
For x is equal to 0, it's
pointing to plus 2 and it's

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.500
pointing to minus 2.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.470
It's pointing to two different
values which you cannot have

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.070
in a function.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.310
For a function, for any
given x, you can only

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.650
define one y value.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.230
So this relation is
not a function.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.430
D.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.790
Next question.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.400
I think this is the last.
It's a page on its own.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.000
Oh, that was the
last question.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.320
Did I skip a problem?

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.560
See that was 80.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.190
That's it.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.030
We're all done.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.180
All right, see you soon.
