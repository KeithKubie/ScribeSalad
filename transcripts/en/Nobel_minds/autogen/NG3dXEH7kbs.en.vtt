00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
so it's easy to understand why they have
 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.410 align:start position:0%
so it's easy to understand why they have

sometimes it works the wrong way and
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.690 align:start position:0%
sometimes it works the wrong way and
