00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.969
Looking at this graphically, we might see

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.400
packets generated at a particular rate and the

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.510
packets might be received at slightly different

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.470
times, depending on network delay. These types of

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.590
delays are the types that we want to avoid when we playout, so if we

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.250
wait to receive several packets. And fill the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.220
buffer before we start playing, say to here.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.300
Then, we can have a playout schedule

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.439
that is smooth, regardless of the erratic arrival

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.790
times that may result from network delays. So

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.340
this playout delay or buffering allows the client

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.130
to achieve a smooth playout. Some delay

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.720
at the beginning of the playout is acceptable.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.600
Startup delays of a few seconds are things

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.430
that users can typically tolerate, but clients cannot

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.010
tolerate high variation in packet arrivals if the buffer starves or if there

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.150
aren't enough packets in the buffer. Similarly, small amount of loss or missing

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.250
data does not disrupt the playback but retransmitting a lost packet, might

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.290
actually take too long and result in delays or starvation of the playout buffer.
