00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:01.779
- [Voiceover] Alright, in
this video, we're talking

00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:06.144
about the document-based question, or DBQ,

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:09.863
section on the AP US History exam.

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:11.942
Now, this is one of two
main essays that are

00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:13.498
on the exam.

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.840
One is based on documents
that are provided to

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.743
you and the other is based
on your own knowledge

00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:21.323
of the subject.

00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:24.956
So you'll get 55 minutes
to do this portion of

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:27.998
the exam and it's
generally recommended that

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:30.936
you spend about 15 of
those minutes planning

00:00:30.936 --> 00:00:35.936
your answer and about 40 of those minutes

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:38.911
actually writing your answer.

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.408
Now your mileage might
differ, you might find that

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.514
you're someone who wants
to spend a little bit more

00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:46.022
time planning or your
somebody who can plan

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:48.076
really fast and write well.

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:50.841
In any event, you want to
go in with a plan about

00:00:50.841 --> 00:00:53.417
how much time you're going to spend on

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:56.239
each part so that you
don't get surprised at the

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.560
end of the period that
you still have a couple

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.653
paragraphs left to write
but you're out of time.

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:04.222
So for the DBQ section,
you're going to get a

00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:09.122
question that asks you
to analyze changes or

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:13.058
continuities over time,
something that really gets

00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:17.702
at the heart of how things
in history change over time.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:19.547
So unlike the short answer
questions, which are very

00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:23.867
specific about one period
in time, this is asking you

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:28.047
to take a broader look at
US history and write an

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:30.983
essay about one of its major themes.

00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:33.039
Let's take a look at this question.

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.346
Analyze major changes and
continuities in the social

00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:42.346
and economic experiences
of African Americans who

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.999
migrated from the South
to urban areas in the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:51.429
North in the period 1910 to 1930.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.720
Well that gives us a lot
of information about the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.994
kinds of things we should concentrate on.

00:01:56.994 --> 00:02:00.872
First, we're looking at
social history and economic

00:02:00.872 --> 00:02:05.872
history, we're looking
at African Americans, and

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.799
we're looking at this migration pattern.

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.571
This is the period of the
Great Migration, as they would

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:19.670
say, when many African
Americans who lived in

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.931
the South moved to the
North for new factory jobs

00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:26.856
in this time period
which certainly included

00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:28.361
World War I.

00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:32.452
And you can see from the
time frame that we're

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:36.238
talking about a fairly early
20th century time period

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:39.998
ending in 1930, so you don't
want to be talking about

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:42.053
the experiences of African
Americans in the Great

00:02:42.053 --> 00:02:44.980
Depression or in World War
II, or in the Civil Rights

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.417
Movement because that's much later.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.216
Now you might be able to
end on a note that shows

00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:52.978
your knowledge of what's
to come, but really for the

00:02:52.978 --> 00:02:56.578
meat of this essay, you
want to stick to the time

00:02:56.578 --> 00:02:58.458
period in question.

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.839
To answer this, we're
going to want to write an

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:05.839
essay and, at the very
least, I would go for your

00:03:07.016 --> 00:03:12.016
standard five paragraph
essay where you have an

00:03:12.112 --> 00:03:17.112
introductory statement,
introduction, which includes

00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:22.213
a strong thesis statement
and we'll get to how to

00:03:22.213 --> 00:03:24.790
write one of those soon.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.790
And then, three paragraphs
of body text, each that

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:34.577
is trying to prove a point
brought up in its topic

00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:38.873
sentence, and a conclusion,
which wraps up what

00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:41.608
you've said and ties it up with a bow.

00:03:43.332 --> 00:03:45.073
Now to do this, you're going to have to

00:03:45.073 --> 00:03:49.798
consider and analyze about seven to nine

00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:53.733
primary documents, which
are provided for you

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.452
by the exam.

00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:59.573
You should include all,
or maybe all but one, of

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.395
those primary documents in your answer.

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:04.369
Now you don't have to
go into detail about all

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.630
of them, but you should
include analysis of some

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.309
of the arguments, some of
the biases, and some of

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:17.291
the larger ideas behind
some of those documents.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.635
You should also be prepared to give some

00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:23.769
outside information that
shows that you really know

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:26.989
the material and can give context to it.

00:04:32.174 --> 00:04:34.867
So that's what these questions are about

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:37.178
and how you should go
about answering them.

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:39.268
In the next video, we'll
start looking at primary

00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:42.703
documents and getting ready
to make a thesis statement.
