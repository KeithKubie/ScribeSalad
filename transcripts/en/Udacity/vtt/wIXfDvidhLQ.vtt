That's it! We're done! Great job finishing the class. You

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.710
might be wondering, what should I try next? I'd encourage you

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.460
to have a look at other courses in the data

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.980
science track here at Udacity. You might consider taking Intro to

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.360
Data Science, Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce or maybe Intro

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.290
to Statistics. If you enjoyed this course, pretty much anything in

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.210
the data science track is going to be of interest to

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.380
you. If you'd like to learn more about MongoDB, we offer

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.410
a number of introductory and advanced online courses

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.900
on our own platform, at MongoDB University. These courses

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.000
cover all the details of MongoDB that we couldn't

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.370
quite fit into this course. For example, there you

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.170
will see just exactly how we scale MongoDB

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.860
to big data problems. These courses are completely free,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.380
and taught in a style very much like the

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.567
one you just finished. Take a look at university.mongodb.com.
