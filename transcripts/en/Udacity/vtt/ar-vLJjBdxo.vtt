00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.990
When you have an expression with like
terms, you can combine the like terms.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.900
Let's use an example.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.150
If Nathalie buys seven pineapples for
x dollars,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.010
we can express the cost
of pineapples as 7x.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.850
Then Nathalie goes out and
buys ten more pineapples and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.705
the cost of the ten
new pineapples is 10x.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.731
We can then express the cost of
all the pineapples as 7x + 10x.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.540
How else can we express
the cost of the pineapples?

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.170
Please pick one.
