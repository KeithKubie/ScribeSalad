00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.340
&gt;&gt; Welcome, everyone, to one of
our Thursdays at three talks.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.630
It's so nice to see
all of you here.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.940
It is our pleasure to
introduce Eileen Botting

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.640
to the rare books division.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.640
So, as many of you know,
we hold a lot of events

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.960
in the rare books division.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.850
But it's somewhat unique,
I think, to host a talk

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.920
that not only speaks
to our holdings

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.760
in the rare books division,
but also directly points

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.970
to material that, right now,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.760
is so readily accessible
to the public.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.080
So Hannah Mather Crocker's
"Observation on the Real Rights

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.610
of Women," published in
Boston in 1818, the first book

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.900
on women's rights published by
an American, can be accessed

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.220
in its entirety on
the library's website.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.720
That's very exciting, right?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.070
And in many ways, this
liberates the text, right?

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.540
Both, sort of, figuratively
and literally,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.170
from its archival
boundaries, right?

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.830
And making it freely available
to that next generation

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.790
of feminist philosophers.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.910
And that's very exciting.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.290
So, appropriately, today
we're going to be talking

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.450
about those questions of
reception and influence

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.630
of the long, and complex, and
sometimes controversial history

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.870
that comes along with the
history of women's rights.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.050
Professor Botting is here to
talk about all of this today.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.510
And I can honestly think

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.490
of no one who's better
suited for this talk.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.550
Dr. Botting is a professor
of political science

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.870
at the University Of Notre Dame.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.270
Her many publications reflect
her profound commitment

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.280
to using the history
of political science

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.960
to engage questions, important
questions, of human rights,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.890
of women's rights,
of children's rights.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.810
And so her books include,
"Mary Shelley and the Rights

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.140
of the Child: Political
Philosophy

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.230
in Frankenstein," from 2017.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.020
"Wollstonecraft, Mill, and
Women's Human Rights," 2016.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.750
"Family Feuds: Wollstonecraft,
Burke, and Rousseau

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.950
on the Transformation of
the Family," from 2007.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.870
Dr. Botting also has written
an intimidating amount

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.000
of articles and book chapters.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.600
And if I may, my favorite
is from the Journal

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.970
of International
Political Theory, from 2016,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.660
"Women's Human Rights
May be Unicorns,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.360
but They Can Fight
Wicked Witches."

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.220
So several of these articles
have won prestigious awards

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.150
from institutions such as,
the Society for the Study

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.620
of American Women Writers
and the Okin-Young Award

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.040
in Feminist Political Theory.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.090
So again, we are delighted to
have her here with us today.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.940
So please help me to officially
welcome Dr. Eileen Botting

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.380
to speak on why Hannah
Mather Crocker's "Observation

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.510
on the Real Rights of
Women" matters at 200.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:48.060
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.420
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting: I
wanted to see how good you are.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.390
So, the topic of my talk is
why Crocker's "Observation

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.880
on the Real Rights of
Women" matters at 200.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.890
And to answer this
question, I think I need

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.700
to tell you a little
bit about why I came

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.340
to study Hannah Mather Crocker,
and why she's come to matter

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.300
so much to me as a scholar
of feminism in America.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.900
I became interested in
the American tradition

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.930
of women's rights advocacy
in graduate school,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.960
at Yale University, where
I was studying for my PhD

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.880
in political science
with my good friend

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.140
and colleague Colleen Shogan
of the Library of Congress.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.550
Professor Roger Smith
of the Yale Department

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.850
of Political Science
taught a course

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.760
on American political thought

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.050
in which we read
women's rights advocates

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.960
like Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
and Susan B. Anthony,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.910
the Grimke sisters,
Katherine Beecher, and so on.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.700
And I was struck by how these
women made arguments strikingly

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.750
similar to Mary Wollstonecraft,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.830
who is the topic
of my dissertation.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.350
Mary Wollstonecraft,
as you know,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.240
was an Anglo-Irish women's
rights advocate from London,

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.490
who had published the first
internationally renowned

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.470
treatise on women's rights
in 1792, "A Vindication

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.310
of the Rights of Women."

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.320
So after I had completed my
dissertation on Wollstonecraft,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.630
Burke, and Rousseau's
theories of the family,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.190
I moved on to study the question

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.380
of Wollstonecraft's
philosophical impact

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.420
in the United States.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.490
And among those women that
I discovered were pupils

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.770
of Wollstonecraft, to
use a phrase coined

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.350
by Abigail Adams, no less.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.200
Were women like Judith
Sargent Murray,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:46.670
who wrote a very early essay
on women's equality to men,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.220
that was published in
her Gleaner of 1798.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.770
And also Hannah Mather Crocker,

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.200
who published the first book
length philosophical treatise

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.840
on women's rights
in 1818, in Boston.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.060
I was shocked to learn that the
author of America's first book,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.100
or treatise on women's
rights was almost unknown,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.100
even in feminist scholarship.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.400
In fact, one of the
only scholars

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.170
to have highlighted Crocker's
achievement was Roger Smith

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.000
in his 1997 book,
"Civic Ideals."

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.770
So who was Hannah
Mather Crocker?

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.670
She was born in 1752
near North Square,

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.370
in Boston's North
End neighborhood.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.560
Her family home on Moon
Court was around the corner

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.630
from Paul Revere's house and
the Second Church of Boston.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.440
So if you've been to
the Paul Revere house,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.730
you're in her neck of the woods.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.480
And the Second Church of
Boston no longer exists,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.170
but there's a placard in the
square there that you can see.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.130
And this was the
Congregationalist Church

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.170
of her forefathers,
Increase and Cotton Mather,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.400
who are pictured here.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.820
She identified as
the fifth generation

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.850
of Congregationalist clerics.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.040
And political leaders born
of the American branch

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.370
of the Mather family, she gave

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.700
to the American Antiquarian
Society, in 1815,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.680
an infant's high
chair, pictured here.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.680
She claimed that
seven generations

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.190
of the Mather family
had sat in it,

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.640
beginning with Richard Mather,
the father of Increase Mather.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.140
But later scholarship has shown
that the chair was likely made

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.380
in America, not England,
in the 17th century.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.030
So it is more likely that
five generations, only five,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.560
of Mathers and Crockers,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.390
beginning with Increase's son
Cotton, pictured in center here,

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.350
sat in the chair from
the late 17th century

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.560
through the early 19th century.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.600
Crocker bore 10 children
to Joseph Crocker,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.610
a Revolutionary War veteran.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.620
And seven lived to adulthood.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.960
Some of her grandchildren,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.550
she wrote in her unpublished
Reminiscences, in the 1820s,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.760
sat in the Mather high
chair before she gave it

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.210
to the American Antiquarian
Society.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.490
So it's quite a touching
art object for her

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.400
to symbolically bestow
to the AAS.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.290
Which at the time, as you
know, with an all-male society.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.320
So it takes on even deeper
symbolic feminist resonance.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.260
We think about her as
a woman, as a mother,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.570
giving over this art
object that represents

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.070
at least five generations
of her family.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.490
Now Crocker's mother
was a Hutchinson.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.630
She was the sister of the
Royal Governor of Massachusetts

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.630
in the run-up to the
American Revolution.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.170
He's pictured here.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.660
And so Crocker had Loyalist
ties through that wing

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.210
of the family, the
Hutchinson wing.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.230
But her father was a Mather,
the son of Cotton Mather,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.260
the famed Puritan minister.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.350
And Samuel Mather, her
father, was a strong supporter

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.800
of the Revolutionary cause.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.590
Crocker's own political
sympathies were squarely

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.950
on the side of the
Revolutionary patriots.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.360
In her Reminiscences and
Traditions of Boston,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.610
which I co-edited and published
with my former graduate student,

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:31.330
Sarah L. Houser, 2011,
she describes herself

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.570
as a Revolutionary
patriot, smuggling papers

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.610
across the Charles
River from her father

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.010
to General Joseph
Warren, pictured here.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:46.680
Joseph Warren was a
Revolutionary War hero,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.770
who would die in the Battle of
Bunker Hill the next morning

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:58.150
after Crocker supposedly
delivered these papers

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.390
on behalf of her father.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.260
Now this story may have
been inflated for effect

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.390
by the elderly Crocker,
who wrote her Reminiscences

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.840
in the 1820s, when
she was in her 60s.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.200
But the symbolic point
of this story is clear.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.680
Crocker wishes to
represent women

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.440
of the Revolutionary
generation as more than capable

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.170
of the taking up the task
of republican citizenship,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.150
including putting their safety
on the line for the sake

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.750
of preserving the flame
of liberty that had swept

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.280
over the American colonies.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.130
After enduring the increasingly
oppressive and unfair trade

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.030
and taxation policies
of the British

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.980
since the mid-18th century.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.760
Crocker consistently represented
herself and other women

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.550
as capable and deserving
of citizenship.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.650
She also suggested, in
sometimes subtle prose,

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.580
that to deny women's
full citizenship was

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.930
to render illegitimate the
American republic and its roots

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.080
in the revolutionary
struggle for equal rights

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.410
and liberty for each and all.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.720
Raised a Congregationalist,
Crocker viewed all souls

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.230
as equal, and made in the
image of their rational God,

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.500
whose universal and
rational moral law,

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.800
they were obliged to follow.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.710
On the title page
of the Observations,

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.370
she used a quote
from Genesis 2:23.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.190
As a biblical para-text
to frame her argument

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.640
for the rights of women.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.710
And I quote, "And God saw

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.680
that it was not good
for man to be alone.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.280
And he made him a
helpmeet for him.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.130
And Adam said, she is bone of
my bones and flesh of my flesh.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.820
Therefore she shall
be called women."

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.600
This view of woman as made
by God to be the helpmeet

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.940
of man might look, at first
glance, as patriarchal.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.680
But over the course
of the Observations,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.600
as well as her other writings,
Crocker emphasizes that man

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.940
and women are meant
to be friends

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.610
and companions to one another.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.940
For they are both made in the
image of God and share most

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.380
of the same characteristics,

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.340
including the basic
building blocks

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.150
of the body, bones and flesh.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.280
As well as the God-given
reason to read the scriptures

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.500
and understand the
divine moral commandments

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.050
that apply to both of them.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.060
Her father, Samuel Mather, was
dismissed from the Second Church

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.600
of Boston and founded a new
Congregationalist Church,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.230
the Mather meeting house.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.620
That eventually became the home

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.310
of the Universalist
Church of Boston.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.000
His theological views were
more in the rationalist vein

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.610
than the evangelical vein
that was sweeping Boston

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.470
in the run-up to the Revolution.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.880
I think that Crocker's
own unique theology,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.160
which he preserved in
manuscripts now housed

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.970
in the American Antiquarian
Society was deeply influenced

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.370
by her father's rationalism
as well as her affiliation

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.650
with the Masonic
movement of Boston.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.420
Crocker was involved in founding
the first female lodge for women

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:02.740
in Boston, if not, in the
United States, St. Anne's Lodge.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.000
Now much is known about
this female masonic lodge,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.300
beyond her publication

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.200
of several poems concerning
its activities and ideals

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.010
in Boston newspapers
in the 1780s and 1790s.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.680
I was able to confirm her
publication of these poems

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.850
through examination
of the contents

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.600
of the appendix of
her Reminiscences.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.710
And comparing these
poems preserved there

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.380
in manuscript form with those
published in Boston newspapers,

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.930
and now preserved on microfilm.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:36.170
The spirit of St. Anne's Lodge
was one of educating women

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.220
to understand and believe in
one another's fundamental moral

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.520
and intellectual equality

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.920
as creatures made
in the image of God.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.690
The lodge met to read works
in science and literature.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.110
Blending biblical and
masonic language and ideas,

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.670
the lodge produced a feminist
creed, the North Square Creed

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.790
for the husbands of
the women of the group.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.500
Preserved in the Reminiscences,

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.160
as well as in the American
Antiquarian Society,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.620
the Creed provides the
helpful feminist commentary

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.160
on the biblical concept
of the helpmeet.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.730
That makes sense of the
para-text from Genesis

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.100
on the title page
of the Observations.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.120
So I'll read the Creed now.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.400
"I believe woman is
the ostensible source

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.700
of man's happiness.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.490
I believe it was not
good for man to be alone,

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.220
and God in infinite mercy
provided him a helpmeet.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.970
I believe a prudent wife is the
greatest blessing man can attain

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.270
in this life.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.150
I also believe every man
that has a prudent wife ought

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.550
to harken to the voice
of his prudent wife.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.560
As I firmly no good and
prudent woman will ever lead her

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.070
husband astray.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.290
And I do verily believe
that every man

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.420
that has a prudent wife has
a blessing from the Lord.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.080
Therefore, I do believe in
all things, as my best friend

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.400
and my wife, and
the other ladies

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.260
of this happy circle
wishes to believe.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.560
In token of approbation,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.760
we unite in here to
affix our names."

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:04.310
Among the initials is JC,
which I and Sarah Houser take

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.500
to be Joseph Crocker,
Crocker's husband.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.130
The Creed is drawn by Prudentia.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:16.760
Prudentia's one of
Crocker's staple nicknames.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:24.180
And she often wrote
under that pseudonym,

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.290
even in her manuscripts.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.330
So she clearly thought
of the name, Prudentia,

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.620
as symbolic of her
character as a model

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.250
of women's prudential
reason and good judgment.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:47.780
So now the Creed suggests
that the husbands of the women

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.920
in the lodge pledge to honor and
obey their wives in every aspect

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.670
of their lives, showing
the lodge's commitment

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.330
to the empowerment of women
from within marriage and family,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.600
and extending outward to
women's roles in society

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.060
and education more broadly.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.100
So I take this to be a
creed written by women.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.840
And probably written,
in particular,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.110
by Hannah Mather Crocker
for the men whose wives were

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:21.290
in the lodge to signify their
support of their education

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.250
within the masonic culture.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.620
But also, just to more
broadly affirm their support

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.440
of their wives in every aspect
of life, beginning in the family

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.450
and extending out
to society at large.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:43.450
So together with Sarah Houser,
I argued in a 2006 article,

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.070
in the American Political
Science Review, that Crocker,

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.860
like many women of the early
19th century used rhetorical

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.630
strategies to subtly

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.200
and cleverly engage the
controversial question

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.400
of women's rights in the
post-Revolutionary era.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.320
In the Napoleonic era, both in
the United States and in Europe,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.720
the question of women's rights
was often run underground.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.950
And it lacked the highly visible
public profile it had enjoyed

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.310
in the heady days of the
American and French Revolutions.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:19.480
For this reason,
women had to engage

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:26.100
in covert rhetorical strategies
to engage the question

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.400
of women's rights during
the first two decades

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.970
of the 19th century.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.710
One example of a
rhetorical strategy

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.670
that Crocker used was
her apparent claim

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:43.200
in the Observations that women
should not ascend the rostrum

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.840
to make public speeches.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.960
So let me read this quote from
chapter two of the Observations,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.900
and then we can parse it to look
at its complicated language.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.070
She says, "There can be no
doubt that, in most cases,

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.850
their [women's judgement] may
be equal with the other sex,

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.750
perhaps, even on the subject
of law, politics, or religion.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.830
They may form good judgment.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.700
But it would be morally improper
and physically very incorrect

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.640
for the female character to
claim the statesmen's birth,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.180
or ascend the rostrum to gain
the loud applause of men,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.800
although their powers of mind
may be equal to the task."

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.980
So although it looks
at face value

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.360
that she's prohibiting women's
ascent to the rostrum, you know,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.860
ascent to a position
such as this, a podium,

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.430
to make a public speech.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.270
When you read closer,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:42.100
her language reveals
itself to be very ambiguous.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.070
It seems that she's
not so much claiming

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.060
that women should not
make public speeches,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.190
but that women are constrained
to some degree by norms

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.440
of feminine propriety
with regard

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.310
to their public political
actions, including speech.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.210
In addition, when we read
this passage in light

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.720
of Crocker's own preservation
of manuscripts of sermons

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.330
and other speeches that
she gave in the 1810's

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.950
to support the founding
of a school for poor girls

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.250
in the north end of Boston,

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:13.640
and to protest the
injustice of the War of 1812.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.550
Then we see that
Crocker did not object

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.290
to women's public
speaking per se.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.310
But rather modeled,
through her writing

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.750
and other political
actions, including her gifts

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:27.270
of manuscripts to public
repositories, a women could

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.020
and should strategically
deploy speech

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.540
and other political
actions in relation

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.980
to sometimes oppressive
norms of femininity.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.800
Paradoxically, capitalizing
on those norms

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.420
by subtly subverting them
through brave and smart acts

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.290
of public resistance to
gender-based oppression.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.770
Crocker advocated for equal
educational opportunities

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.750
for men and women,
beginning in childhood.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.830
She liked Wollstonecraft's
view on education,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.330
but was not as committed to
co-education or public education

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.450
as the primary means for
realizing the full range

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.100
of educational opportunities
for women.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.760
Crocker emphasized the
need for the content,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.290
but not necessarily the form
of education to be the same

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:17.450
for girls and boys, for the sake
of advancing gender equality.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.670
To get a sense of the range of
educational forms she supported,

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.140
we can look at her life.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.580
She was homeschooled amidst the
famed Mather family library,

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.000
now housed in the American
Antiquarian Society.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.360
She praised her friend,
the freed slave

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.510
and African American
poetess, Phillis Wheatley,

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:40.270
as a largely self-taught
prodigy and poetic genius.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.770
She helped found a vocational
school for poor girls in 1813,

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.070
which closed in 1819,
in part due to the rise

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.530
of public schools in Boston that
could fulfill the same purpose,

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.150
but in a more comprehensive
manner.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:57.660
There was no record of her
or the other women involved

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.960
in the founding of the school

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.390
for poor girls opposing
its closure, or the growth

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.490
of public schooling in Boston.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.800
It seemed Crocker was fine
with religious and secular,

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.550
public and private,
co-educational

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.740
and single sex forms of
education for children.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.360
As long as the genders, classes,
and races had equal access

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.070
to high-quality educational
content, with a focus

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.680
on science and literature.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.530
So why do the Observations
matter at 200?

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.360
I have five reasons.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.420
First, I'd like to make a
case that it is, in fact,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.810
the first book-length
philosophical treatise

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.570
on women's rights
published by an American.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.900
We had a symposium at the
Massachusetts Historical Society

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.100
as part of the American
Political Science Association

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.260
meeting in September,
in which we had a number

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.610
of scholars of Crocker.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.110
And some scholars, more
generally, of American history

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.780
and literature taking part.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.360
And some of my colleagues
expressed some skepticism

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.660
about this claim.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.890
I mean, is the Observations
truly a treatise?

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.810
That was one question
that someone asked.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.310
I believe so.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.130
It is organized in the
form of a treatise.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.060
And this tends that
it is separated

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.590
into discrete chapters focused
on particular philosophical,

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.530
theological, and
historical topics.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.130
It builds to a conclusion.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:40.350
And although it branches the
fields of history, philosophy,

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.050
and literature, as well
as theology, it, to me,

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.260
represents a coherent
philosophical argument made

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.920
over the space of
roughly 100 pages.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.340
If that doesn't qualify
for a treatise,

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.830
I don't know what does.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:05.100
Now, I think that in
contemporary literary terms,

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.240
we might understand
it as a hybrid text.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.360
So in contemporary
literary theory,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.450
we call a hybrid text
something that, perhaps,

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.590
bridges autobiography
and philosophy,

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:22.860
or creative writing and history.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.470
This is a very popular
form of writing today.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:33.690
Crocker most definitely
bridged the feminine genres

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:39.330
of the late 18th and
early 19th century

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:44.640
of the literary miscellany,
women's history,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.830
and family genealogy for sure.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.730
But she blended those
traditional feminine genres

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.030
and modes of writing

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:58.280
with traditional masculine
genres and modes of writing.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.800
And those would be the
philosophical treatise,

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.920
or argument, the theological
treatise and argument,

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.550
and the political treatise.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.050
Which is probably the
most masculine form

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.660
of writing at that time.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:18.210
So keep in mind how bold it
was for Mary Wollstonecraft

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.990
to publish her first political
treatise in 1790, "A Vindication

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.810
of the Rights of Man."

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:29.080
Wollstonecraft published that
first reply to Burke in his

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.890
"Reflection on the Revolution
in France" anonymously.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:37.270
And no one guessed
it was a woman.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:42.130
No one believed it
could be a woman.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.560
That's how bold it
was to write--

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.520
use the form of a political
treaties to reply to Burke,

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.020
you know, the elder
statesman of the time.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.110
So for Crocker to
take this form, right,

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:02.520
of the political treatise
in 1818, just three years

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:10.240
after the end of the Napoleonic
Wars, in a time of repression

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.980
on the issue of woman's rights,
on both sides of the Atlantic,

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.250
and to make an extended
argument for woman's rights

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.810
in that forum, is radical.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:26.730
Even if much of her language
appears conservative and appears

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:31.130
to be a step backward from
Enlightenment Era ideals

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.430
of woman's rights

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.700
that Wollstonecraft
advocated for, for example.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.010
I think when we read the
treatise more closely,

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.700
we find that Crocker,
largely, is in agreement

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.190
with Wollstonecraft,
who she actually praises

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.410
at one point in the
Observations.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.920
So I would like to make a
scholarly case at some point

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:59.750
that we should understand the
publication of the Observations

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.790
as significant politically as
Wollstonecraft's publication

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:09.950
of "The Vindication of the
Rights of Man" in 1790.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:16.810
So the second reason
I'd like to argue

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:24.210
that the Observations matter at
200 is Crocker's use of the text

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.880
to defend, not solely
republicanism,

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.280
but a feminist form
of republicanism.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:37.700
So in chapter seven
of the Observations,

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.770
Crocker follows Mary
Wollstonecraft

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.510
by explicitly venturing
into the political theory

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.810
of republicanism.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.260
Those of you who are familiar
with Wollstonecraft's work know

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.190
that her history of the
French revolution, Crocker--

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.530
I mean, I'm sorry,

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.850
Wollstonecraft explicitly
identified herself

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.170
as a political scientist.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.360
In chapter 6 of the
Observations,

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.510
Crocker explicitly identifies
herself as a philosopher.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.540
And she takes up
the philosophical

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.150
and political question of
what makes a legitimate state.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:11.700
And like Wollstonecraft,

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.950
she agrees that a legitimate
state must be republican.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.700
Crocker argues, in
chapter seven,

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.730
that legitimate government
requires women the right

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.960
of mutual judgment
alongside men.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.400
Joining with the other sex
in every prudent measure

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.720
for their mutual
defense and safety.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.390
Republicanism also requires
free discussion of sentiments

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.020
across all classes
of the citizens.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.630
But she doesn't stop there.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.950
The Observations do not merely
advocate for republicanism,

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.680
as male revolutionary leaders,
you know, such as Jefferson

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.680
and Lafayette had
done for decades.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.890
But the Observations go further.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.400
They argue for a need of a
feminist form of republicanism.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.490
Her model for a legitimate
American republic is the happy

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.060
and equal marriage.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.960
The state must be constituted
in terms of the equality

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.090
of its partners in
the citizenry.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.500
Animated by mutual respect,
and put in deliberation

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.320
about matters of common concern.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.000
Just like in an ideal marriage,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.320
the partners would have
equal say and input.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.230
And the husbands would
respect the wives

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:24.540
as the North Square Creed
implored them to do.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.190
So she writes in
the Observations,

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.500
"Love is the sacred bond
of mutual friendship,

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.670
and promotes a reciprocal
intercourse of kind affection."

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.590
This is a really
striking passage.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.890
And a number of us

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:39.170
at the Massachusetts Historical
Society panel noted the way

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.190
in which the Observations
continually returns

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:48.690
to the importance of the values
of love, peace, and friendship.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:52.370
And that this actually provides
a nice antidote to the, kind of,

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.090
hostile political climate
we find ourselves in,

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.390
especially with regard

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.690
to feminist ideas today
in the United States.

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.780
In the age of me
too, it does seem

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:05.530
as though Crocker's
understanding

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.240
of love is the sacred bond

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.950
of mutual friendship
is instructive.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.340
Friendship between men
and women is the basis

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.970
of a just and peaceful society.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.550
You know, while naming violence
is critical, as she did herself

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:21.570
in the Reminiscences, when
she exposed Phillis Wheatley's

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.780
husband was abusive,
and a likely reason

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.870
for her untimely death,
Crocker also envisioned

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.350
and practiced how friendship

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:36.720
across differences
is the way forward.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.260
So while we must name
and identify violence

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.270
and injustice, we
can't stop there.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.560
We actually have to build
bridges and create peace

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.590
and relationships of
friendship in order

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:49.800
to achieve justice
in the future.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.140
Domestic tranquility
and peace are part

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.320
of a legitimate republic
as much as a loving

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.900
and egalitarian marriage
based on friendship.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.780
Crocker though, an
ardent supporter

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.080
of the American Revolution,
represented herself

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.230
as a non-violent
messenger for the patriots.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:08.970
When she smuggled papers from
her father to Joseph Warren,

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:12.330
her point, even in this story,
was the value of peace and love

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.620
over war and conflict.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.960
In one version of the story that
circulated in anecdote form,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.480
in early 19th century Boston,
Warren gave her a chaste

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.570
and friendly kiss before he
said, "I'll see you tomorrow."

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.180
Of course the tragedy
was, he died the next day

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.250
in the Battle of Bunker Hill.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:36.640
And I think this story has great
symbolic resonance for Crocker.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.210
Because I think she wants
to hold up Joseph Warren

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.830
and herself as a model of
a kind of civic friendship

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.760
between male and female equals.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.540
It wasn't a romantic
relationship.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.580
She was already engaged
to Joseph.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.670
But they had a kind of deep
respect for one another,

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:57.500
as fellow civic actors.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:02.300
And so the chaste kiss
represents that equality

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.340
and friendship between them.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:11.950
In the 1810's, she
protested the War of 1812

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.200
through numerous poetry.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.490
And she used the penname,
the Widow Pigsley.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.540
And argued with satirical
political verse

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.690
that she should not have to
pay taxes to support an unjust,

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.900
imperial war against
the poor Canadians.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:32.550
And her Observations, likewise,
preach peace and love to cancel

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:35.100
out past conflict
between the sexes.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.670
And argue that, only once
peace reigns in the family,

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:42.950
will it reign across
the whole republic.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:47.140
The next reason why I think the
Observations matter at 200 is

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.650
that Crocker gives us a model

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.660
for theorizing rights
alongside duties.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:58.460
So the title of the Observations
is quite long, "Observations

00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.760
on the Real Rights of Women

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.650
with Their Appropriate Duties
Agreeable to Scripture,

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.870
Reason, and Common Sense."

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.280
And I think it's
really important

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:12.080
that she pairs real rights
alongside appropriate duties.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.850
And by pairing rights
and duties,

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:20.600
she actually followed both
Burke and Wollstonecraft.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.660
Her language of real rights
probably was drawn from Burke's

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.770
"Reflections on the
Revolution in France,"

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:30.520
where he contrasted the real
rights grounded in human needs,

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.710
with the abstract
rights of the principles

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.480
of the French revolutionaries.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.080
Now although she takes the
term real rights from Burke,

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.060
she puts a Wollstonecraftian
twist on them.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.330
Like Wollstonecraft,
she understands rights

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.770
as moral correlates of
fundamental duties described

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.560
by the universal,
rational law of God.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.420
For Crocker and Wollstonecraft,
the real rights

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.680
of women are grounded on the
absolutely firm foundation

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.970
of God's rational and moral law.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.680
It must be practiced in tandem

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.240
with their appropriate
moral duties.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.420
Crocker, however,
relies much more heavily

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.780
on Christian scripture to
justify this moral framework

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.820
than does Wollstonecraft.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:15.750
Now in a time of skepticism
about liberals and liberalism,

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:19.840
the emptiness of rights talk,
the futility of liberalism,

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.390
and speculation about the
end of the republic itself,

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.780
we need recourse to a deeper
and richer vocabulary of rights

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.150
and duties that Crocker
provides in the Observations.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.640
30 years ago, the Kantian
feminist philosopher Onora

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:38.710
O'Neill called for a declaration
of duties to fend off the threat

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.240
of the emptiness of rights talk.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.270
In other words, O'Neill,
like Crocker,

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.520
thought every time
we mention a right,

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.500
we ought to be conceptualizing
that right in relationship

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.470
to a fundamental duty.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:57.200
Paying respect to Crocker's
argumentative approach

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.220
to women's rights
may pay dividends

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.820
to contemporary feminists,
especially in the US,

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.210
where Christian religion
is a huge part

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.620
of the political landscape.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.760
We may need more reference to
real rights, grounded in a sense

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.530
of duty to serve
and help one another

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.100
in times of crisis and need.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.950
Crocker wrote in the
Observations, "Love is the life

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:21.230
and soul of every relative duty.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.980
Furthermore, the
surest foundation

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.990
to secure the female's right,
must be in family government.

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:31.360
As without that, woman can
have no established right."

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.400
Throughout the book, she
speaks of the importance

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.500
of maintaining sexual equality
in both religious practice

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:42.670
and education in the home in the
old tradition of the Puritans.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:46.320
Gender equality begins
not only with the family,

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.570
but with its religious
practices and beliefs.

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:54.570
Then extends outward to permeate
the whole free federal republic.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.340
The fourth reason why I
think the Observation matters

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.430
at 200 is somewhat paradoxical.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:07.240
And that's because, I
think, Crocker is something

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.810
of a specter in the
history of feminism.

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.370
She's haunted the history
of feminism in the US

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.790
without ever gaining a
real place in the canon.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:21.800
Harriet Robinson and Elizabeth
Cady Stanton dismissed her

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.900
in their 1880's histories
of the women's rights

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.440
and suffrages movements.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.530
Because she was too
conservative or subtle

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.390
in her presentation
of her views.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:34.180
They viewed her as a step
backwards not forwards.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.590
They may have also felt
some anxiety of influence.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.140
Ironically, the now
famous Cady Stanton

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.440
and other white feminists

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.090
of the women's suffrage
movement during reconstruction

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:47.220
in the progressive era are
rightfully taken to task

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.840
for racist attacks
against Frederick Douglas

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.950
and other black feminists of
the period after the passage

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.250
of the 15th Amendment,
without women's suffrage.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.500
By contrast, Crocker modeled
inclusion, not exclusion

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.230
on matters of race,
gender, class, and religion.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.820
She helped to found the school
of industry for poor girls

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.980
in the North End, with a group
of women from various churches.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.160
She included women of all
backgrounds in her history

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.950
of Boston, including her friend
the poet, Phillis Wheately.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:25.330
She condemned slaver in her
1813 sermon, "A Humble Address,"

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.630
which she preserved

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:32.690
in the American Antiquarian
Society in manuscript form.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.800
She included the founding of
the first black church of Boston

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.120
in her history of the evolution
of Christianity in the city.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.910
She was not free of
prejudice, however.

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:46.390
She never took her grandfather
and great-grandfather Cotton

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.310
and Increase to task

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.330
for justifying the theology
behind the Salem witch trials.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.670
Even though she made fun
of lingering superstitions

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.810
of witches in 18th
century Boston.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.820
She occasionally resorted to
ethnic stereotypes such as,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.800
original inhabitant to
describe herself as one

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.980
of the few true Bostonians left
in the north end in the 1820's

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.820
as migrants and other
minorities began

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.620
to populate her home
neighborhood.

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.320
The interface of sexual, racial,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.130
and religious inequalities
haunt Crocker's thought

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.810
in subsequent iterations
of American feminism.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.600
Returning to her Observations
is a chance to reflect

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.750
on how feminism has haunted
the ideas and politics

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.660
of the American republic
from the start.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.000
And to think about why
extraordinary women

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.310
like Crocker still
haunt the very margins

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:37.880
of the feminist tradition that
aims to make that republic live

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.280
up to its principles of equality
and liberty for each and all.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.450
A visible sign of her
ghostly presence is our lack

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:49.350
of any image of her, despite
her gift of priceless portraits

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.030
of her forefathers
Cotton and Increase

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.070
to the American Antiquarian
Society

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:58.490
and the Massachusetts
Historical Society.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:02.020
So finally, the fifth
reason why the book matters

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:07.840
at 200 is digitization by the
Library of Congress in 2017.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.450
So the text is preserved
on microfilm

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.570
by the American Antiquarian
Society

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:16.540
in the late 20th century,
and made available digitally

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.370
in the early part
of this century,

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.340
via the Early American
Imprint Series,

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.010
which is a wonderful resource.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.530
But if you're not part of a
University with a great library,

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.850
you probably don't
have access to this.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:33.100
And so to have it
digitized by the Library

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.820
of Congress is really a
tremendous step forward

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.140
in Crocker scholarship.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.550
I truly believe that
there will be a generation

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.580
of young feminist scholars who
study this work in its context,

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.230
in its rich political context.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:49.740
And make many discoveries,
simply because it is, literally,

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.940
publically accessible now.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.840
So thank you very much for that.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:01.430
Now my good colleague,
Constant Post of the University

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:06.860
of Iowa published the first
modern scholarly edition

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.150
of the Observations in 2011,

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.790
published with the
University of Nebraska press.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:13.880
And it's a wonderful resource.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.640
And it not only has
the Observations,

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.120
but also Crocker's other
two major prose works,

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.480
long essays that she published
in Boston in the 1810's.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.310
It also has several
of her sermons

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.370
from the American
Antiquarian Society.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:37.060
And it has selections from her
Reminiscences and Traditions

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:42.650
of Boston, which is the
manuscript that I co-edited

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:45.310
and published with the New
England Historic Genealogical

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.930
Society, with Sarah
Houser in 2011.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:50.110
So this is a comprehensive
scholarly edition

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.910
of the manuscript that's
held at the NEHGS in Boston.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.430
And this is her history
of Boston.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:00.280
It's also very much a
history of her family.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:06.090
But it's a comprehensive history
of the city from the late 1620's

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:10.870
through the late 1820's,
when she died in 1829.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:14.360
We don't know what she intended
to do with this manuscript.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.350
But there is some evidence
within it that she intended

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:21.400
to either publish or give it

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.490
to the Massachusetts
Historical Society.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:27.390
And so, either way, I think she
would have been quite pleased

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:31.310
that it finally made
it to print.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:35.440
So with these resources,
these scholarly resources

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.930
and the digitization of the
Observations on the Library

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:46.240
of Congress website, I think
we have the opportunity

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.150
to push people to
take Crocker seriously

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:52.750
in American history
going forward.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:58.770
I have on the screen
the homepage

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.590
of the Hannah Mather
Crocker Society,

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:07.790
which is a scholarly group
I helped to found in 2013.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:12.300
And you can see that we
have a link to your copy

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.430
of the Observations
on the homepage.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:21.310
And we also have some other
links to snippets of manuscripts

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:28.970
that I became aware
of, initially, in 2009,

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:33.630
a anonymous owner of Crocker
family manuscripts contacted me

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.930
by email.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:37.500
I still don't know the
identity of the family.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.900
But I believe they're
descendants of Crocker,

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:45.360
probably through Joseph's
line of the family.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:50.270
And they shared with me some
images of manuscripts that,

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:58.740
I believe, are authentic
due to the handwriting.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:01.630
And they've not shared with me
the whole of their collection,

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:04.410
although they promised me that
when they were ready to share it

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:07.770
with the public, I would be
the first to be able to use it

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.260
for scholarly purposes.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.900
I hope that is true.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:15.490
You know, I'm sitting
on the edge

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:19.050
of my seat waiting
for this moment.

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:23.840
And if anyone has any advice
how deal with anonymous donors,

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.120
and get them to give you
access to their papers,

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.060
their priceless collection
of historical data,

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.500
I would love to hear any advice.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.950
Because if I was
granted permission

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:38.600
to study this treasure
trove of documents

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.590
from the Crocker family's
private collection,

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:43.650
I believe I could make
a serious contribution

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.060
to knowledge regarding the
religious, intellectual,

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.470
cultural, and political origins

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.630
of women's rights
advocacy in the US.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:52.430
But I believe that's
the missing piece.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:56.270
What we need are further
manuscripts evidence of her life

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.580
and times to pull
the pieces together.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.140
Because there's still
a few mysteries left.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.060
The major mysteries I would like
to solve are, first the school

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.780
of industry for poor girls
in the north end of Boston.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.820
I think this is a really
remarkable organization.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.780
It's one of the first
organizations

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:20.220
of any sort founded by
women, as far as I know,

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.220
in at least Boston,
if not the northeast.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:32.420
And so it was a school founded
for the assistance of poor girls

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.740
by women from multiple religious
backgrounds and churches.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:41.780
So I'd really like
to get more insight

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.140
in to what actually was going
in the school of industry.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.510
Because it strikes me as,
actually, quite radical

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:51.460
from both-- at least
from a gender perspective

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:52.950
and a class-based perspective.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:57.170
And I would love to know how
racially diverse the group they

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:58.470
were serving was.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.350
I also want to learn more
about St. Anne's lodge,

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:06.480
supposedly the first
female masonic lodge

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.840
in the United States.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.550
And we know almost nothing
beyond the few poems

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:16.290
that are preserved
in the Reminiscences,

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:19.490
which she also published
in Boston newspapers

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.220
in the late 18th century.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:28.670
But if I could crack the
puzzle of St. Anne's lodge,

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:30.610
that would be amazing.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:36.220
As many of you may know, masonry
is a difficult subject to study,

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:39.220
because they're still
quite secret.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:43.110
And so I've gotten to know some
scholars of masonry who tend

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.190
to be freemasons themselves.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:53.610
But I think it if could find
manuscripts that shed light

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.520
into the history of
St. Anne's lodge,

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.500
that would probably make the
masonic scholarly community more

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:04.080
open to collaborating
with a non-mason.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:12.120
So that's what I think we
have left here is, hopefully,

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.880
a raising of public
awareness of Crocker.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.370
So that more manuscripts
will come to light.

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:18.890
And we'll be able
to learn even more

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.550
about this really
important, but, unfortunately,

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.460
largely forgotten
founding mother

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.620
of the United States of America.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.420
Thank you.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:38.750
[ Applause ]

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:45.750
&gt;&gt; So we certainly have
time for questions, so.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.160
&gt;&gt; What are the poems like?

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.770
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting: Oh,
yeah, sure, maybe I can--

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.070
she had a lot of humor.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:55.990
So maybe I can pull out
a poem that was humorous.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:46:00.210
One thing that she did is
she preserved the poetry

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:01.700
of other women.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.280
So in her history of
Boston, she has a poem,

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.820
a famous poem by
Phillis Wheatley.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:13.560
And she says that Phillis
Wheately gave her a copy of it.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.610
She's copying down a
poem from manuscript

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.240
that Phillis Wheately
herself gave her.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.920
And of course, in
my fantasy world,

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.920
this manuscript actually
exists in this-- [Laughter].

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:31.690
But she had a lot of respect
for her fellow women poets.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:37.230
And she chronicled the
many great women poets

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:42.320
in the Boston area, going
back to the 17th century.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:47.200
So, yeah, well, here's
a funny one.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:53.610
It's called, "On the
Advantage of a Good Chimney."

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.490
OK. "Would you your
house from smoking free?

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:59.550
You must erect a good chimney.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:01.980
While you're planned
by [inaudible] ware,

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.860
so as to rarify the air.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.200
By gentle crannies
made complete,

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:10.620
so as to send a pleasant heat
into your parlor pure and clear,

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:13.050
and keep the smoke
out through the year.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.350
Then you, my friend,

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:17.940
will clearly see the
blessing of a good chimney."

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:23.520
She did lots of funny,
satirical verse.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.790
And some of the best
stuff is stuff

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:31.150
that protests the War of 1812.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.110
There's some really
great satirical verse,

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:39.830
which I think is very much in
spirit of John [inaudible].

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:42.060
So and implicitly quite sharp.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.850
Because what's she's saying
is that she's a taxpayer.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.150
She owns land.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.470
And she shouldn't have to
pay taxes for an unjust war.

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:49.930
Which is an incredible--
I mean think about it.

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.830
I mean, how could you possibly
read her as just some sort

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:56.320
of retrograde defender
of the status quo?

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.610
She's writing poetry
like that, right?

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:02.460
And then, literally, giving
it to the AAS or preserving

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.520
so that it can be given
to the MHS, right?

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.710
Clearly she wanted
this stuff to be read.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.520
And she also circulated
a lot of her poems.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.220
She gave a lot of her poems,
or mailed a lot of her poems

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.460
to some of the leading
male intellectuals

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.090
of the time period.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:20.040
So William Jenks was a professor
of theology at Bowdoin.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.790
And he also was a professor
of Oriental languages.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:25.490
And they had a long
correspondence

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:27.060
about the school of industry.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:32.280
He was very interested in her
work as part of that school.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.250
But she also would just send
him her political poetry

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:36.550
in the mail.

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:37.990
And so, actually,
that's why we have a lot

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:39.900
of those poems, or
copies of them.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.420
Is he preserved them
in his papers,

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.380
and they ended up in the MHS.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.680
Here's one on a more
serious topic.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.930
And this is really
early, this is 1773.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:52.230
So she's 21.

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:55.560
So this is really one
of her earliest poems.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.440
"To a Friend on the
Death of a Child," 1773.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.850
"Say Delia [phonetic spelling],
whence these cares arise,

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:05.510
those anxious cares
that wrack your breast,

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:08.050
if heaven is infinitely wise,

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:12.050
what heaven appoints
is just and best.

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:15.360
'Tis mercy, justice, truth
divine that mingles blessings

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.310
with our cares and shower
our thankful hearts repine,

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:24.330
if we obtain not
all our prayers."

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:27.840
And she signs it,
"Resignation by [inaudible]."

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:41.010
So this is a more humorous
one, I suppose, about death.

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:43.840
But written in a
more humorous vein.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.310
"Lines in the Death
of her Favorite Cat,"

00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:50.260
by Hannah Mather Crocker.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.070
"Awake my psalm, awake my muse,

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:57.550
the noble theme I now
must choose shall be poor

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.280
tabby's praise.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.700
Assist my muse, restring
my lyre,

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.910
and touch my pen
with ardent fire.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:07.030
To sing her worth and
humble [inaudible].

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:11.400
Had I pen well-tipped with gold,
her virtues I might just unfold.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.340
She was quite meek
and harmless too,

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.280
but faithful in her duties sang.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:23.400
For the rats and mice did slay
and did her duty faithful show."

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.520
[Inaudible] range, I
mean I think that--

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:34.080
on the face of might say,
oh, she was just kind

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.630
of amateur writer
of [inaudible].

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:38.340
But if you look back
at the 18th century

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:42.240
and by how many intellectuals
of the time period wrote verse

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.420
and then published it,
often under pseudonyms,

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:50.050
you have to remember that poetry
performed a political function.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.830
But it doesn't for
us now, necessarily.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:57.380
And so for her to be writing
poems, circulating them

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:01.280
by manuscript, publishing them
in newspapers, [inaudible].

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.760
Compare it with the Federalist
Papers, also published

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:13.190
under pseudonym, I think we need
to see the value of these poems

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:15.260
in their political context.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.210
And understand that,
especially for a women writer,

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:26.410
much of what she was doing has
many levels of [inaudible],

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:29.090
personal, social,
political, and so on.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.540
&gt;&gt; It seems like
she talked a lot

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.560
about women, wife, and helpmeet.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:37.860
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting:
Yeah, yeah.

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:43.400
&gt;&gt; And I'm wondering if, like,
single women or, you know--

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.380
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting: Yeah,
well, that's a great question.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.680
That's great.

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.810
In the Rights of Women, by Mary
Wollstonecraft, which she read

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:52.930
and cites several times
in the Observations,

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:56.670
Wollstonecraft does
single out single women.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:52:03.640
And she does argue for
a single woman's right

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.650
to live a life of dignity.

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:09.020
And I think that's, really, one
of the most powerful moments

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.290
in "The Vindication of
the Rights of Women."

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:13.220
Because a lot of times
Wollstonecraft even gets

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.860
typecast a kind of
conservative defender

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:21.040
of marriage and,
you know, so on.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.650
And I think that
really misses the mark.

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:25.590
Because Wollstonecraft
certainly defends marriage

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:29.290
when it's practiced as an
egalitarian friendship.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:33.350
But she also defends
women's right to be single.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:37.270
And to live that
life with dignity.

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:39.880
Crocker is similar
in this sense.

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.400
Now, she's certainly
upholds marriage

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.280
as her model social
relationship.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.580
So does Wollstonecraft.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.620
Wollstonecraft says marriage
is the most holy band

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.320
of friendship in society.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:53.260
And Crocker says just about
the same in the Observations.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.420
So it's her ideal model
relationship, right?

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.010
So everything, including
politics,

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:00.230
including the republic
itself, you know,

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.100
everything should
function, ideally,

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.400
the way a good marriage
functions.

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.990
If a marriage is
functioning as a friendship.

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:10.040
That said, [inaudible] was a
widow for most of her life.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.750
OK, and she raised most
of those kids herself.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.260
So seven of them
lived into adulthood.

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:24.370
And Joseph Crocker is dead by--
I think he dies in 1797, right?

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:28.360
So when she's giving
papers and books

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.630
from the Mather family
library, and the artworks

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:35.240
from the Mather family
collection the MHS in 1798,

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:39.820
she's doing that as a widow.

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.480
So many of her boldest
political acts,

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.230
the boldest public acts
come when she's a widow.

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:49.120
And then all of her published
writings come when she-- no, no.

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:54.260
All of her major published
writing come when she's a widow.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.830
She published some poems
when she was married.

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:02.640
And she was obviously active in
founding the St. Anne's lodge,

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.210
which she supported through
signing the North Square Creed.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:11.640
But she lived most of her life
as a widow, as a single mother,

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:16.080
you could say, supporting that
family and her grandchildren.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.470
And so I think that
she used the--

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:24.790
many of her pseudonyms
accentuated her identity

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.090
as a widow.

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:29.140
The Widow Pigsley was
one I mentioned earlier.

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:32.320
So I think it's implicit
across her body of work

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.250
that being a single woman

00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:40.410
or being a widow is a legitimate
way of life for a woman,

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:42.920
and ought to be respected
and supported

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:46.070
in a free, federal republic.

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:49.400
I'd have to go back and look at
the text of the Observations,

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:56.800
though, to see when she flags
single women who are not widows.

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:03.370
That [inaudible] when she
talks about the right of women

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:12.180
to be single prior to marriage,
or to not enter marriage at all.

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:17.730
But I think the fact that
she understands marriage

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:22.100
as a friendship and as a
union you enter into freely.

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.390
And that love means that she has

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:26.600
to vindicate women's
right to be single.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:29.440
Because marriage, if
it is a friendship,

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.740
could never be forced.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:38.060
&gt;&gt; Many times people
that have manuscripts,

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:40.870
don't want them published
because it affects the value.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.970
So you may want to
find a benefactor.

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:45.860
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting:
Right, a benefactor.

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.910
&gt;&gt; Who could help you to talk
with this anonymous source.

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.210
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting:
Yes, right.

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:54.830
&gt;&gt; That maybe there is some way
of shaping those [inaudible].

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:56.650
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting:
Oh that's interesting.

00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:58.110
&gt;&gt; Find the money first.

00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:59.980
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting:
Find the money first.

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:03.010
OK, OK, it should be possible.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:08.080
That's good advice.

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.340
That's good advice.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.660
And one time when they wrote
to me, I did say, you know,

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:16.960
I think [inaudible]
would be very interested

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.260
in preserving these.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:23.260
And their special
collections library.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.720
But they, basically, just
weren't ready to part with them.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.020
You know, they were preserving.

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:31.550
And so I value your
intuition here that it's

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:35.650
about family attachments to the
documents themselves, right?

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:37.380
And they have to
get to the point

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.300
where they are ready
to part with them.

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:43.200
&gt;&gt; But if you can convince them

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.260
that financially
you're prepared,

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:49.030
or the institution is prepared

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:54.770
to have them evaluated
and so forth.

00:56:54.770 --> 00:57:03.040
Over time it may help them
make a decision, [inaudible].

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.490
&gt;&gt; I don't know the naming
traditions of that period.

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:12.540
How common was it for a
woman to use her birth name?

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:15.070
And did she do that
all her life,

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.310
or only when she became a widow?

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:18.610
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting: Well,

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:20.880
you can see that's
one of her signatures.

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:25.620
And she often went
by HM Crocker.

00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.900
Let me go back to the--

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:34.260
here, when she published
it, it was H Mather.

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:38.230
She also used HMC a lot
in her Reminiscences.

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:40.170
She loved that.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:45.400
But she almost always included
the M. She was very proud

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.700
to be a Mather.

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:50.430
It mattered a lot to her, and
she understood herself as part

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:53.540
of the five-fold line of Mather.

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:59.970
And I think she understood
herself as the female heir

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:04.280
of that grand Puritan
theological tradition.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:08.410
That went back to
Richard Mather.

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:13.740
And she was the heir of
the Mather family library.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.850
And then donated most of that

00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:21.310
to the American Antiquarian
Society in 1814, 15.

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:27.930
And so she, I think, always
accentuated the Mather,

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:29.610
or the M, because she wanted

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:33.070
to remind people she
was the female heir

00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:36.390
of this grand patriarchal
tradition.

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.990
In some ways, what she's doing,

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:40.860
she's taking it making
it into a feminist one.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.330
She's showing that their
Christian principles are

00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:45.570
compatible with modern
ideas of women's rights

00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:49.890
that were arriving from
the Revolutionary period.

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:53.170
There was no conflict
in principle

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:55.080
between being a Christian,
right,

00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:01.360
and that, what her father would
have called an old light sense,

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.920
an old rationalist,
Puritan sense

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.280
of Christianity of
the 17th century.

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:12.770
And espousing the
revolutionary ideals,

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:14.540
including women's rights.

00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:17.640
&gt;&gt; Yet she's light
years away from Cotton.

00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:21.630
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting:
Oh, yes, On the other hand,

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:25.970
what she has more in common
with Cotton and her father,

00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:29.050
Samuel, is their rationalism.

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:33.490
I mean that, you know, that
the Great Awakening brought

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:35.450
evangelicalism to Boston.

00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:38.670
And that never sat
well with the Mathers.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:39.970
They weren't evangelicals.

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:43.200
And that's why there was the
break between the Second Church

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.630
of Boston and the
Mather family house.

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:48.170
So her father, literally,
goes to found a new church.

00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:51.230
Because he's an old
light rationalist.

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:55.850
And he, in many ways, is
much more in tune, you know,

00:59:55.850 --> 01:00:01.220
with Increase and Cotton than
he is with his [inaudible].

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:04.750
[Inaudible] and Crocker became
very interested in the rise

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:07.310
of universalism, Unitarianism,

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:09.460
from within the Unitarian
Church of Boston.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.430
Because she was,
herself, not a Unitarian.

01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:16.250
But what she had in
common with the Unitarians

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:18.660
and the Universalists
was rationalism.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:25.520
And I think that's why you see
all those old Boston, you know,

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.920
Congregationalist
churches, basically,

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.530
turn Unitarian functionally
by the early 19th century.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:39.590
&gt;&gt; I have a question about,
so you made a really good case

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:43.180
about why she would be
considered feminist republican.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:46.780
You know, and cited civic duty
and virtue being, you know,

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.620
equal between men and women.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.790
But the question
I-- and going back

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:53.390
to the [inaudible] Roger Smith.

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:56.320
Roger, you know, said
that it's not just--

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.300
it's not just republicanism,
but it's also liberalism.

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.380
And then he has this other
term, descriptive hierarchies.

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.470
So I want to ask you
about liberalism.

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:08.510
There wasn't a lot of
liberalism in your talk.

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:11.400
But this is the real rights of
women and appropriate duties.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.130
The duties, yes, OK
that's the republicanism.

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:15.620
But what about the rights?

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.780
And what rights is
she advocating for?

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.140
And did they include voting?

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.280
Did they include things
that we would consider

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.580
to be liberal functions?

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.880
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting: Sure,

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:29.090
like other women's rights
advocates of the late 18th,

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:36.630
early 19th century, she didn't
go straight to suffrage.

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:38.780
Even Mary Wollstonecraft
doesn't go straight to suffrage.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.220
I mean there's the famous
moment in the "Vindication

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:44.230
of the Rights of all Men,"
in chapter 9, where she says,

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:46.230
you might laugh at me if I say

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:50.670
that women should have the
same right to be represented.

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:52.680
And to have representatives
as men.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.420
And she flags the debate

01:01:54.420 --> 01:02:00.700
about whether working class
men [inaudible] or not.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:06.560
But she kind of frames it
as a kind of joke of sorts.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.300
Or she anticipates the
laughter [inaudible].

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.190
And so there's even a debate in
the Wollstonecraft scholarship,

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:17.030
believe it or not, where some
scholars will actually resist

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:19.590
the notion that Wollstonecraft
really advocated women's right

01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:20.890
to vote.

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:22.300
I think that's going
way too far.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.100
It's clear from the "Vindication
of the Rights of Women,"

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.420
even just the preface
and the introduction.

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.440
Wollstonecraft wants men and
women to have equal civil

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.240
and political rights, period.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.340
That includes voting.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:38.540
And so it even includes being
representatives themselves,

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.120
[inaudible].

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.760
That said, Wollstonecraft
was a little cagey

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.920
in the way she represented
that issue of suffrage.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.820
And Crocker is no different.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:53.820
We don't get any explicit
defense of women's right

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.360
to suffrage in the Observations.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.590
But as far as I can tell, nobody
in the American tradition,

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:11.940
not a single writer,
prior to 1846, I believe--

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:20.230
Samuel May was actually an owner
of a copy of the Observations,

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:24.940
which is now held in
the Boston Athenaeum.

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:28.460
And he wrote an essay on
the rights and condition

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:32.920
of women published in New York,
upstate New York, in 1846.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.080
The library has a copy of that.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.900
And that book has some
theological arguments

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.200
about the rights of women,

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.100
which I think are roughly
comparable to the Observations.

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:48.890
Now I could never say, was
there a direct influence

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:53.390
of Crocker's Observations
on Samuel May's, you know,

01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:56.510
book on the right of
women to suffrage.

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.940
But I think the fact that he
owned a copy of the Observations

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.280
and he made similar
theological arguments suggest

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.950
that he was probably
influenced by her.

01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:09.850
So while she herself did not
argue for women's suffrage,

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:11.180
which I guess we'd understand

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.780
as the classic liberal
right, right?

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:19.940
She certainly had
influence on those who went

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.590
on to make those arguments.

01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:24.820
Now let's think about other
famous American feminists

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:28.640
from the early 19th century,
Angelina and Sara Grimke.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.750
Their letters on the equality of
the sexes, from the late 1830's,

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.110
also published in Boston.

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:36.890
They don't explicitly argue

01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:39.130
for women's right to
vote at that time.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:40.430
They go on to.

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:41.730
They go on to become advocates.

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:45.540
But 1840's is a real
turning point

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.040
in American women's
rights advocacy.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.340
That's when you start

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.880
to see explicit defenses
of a right to vote.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.700
Now there are other
liberal rights,

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:58.740
or rights that we associate
with the liberal tradition.

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:02.810
You know, free speech,
association, tolerance,

01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:07.680
freedom of religious expression,
all of those things she defended

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.790
in Crocker's Observations

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:11.090
and across her body
of work, for sure.

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:12.650
For sure all of those are there.

01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:16.250
Now the reason I frame her as a
feminist republican is that it's

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:19.220
because of this ontological
conception of rights and duties.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:22.810
That duties are the basis
for rights, you know.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:27.130
So every right emerges
from a corresponding duty.

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.850
And that is a more
republican way of framing it.

01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:35.800
And so starting from
rights, we start from duties.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.680
My own view, perhaps,
a slightly in tension

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:45.180
with our wonderful professor,
Robert Smith, is more in line

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:50.980
with [inaudible], who in her
work always emphasized the

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.280
way back.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.320
Modern liberalism emerged from
18th century republicanism.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.500
So both in Europe and the US.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.250
So we can't really separate
out liberals and republicans.

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:06.020
Historically, they
emerged from one another.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.600
So liberalism, in many ways,

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.340
grows out of 18th
century conceptions

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.120
and practices of republicanism.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.570
And she really liked
the American case

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:19.040
as being hugely influential

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.890
on the liberal tradition
going forward.

01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:25.100
So I really read both Crocker

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:28.040
and Wollstonecraft
as 18th century,

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.290
and in Crocker's case,
early 19th century,

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:33.730
republican feminists,
or feminist republicans.

01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:38.450
Whose ideas resonate with
liberalism going forward,

01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:40.430
because republicanism
in general was

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.950
such an important
source for liberalism.

01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:49.180
&gt;&gt; Does she discuss as
to why she writes this?

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.480
My question is.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.780
And second question, did
she also have interaction

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:58.780
with single propertied
women of other states?

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.580
So for example, New Jersey--

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.290
it's been a while since
I've looked at that.

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:06.370
But there was a period of time
wherein single propertied women

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:08.700
did have the right to vote.

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.250
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting:
Yes, absolutely, yes.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:14.680
So yeah, women could
vote in New Jersey

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.740
until about, I think,
about 1800.

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.560
It might be a little bit later.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.860
It might be 1803.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:22.390
It's about 1800.

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.630
And it was because
their constitution,

01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:28.290
their state constitution
didn't specify the gender.

01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:29.960
So it was legal-- a
classic legal loophole.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.570
So women could vote.

01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:34.250
And then it was shut
down during the beginning

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.130
of the Napoleonic era,
as things became more

01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:41.700
of a process [inaudible] during
the [inaudible] administration.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:45.030
Ironically, given
that [inaudible],

01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:47.810
you know, was when she left.

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:50.380
Her husband voted to support.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:57.820
And so, yeah, I mean, how
much contact did she have

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.240
with women from other states?

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.890
There's not a lot of evidence,

01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:06.190
although she did have some
correspondence with people

01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:10.130
from Philadelphia that's
preserved in her Reminiscences.

01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:16.850
And she spent her
whole life in Boston.

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:20.260
And she, just a few
times, records going out,

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.780
even into what we'd
now call suburbs.

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:25.120
You know, she'd been
out to Plymouth once.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.770
She went out to Worcester once.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:32.040
You know, she was
a true Boston girl.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.650
And she nearly devoted her
whole life to the city,

01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:39.110
and then chronicling
its history.

01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:42.490
But certainly, in her history
of Boston shows her awareness

01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:47.480
of women's agency in
every sector of society,

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:53.350
including economic agency, and
religious agency, and so on.

01:08:53.350 --> 01:09:00.880
So but I'll have to look.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:06.150
And she did talk
about women traveling

01:09:06.150 --> 01:09:10.140
in the colonial period.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:14.930
And some of the women that
she chronicles were those

01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:19.030
that were very bold in their
travels during the colonial era,

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:22.050
often at great personal risk.

01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:27.850
And so she certainly was
interested in this question

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:33.710
of chronicling and
representing women's agency,

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:38.180
especially in roles that kind
of trespassed feminine norms.

01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:43.450
I can't remember if I
followed on [inaudible].

01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:46.220
&gt;&gt; And the first question
was, what compelled her,

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.360
what was the rationale for her--

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.810
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting: Oh yeah,
so, you know, so it seems to me

01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:58.830
that in the 1810's, the War
of 1812 really affected her.

01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:03.040
I think it kind of brought
her into the public.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.030
She really despised that war.

01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:08.870
And so much of her
literary work was devoted

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:10.170
to protesting that war.

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:17.590
And so I think that kind of got
her more into the public light.

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:21.410
She, at the same time, she got
involved in founding the school.

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:24.660
And then she published her
three major prose works,

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:30.150
the series of letters
on freemasonry in 1850,

01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:35.020
the school of reform in 1816,
and the Observations in 1818.

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:38.720
And during this period, she's
beginning to collect the poetry

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.620
that would then be put
in the Reminiscences.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:44.430
And in the 1820's, she
writes the Reminiscences,

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:51.260
between 1822 and 1829.

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:53.560
Now, traditionally,
scholarship has emphasized

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:59.260
that Crocker waits until her
husband is dead before she

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:00.560
publishes her major writing.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.780
While this is true, it
ignores two critical facts.

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.080
One is that she did publish

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.140
in the Boston newspaper
while she was married.

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:13.280
And then in that
very Reminiscences,

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.210
she's preserving poems she
wrote prior to her marriage.

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.930
And then, it also ignores
the fact that Crocker had--

01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:25.630
Joseph Crocker had been dead
quite some time before she went

01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:31.000
out and published her first
major prose works in 1810.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.390
He dies in the 1790's.

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:36.390
So it can't simply be his death
that precipitates her to go out.

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:39.290
It's not right, oh yeah,
because she was in some sort

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:40.960
of repressive marriage
in which, you know,

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.670
she didn't feel comfortable
publishing or writing.

01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:45.720
That wasn't the case at all.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.170
And so I think it really was the
political atmosphere of the War

01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:55.800
of 1812 that really catalyzed
her as a public actor.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.280
And that I find very
inspirational, honestly.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:04.780
And when I was writing the
piece on her political oratory

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:08.620
for the Journal of Politics,
you know, it was in the wake

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.460
of the Iraq and Afghanistan War.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:15.120
And I have to say reading
her protest of the War

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.240
of 1812 resonated
very strongly with me.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.540
And also in thinking

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:23.870
about contemporary feminist
protest of war [inaudible].

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:30.280
&gt;&gt; So she was financially
stable [inaudible].

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.720
&gt;&gt; Eileen Hunt Botting: Well,
OK, so that's a great question.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:36.080
She did inherit most of her
wealth from her mother's side

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.770
of the family, the Hutchinsons.

01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:42.410
The Mathers had a lot of
books and a lot of art.

01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:44.300
The Hutchinsons had real estate.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.510
And I think that's how
she maintained herself.

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:49.140
She rented rooms.

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.870
There are ads in
the Boston newspaper

01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:54.380
that showed she rented
rooms, a room for a doctor.

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:59.060
There's some time she
had multiple homes.

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:00.600
She gave a home to one of her--

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.950
actually, one of her
brothers [inaudible],

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:03.250
because he was a Loyalist.

01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:08.420
And then she gives him a house
so he could come back to Boston.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:13.180
I think shows the ways in which
she never really forsook ties

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:16.010
to the Loyalist side
of the family.

01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:19.950
She always maintained
a strong affection,

01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:22.770
even as politically,
was always a patriot.

01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:24.600
So yeah, it was her
mother [inaudible].

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.010
And then she sold a lot
of the Mather books.

01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:31.260
And she made some money on that.

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.190
And Isaiah Thomas
was the founder

01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:36.060
of the American Antiquarian
Society.

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:38.090
He was a pretty shrewd operator.

01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:43.660
I think he knew she
had a treasure trove.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.250
And he did kind of move in.

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:49.390
But I also think that she
was probably shrewd too.

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:53.390
She sold that off in portions
over quite a bit of time.

01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:57.550
So she knew she had something
of value, and she dragged it

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:02.270
out as long as she could to
use it as a kind of resource

01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:04.270
for her family over time.

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:08.720
But there is a moment
in the late 1810's,

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.700
after she published
the Observations,

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:18.210
where she actually
applied for some charity

01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:20.130
from a veteran's
association as a widow

01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:21.530
of a Revolutionary War veteran.

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:23.440
And so she always
was complaining

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.920
in her poetry how her
house was falling apart.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.500
It always needs repair.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:31.950
It was colonial era so, yeah.

01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:33.720
&gt;&gt; And we, probably
for the sake of time

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.360
and getting everybody back
to their office before five,

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.950
should go ahead and
shut this down.

01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:40.510
But thank you so much.

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.540
