&gt;&gt;Dan Galpin: AndóOh yes.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.110
Here were are at the Friday Games Review.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.869
Oh, we need to go back to theó [sounds stop]
There we are.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:20.869
That's us.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:21.869
&gt;&gt;Koh Kim: Hey.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.539
&gt;&gt;Dan: We're actuallyóRight behind us is
the Building 44 Arcade here in beautiful Building

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.079
44 in Mountain View.

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.239
&gt;&gt;Koh: Mountain View.

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.460
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm Dan Galpin, and once again with
me is our intrepid world traveler.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.690
&gt;&gt;Koh: Koh Kim.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.690
I'm back.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.120
It's been a while, folks.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.620
Well, how are you?

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: Excellent.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.420
And we've got a great set of games here today
for us to look at.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.800
It includes the gravity bending block breakout
game that is Space Out Lite, the pin-toppling

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.920
transpositioner's shuffle board, bowling,
and poker that is 10 Pin Shuffle.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.010
The wannaó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Hmm.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.329
And the wannabe lost cat creation known as
Meowch?

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.329
It's Meowch?

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.579
&gt;&gt;Dan: Does that sound right to you?

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.590
&gt;&gt;Koh: Meowch, Meowch, Meowch.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.590
Okay.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: Somyeol, which is an interesting take
on a multi-character platform game that combines

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.890
aspects of lemmings, and thenó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Snappy Dragon 2, the sequel to the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.830
original Snappy Dragon, where you get to be
a cute dragon and you get to throw fireballs

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.830
at all your enemies.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.619
It's all those pesky garden gnomes, right?

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.619
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] It's almost a physics game,
but not quite.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.890
All right.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.560
So let's go on to our first game, which is
going to be Space Out Lite.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.509
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I think that viewers want to
know what kind of beer you guys are drinking.

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.539
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, very good point.

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:30.539
&gt;&gt;Koh: Oh, good point.

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.549
&gt;&gt;Dan: We are drinking todayó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Today, the beeró

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: The Anchor Brewing Company Liberty
Ale.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.819
I'll hold it up so you all can see it.

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:37.819
It's really nice.

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.979
I'm a huge fan of Anchor in general.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:40.979
&gt;&gt;Koh: Mmhmm.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.509
&gt;&gt;Dan: They are up in San Francisco.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.950
You can go take a tour of the brewery.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.950
It's really fun.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.929
I've never done it, but I know a lot of people
who have and have given really, really good

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:49.929
feedback on it.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:54.450
So let's take a quick look at Space Out, the
listing for Space Out Lite.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.819
Normally, we always review the papers in here
on the Friday Review, which often gives the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.719
best experience for our viewers, but also
guarantees that our developer gets one sale.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.179
&gt;&gt;Koh: Aww! [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] We need to buy it afterwards.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.749
We haven't done it yet.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.990
But we were lazy today, so here's the Lite
version that was actually nominated.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.110
And you know, I wanted to say, this feature
graphic contains a really good set of elements.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.709
It makes it clear what sort of game we're
talking about.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.680
The Space Out graphic itself is a good size.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.680
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.680
Mmhmm.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.680
&gt;&gt;Dan: It'd be very legible if the game is
featured.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.240
It could be a little bit more polished looking.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.660
I think that perhaps the effect behind Space
Out might be a little bit much, but it fits

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.660
all of our guidelines.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.660
Yeah, for sure.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.380
I mean, if you think about it, this is your
first graphic.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.900
If your game ever does get featured, that
gets seen on your mobile phone, so you have

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.720
to think about your screen size as well.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.840
So it's always important to focus on the most
important elements, which is the title and

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.920
also what your game is about.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.110
I wouldóactually, do hope it would actually
include a little bit more of the 3-D depth,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.350
because the actual game is in 3-D, and so
it's kinda strange that I'm seeing a 2-D 8

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.350
bit version game.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.920
I actually was not expecting the game that
I was playing from the feature graphic.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's true, that's true.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
It could go a little further, though.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.950
The other thing I was going to say is I love
the fact that the icon is not a rounded rectangle.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.950
That's always really, really nice to see.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.950
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yes.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.950
Android designed it.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.910
&gt;&gt;Dan: I actually find that when I see a whole
bunch of rounded rectangles, I have a harder

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.430
time recognizing what the different things
are.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.430
This makes it very, very clear.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.760
The icon is really distinct.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.780
It's got a distinct shape.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.150
I really like when people take advantage of
the fact that we don't require that everything

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.550
look the same.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.570
All right.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.480
So the game itself involves changing gravity
around.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.900
We can now switch to the view of the game
itself.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:42.931
[loud ambient sounds] This is gonna be challenging
because we actually [Koh laughs] have to manipulate

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.340
the tabletó
&gt;&gt;Koh: The tablet.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.180
&gt;&gt;Dan: --without spilling the beer.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.240
All right.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.660
So I've got the tablet.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.110
&gt;&gt;Koh: He's doing this one-handed.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.980
It's pretty awesome.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.560
Let's go.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:19.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: This isóFirst of all, you actually
align the screen, so you can see, it's to

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:34.520
prevent me from starting the game the way
that's just going to [unintelligible].

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.770
This level's actuallyóIt has all of the tutorial
stuff.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.289
You can see, it's telling me the gravity.

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.830
The higher levels actually allow you to die.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.541
This level is just really a tutorial.

00:04:56.541 --> 00:04:59.370
It allows you to see how the screen is.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.370
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.039
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's what I'm showing you now.

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.120
I'm actually holding the tablet upside-down
here.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.650
And you notice, he's actually playing the
game.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.650
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.470
One of the power ups is this fire power up.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.990
It did aóoops.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.750
I think we're going to lose HDMI through here
if I'm not super careful.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.789
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:21.789
Sorry.

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:41.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's-- One of the glorious things that
is micro HDMI, is that it's really not meant

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.889
to be tormented, spun around like this.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:56.090
This is an explosion one, this power up.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.300
One of my favorites.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.300
All really, really well done.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:26.990
There isóIn terms of the art itself, some
of the textures could be a little more interesting

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.860
on the blocks.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.639
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:49.979
&gt;&gt;Dan: They're interesting, but they just
look kinda like checkers.

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.639
&gt;&gt;Koh: They look all the same, sorta likeóyeah.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.870
I mean, there's something that's very cool
about them, but--

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.870
That would be my feeling.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.870
I want to see cool designs with blocks.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:13.060
But it's got random pieces of marble and stuff
like that, and we're in a cool space game.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.139
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:16.159
Also, it's the color scheme, right?

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:18.449
The problem with space-themed backgrounds
and all that, it's very dark.

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:26.159
I can imagine, if I'm playing this in a very
brightly lit area, it'd probably be hard for

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:28.210
me to see where I'm going.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.539
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: A little bit.

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:35.110
And the game does get hard very, very quickly.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.110
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.229
&gt;&gt;Dan: Like here, it's very, very easy to
die.

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:43.020
I'm trying to hold this together.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.349
Hope everyone can see this.

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:46.349
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:50.990
Because the way that you die is if you actually
jump out of the block cage. [laughs]

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.319
One of the fun power ups actually allows you
to split balls, which is pretty cool.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.319
&gt;&gt;Koh: No.

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:59.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, that's not the one I wanted.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.930
&gt;&gt;Koh: No.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: Okay.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.619
I'll see if I can do this without dying.

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:05.619
All right!

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:07.370
Made it to the other side.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:15.120
Let's see if I can actually get through a
full level of the game for you all.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.460
Was that the tutorial level?

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.460
Ah, there we are.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.240
&gt;&gt;Koh: 'Cause truly, Dan is a big gamer, and
this should be easy, right?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, yes.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.240
Exactly.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.529
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Actually, I mean, this gameóI really

00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:25.550
enjoy this game.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.580
I love the explosions.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.599
Oh, it's so cool.

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:28.599
And yeah.

00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:30.249
I mean, the developer did a great job.

00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:32.849
I really have to congratulate them.

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:33.900
The game is really, really fun.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.990
I had a great time getting a chance to play
it.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.990
&gt;&gt;Koh: Great twist on breakout.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.760
Now, some other things I always like to note.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.710
You've got the vestigial menu key down here
at the bottom of the screen.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.770
That means they are not be targeting the latest
[unintelligible] version, and that doesn't

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.850
have a menu anymore.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.200
[unintelligible] It doesn't do anything.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.840
I realize it's so cheap.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.330
One of the things that happens for a game
like this that's using a native code to react

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.321
the terminal on of compatibility packs, basically
to make sure that you are maintaining the

00:08:59.321 --> 00:09:00.321
compatibility with lower versions.

00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:03.060
But that slows performance down a bit and
doesn't allow the [unintelligible] to work

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.170
as it normally would.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.080
I'd definitely like to see them taking care
of their [unintelligible].

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080
All right.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.120
I think that's it.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.440
Is there anything you want to stand out more?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.430
&gt;&gt;Koh: I don't know.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.570
I always feltóI love to check my favorite,
the back button.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.690
It looks like the back button acts appropriately.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:32.020
&gt;&gt;Dan: The back button acts perfectly.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.810
No, that was good.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.310
Thanks, guys.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:57.250
Makes me feel like people are watching the
show when that happens.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:09.540
Also, I will say the sound also works when
I [unintelligible] I'm going to place the

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.120
sound on, sorta like Youtube.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.120
All right.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.120
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.080
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, we're playing without sound, but
I conclude the sound works correctly.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.080
All right.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.090
Let's go--
&gt;&gt;Koh: To the next game.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.630
What are we playing next?

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.840
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840
Hold on.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.060
Let me getó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Oh, switch.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.060
Oh, look.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is going to beó
&gt;&gt;both: 10 Pin Shuffle.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.320
[ambient noise finally stops]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Which again, isóAnd we're going to

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.180
go into a landscapeósorry, portrait-mode
game here eventually, but let's talk a little

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.270
bit about their feature graphic.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:46.270
Now, this feature graphic has 10 Pin Shuffle
appearing very, very small.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.270
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:52.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: And honestly, this is one of those
times where what you have in the game in terms

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.000
of icon is nice, but in this, it's just a
very, very tiny part of the scene.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.110
That being said, I love the rest of it.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.970
Other than the title, which I'd change up.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:12.370
I think I would just get rid of the 10 Pin
Shuffle shuffleboard look and just move those

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.960
two pieces of text out, make them larger.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.960
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: It would look much better.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.380
It's also, just from a graphic design perspective,
it really does feel just squashed up there

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.640
in the middle.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:32.380
When you're on a landscape screen like the
view we've provided to the feature graphic.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.860
When you're looking at it on the device itself,
it looks okay because it's in portrait mode,

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.710
and this is a forced portrait mode game.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.960
But you do get a very good idea of what the
game is going to be.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.190
It's going to be a combination of shuffleboard
and bowling, and also poker.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.190
&gt;&gt;Koh: Poker, yeah.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.970
They mix up a lot of different genres in this.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.550
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, this is a total gaming mashup.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.550
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: I first started to play, and I'm likeóThe
only thing that actually kind of sucks about

00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:03.670
the gameólet's actually move on to the game
screen hereóis that you could actually kick

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.040
butt on the bowling and shuffleboard side
of it.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.120
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right, but then you can suck at the
poker side of it.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.370
&gt;&gt;Dan: And still lose on the poker side.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:17.540
And it's not like there's betting or anything
like that, which would have actually made

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.120
it even more interesting.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:27.030
10 Pin Poker is the only game that's actually
active in the free version.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:32.360
I haven't unlocked this, which I really should
have done.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.410
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.410
Yeah.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm totally denying all this income
to ouró

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.090
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah, look at all those locks.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.290
Now I'm actually curious.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.080
I was going to actually get the premium version
of this, but--

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know, I intended to.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.530
It's beenó
&gt;&gt;Koh: It's okay.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.090
I'm going to attempt to play this sideways.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.120
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.830
Actually, we can actuallyówe'll rotate.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.830
We'll rotate.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:56.890
&gt;&gt;Koh: We'll rotate it?

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: Here we are.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.630
If we lose it.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:00.630
Here we are.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.630
One, two, three.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.630
All right.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.630
&gt;&gt;Koh: All right.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.440
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's much, much easier to play.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440
Okay.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.280
And I actually had set up, I think, to play
with a component.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.490
Oh, I did so badly.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.710
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'll let you take over.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.430
[ambient noise starts again] The controls
for that were kinda interesting.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.451
There's two levels of controls.

00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:27.570
Your initial ability to gain and rotate the
floor.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.790
Next, you have the initial position of up,
as well asó

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.710
&gt;&gt;Koh: I'm ready to get my butt kicked right
now.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.370
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think I'll rotate the end of the
board from the start, but actually, much depends

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.940
on your accuracy in the target.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.940
Excellent.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.940
[high pitched voice] Strike!

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.940
&gt;&gt;Koh: Excellent.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.940
Strike.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.940
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.940
It's a quantifiable shuffleboard team.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:47.940
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: But in all seriousness, it was a little
bit confusing when I first started playing

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920
the game.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.010
Once I got into play, I realized a lot of
times how I manipulated the board and the

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.670
initial setting didn't work at all.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.650
[unintelligible] And making sure [noise stops]
that I had a very accurate, straight shot.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.830
The presentation's really, really nice.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.530
I love the little reflective effect on the
surface.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.530
It's a very nicely done texture.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.530
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: There's a lot of really well done sound
effects as well.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.950
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: That we're not hearing.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.920
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah, the extras are really great on
this game.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.770
It's really, really nice when you get out.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:28.210
When you get a spare, it does things like
it has a crowd that you can hear that boos

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.180
when you get a split.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.940
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:39.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: I mean, this is a really, really well
done game.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:46.620
Again, this is another game that you can see
the vestigial menu on the bottom of, but as

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.290
far as I can tell, it handles sound correctly.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.880
This is--
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.070
Everything sounds right.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.820
The back button seems to work appropriately
when I remembered.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.570
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah, see.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.570
Look.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:01.570
You want to quit?

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.570
No, I don't want to quit.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.570
I'm doing pretty well, actually.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: What if you hit it again?

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.570
Does it--?

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.570
Oh, that doesn't do anything.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.570
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.570
Yeah, that itself.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.470
&gt;&gt;Dan: It should dismiss it, rather than have
it do nothing.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.850
Or, you know, potentially take you back to
the main menu.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.290
I'd like to see this thing because it's really
clearly dialog.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:23.000
So that's something our QA team would actually
say, "Hey!

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.900
You should make it do something" because the
backing should always do something.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.900
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.630
&gt;&gt;Dan: But other than that, the game works
well.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.870
In terms of tablet presentation, it's pretty
good too.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.833
I think that it might be that the gestures
are a little bit longer on tablet than they

00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:33.833
might need to be.

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:36.940
It might be fun to play with that.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.510
In terms of how you move position and actually
shoot, I'm not sure how much the developer

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:47.400
did with that, but that was my feeling.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:56.630
I had to gesture a little longer than I thought
I should have to in order to actually make

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.630
it go.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.480
But it also--
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.830
Well, it also varies, right.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:09.110
'Cause I played this on my Nexus 7, and it
seemed to me that the sensitivity on that

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:15.370
was a little bit different than what a Transformer
is.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:22.320
I mean, if you give the user some sort of
way to be like, "Oh, maybe I just want to

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.800
flick a little bit."

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.640
Sensitivity controls would be nice.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.640
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.810
I think the way to do this is to build an
initial sensitivity based upon the density

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.020
of the screen.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:41.630
Maybe not in this case, not even the density
of the screen, but actually based upon the

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.630
distance that the user actually is having
to swipe.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:52.970
That's something to think about, in terms
of improving it.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.140
I still thought it was pretty darn good.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.320
To be honest--
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah, it was pretty good.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.029
I mean, it's very high quality.

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:01.890
Once you got usedóyou sorta figured out what's
going on.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.250
I had no qualms recommending this game to
friends.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.260
It's fun.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:14.799
There are a couple of little tiny issues in
terms of presentation that could be helped

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:20.020
on the tablet, but honestly, without being
nitpicky, I would say it looks really, really

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.020
solid.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.020
So yeah.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.020
Great job there on 10 Pin Shuffle.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.960
We'll go on to our next title now.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960
&gt;&gt;Koh: Next title.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know, I know, you have to end your
game.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:29.670
&gt;&gt;Koh: I know.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.670
I'm actually doing pretty well.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: You're doing pretty well.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.670
I know.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.230
&gt;&gt;Koh: This is not normal for me.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.620
[laughs] I actually was pretty bad at this
game.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.549
&gt;&gt;Dan: I want to see what happens.

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:53.170
Have you seen, by the way, is that what's
going on in the game is that as you play the

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:58.309
game, you actually get a better and better
poker hand, and you get the ability to swap

00:17:58.309 --> 00:17:59.309
out cards.

00:17:59.309 --> 00:18:02.450
That isóYou can say, "Which one do you want
to play?"

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.450
&gt;&gt;Koh: I don't know.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.170
I don't want to lose my pair.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: You can't lose your pair.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.270
I would pressó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Press Alt to take up the 9.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.020
&gt;&gt;Dan: The 9.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:17.660
It's a bigóHave you tried counting cards
with this to see how accurate it is?

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.130
I was curious to seeó
&gt;&gt;Koh: I was thinking about that too.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.130
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.650
I assume it's from a single deck, but you
know.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.840
I don't know.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840
We'll see.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.620
We're almost done with here.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.210
We've got some time.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.800
Let's finish the game.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.990
&gt;&gt;Koh: Let's see.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.570
Let's see how I'm going to do.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: All our viewers-- Exactly.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.160
[high pitched voice] Strike!

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:48.020
&gt;&gt;Koh: So by the way, I have never won a game
of this in poker.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.180
[laughs] Even as many strikes as I have.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.559
'Cause somehow, the computer's always gotten
a better poker hand than me.

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:53.559
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:54.720
I really don't get that at all.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.460
So let's get rid of the jack and the king
here.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.150
We keep our ace high.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.160
And then draw.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.160
Let's go for it.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160
Ohhhh!

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160
&gt;&gt;Koh: Aww, I should have just gottenóYeah.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.320
Sometimes I'm just not--
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.940
As I said, you don'tóit's hard to tell exactly
what's going on, because you can't tell what

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.330
the computer's doing.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.330
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:20.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: I find the computeróThey've done the
computer nicely, so that if you are really,

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:28.560
really sucking at the shuffleboard part of
the game, the computer does really, really

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.560
badly.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:36.350
&gt;&gt;Koh: The one thing that I kinda am a littleówould
not take out is if you look in the upper right

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.790
corner, it does say, "Available on the app
store."

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.650
So I would--
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know, I know.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.730
This is the default ad when an ad isn't showing
up.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:43.730
Come on, guys!

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.730
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:45.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: I don't have one of them devices.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.730
Dude!

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.730
It's an Android game now.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.730
All right.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.380
So you've got one more shot.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.809
Want to get rid of that one?

00:19:51.809 --> 00:19:52.809
Ah, such a tough one.

00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:56.220
&gt;&gt;Koh: At this point, you'd want to keep the
thing.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.310
I would just get rid of--
&gt;&gt;Dan: I would say go for it.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.890
Yeah, go for it again.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:02.890
&gt;&gt;both: Yeah!!!

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.410
&gt;&gt;Koh: Full house, look at that!

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.640
This may be the first game I've ever won!

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's exciting.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.900
We get to find out what happens when you win.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.900
Suspense, you know.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.200
One thing that is kinda frustrating is that
I do notóalso, at the end of the bowling

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.470
game, if youóit doesn't actuallyóif you
end up getting a strike, it doesn't give you

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.470
extraóIt doesn'tóyeah!

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.200
&gt;&gt;Koh: So I was going to be really mad if
they had a better full house.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.750
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.860
All right, we finally [high pitched voice]
woooooooon!

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.860
All right.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.860
So that'sóoooh, nice.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.860
&gt;&gt;Koh: Oooh.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.130
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, no, no.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.080
Let's not play new opponents.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.080
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.860
&gt;&gt;Dan: So I guess you end up getting more
challenging opponents as well.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.860
Again, thumbs up.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.740
Clever mashup of a bunch of stuff.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.059
Does this mashup exist?

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:46.059
Does anyone know?

00:20:46.059 --> 00:20:47.679
&gt;&gt;Koh: I don't even know.

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:50.990
That's the first I ever saw a mashup like
this, I was like, "Poker and shuffleboard?

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.990
And bowling?

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.990
Really?"

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.990
I really want to know.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.870
&gt;&gt;Koh: If you do find out a game, post a link,
'cause I'd be interested.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:57.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.210
If any viewers out there know the answer to
this, let us know in the comments.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.500
&gt;&gt;Koh: Actually, that would be a very interesting
show.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.660
We should do a mashup, genre mashup show.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.020
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] All right.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.450
So let's go on to our next game here.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.450
I'll let you move the tablet, Koh.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:12.450
&gt;&gt;Koh: All right.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.130
&gt;&gt;Dan: And I'll take control of the slide
deck.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.370
So our next game is going to be
&gt;&gt;both: Meowch!

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:25.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: And Meowch is kinda an interesting
game, because I wasn't sure how I felt about

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.090
it.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.870
&gt;&gt;Koh: I wasn't really sure.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.820
I saw the feature graphic, and I was like,
"What is this game?

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.820
Interesting."

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.820
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:38.340
&gt;&gt;Koh: I mean, it is a very bold feature graphic,
though, so I give the developer or whoever

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.660
designed it that much.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.820
It's definitely attention-grabbing.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: Let's switch over to it here.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.370
So there'sóooooh.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.270
&gt;&gt;Koh: I was like, "Whoa!"

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.600
&gt;&gt;Dan: Transitions, oh yes.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.340
You can tell that Ian didn't make this deck.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.340
So yeah.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.490
Actually, this is a great feature graphic
in terms of making sure the text is forward.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.600
It does not tell me anything about the game.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.370
Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's
not.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.100
&gt;&gt;Koh: Sometimes a bad thing.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.100
Yeah.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: It doesn't necessarily have to.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.030
One of the things that's really interesting:
we had a developer who got their app featured

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.429
recently, and they doubled the number of installs
just by making a more attractive feature graphic.

00:22:14.429 --> 00:22:18.110
They actually went and-- The first, their
original feature graphic, was just a blowup

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.330
version of their logo.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.140
They ended up replacing it with this beautiful
artwork and imagery.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.140
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.140
Right.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.140
&gt;&gt;Dan: Beautiful imagery in this case.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.910
With a slightly smaller version of their logo.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.400
But it just looked pro.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400
&gt;&gt;Koh: Well, yeah.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.770
It was the app Dwellable.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.420
It was basically a vacation rental app.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.610
Originally, it was just basically this garish,
bright orange background with their logo.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.610
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.480
&gt;&gt;Koh: And so you can imagine you're like,
"What is this app?

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.940
It doesn't tell me anything that it does."

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:47.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: But then they showed me this beautiful
house that you could rent, along with Dwellable.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.490
And boom.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.280
All of a sudden, itó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Double installs?

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.980
I was like, "No, it's more installs."

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: So these feature graphics really are
important.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.890
I don't know how many more times we have to
emphasize this.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.220
This is great.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.090
I think thatóI honestly don't know if I would
represent this game any other way.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.090
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.179
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's pretty reasonable.

00:23:11.179 --> 00:23:15.750
It is hard to go, "What's going on in this
game?"

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.720
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right, until you play it.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.310
But luckily, they have a free version for
everyone to try, so it gives everyone a chance

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.310
to try it.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.310
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.970
So let's go into the actual gameplay itself.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.450
We'll switch over to our gameplay slide here.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.620
This is another-- [laughs] I had to rotate
the tablet.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.850
&gt;&gt;Koh: Of course.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.140
[laughs] Now you've got to rotate it back.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:41.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: I have to rotate it back, because this
is it.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.450
&gt;&gt;Koh: Okay.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.110
&gt;&gt;Dan: The reason I actually like leaving
this in the key dock is because it makes it

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.600
easy when we have to rotate it.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.370
Otherwise, it's kinda a challenge.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.790
&gt;&gt;Koh: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.860
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:59.890
So I'll let youóI didn't play this one as
much as some of the other games.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:05.240
&gt;&gt;Koh: But we'll just go to the first level
because it's just easy.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, it is.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.940
&gt;&gt;Koh: Just to see what's going on.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: You don't get the humans trying to
grab the cat through the windows.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.480
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right, that happened in the second
level, which was kinda crazy.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.000
So basically, you're essentially a cat, and
all you do is you--

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.420
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think you actually are a cat.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.920
I don't even think it's essential.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.920
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.929
But you're essentially trying to get all this
Meowcat food and then go to the exit.

00:24:30.929 --> 00:24:31.929
Right?

00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:33.600
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's a missing cat sign, actually.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.780
You're trying to get rid of the missing cat
sign so that you canóBecause obviously, it

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.250
makes itó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Enjoy your freedom.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: Enjoy your freedom.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.250
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: The goal isóyou're this not stray
cat.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.630
You're a cat who's trying to be found by its
owner, and you're desperately trying to avoid

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:47.830
being found by your owner.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.030
Which is kinda weird, actually.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.870
Unless maybe what you are is you areóNo,
it's a missing cat sign.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:53.870
&gt;&gt;Koh: It is a missing cat sign.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:58.050
So you're a cat that decided to escape from
its owner because you don't like cat ladies.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.120
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: That does seem to be actually exactly

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120
the case.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.120
&gt;&gt;Koh: All right.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.420
&gt;&gt;Dan: You're owned by a crazy cat lady.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.570
&gt;&gt;Koh: You're owned by a crazy cat lady, and
you're trying to escape for your freedom.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.100
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: So the game does get harder in the

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.120
second level.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.880
There's a lot more elements.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.710
You also are a catóI would describe you as
being sortaóusing theóYou're sorta the angry

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.530
cat metaphor here, where you actually are
kinda a giant kitty slingshot.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:22.530
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:23.530
Right.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: If you actually kinda pull the tail
on your cat back, in order to launch your

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.490
cat forward, probably for reasons of animal
abuse, they don't actually show this.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.490
Which is probably good.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.380
But it is a littleóThe controls are a little
weird, 'cause it's not really obvious what

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.380
you're doing.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.720
Like, "Why am I pulling back on the cat?

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.870
To make the cat jump?"

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.990
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah, I wasn't really sure about that.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.660
It took me a while to figure out what up.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.790
Even the objective, too.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:46.590
I think a lot of itóI didn't realize, "Oh,
I was that missing cat."

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:47.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.590
Exactly.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.660
So anywhos, we'll just try to get out of here.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.460
I didn't do well this level.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.960
But at least I avoided the crazy cat lady
who's trying to get me, and the animal control

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.960
officer.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.960
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.960
Right.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.960
&gt;&gt;Dan: But that's basically the game.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.230
I'm sure they add more elements as you go
farther into the game.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.480
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:15.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: It didn't strike me as a game that
I really had to play.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.612
From an art style perspective, it's somewhat
consistent.

00:26:17.612 --> 00:26:21.310
It's a littleóIt definitely has that "I drew
this in Adobe Illustrator" kind of look to

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.890
it, but it doesn'tóAnd it's fine.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.060
I mean, I think it'sófrom what I saw, it
seems like a reasonably clever game.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.710
But it did kinda strike me as an odd game.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:33.350
And again, I really wanted to play this game
deeper than I actually was able to do.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.350
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:38.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: Some strange things about this game
in terms of the juxtaposition of different

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:44.610
elements: you do have this sort ofóthat the
numbers have a really, really different feel

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.740
to the score, and a couple of other things.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.740
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.050
&gt;&gt;Dan: It might be worth playing with it to
keep this.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.160
You've got this really cool hand run style
already.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.160
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.480
Well, I think a lot of it is just try to educate
your player on what all these different elements

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.480
are.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.480
Like, what's actually bad?

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.929
I didn't even realize the lighted yellow windows
is actually, the crazy cat lady can come out.

00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:04.970
It took me a while to be like, "Oh!

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.860
I was not supposed to do that."

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.770
It doesn't give you an indication of whether
youóNot like failure, per se, but you did

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.770
something wrong.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:12.770
I had no idea.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.179
I was like, "Oh, animal pest control.

00:27:14.179 --> 00:27:17.090
Oh yeah, that's actuallyóI don't want to
get caught by that."

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.450
Or "Oh, these antennas, these satellite dishes.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.809
Oh, I can bounce off of them."

00:27:21.809 --> 00:27:24.500
You just have no idea unless you experiment.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.900
Now, that's alsoóI mean, that can be a good
thing, but you want to make sure thatóI mean,

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.410
this is only the third or fourth level, right?

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:34.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:41.640
&gt;&gt;Koh: You have to think about who your audience
is in terms of these types of arcade action

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640
games.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.270
You just want to make sure--
&gt;&gt;Dan: Boom. [high pitched voice] Ouch!

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.270
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.660
&gt;&gt;Dan: So one of the things that's interesting
about this game, that I would say isóActually,

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.190
I want more frames of animation.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.940
I actually wasóEspecially in the cat.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.559
Because IóThere's some, but I think that's
actually one of the things that would make

00:27:57.559 --> 00:28:00.140
the game really just feel that much better.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:05.809
When you have the cat and the cat is the main
character, just a couple of additional frames

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:07.710
would look really, really nice.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:16.590
So that way, if there's any little polish
I would add to the game, you know, everything

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.919
else is pretty much-- Stylistically, we're
talking about here.

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:20.919
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:28:20.919 --> 00:28:25.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now, I will say one thing I'm really
happy to see is this game actually is targeting

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:26.950
a recent SDK.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:27.990
We don't see a vestigial menu.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.049
In terms of back key support, it does exactly
the wrong thing.

00:28:31.049 --> 00:28:32.080
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080
Right.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.870
It doesn't bring up a menu, an actual menu
button.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.890
It just brings up "Do you want to exit?"

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:39.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.900
&gt;&gt;Koh: But at least it's something.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.790
I mean, this is progress.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.730
I mean, before, we had a lot of games that
didn't have anything.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.929
&gt;&gt;Koh: But that game is also coming.

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:51.929
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:28:51.929 --> 00:28:54.919
So I don't know.

00:28:54.919 --> 00:28:55.919
I wasn't sure.

00:28:55.919 --> 00:28:57.400
It wasn't a game that really engaged me.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.330
Space Out really engaged me, 10 Pin Shuffle
really engaged me.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.330
Meowch?

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:02.330
Meowch was fun.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.490
I think I would probably recommend it to someone.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.400
It seems like it was targeted at someone younger
than me.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.980
But at the same time, it also seemed really,
really challenging.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:14.270
I kinda wondered whether an eight year oldó
&gt;&gt;Koh: In world 1, number 3, it was pretty

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.169
hard until I figured it out.

00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:17.169
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:29:17.169 --> 00:29:21.290
So my feeling is that it's sorta this strange
combination of a game that seems to be targeted

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.669
at kids but seems to be too difficult for
kids.

00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:24.669
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:25.669
Right.

00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:27.480
&gt;&gt;Dan: Maybe there is some balance that can
be struck there.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.480
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.480
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.570
We're going toó
&gt;&gt;Koh: But great art style though.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.570
Positive.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.570
Great art style.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.570
I like the design, the graphics.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.230
But definitely, a lot can be improved on it.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:40.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right, so now we're going to eventually
move to a landscape game.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.030
&gt;&gt;Koh: All right!

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.030
And this game is Somyeol.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.030
At least, that'só
&gt;&gt;Koh: Somyeol.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.030
Somyeol.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.030
Yes, Somyeol.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: So I wasn't quite sure how it was pronounced,
but now it'sóI believe Koh in this case.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.030
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.030
This is actually kinda strange.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.070
So I see this feature graphic, I have no idea
what to expect.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.050
I'm assuming the Somyeol is actually probably
what those little lemming-like creatures are?

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, yeah, I think so.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.970
Again, lemmings wear green hair.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.040
This is purple hair.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.410
So they're definitely not lemmings.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:02.410
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.580
&gt;&gt;Dan: And I would say there's a lot of things
about this game.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:11.230
First of all, [ambient noise in background
for a short while] you can actually look at

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.230
the feature.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.440
So the feature graphic here actually at least
had the text in the right proportion.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.550
It's big, it's flashy, it's eye-catching.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.410
We have another rounded corners icon for no
apparent reason.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.010
Especially when you've got something as dynamic
and eye-catching as the actual Somyeol hair

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.010
itself.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.010
It just sticks out in all directions.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.549
You know, why not make that part of your icon,
part of that look?

00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:25.280
I think we missed out.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.810
There's a missed opportunity here.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:27.810
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.410
You can definitely do background transparent
image and just stick out there hair.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.410
That's probably fine.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:35.060
But let's actually look at the game itself.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.090
So hopefully, we actually have this running.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.830
&gt;&gt;Koh: So we can actually play it.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: We can actually play it.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:44.060
Now, some things you may not notice at home:
everything is really, really low res.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.060
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: Okay, in this game, exceptionally,
exceptionally low res.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:52.370
And it is a hand drawn art style, but when
you see hand drawn art, it's so much nicer

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:57.660
when you actually get to see it at a resolution
close to what the tablet is playing on.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.790
It just feels like, "Okay, this was made a
long time ago."

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.790
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:04.360
&gt;&gt;Dan: And it's not made a long time ago in
that, "Oh, cool, it's retro."

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.799
It's made a long time ago inó
&gt;&gt;Koh: As in someone didn't think about HD.

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:09.590
It lives in SD land.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.600
&gt;&gt;Dan: As that it was made for a device that
had a much lower resolution than this.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:18.030
And other notes: we've got lots of icons all
over this screen.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.350
We have individual icons for a whole bunch
of things.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:23.860
I'm actually at least glad that it's not trying
to get me to click on them, but I always feel

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:29.020
like if you're going to do an Android game,
having a standard Android share icon in addition

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.049
to all those, at least, if not it being the
only thing there, it's really nice.

00:31:32.049 --> 00:31:35.860
'Cause right now, if I wanted to post to my
Google+ account, I can't do it.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.370
If I want to send email that contains similar
information, I can't do it.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.370
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:44.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: If I wanted to share stuff with somebody,
perhaps from the web store to someone, I can'tófrom

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:45.790
the Google Play Store, I can't do it.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.790
So there's a lot of things here.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.800
If I wanted to rate the game, there might
be a way to do this.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.289
I have no idea how I might do this from the
information in the screen.

00:31:53.289 --> 00:31:54.289
&gt;&gt;Koh: No, no.

00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:55.289
Not the screen.

00:31:55.289 --> 00:31:58.539
&gt;&gt;Dan: There's a lot of things that are here
that may or may not be useful, and yet, a

00:31:58.539 --> 00:32:04.020
bunch of things that are definitely important,
like "Please rate the game" is not here.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.660
Just some little thoughts.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:11.419
Or if it is there, I can't possibly tell what
it is.

00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:12.419
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:32:12.419 --> 00:32:14.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now again, we kinda considered this.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:18.720
We go back to this very, very low res, hand
drawn art style.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.720
Cute.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.720
But the game is really inventive.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.410
And I think that's actually what's kind exciting
about it, isóLet's go to one of the levels

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.650
that'só[pause] [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs]

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:29.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: Againó
&gt;&gt;Koh: And againóThat's interesting.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:36.559
Well, you know, it's definitely artwork that
feels like the stuff that I would draw if

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:38.650
I were drawing a game.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.200
&gt;&gt;Koh: I mean, it could be on purpose.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.070
I just wish it was in a higher definition.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.070
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.580
Again, you know, it's hard to say.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.340
Whenever you're looking at a title like this,
you're like, "Well, was this intended?

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.669
Is it supposed to have that feel?"

00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:55.809
&gt;&gt;Koh: [hums]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Some very cool things about this game.

00:32:55.809 --> 00:32:59.809
So this is actually a multiplayer platform
game, where I've got to get these guys to

00:32:59.809 --> 00:33:01.700
safety and get them onto the rocket.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.700
Okay?

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.570
Obviously very, very straightforward to do
in that level.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.570
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:10.299
&gt;&gt;Dan: But it gets tricky because sometimes,
what you have to do is actually group them

00:33:10.299 --> 00:33:11.299
together.

00:33:11.299 --> 00:33:12.350
You can actually sometimes drop them into
place and have to squash them into one level.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.350
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: And there are puzzles to solve where
half of them go one place and half of them

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:17.670
go the other way.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:18.670
&gt;&gt;Koh: Go the other way.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:19.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: And you control them all as this block.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:24.500
A lot of times, it's figuring out how to split
them up and still control them, etc, etc.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.539
There's a lot of really interesting puzzles.

00:33:26.539 --> 00:33:28.380
There's a lot that's going on in this game.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:33.591
I kinda wantóI just want a presentation that's
just a littleóthat says to users, "Yes, this

00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:36.400
game really had a lot of thought put into
it."

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.780
But it's probably--
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right, right.

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.160
But the gameplay element is probablyóit's
very interesting.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.380
I think it's very unique, and so--
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.380
Yeah.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.120
I'd like to see the game do more.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.120
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.190
&gt;&gt;Dan: One other thing to note in this game
is not only is the game targeting an ancient

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.680
SDK version, but it's actually not targeting
all screens.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.150
So we have the zoom controls on it.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.010
And it might actually look better, honestly,
zoomed.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.600
&gt;&gt;Koh: Zoomed in full screen.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: In this particular case.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.010
Although it's pretty much gonna beóIt's gonna
look very similar.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:09.419
And there are a few assets here that are higher
resolution than others.

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:10.419
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:34:10.419 --> 00:34:12.099
&gt;&gt;Dan: So that might be something worth noting.

00:34:12.099 --> 00:34:17.310
In terms of back key support, it is doingó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Seems like it's doing what it's supposed

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:18.310
to do.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:19.310
Yeah.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.310
&gt;&gt;Dan: What it's supposed to do.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.310
Yeah.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.310
That'sóLike this "Please rate"!

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.310
Oh, exit.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:24.580
It'd be better if that was a link.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.580
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.190
&gt;&gt;Dan: Maybe it is a link, and I couldn't
tell.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:29.190
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: But in any caseóso that's Somyeol.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:35.340
And the final game that we're going to look
at todayó

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.690
&gt;&gt;Koh: Is Snappy Dragons 2.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: --is Snappy Dragons 2.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.460
And Snappy Dragons 2 is a beautiful looking
game.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.610
Extensive Studios did a fabulous job on it.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.040
It is, again, a sequel to the original game.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.210
And we're, once again, playing the light version.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:53.070
If you nominate the light version, there's
a chance that we'll play the light version.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:57.040
If you want us to actually use the premium
version, please nominate the premium version

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040
and we'll do it.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.040
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: Don't make your premium version like
$10,000 the one day we go to play it.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.040
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.370
&gt;&gt;Dan: But in all seriousness, we don'tó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Well, then we probably won't review

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:05.370
it.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:06.370
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Probably not.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:09.980
Well, I think it's actually the maximum is
like $99 on Google Play.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.930
But any caseó
&gt;&gt;Koh: But feature graphic wise, really cool.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.490
I'm not really sure if I would have used the
transition between the yellow to red.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.760
It's really hard to see against the light
blue background.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: You can't really tell you're on the
website.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.760
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: But we have the beautiful advantage
that we're actually looking at the screen

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.990
right now.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.990
A very small screen.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:31.020
Like, I couldn't possibly read the text in
the review itself from where we're looking,

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:36.880
but the size of those reviews, of the graphic
that we're looking at right now is not that

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.869
far off from this size on a phone or a tablet.

00:35:40.869 --> 00:35:43.800
And I justóit looks likeó
&gt;&gt;Koh: You just can't see anything.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.869
I can't read it.

00:35:44.869 --> 00:35:47.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it looks like P Drag 2.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.290
I can read the 2.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:52.140
So a little bit more contrast would actually
help quite a bit.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:57.470
And this is one of those times where really,
a subtle drop shadow would help a little bit

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:58.470
more.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:59.470
There might be one.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.450
If there is one, it's really subtle.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:02.450
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: I see it over here.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.230
No, I don'tóOh, a little one, maybe.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.230
&gt;&gt;Koh: No, no.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.230
I mean--
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:09.330
We can read it.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:12.290
We can read it when we're looking at a closer
screen.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:13.290
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:17.770
Really, the biggest thing is just think about,
when you're thinking about designing your

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:22.910
feature graphic, always think about your color
schemes, what you're using, and all that stuff.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:27.620
I mean, there's always thisóIt's a lot of
cool color sciencing, but yeah.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.580
Contours--
&gt;&gt;Dan: The composition is great.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.380
&gt;&gt;Koh: Oh, yeah, the composition's great.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.540
You know, honestly, if they just switched
it all to red letters, it probably would have

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.540
been fine.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: It would have popped.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.960
&gt;&gt;Koh: It would have popped a lot more.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960
Or orange.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.230
Blue and orange are complimentary.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.740
They're going to stand out to contrast.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:46.770
&gt;&gt;Dan: The other thing is, no rounded rectangle
needed on this guy.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.500
You're already pushing the boundaries on it.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.670
I would just say get rid of it.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:52.340
It looks cool enough without it.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.450
We don't need it.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:54.450
And yeah.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:55.530
That would be my take on that.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.530
&gt;&gt;Koh: Okay.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.440
&gt;&gt;Dan: So let's go to the actual game itself.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.440
&gt;&gt;Koh: So the actual game itself.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:06.720
Oh, I wanted to show people what I didn't
like about the game to start out.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.360
So let's restart the game.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.360
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.160
We're going to restart the game so we canóyes.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:18.110
&gt;&gt;Koh: Mostly 'cause this is a pet peeve of
mine, but mostlyóAll right, if this is the

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:22.400
first screenóSo it'só
&gt;&gt;Dan: Have you played the game before?

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.690
&gt;&gt;Koh: Have you played the game before?

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:26.690
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:32.430
&gt;&gt;Koh: So if you look at this from first glance,
think about a user, I looked at this, I was

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.490
like, "Well, is this an ad?

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:37.510
Am I supposed to click on something, or is
this just another screen?"

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:38.510
It's actually very hard to tell.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:42.300
And it wasn't until I started touching the
screen that I realized, "Oh, I was supposed

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.300
to touch it."

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.840
[laughs] In order to start the game.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.840
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.840
That's a really, really good point.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.840
I think it's one of those things where, as
an interstitial, where it's really clear that

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.270
it's interstitial, this is cool, but it's
a very first screen you see in the game.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.960
It's a little bit--
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.960
Right.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.350
I would just have rather it had gone to this
screen.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:58.380
But, you know, that's just my slate.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.410
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.410
No, no.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:02.510
I think it's a really good point.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:06.290
And again, beautiful composition here--
&gt;&gt;Koh: It's a beautiful first screen.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:07.660
&gt;&gt;Dan: --on the title screen.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.660
This is nice.

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:09.660
Again, I'd like to see a standard Android
share icon next to other things or in place

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.660
of other things.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.260
I reallyóyou know, people should be allowed
to share on whatever social networks they

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.260
are using.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.260
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.340
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mu and . There are places in the world
in which, actually, Facebook is not the most

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.340
popular social network.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.520
And Twitter, people don't even know about
it.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.390
So make sure that users that are in Korea,
for exampleó

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:27.650
&gt;&gt;Koh: Korea, for example, yes.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.680
&gt;&gt;Dan: They use their social network of choice.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.700
&gt;&gt;Koh: There are other social networks out
there.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.880
They're probably a lot more beneficial.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.310
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: So just again, using the Android standard

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:39.740
share app allows someone to use what they
have installed.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:44.150
If you want to include things next to it,
that's great.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.090
But I really like seeing at least that there.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:48.730
&gt;&gt;Koh: But let's play this.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.320
This is actuallyóit was very interesting
because it was one of those things where--

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's a beautifully, beautifully drawn
game.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.339
&gt;&gt;Koh: We're gonna try a harder level, because
it's just more fun.

00:38:55.339 --> 00:38:56.339
So you're basically, essentially, controlling
a dragon.

00:38:56.339 --> 00:38:58.700
And your objective is throw, breathe fireballs
and fiery fury against all of your opponents.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.700
Right now, it's these little wizards.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.700
They're keeping your baby dragons captive.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.700
&gt;&gt;Dan: I thought they were gnomes.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.700
Maybe they are wizards.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.390
In any caseóso the thing-- The animation
is actually really, really well done on the

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.390
dragon.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:07.390
It feels almost like cartoon animation, which
is great.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:13.410
I would say the only sad thing for me about
this one was that the destruction of the buildingó

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.450
&gt;&gt;Koh: The building--
&gt;&gt;Dan: --was so boring!

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.450
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:17.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: They're not buildings.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.450
They don't behave.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.110
&gt;&gt;Koh: It's like Worms from old school.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.110
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.110
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right?

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.060
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is basically, it is exactly like
what you get in Worms.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.280
And you don't get things that are falling
in any reasonable way, you don't get any kind

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280
of destruction.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.640
It was kinda sad 'cause everything is so beautifully
done other than that that it was sorta sad.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.890
It doesn't mean the game isn't fun.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:34.890
The game is still fun.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:35.890
It's still beautiful.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:38.440
It's just that I was hoping that I was gonna
get this cool physics gameó

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.630
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah, see things blowing up.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:42.369
&gt;&gt;Dan: --and what I actually got was a very,
very old school kind of game.

00:39:42.369 --> 00:39:44.470
And when it came to the gameplay itself.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.320
That doesn't mean it's not fun.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.320
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.470
&gt;&gt;Dan: Let me say that.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.540
But I just wanted to see it taken to the next
level, especially knowing this was a sequel.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.430
That being said, the artwork is beautiful,
the game really is fun, it's got a lot of

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:54.560
greató
&gt;&gt;Koh: It's very animated.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: --elements, it's very well animated.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560
&gt;&gt;Koh: Well thought levels.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.560
Yeah.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.560
I mean, I thought, overall, it was a good
job.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.380
I think out of the set right now, this may
be, in terms of execution, probably the best

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.380
one.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.440
I just kinda wish that the--
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is the most polished of the games.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.030
&gt;&gt;Koh: Definitely the most polished.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:10.140
&gt;&gt;Dan: In terms of the art style, the look
and feel.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.460
All really, really blends together well.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.430
All of the elements are really well thought
out.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:18.710
As far as the most fun games to play, honestly,
both of the two first games are really fun.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.380
My favorite game was probably actually the--
&gt;&gt;Koh: 10 Pin Shuffle was actually pretty

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.380
fun.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: 10 Pin Shuffle was very fun.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.390
I liked, though, the weird gravity breakout
game.

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.330
I thought that wasó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.339
Space Out was pretty cool.

00:40:26.339 --> 00:40:27.690
&gt;&gt;Dan: Space Out had a lot of stuff going
for it.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:28.800
&gt;&gt;Koh: I just wish it had a different color
scheme.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.820
It was very dark.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.099
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was very dark.

00:40:31.099 --> 00:40:33.400
Maybe that wasó
&gt;&gt;Koh: I'm a very visual person.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.400
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.400
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Koh: If you want to impress me, it's all

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.400
about the visual.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.580
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: So I mean, I did want to mention, this

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.020
was the first time I've ever actually done
one of these shows without a hat.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.099
So this isó
&gt;&gt;Koh: [unintelligible]

00:40:43.099 --> 00:40:44.099
&gt;&gt;Dan: Not onlyóI know.

00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:46.180
Not only are we in the beautiful Building
44 arcade, or at least we're in front of the

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.180
Building 44 arcade, but we also haveóThis
is setting a new trend here.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.180
But yeah.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.760
In all seriousness, this game really has a
lot going for it.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.490
I just kinda want to see the developer take
it to the next level, because I think it could

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:54.490
be better.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.490
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:59.220
I just kinda wish that when you go up the
buildings, all those bricks and all that fall

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.220
apart and all that and stuff.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.240
But I guess that kinda would affect the level
design, because you can't hit the baby dragons

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.240
again after you destroy it.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.240
So it'sóBut overall, good job.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.240
And one other thing I wouldóYou know, when
you look at a presentation like this, you

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240
put this in front of marketing and merchandising
people, and they're not going to have any

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240
trouble featuring this in terms of the look
and feel.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.240
They're gonna say, "Oh, yes, this is the kind
of professionalism that people expect when

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240
they click on the feature graphic within Google
Play."

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.780
&gt;&gt;Koh: So I think the one thingóI think this
is the one game that did not have a back button

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.780
thing.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.000
So if you do press the back buttonóOh.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.350
But in the beginningóMaybe it was in this
one.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.350
It may have not been this one.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:17.530
There was a game where it was in mid-play,
when if you hit the back buttonóIt may have

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.530
been this one, actually.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:19.530
In mid-play.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:20.530
No, not this one.

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:21.530
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, there wasó
&gt;&gt;Koh: There was definitely another game with

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:22.530
a weird back button.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.530
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.290
This one handles it pretty well.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:26.290
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:27.290
&gt;&gt;Dan: There we go.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:28.290
&gt;&gt;Koh: Weather widget.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:32.800
&gt;&gt;Dan: So one of the things we like talking
about occasionally here on the show-- and

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.619
I'm going to move us back to our correspondence
slide here on the Friday Reviewóis the kind

00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:36.619
of games we're playing now.

00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:38.880
One of the ones that Koh brought to my attention
is we have the largest game ever onó

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: In terms of assets files.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: In terms of assets files.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.880
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Koh: So the reason why I was excited about

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.880
this game: it's called A Bard's Tale.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.880
It's from InXile Entertainment.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.880
And for all of you that follow the video game
news, you gamer nerds out there, InXile Entertainment

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.880
was founded by Brian Fargo.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.880
He's actually--
&gt;&gt;Dan: The founder of Interplay.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Founder of Interplay, who founded the
Wasteland series.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.880
So he successfully did Wasteland 2, kick started
Wasteland 2, which probably brought in, what?

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.880
Multi millions of dollars' worth of stuff?

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was certainly one of the most successful
of all times.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: It was pretty big amount of money for
a crowd-funding campaign.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: So he actually didóThis was originally--
I think it was originally on iOS and is now

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.880
ported to Android.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.880
It was recently released--
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was originally on Xbox.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Or Xbox.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.880
Yeah, it was back in 2004.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: And then they decided to move to move
to mobile.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.880
I think it first was on a differentóIt finally
is now on Android, so now it's mobile.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.880
So I was like, "Cool, I get to play this wherever
I want."

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.880
Whatever.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.880
So I was on my Nexus 7, and it was probably
the best choice, to be honest, 'cause I could

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.880
definitely tell it was made for the Nexus
7 tablet.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.880
But the total download asset file size was--
&gt;&gt;Dan: Monstrous.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.880
Almost 4 GB. 3 and a halfó
&gt;&gt;Koh: 3.6, 3.7 gigs?

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: So you definitely need Wifi. [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: You definitely need Wifi.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.880
And if you have an 8 gig Nexus 7, it's pretty
much the only thing that's gonna be on your

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.880
Nexus 7, but it mightó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Well, it actually is okay, because

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.880
it's probably when I don't haveóI don't keep
that many games that are on my tablet or still

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.880
on my tablet.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880
That is probably one of the few games that
will be still on my Nexus 7.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.880
But anyway.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.880
Absolutely.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.880
Hats off to developers for bringing such an
ambitious game over.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.880
It's completelyóI would say that, you know,
the thing with the Bard's Tale is it relies

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.880
so much on the musical element of the game
that itó

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.880
Music, audio.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's hard to bring the game over without
having it in there, but the music is enormous.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.880
There's just an enormous amount of audio in
this game.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.880
If there was a way to bring over this game,
this particular game, without having to have

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:25.880
the audio, it might actually allow for some
more casual gamers to actually get into the

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.880
game.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.880
The problem is that it's justóthe audio really
does provide some of the absolute best experience

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.880
within the game.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880
You could just go--
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880
I mean, some of the jokesóI mean, you can
tell, this is a very well scripted, this is--

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is an adult game, too.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:32.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: This is definitely an adult game.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Let's make this very, very clear.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: The humor is pretty funny.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.880
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's bawdy.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.880
If you've been to a Renaissance Faire, you
pretty much know what this game is gonna be

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.880
like.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: In fact, when I heardówhen I listened

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.880
to the first song of the game, I'm like, "I
know that I've heard that song at a Renaissance

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.880
Faire."

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: So you definitely have that element
in it.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.880
Yeah, you know, if you've got small children,
this is probably not the game to pander.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: You don't want to share your tablet
ifówith your small children.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.880
If you have this game on your thing.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: With this game, yeah.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880
Yeah.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880
It's definitely a game for you and your teenage
friends to play, and/or other adults.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880
It's definitely got that level of humor in
it.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: But it's very fun.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.880
It's very, very well done.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.880
And they did a beautiful job on the Tegrad
version for Nexus.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.880
No, it looks beautiful.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Just to switch over to the tablet really,
really quickly.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: I mean, we're only playing this on
a transformer.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.880
And if this is what it looks like on the transformer,
you can imagineóAnd actually, there's two

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.880
different versions.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.880
It doesóI mean, basically, the basic, the
actual files, standard file's about 1.6 gigs,

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880
but if you do have a Nexus 7 or any Tegra
3 tablet, or an NVIDIA tablet, then you will

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.880
be given the option to download the bigger
version.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: I thought this song was just so appropriate
for our Friday Review here.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs] Right.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: And yeah.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.880
You can actually hear this song basically
sung in its entirety at Renaissance Faires.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.880
But in all seriousness, this actuallyóSo
the transformer prime has the same GPU and

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.880
similar kind of capabilities to what we have
in the Nexus 7.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: All right.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.880
That's right.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.880
That's nice.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.880
That's anotheróI forgot about that.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.880
So this does have the truly awesome, massive
megadownload made available for the NVIDIA

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.880
chips.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880
And it really does look good, as you can see.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.880
It's just really, really great to get to see
it.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.880
So I thought I'd mention, because sometimes
we don't talk about what we're playing.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: And it's nice to say, "By the way,
in addition to all these other games that

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.880
we're playing, we're also spending time doing
this."

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880
So you can tell, yes, my range of games that
I like are pretty far.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.880
[laughs] Pretty extreme.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, that's why it's great to have
Koh here on the show.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: 'Cause pretty much, you know, there

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880
are games tható
&gt;&gt;Koh: Hey, I like my Match 3 games!

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hey, I like Match 3 games.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880
Yeah, that's why it's good to kinda mix things
up here on the Friday Review.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.880
Get lots and lots of different ideas.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880
And also find out what people are playing.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880
So yes.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.880
Tell us what you're playing.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.880
Make sure to go to the Moderator page, nominate
your favorite games, nominate games that you've

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.880
written, nominateó
&gt;&gt;Koh: Nominate games that you think we should

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.880
know about and talk about.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.880
If a game is awesome but something about it
just drives you nuts, let us know.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.880
Because we want to make games better on Android.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's our goal here.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: And it's okay if they're in another
language.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.880
I can actually speak and read Korean.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.880
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.880
And I can watch her speak and read Korean.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: So it all works out.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.880
So I think we're going to have a short show
here today on the Friday Review.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.880
So if there's anything elseóIs there anything
from the live stream that we should know about?

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.880
Is there anyone on the live stream?

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.880
&gt;&gt;Daniel: There's tons of people on the live
stream, but I think you answered the biggest

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.880
question, which was, "Where's your hat?" so
I think we'll leave it at that.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] Where's my hat?

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Where'só[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now everyone knows why Dan wears a

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.880
hat.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: But we do have Halloween coming up.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: We do.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: We should do a show about zombies or
witches oró

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.880
So if you see some great Halloween-themed
games out there, let's start getting them

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.880
nominated.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.880
If we see enough of them, we'll do a Halloween-themed
show.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: And we'll actually dress up.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.880
I mean, what would you dress up as, though?

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: I don't know.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880
That's a secret.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880
Maybe I'll leave that to the Moderator forums.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, yes.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.880
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Koh: They actually do a Halloween.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Maybe that's a bad idea.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's a bad idea.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.880
Yeah, exactly.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs] Right?

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Koh, you dress up, well, however you
like.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan: And we'll see with some anticipation

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.880
here.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.880
Set some suspense about what Koh might actually
dress up as for future episodes.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.880
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Koh: [laughs]

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.880
So that's it for us here at the Friday Review.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.880
Thank you, of course, once again to Daniel
Pham for being our engineer todayó

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Yeah!

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: --and making sure everything was running
smoothly.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.880
He also corralled us and made sure the show
happened today.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Right, right.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Which is always good.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880
And, of course, cheers.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.880
&gt;&gt;Koh: Cheers.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.880
Happy Friday, everyone.

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:32.883
&gt;&gt;Dan: Happy Friday.
