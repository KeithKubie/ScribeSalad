&gt;&gt; DUNCAN: Hello from Google I/O. My name
is Brandon Duncan and I'm the director of

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:18.300
engineering at LinkedIn.
&gt;&gt; So do you want to talk about what are your

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.679
favorite OpenSocial 0.9 features?
&gt;&gt; DUNCAN: Sure. So we recently upgraded to

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.519
OpenSocial 0.9 for our container on LinkedIn
and there's lot of interesting new features.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.489
But I think the one that really excites me
the most is data pipelining. This is going

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.829
to allow us to create very performant applications
because we're going to be able to provide

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.420
the third party partner with exactly the data
that they need to render the view that they're

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.989
going to present to the user. We do that all
in one shot so there's not a lot of network

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.340
traffic going between our data centers. This
is going to provide our users with the best

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.510
experience on our site, hopefully to the point
where they can't tell the difference between

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.269
what's natively the LinkedIn website and what's
third party applications being served through

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.750
OpenSocial. So LinkedIn is the world's largest
professional networking site. We've been around

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.430
for about six years and we have 41 million
members. We recently, in the last year, implemented

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.899
an application platform based on OpenSocial
technology. And we've done this because we

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.140
want to be able to tap into the wider developer
community so that they can provide our users

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.759
with innovative new features as well as we
recognize the fact that professionals in different

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.090
geographic locations may want to have features
that tailors specifically to the way they

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.159
do business. And this, again, the platform
allows us to take advantage of all these developers

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.430
who understand those local markets and can
build professional applications that appeal

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.039
to people in those markets.
&gt;&gt; And as developers, what are some of the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.570
worst stories and lessons you learned from
the technical challenge of using your product?

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.250
&gt;&gt; DUNCAN: So we've got a lot of interesting
stories. I think one that I won't forget for

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.070
a long time is, we actually wanted to make
our--we've been very focused on performance

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.650
for our OpenSocial platform and when we initially
launched, we were actually creating the iframes

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.900
that hosted the third party applications dynamically
using JavaScript. We wanted to move to more

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.750
of a static model, and we did that and we
actually increased performance quite a bit,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.690
but it turned out, the day before we were
about to release this, we realized that it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.599
wasn't working in Internet Explorer. So you
just, you know, reiterated to us the fact

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.069
that even today you have to deal with cross
browser compatibility issues, especially with

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.739
the technology like OpenSocial which is so
heavily based on JavaScript, which, you know,

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.209
there's obviously quirks with the different
browsers. So that definitely taught us, you

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.170
know, you don't want to spend three in the
morning, the night before you're releasing

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.459
code, trying to debug things and firebug and
using other tools, but, you know, we got through

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.510
that. But it definitely made me recognize
that in the future as more browsers start

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.010
to leverage, things like HTML5, we're going
to hopefully be able to standardize on a particular

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.069
method for doing cross iframe communications,
which is one of the big stumbling blocks,

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.420
I guess, I would say in terms of the technology.
&gt;&gt; So on containers, what's your favorite

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.400
app on your set?
&gt;&gt; DUNCAN: Yes. So in terms of my favorite

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.610
application, I would have to say that that's
the Company Buzz application. I think that's

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.769
the only one that I actually use pretty much
every single day. It's really great because

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:45.030
it essentially--it takes all the twits that
people are saying about LinkedIn or any other

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.980
company that I might be interested in, and
it gives me that in a nice filtered view so

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.720
I can see what are the trends. Are more people
twittering about my company today than yesterday?

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.930
Are they positive or negative? And I've actually
found some interesting, you know, uses of

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.959
reported bugs, and I've found out about new
features that people want simply by watching

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.040
Company Buzz.
&gt;&gt; People are always worried about security.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.680
How are you going to visit your security model?
&gt;&gt; DUNCAN: Well, I think even more so at LinkedIn,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.890
our users are very keen on making sure that
their private data stays private because we've

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.800
got people who--they don't want to get spammed
and don't necessarily want to be contacted.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.880
So when we built this application platform,
we were very concerned about, "Does the OpenSocial

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.270
standard provide for the rich set of APIs
that we want to provide but at the same time

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.130
allow us to control and make sure that partners
aren't abusing our system?" So for us, the

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.540
knowledge that partners are going to be authenticating
with us using well-known standards like OAT,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:59.010
you know, war-tested technologies, and the
fact that the OpenSocial APIs allow us to

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.250
provide the partners back with a very granular
set of field. So if a particular user said,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.390
"I don't want my previous companies being
shown on my profile," we can actually hide

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.440
that, and so when the developer asks us for
this person's profile, we won't include those.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.980
The standard allows us to do those things.
&gt;&gt; How are the business-caucus users taking

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.940
advantage of the social platform?
&gt;&gt; Well, being a professional network, we

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.290
certainly--we want to provide the every day
professional with reason to come to LinkedIn,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.040
and to actually get, you know, something valuable
out of it. So take for example the Amazon

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.400
book reading application, a lot of people
use Amazon and the type of reviews and information

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.680
that you can find about books on Amazon are
really valuable. It helps you make purchasing

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.490
decisions as a consumer. But when you combine
that with the social graph that LinkedIn provides

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.240
and the information that we know about people,
now you can do really interesting things like,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.500
for example, I might be a software engineer.
It would be very useful for me to know what

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.850
are the books that senior software engineers
or architects are reading right now. Or if

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.320
I'm in the real estate industry, what are
other real estate professionals are reading.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.320
So rather than just seeing reviews from a
random cross section of the population like

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.310
I might see on Amazon, you're actually able
to get more valuable information when you

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.440
combine that with the social graph, and OpenSocial
is the technology that allows us to do that.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.940
&gt;&gt; Brandon, we thank you for your time today
and we wish you well.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.800
&gt;&gt; DUNCAN: Sure. Thank you.
