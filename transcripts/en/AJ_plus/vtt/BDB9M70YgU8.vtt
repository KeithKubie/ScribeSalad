00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
The Republican Party is not

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.100
known for championing environmental causes.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.620
President Trump believes climate change is a hoax.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.460
Trump administration has announced plans to gut the Endangered Species Act.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.720
But today's open hostility towards green policies

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.420
wasn't always the Republican way.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.060
I think younger people might be surprised to know that the Republican Party

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.900
has not historically been opposed to environmental protection

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.520
or to conserving wild spaces and natural resources.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.600
In fact, much of the framework for environmental and conservationist policies today was laid down by the GOP.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440
Take the United States Forest Service for example.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.540
It was set up by Republican President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905 to protect wildlife and public lands.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.100
During his presidency, Roosevelt protected approximately 230 million acres of public land.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.480
And some of the most vast and far-reaching environmentally friendly policies

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.600
that fundamentally changed America were enacted by

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.880
this guy.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.380
Yes, that's right.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.540
Richard Nixon, the president better known for this:

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.100
One year of Watergate is enough.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.740
And this:

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.920
People have got to know whether or not their president's a crook.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.520
Well I'm not a crook.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.140
Nixon achieved some of the biggest green accomplishments of any modern American president

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.520
leaving an impressive record when it came to implementing policies

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.200
to protect the environment.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.080
He was from California and his base was in souther California that had seen smog

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.460
So he knew that politics and he knew how bad the smog and pollution could get

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.660
Nixon's administration with the help of a Democratic Congress

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.920
Passed many environmental initiatives

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.220
From institutional reform to pollution control

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.680
He was an institution builder at the federal level.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.080
I mean one of the big changes that happened

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.400
in his tenure as president was that

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.920
environmental regulation and pollution and public health, environmental health

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.120
It was moved up to the federal level because the states weren't doing a good enough job.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.200
It was an extraordinary example of cooperation between Republicans and Democrats.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.900
All those laws were passed on a bipartisan basis

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.200
People would be surprised to know, with overwhelming support from both parties.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.840
What's most notable is it wasn't especially controversial

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.000
You know, you've got Republican members of Congress supporting

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.500
clean air, clean water, trying to do something about toxic waste, and you have

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.280
Republican presidents signing the bills.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.800
This is almost impossible to think about nowadays.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.840
Environmentalism had become a big concern

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.060
for the American people in the late 60s and early 70s.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.380
In all too many parts of America, it's becoming more and more

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.900
difficult to find breathable air, drinkable water.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.820
They had witnessed a devastating oil leak in Santa Barbara, California,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.600
and rampant pollution in other parts of the country.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.720
New Yorkers learned about it at first hand when freak weather conditions

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.940
in July trapped poisonous fumes just above the city.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.620
Environment was kind of a unifying issue.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.020
It was an issue where Republicans such as him, they also thought that,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.900
you know, we needed clean water, that pollution was a really big concern.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.500
In 1968, Nixon created the Task Force on Environment.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.880
And Congress was also doing its part.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.660
It approved one of the first laws to establish a national framework

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.040
for environmental protection.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.940
The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.520
The purpose of the Act was, 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.260
and is to this day,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.120
to make sure the government conducts assessments before it begins

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.220
any federal projects that significantly affect the environment.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.560
That includes construction of airports, buildings and military complexes.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.480
But in 1970, Nixon proposed something that would change

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.540
the way the government dealt with the environment:

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.340
he submitted to Congress a plan to set up the Environmental Protection Agency,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.280
(the EPA).

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.400
Each chapter contains specific recommendations by the counsel

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.880
for strengthening our attack on environmental problems.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.200
Both Nixon and Congress were on a roll

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.660
They passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, in order to tackle air pollution

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.180
and set standards for what type of air pollutants can be released

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.020
In 1972, Nixon signed the Clean Water Act to regulate water quality.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.920
The Act also made it illegal to discharge pollutants into navigable waters

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.960
without a permit.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.400
And it wasn't just environmental legislation that Nixon was signing.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.220
In 1973, he approved The Endangered Species Act.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.620
The Act granted the government powers

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.020
to protect species at risk of extinction.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.000
Of course, whether Nixon was genuinely passionate

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.740
about saving the environment is up for debate.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.220
He was kind of pushed into it a little bit.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.880
He might not have done it had he not had a Democratic Congress

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.600
and as well as environmentally-informed advisers to steer him that direction.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.900
But whether it was political calculation

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.540
or a personal passion for the environment that drove Nixon's green policies,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.920
, the fact remains that a Republican president supported laws

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.860
that have significantly changed the lives of Americans.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.700
Clean air and clean water,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.440
the wise use of our land,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.300
the protection of wildlife and natural beauty,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.600
parks for all to enjoy...

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.580
these are part of the birthright of every American.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.280
So...what happened?

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.260
It's really the more recent Republican administrations

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.300
and the more recent Republican members of Congress,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.320
I'd say in the last 20 to 30 years, that have

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.340
really rolled back environmental protection.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.280
And during this period the more recent period, environmental protection

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.420
and especially climate change have become deeply partisan issues.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.460
And then, in 1981, a new president takes office

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.060
guided by a free-market ideology innately hostile to government regulation.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.580
What happens is Reagan comes in.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.200
Along with him are opponents of environmental protection

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.320
through regulation.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.720
What President Reagan did, which really set back environmental protections,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.300
he appointed a secretary of the Interior

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.460
and an administrator of the EPA

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.920
who were essentially opposed to the missions of those agencies.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.920
Reagan appointed Anne Gorsuch who,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.000
keep in mind, didn't like the EPA,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.600
to lead the EPA.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.920
And for two years they do what they can to curb it, to dismantle it.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.380
I mean, Anne Gorsuch took apart the whole enforcement division at the EPA.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.040
They proposed massive cuts in EPA and other environmental agencies

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.380
Watt wanted to open up all these federal lands to the oil drillers

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.020
and the grazers and so forth.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.740
The environmental programs managed to survive some blows by the Reagan administration

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.960
in large part due to pushback from Congress.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.420
The Senate belonged to the Republicans, but the House was a blue majority.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.160
Both Watts and Gorsuch eventually left.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.540
Reagan's next appointments were more friendly to the environmental agencies.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.920
The preservation of our environment is not a partisan challenge,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.680
it's common sense.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.560
But what happens during the Reagan administration

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.860
the embrace of anti-statism and a strong dislike for big government.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.880
And from there, the Republican party starts going through a bit of a metamorphosis.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.520
I wouldn't say it's been a kind of linear road where of Republicans suddenly decided

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.460
you know, on mass that they didn't care about the environment

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.940
I think that what's happened over time is a combination of things

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.000
One is this sort of embrace of deregulation generally in the Republican Party

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.920
I would say environmental protection was part of the deregulatory moment

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.840
in the Reagan administration. And it's part of an anti-federal government era

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.500
which Reagan of course ushered in when he said:

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.260
Government is not the solution to our problem.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.860
Government is the problem.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.720
Conservative think tanks and corporations also started getting involved.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.260
Since the 1990s

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.580
more than two-thirds of contributions

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.160
from the oil and gas industry

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.940
have gone to Republican candidates

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.360
and party committees.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.800
Another thing that changed?

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:05.520
The other is a kind of loss of moderate Republicans in the House and in the Senate.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.140
And the loss of that species of Republican means that you have much more

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.100
extreme Republicans.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.720
And there's kind of a similar dynamic happening over time

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.140
in the Democratic Party where you see a divergence between

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.700
your average Republican and your average Democrat,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.400
which makes bipartisan law very hard to pass.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.380
It may come as a surprise to know that one Republican president that was

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.500
surprisingly moderate and bipartisan when it came to the environment was

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.280
George H. W. Bush.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:39.000
If we believe every American expects and deserves clean air,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.080
and then we act on that belief.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.360
H. W. Bush actually should be known and given credit for being

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.540
quite an environmental president.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.500
He signed the most important revision of the Clean Air Act

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.200
since it was originally passed in 1970, and it included a system

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.900
for dealing with the problem of acid rain, which was destroying lakes and forests.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.720
The first ever market trading scheme for issuing allowances to pollute,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.860
but creating a scheme to buy and sell those allowances

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.860
as a kind of market mechanism for controlling air pollution.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.300
And then in the George W. Bush era, we saw really a period of, again, retrenchment.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.780
He pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol,

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.280
which was the international agreement on climate change at the time.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.920
But what really intensifies the partisan battle is:

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.800
climate change.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.900
It sort of creeps into consciousness as an issue,

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.160
and it only becomes a really compelling issue that the

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.280
public becomes familiar with in the late 90s and early 2000s

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.340
Clearly to me, this climate change issue is one of the principal challenges

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.360
that we face.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.560
A challenge that, should we fail to meet it, could imperil the lives of our children

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.240
and if not our children, our grandchildren.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.700
By that point it becomes clear that this is going to be a very partisan issue

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.640
because climate change is about the energy system.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.640
You know, it's about oil and gas, and how we fuel our electricity

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.060
and how we fuel our transportation.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.200
And suddenly it becomes clear that this is going to be

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.040
something the parties divide over.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.560
Jody Freeman was also a counselor for energy and climate change during the Obama presidency in 2009.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.620
After taking office, Obama attempted to get

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.240
a comprehensive climate and energy bill passed.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.320
But what Freeman and Obama found was that it's not just about

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.060
convincing the other party about the importance of

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.680
implementing extensive climate change policies.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.420
It's about convincing your own too.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.360
Even though it was a Democratic Congress

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.540
for the first two years of the Obama administration,

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.220
that new legislation could not get through.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.600
And that's because energy and climate change are not clearly just

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.760
Republican and Democratic issues, people don't vote just based on party.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.960
They vote based on where their state is positioned in terms of

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.260
what kind of resources they have.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.400
Are they a coal state?

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.440
Are they a wind state?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.840
Are they a state that's rich in renewables

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.420
or a state that has oil and gas?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.780
So, it;s very hard to get support even when you , your party,

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.140
controls the Congress.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:13.480
Once the midterm election happened, the Democrats lost control of the Congress.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.780
And so there was no way a climate change legislation

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.900
was going to get done.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.580
The Trump administration has made a targeted effort to roll back

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.740
Obama's legislations and efforts to combat climate change.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.840
The impact of these rollbacks could have detrimental consequences.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.080
The Republican Party went from this:

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.400
There is no disagreement with regard to the need for all nations

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.100
to cooperate, share their knowledge and their brains

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.240
in cleaning up the environment of the world.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.380
To this:

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.260
As someone who cares deeply about the environment, 

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.560
which I do,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.360
I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punished the United States

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.980
which is what [the Paris Agreement] does.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.460
We've lost our leadership role in the international community on these issues,

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.280
and the international community's really startled and disappointed

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.620
that the U.S. has disappeared on many other diplomatic issues.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.420
There's no question that this is a moment of complete retrenchment

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.700
on climate change and clean energy policy
