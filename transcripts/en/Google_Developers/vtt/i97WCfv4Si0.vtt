MARTIN OMANDER: Hello.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.690
My name is Martin
Omander, and I welcome you

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.580
to "Google Root Access,"
the show featuring

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.150
actionable startup advice.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.050
My guest today is Jakob Berglund
from the startup Unified

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.304
Intents.

00:00:17.304 --> 00:00:18.970
Jakob, tell us a bit
about your startup.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.845
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.970
So we have created an app called
Unified Remote that basically

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.280
turns your smartphone
into a universal remote

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.690
for your computer.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.930
So we support Linux,
Windows, and Mac.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.772
And we give you remote
controls for different programs

00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:34.480
on your computer.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.170
So VLC, Spotify, iTunes.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.540
And we also allow users to
create their own applications.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.750
So you can basically
control anything

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.780
you like on your computer
from Unified Remote.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.571
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah.

00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:50.295
So you're sitting in the couch,
and just pull out your phone,

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:52.610
and you control what music
plays on your computer.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.860
JAKOB BERGLUND: Exactly, yeah.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.734
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:55.370
I see.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.080
So in the last episode, I spoke
with your co-founder, Philip,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.020
and we spoke about
business stuff.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.970
Let's talk about technology
this time around.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.260
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.820
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.670
I'm an engineer.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.160
I love talking about technology.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.800
You're an engineer, too, right?

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.210
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.370
Exactly.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.540
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.610
So I went to the Play
Store and noticed

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.340
that you have 3
million downloads.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.650
Quite impressive.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.567
How did you get there?

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:15.441
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.790
Basically, we started early.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.880
So we were a couple of months
into Android was released,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.650
we released our app.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.820
And that, of course,
gave us a big boost,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.940
because we got all
the media attention

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.000
and because no one
else was on the store.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.030
So no one else
was written about.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.660
So every new cool app was
written quite a lot about.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.180
And we also always listen to our
customers as much as possible.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.080
So for support or
Google Analytics

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.285
or different kind of media.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:46.750
MARTIN OMANDER: Mm.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.100
Right.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.310
So now Android has been
around for a little while.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.790
What kind of new technologies
are you looking into now

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.875
to get that sort of
media boost again?

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:54.750
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.590
So we always look for
new, cool technologies.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.360
You can't support
everything, but you

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.000
have to pick the best ones.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.360
And right now, we're looking
to Android Wear, of course.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.940
But also other
wearable technologies,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.280
like Apple smart watch and--

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:10.449
MARTIN OMANDER: Mm.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.000
That would be pretty cool.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.640
You can sit on the couch and
control what music is playing,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.870
or movie is playing,
on your watch.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.745
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:02:15.745 --> 00:02:17.580
Because we want
to make the remote

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.550
control as useful, or as
close to you as possible.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.570
You should not have to
look for your remote.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.637
So on your wrist, you will
probably not lose your wrist.

00:02:27.637 --> 00:02:28.720
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, right.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.330
And you get that media hit
again from being among the first

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.510
on a new platform.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.180
Sounds like.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.920
Yeah.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.700
So your app, I looked at it.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.550
It contains many different
remote controls inside it,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.840
plug-ins for controlling
Spotify and VLC and so on.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.410
How do you decide which
pieces of software

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.636
to support within your app?

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.510
There's an infinite
number of apps out there.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.190
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah, obviously.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.450
So we started, of
course, with the big ones

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.050
like VLC or Spotify.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.840
But then we listened to
our customers, of course.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.190
And they requested quite a
lot of different applications.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.650
So we started adding them.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.350
And then we started
looking through Analytics

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.420
for which remotes
were used the most,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.670
and try to find similar
remotes, but also

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.140
improve some
remotes that we see,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.700
OK, this is not used that much.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.460
Or this is really used, so
we have a lot of uses there.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.100
Perhaps we should put even
more attention to that one.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.020
Or that one is
not used too much,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.900
so perhaps there is
something wrong with it.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.154
And then we reduce to that one.

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:35.070
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.294
So you say Analytics.

00:03:36.294 --> 00:03:37.710
What analytics are
you looking at?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.335
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah,
Google Analytics.

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:42.650
So we look at which countries
are people coming from?

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.640
But also which
remotes are most used?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.120
Which buttons are most
used in those remotes?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.960
And as much information
as we can gain,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.140
we try to use just to make
it as useful or as smooth

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.040
as possible for users to use.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.780
MARTIN OMANDER: So this is
the normal Google Analytics

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.055
that you might install
on your website?

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:03.930
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.110
It's the same thing, but
it's a different SDK.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.120
So just put in a JAR
file in your application,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.080
and add some code.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.570
There's a great guide
at Google, of course.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.480
So you can just add it.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.385
It's almost drag and drop.

00:04:18.385 --> 00:04:20.079
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, right.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.669
Oh, so you just imported your
file in your Android project,

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.710
and then you have access?

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.146
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:24.820
Exactly.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.637
So you add some small piece
of code, and everything works.

00:04:27.637 --> 00:04:28.720
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, right.

00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:32.650
Are there any other insights
you get from Google Analytics

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.000
like how people find
the application,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.150
or geography, or anything else?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.230
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.110
Because we have a server
version, or a server

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.670
part of our software, we have
a website people have to use.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.250
You have to get that server.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.720
And then we see from which
countries or from which

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.520
links that people are
going to our website.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.850
So we get quite a lot of traffic
there, and that, of course,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.620
helps us also to-- oh, that
website has written about us.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.365
Perhaps we could boost
that by just putting it

00:05:06.365 --> 00:05:08.590
on Facebook or whatever.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.690
So we always look
for all kind of data

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.589
to find interesting parts.

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:16.380
MARTIN OMANDER: Mm.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.880
Right.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.580
Great.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.200
So finally, what
would your advice

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.230
be to a mobile startup
starting today,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.456
when it comes to new technology
platforms and analytics?

00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:26.330
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.960
Pretty much, start
as soon as possible.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.790
You have to be first on market.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.810
If you're first on market, you
will get the media attention.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.310
But also, of course,
listen to your customers

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.410
and try to understand
what your customer needs.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.160
And Google Analytics is
one way of doing that.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.645
Of course, support and other
social media is also useful.

00:05:48.984 --> 00:05:49.900
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.610
Great.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.880
Thank you for sharing your
experiences with us, Jakob.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.213
JAKOB BERGLUND: Yeah, thank you.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.058
MARTIN OMANDER: Hopefully, you
found something useful there

00:05:57.058 --> 00:05:58.860
that you can use
in your startup.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.710
