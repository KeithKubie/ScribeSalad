LINDSAY MCGREGOR: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.490
Thank you for coming.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.414
My name is Lindsay.

00:00:03.414 --> 00:00:04.580
NEEL DOSHI: My name is Neel.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.600
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: And we're the
authors of "Primed to Perform,"

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.058
and we're here to
talk to you today

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:11.350
about what creates a
high performing culture.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.870
But before we talk about what
creates a high performing

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.239
culture, we have to
talk about what creates

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.712
a high performing individual.

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:20.670
So I'm going to ask the
audience, do any of you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.176
have kids?

00:00:22.176 --> 00:00:24.190
Anyone have high
performing kids?

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.370
Who has a kid who's 18
months old or older?

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.340
What are they like?

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.160
Can they walk?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.830
Can they talk?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.350
Can you describe
them a little bit?

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.040
Active-- what else?

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.930
Other people with kids, or
people who have recently

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.080
seen an 18-month-old?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.140
Yep, what are they like?

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.622
Rebellious, yes.

00:00:46.622 --> 00:00:48.410
What's that?

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.900
Is there something else?

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.440
So they don't follow your
directions all the time, right?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.404
They don't do exactly
what you tell them to do.

00:00:55.404 --> 00:00:57.820
So I'm going to tell you about
an experiment in which they

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.450
looked at toddlers to see
how helpful they wear.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.200
How helpful you are, or
your level of citizenship,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.650
is one type of
performance that's

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.060
really important
for an organization.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.750
I'm sure you all
want teammates who

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.710
will help you out
when you're overworked

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.470
or need an extra little help.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.500
I'm sure you all
have teammates, who

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.110
you want to help out the
team rather than just do

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.460
things for themselves.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.480
So here was the experiment.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.320
They set up the
toddlers in a room.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.790
The room went from
about me to the podium.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.750
And in the middle of the floor
was a toddler with the toy--

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.980
a really fun toy that lit up
and made music and sounds.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.930
And over here in the corner
was a research assistant.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.210
She was sitting behind a
table doing an activity, when

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.370
occasionally she
would drop something

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.390
off the edge of the
table by "mistake."

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.220
The [INAUDIBLE] wanted to see
if when she dropped that thing,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.850
the toddler would
leave his toy way

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.770
and go help a stranger
by picking up the object.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.790
So I'm going to ask
you guys to vote.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.632
How many of you think that
more than 50% of these toddlers

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:00.465
helped the stranger?

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.540
How many think less than
50% helped the stranger?

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.560
We've got a mixed room--
child lovers and child haters.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.555
Let's see what
actually happened.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.120
What's that?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.040
Realistic-- realists
and idealists, exactly.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.110
Here's the experiment.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.190
Let's take a look.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.078
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:33.070
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: The
researcher is folding papers.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.535
-Half.

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.014
Oh!

00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:39.472
-Oh!

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:39.972
-Thank you.

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:50.120
LINDSAY MCGREGOR:
It's adorable, right?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.861
This little kid just
gets up, goes over

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:53.860
and helps this stranger.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.060
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.340
Now, it turns out that half
of you were of course right.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.560
Over 90% of toddlers
actually helped-- over 90%.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.060
That's huge.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.510
But that wasn't actually
the point of the experiment.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.550
The point was to see if we
could make toddlers even more

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.930
helpful.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.710
So how do we make
people more helpful?

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.994
How do we encourage a behavior?

00:03:15.994 --> 00:03:17.410
There was the
control group, where

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.950
they went through an exercise,
like this or one very

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.590
similar to this,
over and over again.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.490
The next group was praised.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.030
Praise is a really
good way to show

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.220
that you value an activity.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.136
The third group received
electric shocks.

00:03:32.136 --> 00:03:34.630
No, I'm just kidding.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.660
But you kind of looked like
you would enjoy watching that.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.650
The third group was
rewarded with a toy.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.930
That's like a little
bonus for a toddler.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.010
This is a great way to reinforce
an activity that you really

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.610
like.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.100
This is what we do
in organizations.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.780
So think in your head,
how much more helpful

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.830
was the praise group,
and how much more helpful

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.340
was the reward group
than the control?

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.450
How much of a difference
did these things make?

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.900
Let's take a look.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.140
The control group-- 89%
of them kept helping again

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.030
and again and again when the
researcher dropped an object

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.560
over the table.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.990
Praise group-- 81%
of them kept helping.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.890
That's the reverse of what
many of us would expect.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:27.590
The reward group-- 53% of them
kept topping-- a dramatic drop

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.310
from something that we think is
going to increase performance.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.480
We're all with our families
and our organizations

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.660
to use things like
praise and reward

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.000
to reinforce and encourage
the type of performance

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.200
that we like.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.576
This is doesn't work
exactly the way we expect.

00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:44.950
NEEL DOSHI: This should come
as a surprise to many people

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.230
because when we've
seen organizations,

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.510
hundreds of organizations,
praise and reward

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.810
are the dominant
strategies of how

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.712
they try to drive performance.

00:04:53.712 --> 00:04:55.170
Just for fun, I'm
going to show you

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.704
what a child looked like
who was in the reward group.

00:04:57.704 --> 00:04:59.120
Now, keep in mind,
this kid looked

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.682
like just the other one-- popped
up, helped out the stranger.

00:05:02.682 --> 00:05:04.140
But this is what
it looks like when

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.306
he was trained with rewards.

00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:07.830
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.991
-Uh-- oh!

00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:19.890
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Oh.

00:05:22.627 --> 00:05:24.710
NEEL DOSHI: What I love
is as adults if you're not

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.380
going to help somebody,
you look away.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.838
This kid just keeps
staring at her.

00:05:31.612 --> 00:05:33.570
And it goes on for an
uncomfortably long period

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.240
of time.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.675
-[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:39.050
NEEL DOSHI: That's
child language

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.820
for, "you're on your own."

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.862
There you go.

00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:47.470
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.000
What we learn from
this experiment

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.829
and, at this point, thousands of
others, especially with regard

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:55.120
to our core question, how do
we build a high performing

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.410
culture, what we learned
is that we actually

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.500
have to answer three different
questions to get there.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.180
The first question we have to
answer is, what is performance?

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.680
In the case of this
experiment, they

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.305
looked at citizenship, something
that few people would actually

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:09.037
treat as part of performance.

00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:10.870
The second question we
have to ask ourselves

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.972
is, what drives performance?

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:14.930
What is that psychology
that drives the highest

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.334
levels of performance?

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.000
And the third question
we have to answer

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.600
was, how does culture
play a role in that?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.157
So we're going to do that in
the course this conversation.

00:06:24.157 --> 00:06:25.990
We're going to answer
these three questions.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.037
Well, let's start with
what is performance.

00:06:29.037 --> 00:06:31.620
To answer that question I'm gong
to share with you an anecdote

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.130
that we pulled out of history.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.240
We love this anecdote
because it really shares

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.600
the nuance of performance.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.996
This story takes place in 1805.

00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:41.495
It's 1805.

00:06:41.495 --> 00:06:43.340
We're in continental Europe.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.480
During that time, Napoleon
had amassed the dominant army

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.130
of the day, and with his army he
more or less conquered Europe.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.380
But while Napoleon had the
dominant army of the day,

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.750
anyone guess what
the British had?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.790
They had the dominant
navy of the day.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.894
And as long as the British
had the dominant navy,

00:07:01.894 --> 00:07:03.810
Napoleon could never
land troops on the island

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.500
and never conquer it.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.890
So Napoleon just
conquered Spain.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.930
He set his eyes on England.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.330
He created an armada,
where he combined

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.750
the Spanish and French fleets.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.959
What we're about to talk about
is the battle of Trafalgar.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.500
So Jeopardy question
of today, anyone

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.770
guess who the commander
of the British fleet

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.250
was during the
battle of Trafalgar?

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.340
Nelson, that's absolutely right.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.660
So during the battle
of Trafalgar, 1805,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.450
stakes were high.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.660
The battle takes place
off the coast of Spain,

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.340
so Nelson and his is fleet
are not in home territory.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:47.790
Nelson's fleet of 33 ships,
a total of 2,318 cannon.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:53.140
The Spanish and French--
40 ships, 2,868 cannon.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.240
So Nelson is outgunned
and outnumbered.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.430
At the time, typically
naval warfare

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.656
was a sign of strength
against strength.

00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.655
The two fleets would float
up against each other

00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:06.410
in parallel lines.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.310
They'd shoot at each other
till somebody got tired of it.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.112
Then they'd go limping off.

00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:12.195
There's a reason for that.

00:08:12.195 --> 00:08:14.111
It sounds silly, but
there's reasons for that.

00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:16.440
One was concentration
of firepower.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.950
All your cannon are
facing sideways,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.540
so it makes sense
to line them up.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.980
You want to avoid friendly fire.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.022
The other reason
was more subtle.

00:08:24.022 --> 00:08:25.480
So imagine this;
you're an admiral.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.795
You're commanding 33 ships.

00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:28.170
You're in the
middle of a battle.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.530
You want to issue commands
to the other ships.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.289
How do you do that?

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.980
Any guesses?

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.900
Yeah, flags-- that's
why the admiral's ship

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.470
was called the flagship.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.070
And so in order to make
sure your whole fleet had

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.489
line of sight to
your flagship, it

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:44.914
was just easiest to line them.

00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:46.830
That way you knew that
everyone could actually

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.120
see your command structure.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.710
Nelson, going into
this battle, knew

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.710
if he was fighting
strength against strength,

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.000
he would lose.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.680
Maybe at the best he
could squeak out a draw.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.570
More likely, he'd lose.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.297
So here's what we did.

00:09:01.297 --> 00:09:02.880
In the weeks leading
up to the battle,

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.590
he had all the
captains of the ships

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.880
meet on his flagship
for dinner every night.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.630
In that dinner, part
of it was celebrating

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.920
the camaraderie, The
Brotherhood, he called them,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.800
his band of brothers.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.350
But part of it was explaining
the two halves of his strategy.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.570
The first half was he was
going to instead of lining up

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.300
in parallel to the enemy line,
his fleet, the Red Ships,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.470
were going to approach the enemy
in two perpendicular columns.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.190
His thought process
was, if I do this,

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.740
I can cut out the bottom
third of the enemy's line,

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.751
and by the time they swing
back around, it'll be too late.

00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:38.250
The other thought
process was he was

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.920
going to point one of the lines
straight at the enemy flagship.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.836
If he takes out the
enemy's command structure,

00:09:42.836 --> 00:09:44.910
they'll just crumble.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.950
And this is a high
risk maneuver.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.710
While those two lines are
approaching the enemy line,

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.660
they're taking fire
that they can't return.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.672
So Nelson puts his
too strongest ships

00:09:54.672 --> 00:09:56.130
at the very front
of those columns.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.010
One of them was his own ship.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.710
Nelson was at the front
of one of these columns.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.040
That was the tactics
of this plan.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.570
However, he also said to his
captains, after we do this,

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.820
I can't possibly predict
what's going to happen.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.580
Who knows?

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.871
Who knows how this is going
to play out once we execute

00:10:13.871 --> 00:10:15.860
this side of the strategy?

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:21.140
So once we do, you have it
within your degrees of freedom

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.420
to figure out what to do next.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.780
Essentially, find the enemy ship
nearest you and figure it out.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.410
That's what he
told his captains.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.740
Those were the two
halves of his plan.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.440
So the morning of the battle it
looks more or less like this.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.355
The tactical side of his plan
works exactly like planned.

00:10:35.355 --> 00:10:37.520
He takes out the enemy
flagship in the beginning,

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.580
cuts the enemy line into three.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.700
Now, he told his troops
before the battle,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.270
don't even look at my
flagship because I'm not

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.132
going to issue commands
during the battle.

00:10:46.132 --> 00:10:48.340
It's a good thing he said
that because in the opening

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.990
minutes of the battle he dies.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.920
He was on one of the
lead ships, after all.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.040
By the time the smoke settles,
the British sink or capture

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.580
over 20 of the Spanish
and French fleet.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.940
The British didn't
lose a single ship.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.240
The victory was so lopsided,
at a time when people actually

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.710
thought that the defeat would be
lopsided, that this battle was

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.860
studied ad nauseum
because they realized

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.272
there was more to performance
than we really understand.

00:11:18.272 --> 00:11:19.730
LINDSAY MCGREGOR:
So this scenario,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.650
and many, many others, have
taught us that there's actually

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.820
two types of performance.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.730
The first one is what we
call tactical performance,

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:34.840
and this is how effectively
you execute the plan.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.150
The other type of
performance however

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.310
is adaptive performance,
and this is how well

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.660
you diverge from the plan.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.540
One is how well you stick to it.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.620
The other is how well
you diverge from it.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.370
One is how well you do it.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.060
The other is how
well you don't do it.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.970
And these two things
are actually opposites.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.910
So take three short examples.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.720
First, Nelson, what
we've just been

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.590
talking about-- in the beginning
of the battle, all of the ships

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.920
followed the plan.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.530
They have high
tactical performance.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.800
Once the battle
becomes unpredictable,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.510
all of the captains adapt.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.150
Think about another
example-- a business example.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.390
Imagine that we were all going
to run a customer service

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.810
center, a call center.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.240
And all of us would probably do
a pretty good job of setting up

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.900
the tactical performance.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.630
We'd estimate how
many calls were

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.880
going to come in,
how long each service

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.820
rep should spend on the phone.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.410
We'd probably put metrics
and dashboards everywhere.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.110
But if you start to hammer
down on tactical performance

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.709
too much, you start
to kill the adaptive.

00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:43.250
Have you ever been
on the phone where

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.230
you're talking to a
customer service you

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.210
can tell that they're
reading a script to you?

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.130
And it's really irritating
because your problem isn't

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.770
in their script, and
you need them to adapt.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.930
That's the service center
that has doubled down

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.140
on tactical performance
so much, but they've

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.140
killed adaptive performance.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.240
Imagine if we were all
the board of trustees,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.545
and we were helping
the CEO to do his job.

00:13:07.545 --> 00:13:09.750
A CEO with good
tactical performance

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.500
would have a strategy and a
work plan and goals and metrics.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.720
He'd have an estimate of
how much earnings per share

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.040
he would want per quarter.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.350
But a CEO that had doubled down
on the tactical performance

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.780
too much would be
the type who would

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.710
be hitting those
tactical performance

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.460
metrics, like earnings
per share every quarter,

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.330
to such an extent that
he was missing out

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.080
on the adaptive opportunities.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.730
When researchers measure
executives, most of them

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.170
say that they would forego
value-creating activities

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.340
if it was going on their
earnings per share numbers

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.820
because those
organizations are so

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.430
focused on the tactical
and not the adaptive.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.204
NEEL DOSHI: Now, my
guess is everyone

00:13:53.204 --> 00:13:55.620
in this room would do a great
job of tactical performance.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.744
We all know how to do this.

00:13:56.744 --> 00:13:58.497
This is machinery
and knowledge that

00:13:58.497 --> 00:14:00.080
has been built over
the last 100 years

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.397
on how to manage a business.

00:14:01.397 --> 00:14:03.730
But most of that is around
tackle performance; how do we

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.400
drive for predictability?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.450
So if that machinery,
when overused,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.070
destroys adaptive performance,
then the next question becomes,

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.934
what drives adaptive
performance?

00:14:14.934 --> 00:14:16.600
Looking at experiments
like the toddlers

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.474
that you saw earlier
and thousands of others,

00:14:18.474 --> 00:14:22.120
we are actually able to draw
a very simple conclusion.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.570
Why we work determines
how well we work.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.587
A person's "why" is the driver
of their adaptive performance.

00:14:29.587 --> 00:14:31.795
Now, I'm not going to ask
you to take my word for it.

00:14:31.795 --> 00:14:33.450
We're going to
prove this to you.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.908
But before we prove
it to you, I've

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:37.080
got to give you a
language and a framework

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.584
to understand the reasons why
people do just about anything.

00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:42.375
This framework we call
the motive spectrum.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.320
In this framework, it first
starts with the realization

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.630
that a person's motive, the
reason for doing something,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.081
can come from one
to three places.

00:14:52.081 --> 00:14:53.080
There's the work itself.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.750
There's their own identity,
their values, their beliefs,

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.590
and then they are
external forces,

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.334
like your mother-in-law.

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.250
Lindsay's my wife, so
this is our inside joke.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.690
When you look at
the motives that

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.250
can be combined with
these three ingredients,

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.400
the first motive you get is
what we call the play motive.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.220
The play motive,
the motive itself,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.917
is symbolized by the circle.

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:19.250
But with the play motive, the
motive is the work itself.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.840
The work is its own reward.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.150
Think of a hobby
that you do, a hobby

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.660
like a woodworking or
photography or a sport.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.702
Nobody pays you to do it.

00:15:26.702 --> 00:15:28.618
You're not doing it for
any particular reason.

00:15:28.618 --> 00:15:29.770
You just enjoy doing it.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.870
Think about why kids
play, that notion

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.860
of self-directed learning,
curiosity, experimentation,

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.310
exploration.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.670
That's the play motive.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.250
One step removed
from play is what

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.896
we call the purpose motive.

00:15:41.896 --> 00:15:43.270
Purpose motive--
now the circle's

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.020
a little further to the
right because unlike play,

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.720
which is the work
itself, purpose

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.490
is when you identify
with or believe

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.960
in the outcome of the work.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.720
Play is the work itself.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.140
Purpose is the
outcome of the work

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.661
that you actually identify with.

00:15:57.661 --> 00:15:59.660
The next one's what we
call potential-- circle's

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.220
a little further
over to the right.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.260
Because with potential,
you found that the work

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.790
enhances your potential.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.300
So a second or third
order outcome of the work

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.140
actually benefits your
own identity, your values,

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.180
and beliefs.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.430
That's why the circle's a
little further to the right.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.910
So a teacher at play enjoys
creating lesson plans,

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.990
tending to the classroom,
engaging with students.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.230
A teacher with purpose does
it because he feels like he

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.990
believes in educating children.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.517
A teacher with
potential might say,

00:16:26.517 --> 00:16:28.350
I want to be a school
administrator one day,

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.235
and this is a stepping
stone to getting there.

00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:33.610
These three motives are all
connected to the work itself,

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.300
so we call them
the direct motives.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.840
They're directly connected
to the work itself.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.125
The next, we call them
emotional pressure.

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:44.200
The circle is now disconnected
from the work itself, so

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.050
think about guilt.
Show of hands here,

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.850
anyone ever use guilt to get
a loved one to do something?

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.060
Show of hands-- guilt.
We've all done it.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.700
If you think about that,
let's say I guilt Lindsay

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.360
into taking out the trash.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.370
She might take out the
trash, but she's not

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.370
doing it for play
purpose or potential

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.760
having to do it that activity.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.970
She's doing it to
alleviate the guilt.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.670
The motive is now separate
from the activity itself.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.079
Peer pressure, FOMO,
sense a disappointment--

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.810
these are all versions
of emotional pressure.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.109
The next is what we
call economic pressure.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.150
It's when you're doing
something to gain a reward

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:25.166
or avoid a punishment that's now
separate from the work itself.

00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:26.540
And then lastly,
you get inertia.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.433
This is my favorite one.

00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:28.840
This is when you ask
somebody, why are you

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.030
doing what you're doing?

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.664
And they say, I don't know.

00:17:31.664 --> 00:17:33.330
I'm doing it because
I did it yesterday,

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.620
because I did it the day
before, because I did it

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.200
the day before that.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.157
I'm doing it because
I'm doing it.

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:40.240
You'd be amazed by how
much inertia there actually

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.590
is in the workplace.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.590
These three we call
the indirect motors.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.200
When we've studied
performance through this lens,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.810
we've been able to
conclude two things.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.980
The first is the direct motives
increase adaptive performance,

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.022
and the indirect
ones destroy it.

00:17:58.022 --> 00:17:59.730
The second thing we
were able to conclude

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.490
is the closer the
motive is to the work

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.790
itself, the more powerful.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.740
Play the most powerful, then
purpose, then potential,

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.730
inertia the most destructive,
then economic pressure, then

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.620
emotional pressure.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.790
Those two findings
are so consistent,

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.580
we can boil them into a
single concept called TOMO.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.730
TOMO, short for
Total Motivation,

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.060
occurs when your culture
maximizes play, purpose,

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.960
potential and minimizes
emotional pressure,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.840
economic pressure, and inertia.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.025
A low TO MO culture
does the opposite.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:30.900
It makes people's motives
emotional pressure,

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.900
economic pressure, and
inertia, and actually, it

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.782
reduces play, purpose,
and potential.

00:18:34.782 --> 00:18:36.740
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: So
we're going to take a look

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.770
at these motives in action.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.830
So I don't know about
you guys, but I've always

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.690
loved doing math problems.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.130
I was the nerd in
elementary school

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.630
who would stay and play with
the bricks and the math puzzles

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.190
during recess, instead of
go out and play sports.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.630
I think these guys were, too.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.210
So I'm going to ask you
guys to do a little math

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.457
problem in your seats.

00:18:57.457 --> 00:18:58.665
I'm not going to call on you.

00:18:58.665 --> 00:19:00.350
It's just for yourself.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.466
I'm going to show up
a grid of numbers,

00:19:02.466 --> 00:19:04.715
and there's going to be two
numbers that add up to 10,

00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:07.240
and I want you to find
those two numbers.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.480
So here we go.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.230
The two numbers
that add up to 10.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.550
I think some people have.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.035
Who's got it?

00:19:31.035 --> 00:19:31.785
Yep, the back row.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.120
Bottom left and bottom
right, that's correct.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.300
Now, back row person, everybody
on the end of every row,

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.347
can you please stand up.

00:19:45.347 --> 00:19:47.305
Unfortunately, I'm going
to interrupt some hes.

00:19:50.872 --> 00:19:51.830
Not going to volunteer?

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.490
OK.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.660
You, you're taking his place.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.830
All right.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.530
So now I'm going to have this
row do the same activity,

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.700
except I want all of you
to not look at the screen.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.700
I want you to look
at these guys.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.180
I want you to watch them.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.020
I want you to see
who does it fastest.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.430
I want to see if they turn.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.190
As you can see, getting nervous.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.420
You guys, when you get the
problem, you can sit down.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.150
We're going to see who's
the last one standing.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:21.830
On your marks, get set, go.

00:20:30.052 --> 00:20:32.010
We usually have people
write down their answers

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.325
because we often find people
cheat just to sit down.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.220
All right, I'm going
to let you sit down.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.146
NEEL DOSHI: It's worth
noting that this guy-- sorry,

00:20:46.146 --> 00:20:48.530
I don't know your name--
was one of the first people

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.120
to solve it the first time.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.700
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: So
what happened here?

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.580
I was shifting their motives.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.970
Did any of you feel different
the second time around?

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.970
Were you paying attention--
what felt different?

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.090
More pressure?

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.510
You're paying attention to
the audience a little bit more

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.510
than the puzzle.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.125
You're paying attention to
when your neighbor sits down.

00:21:13.125 --> 00:21:14.583
NEEL DOSHI: You're
asking yourself,

00:21:14.583 --> 00:21:15.907
why did I come here today?

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:17.990
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: Exactly,
your mind's distracted.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.810
You're in two places at once.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.862
What we did was we
shifted your motives.

00:21:22.862 --> 00:21:25.070
There's the answer, by the
way, if you're interested.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.870
We shifted your motives.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.730
The first time we
did this exercise,

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.630
I told you about
how I loved math,

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.410
and that it was going
to be in your seats,

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.100
and you wouldn't
have to be called on.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.558
So I was really
trying to encourage

00:21:35.558 --> 00:21:37.090
that play motive
with this is math.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.000
You do math for fun.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.930
The second time around
I really ramped up

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.690
that emotional pressure
and that economic pressure

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.760
by making everybody watch you.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.450
That was the emotional pressure.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.969
The economic pressure is
I forced you to do it.

00:21:50.969 --> 00:21:52.010
You didn't have a choice.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.930
You weren't volunteers.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.900
Changing why you're
doing something

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.100
changes your performance.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.910
They've done experiments
like this with MIT students,

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.670
where at least 25% of the class
has a perfect math SAT score.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.750
And by changing the
TOMO of those students,

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.240
they've changed their ability
to do simple addition.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.150
The success of this group of MIT
students on simple math puzzles

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:19.890
changed by 32%, just with
simple changes in their motives.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.570
That's huge.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:24.080
Imagine a 30% difference
in your team's performance.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.790
NEEL DOSHI: What
you see here is what

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.950
we call a distraction effect.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.210
If you take just about
any job, any job that

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.120
exists there's a component
of that job that's

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.590
tactical performance, where
you want consistency, scale.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.120
There's a component that is
adaptive performance, where

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.630
you want creativity,
problem solving, resilience,

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.720
citizenship.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.600
Every job has these two pieces.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.197
You have somebody with
high TOMO, you get both.

00:22:47.197 --> 00:22:48.780
But in this case,
your poor colleagues

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.340
that we tortured
for a few minutes,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.970
we reduced their TOMO for the
activity, and what you got

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.412
was a distraction effect.

00:22:54.412 --> 00:22:56.370
When you ask people who
are doing this problem,

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.720
are you trying to do it?

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.169
They'd say usually, I'm
trying harder the second time.

00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:01.710
But they're trying
to do the problem,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.300
but their ability
to actually put

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.994
their minds to a problem
solving activity decreases.

00:23:06.994 --> 00:23:08.410
The funny thing
is we can actually

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.797
do worse to people than
the distraction effect.

00:23:10.797 --> 00:23:12.880
So I'm going to ask these
folks to stand up again.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.588
I'm just kidding.

00:23:13.588 --> 00:23:15.420
I'm not going to do that.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.260
They're about to walk out.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.810
To illustrate what's worse
than distraction effect,

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.682
I'll share with
you an experiment.

00:23:21.682 --> 00:23:23.640
The experiment was done
by a Harvard professor.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.900
She gathered a group of poets
in her laboratory-- professional

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.862
poets.

00:23:28.862 --> 00:23:31.320
She was going to have them
write a haiku, a very short poem

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.330
all on the topic of laughter.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.790
So they have the same
topic, the same word count.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.570
However, before they were
to write their poems,

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.130
she had one group of them read
a list of indirect reasons

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.730
for why they're a
poet, so reasons like,

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.760
I continue to write poetry
because I don't want

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.460
to disappoint a
mentor of mine, or I

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.850
continue to write
poetry because I once

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:56.190
heard of another poet who made
a lot of money after publishing.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:59.290
She had another group read
a list of direct reasons,

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.260
for instance, I enjoy
playing with words.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.590
So these two groups read their
two lists, two-minute exercise,

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.150
then they wrote their poems,
which were independently

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.350
evaluated for their creativity.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.640
Now, creativity, a form
of adaptive performance,

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.680
highly prized in
organizations, and when

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.650
she did this experiment,
there was a 28% difference

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.910
in the creativity scores
of the group who's

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.350
TOMO was lowered versus the
group who's TOMO was raised.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.210
Now, think about if two
minutes of reading a list

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.570
can cause this kind of
difference in creativity,

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.611
imagine what the whole
culture of an organization

00:24:33.611 --> 00:24:36.690
does-- one that makes you
think about the play, purpose,

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.720
and potential of
your work, versus one

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.060
that makes you think about
the emotional pressure,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.400
economic pressure, and
inertia of your work.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.390
Two minutes of reading
a list does that.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.160
Imagine what a
whole culture, what

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.700
you're experiencing every
day of your work life,

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.950
imagine what that does.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.970
Now what you have here is
what we call the cancellation

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.420
effect.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.500
When somebody's TOMO
is reduced even lower,

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.260
they're still trying to
tactical performance,

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.270
but the adaptive more
or less disappears.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.970
You ever think to
yourself, maybe

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:07.930
about your own
performance, maybe

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.721
about a colleague's,
and you say, you know,

00:25:09.721 --> 00:25:12.140
that person's just
checking the boxes.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.950
They're just checking the boxes.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.164
What do we mean by that?

00:25:15.164 --> 00:25:16.830
That's actually the
cancellation effect.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.160
They're doing everything
that's measured,

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.960
everything's that's
managed, everything

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.080
that's actively asked of them.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.640
But all of the adaptive
performance has disappeared.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.430
They've been canceled out.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.010
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: We can
actually do even worse.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.440
So I'm going to go back
to the 1800s for a story

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.980
to demonstrate it to colonial
India, the city of Delhi.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.320
The city was overrun
with cobras-- snakes.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.180
This is not a
British garden snake.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.460
When it can stand up, it's
a whole new level of scary.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.320
And the British government
wanted to reduce the cobras.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.060
So what did they do?

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.910
They did what any
logical person would do.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.660
They put a bounty on
the head of every cobra.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.660
Every time you brought
in a dead cobra,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.720
you would get some money.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.170
Now, cobras were coming
in by the bucket load.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.490
It looked like a great success.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.230
Until they discovered that some
enterprising locals had started

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.990
cobra farms.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.750
They were breeding
cobras in order

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.000
to bring them in for the bouncy.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.180
Now, reportedly when the British
government learned of this,

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.270
they canceled the bounty,
and all the farmers

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.383
let their snakes go.

00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:26.760
It wasn't even
worth killing them.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.130
And the cobra
population of Delhi

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:33.659
was higher at the end of this
than it was at the beginning.

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:34.700
So what's happening here?

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:40.660
This cobra affect, an unintended
consequence, looks like this.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.220
Tactical performance
still look high.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.030
You've got dead snakes
coming in by the bucketful.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.650
Adaptive performance
is low, and you've

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.810
got a whole new
type of performance,

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:56.920
maladaptive performance,
which is high.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.790
The people in the system
are doing everything

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.899
they can to meet the target
that you've set for them,

00:27:03.899 --> 00:27:06.440
but they'll take any shortcut
or any short way of doing that.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.065
They're going to
alleviate the pressure

00:27:08.065 --> 00:27:09.570
as quickly as possible.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.270
So this happens all
the time in business.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.600
For example, have any of you
been on hold in a call center

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.390
and you hear the phone connect,
and then the line goes dead?

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.540
Have you heard that?

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.040
It's not actually usually
a technical glitch.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.090
We can get people to the moon.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.790
We can route a call these days.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.660
What's usually happening
in the call centers

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.320
that we work with is those
call center reps are measured

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.720
by the average time they
spend on each phone call,

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.660
and they can see their
average handle time going up

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:41.470
and up and up.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.400
And when it gets
too high, they start

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.110
to pick up, hang up, pick up,
hang up, pick up, hang up,

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.270
immediately until their
call time goes down.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.960
That's the cobra
effect in business.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.180
NEEL DOSHI: Now you guys as a
group have a frame of thinking

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.145
that very few managers have.

00:27:59.145 --> 00:28:00.770
Most business leaders
we work with only

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:01.870
know tactical performance.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.160
They only know one column.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.160
They don't think about
TOMO, essentially what's

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.629
happening the vertical axis.

00:28:06.629 --> 00:28:08.170
They don't know
adaptive performance,

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.260
what's happening in
this horizontal axis.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.189
And so as a result,
in the spirit,

00:28:12.189 --> 00:28:13.730
the well intentioned
spirit of trying

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.240
to increase performance,
what they usually do

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.660
is double down on
tactical performance

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.944
through strategies
that are low TOMO.

00:28:20.944 --> 00:28:22.110
So I'll give you an example.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.240
This is a playing out right
now in public education.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.790
Public education-- unhappy with
teacher performance, we say,

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.790
let's bring the so-called
best practices from business

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.584
to education.

00:28:34.584 --> 00:28:36.750
Those so-called best practices
essentially are let's

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.529
double down on
tactical performance.

00:28:38.529 --> 00:28:39.570
What does that look like?

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.830
Teachers teaching to the test.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.210
You're going to have
standardized testing.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.793
The grades in those
tests are actually

00:28:46.793 --> 00:28:48.197
going to determine your bonus.

00:28:48.197 --> 00:28:50.030
They're going to determine
your career path.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.530
They're going to determine
how much resource you're

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.240
going to get for your students.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.770
The grades in those
tests might be shared.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:57.830
I might rank schools.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.710
I might rank teachers, all in
the spirit of doubling down

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.240
on tactical performance.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.170
Sounds good-- in practice
and logic of it sounds good.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.460
It's tempting.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.310
But you guys now as an
audience know, well, what

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.090
should happen if I did that?

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.410
Well, I'm going to lower TOMO.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.270
I should see distraction
cancellation and cobra effects.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.610
Well, let's take a look
at public education.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.870
The distraction effect-- the
stress levels of teachers

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.330
have increased 70% since 1985.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.940
Think about what
the stress levels

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.022
did to your colleagues who were
solving a simple math problem.

00:29:33.022 --> 00:29:34.730
Imagine if you're
stress levels increased

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.010
that much of the course
of your day-to-day work.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.759
How effective are you
going to actually be

00:29:38.759 --> 00:29:40.420
from an adaptive performance?

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.420
Cancellation effect-- I'm just
going to teach you the test.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.600
I'm essentially just
checking the boxes.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.742
The cobra effect-- this is
from the Atlanta cheating

00:29:50.742 --> 00:29:52.200
scandal, where
hundreds of teachers

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.854
were implicated in a cheating
scheme, where they were erasing

00:29:56.854 --> 00:29:59.020
student answers on test
scores and putting the right

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.750
answers in.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.880
And when asked,
when interviewed--

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.030
these weren't bad people.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.710
These were predictable
consequences

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:10.120
of a system that was driving
only tactical performance

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.012
through strategies
that were low TOMO.

00:30:12.012 --> 00:30:13.470
You'll see it
always, and we see it

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.300
across organizations--
distraction, cancellation,

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.090
in cobra effects.

00:30:19.085 --> 00:30:20.460
LINDSAY MCGREGOR:
So you now know

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.300
about the two types
of performance,

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.000
and you know about TOMO.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.050
But we wanted to see
if TOMO was actually

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:29.940
what was at work out in the
wild in real organizations,

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:34.390
where the top cultures
in the world using TOMO.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.310
We're going take a
look-- we measured TOMO

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:41.700
at 50 major organizations and
20,000 people around the world.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.545
But first, I'm going to show
you how we calculate TOMO so you

00:30:44.545 --> 00:30:46.410
can understand the results.

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.770
So when we calculate
TOMO, we add up

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:52.420
how much play, purpose, and
potential somebody feels,

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.120
and we subtract how
much emotional pressure,

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.220
economic pressure, and
inertia somebody feels.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.660
Now, they've got
different weights

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.060
because of that principle
we talked about before,

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.650
that the closer the
motive is the work itself,

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.390
the more powerful it is.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.050
Play is about twice
as powerful when

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.410
it relates to performance
compared to purpose, and so on.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.460
The way we measure how
much each of these feel

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.950
is using a survey question,
asking people, why do you work?

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.510
Why do you continue to
work at your current job?

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.590
If people say that they continue
to work at their current job

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:28.360
because the work itself is
fun, for example, that's play.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.990
We do that on a seven-point
scale on the survey.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.880
We can come up with
one number that's TOMO.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.660
So we looked at TOMO
and its connection

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.820
to one type of adaptive
the performance,

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.130
which is customer experience.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.480
Customer experience,
customer satisfaction,

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.240
is an incredibly adaptive
type of performance.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.010
You have to adapt to each
and every customer's needs.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.230
So we're going to look
at customer satisfaction

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.620
in an industry that's known
for it, the airline industry.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.500
That's going to be our y-axis.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.890
The x-axis is the TOMO
of the people that

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:04.500
work at these companies--
why they continue

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.500
to work, not how happy
they are, not how

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.820
engaged they are, not
how satisfied they are,

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.510
but why they continue to work?

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.750
That's what TOMO represents.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:17.350
Any guesses on who is
the highest TOMO airline?

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.920
Southwest, let's see.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:26.816
Lowest TOMO airline-- United,
American, Delta, Southwest.

00:32:26.816 --> 00:32:29.300
It's almost a
straight-line relationship

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.450
between how much
TOMO somebody felt

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.610
and the customer experience
that organization produced.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.120
Now, this is amazing given
that this airline industry has

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.560
almost the same planes,
the same terminals,

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.200
the same type of food.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.710
It was TOMO that was
driving this difference.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.150
Let's take a look at
another industry-- grocers.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:51.640
Who is the highest TOMO grocer?

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.400
Trader Joe's Yep.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.930
So let's take a look--
Albertsons, Safeway, Walgreens,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.580
Kroger, Whole
Foods, Trader Joe's.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.920
Again, almost a
straight-line relationship.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.710
Retail industry-- guesses?

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.180
Who's the highest TOMO?

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.310
Nordstrom?

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.570
Let's take a look-- Walmart,
Sears, Gap, Home Depot,

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.860
JC Penney, Macy's, Target,
Loew's, Dillard's, Costco,

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.430
and Nordstrom.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.720
Even in an industry where
strategies can be very, very

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.650
different-- you have
different price points,

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:28.280
different products,
different store layouts--

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.380
the TOMO of the
people in the stores

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.990
drove 40% of the variance,
which was this incredibly tight

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.670
relationship.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:38.230
NEEL DOSHI: What's incredible
is in each of these cases,

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:42.145
you guys knew in your gut who
the high TOMO company would be.

00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:44.270
But for the longest time,
we'd look at a Nordstrom,

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.590
we'd look at Trader Joe's,
we'd look at a Southwest,

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.550
and we didn't know
what was happening.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.880
We didn't know how to think
about it, how to measure,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.950
it, what the frame was.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.820
It was very difficult
to take those lessons

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.390
and actually bring it to
your own organization.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:57.310
Now, we know it's TOMO.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.220
TOMO is driving their
adaptive performance.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.230
Now, if we look at
customer satisfaction,

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.940
we should see in
customer satisfaction

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.150
the importance of balancing
tactical and adaptive,

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.930
so TOMO should predict it.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:09.840
What about salesmanship?

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.620
I'd actually argue
great salesmanship

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.219
is also the balance of tactical
and adaptive-- tactical

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.025
for where do I need consistency,
the adaptive of where

00:34:18.025 --> 00:34:20.389
do I want to pivot
around each individual?

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:22.980
So if that's true,
we should, in theory,

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.159
see a connection between
TOMO and salesmanship.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.380
So in this particular case,
branch-based financial

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.745
institution, we measured the
TOMO of salespeople, divided it

00:34:31.745 --> 00:34:34.659
into two groups-- negative
TOMO and positive TOMO,

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:36.510
and we measured their
sales performance.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:40.850
And we saw was a 28% difference
based on a factor that

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.570
not only did this
organization not know existed,

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.139
but a factor that when you
actually examine their culture,

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.780
they were actively
taking steps to reduce,

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.940
all in the spirit of
tactical performance.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.070
Let's do another example.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.030
This one was done
by an academic,

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.120
where he looked at telesales.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.410
So this is now call
center based sales,

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.200
where he went to a call center,
measured the TOMO of the people

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.270
there, divided them
into four groups.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:10.620
Low TOMO, so low direct, high
indirect, medium, low direct,

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.650
low indirect.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.280
There's the other medium,
high direct, high indirect.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.830
Remember, these
are like a seesaw.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.090
And then there's
finally high TOMO.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:22.152
He's looking at their average
revenue produced per hour now.

00:35:22.152 --> 00:35:23.610
At this stage in
this conversation,

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.068
you guys should be
able to predict,

00:35:25.068 --> 00:35:27.010
at least directionally,
which one's

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:29.680
the worst performer, which
one's the highest performer.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.690
So let's take a look.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:37.900
Low TOMO at $234 per
hour, 251, 285, 375.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.760
60% difference from
the low TOMO group,

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.860
which was by number
the largest group.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:48.700
All from a factor that they
didn't even know existed.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.270
Now, because of
all this research,

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.750
we can actually define culture.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.250
When most people
talk about culture,

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.150
what culture is,
they'll say things like,

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:59.810
oh, it's a set of values and
behaviors that a community has.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.810
That's nice if you're an
anthropologist studying

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:02.710
cultures.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.690
But if you were a CEO,
business leader, manager

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:08.020
and you're trying to build
a high performing culture,

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.853
there's nothing you can
really do with that.

00:36:09.853 --> 00:36:11.850
You can't really engineer that.

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.720
What we've concluded
is that culture

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:19.090
is the ecosystem of processes
that affect your people's TOMO.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.680
Culture's the
ecosystem of processes

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.955
that affect your people's TOMO.

00:36:23.955 --> 00:36:26.330
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: So what are
all of these processes that

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:27.900
affect TOMO?

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.650
Let's take a look.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.730
So we're going to put across
the top of this TOMO scores.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.040
TOMO is on a scale of
negative 100 to 100.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.239
So this is a slice
of the spectrum.

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:40.780
And down the left-hand
side I'm going

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.980
to put the different processes
and how much it swings TOMO.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.830
When we ask people
what process or what

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:50.270
piece of your organization most
affects TOMO and most affects

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.115
culture, people usually
tell us it's your leader.

00:36:53.115 --> 00:36:54.810
It's all about the leader.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.320
It turns out it's
actually not true.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.160
Any guesses on what
has the most impact?

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.820
Your peers, that's one guess.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.090
Anything else?

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.482
Manager-- all right.

00:37:09.482 --> 00:37:13.270
I'm not going to make anybody
stand up if they volunteer.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:18.270
The most important thing was
how your role was designed.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.275
When you have a job
that was well designed,

00:37:20.275 --> 00:37:21.900
you would have a TOMO
score all the way

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.450
over there on the right.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:24.980
When your job was
poorly designed,

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.660
it would be all the
way on the left.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.490
It was an 87-point swings
in somebody's TOMO.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.190
That's huge-- a huge,
huge swing from the way

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:34.780
your role is designed.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.442
Next came your
organizational identity.

00:37:38.442 --> 00:37:40.650
This is not just whether
you have a mission statement

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.610
and values painted
up on your wall,

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.540
but whether your
people actually lived

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.000
and breathed those values.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.510
The next was your
career ladders.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.930
Many organizations design
career ladders so that it

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.350
is a fight to the death.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:54.220
It's a tournament.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.390
For me to win, you have to lose.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:01.090
That's an example of a low
TOMO career ladder process.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.930
The next is your
sense of community.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.525
Then came workforce planning.

00:38:05.525 --> 00:38:07.650
Do you have the time and
resources to actually meet

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.610
your objectives?

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:14.450
Leadership was next, still 50
points swing, which is huge,

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:17.267
compensation, governance
processes, and finally

00:38:17.267 --> 00:38:18.558
your performance review system.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.630
NEEL DOSHI: What we found
is that all of these

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.922
affect homo TOMO
quite materially.

00:38:25.922 --> 00:38:27.630
We also found out they
all work together.

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.600
You have to actually think
about these as an ecosystem.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.070
Well, we want to wrap
up with leadership.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.460
You guys, as individual
leaders, in your organization,

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.960
how do you want to
think about this?

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.790
And then see if you have
any questions about that.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.760
When we double click
on just leadership,

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.160
like the rest of the
magnets, you can actually

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.950
start to say to
yourself, does the leader

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:50.040
actually use direct motivators
or indirect motivators?

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.620
Now we looked at leaders based
on what behaviors they had,

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.910
and then we measured the
TOMO of their subordinates.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.826
And we found, well, you
can have a leader that

00:38:56.826 --> 00:39:00.880
uses or doesn't use direct,
uses or doesn't use indirect.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.607
So one type of leader, we'll
call them quid pro quo.

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:05.940
They don't really focus on
play, purpose, and potential.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.130
Everything is either about
shame, guilt, or sticks

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:10.030
and carrots.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.690
You do this.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.150
I give you this.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:15.560
What we found is that the
average TOMO that leader

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.650
is about a negative one.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:20.974
It's pretty ineffective leader
when it comes to driving TOMO.

00:39:20.974 --> 00:39:23.140
The next type of leader's
the one that does neither.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.460
What's interesting about this
one is this is what I was.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.584
Before we studied this
research, before we actually

00:39:27.584 --> 00:39:31.110
analyzed all this, I knew
the quid pro quo was bad.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.036
And so my mindset
was I'm just going

00:39:33.036 --> 00:39:35.450
to give my people lots
and lots of space,

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.060
let them do what
they need to do,

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.750
and I'll only step in
if there's an issue.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.260
That leader is actually not
direct and not indirect.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.040
They're hands-off.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.660
Now, the TOMO of that leader
theoretically should increase.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.859
It does.

00:39:47.859 --> 00:39:49.400
The subordinates of
those people have

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.800
on average a TOMO of around 11.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.560
Then there's a leader
that does both.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.810
They are trying to drive
play, purpose, and potential,

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:58.518
but they're also using
sticks and carrots

00:39:58.518 --> 00:40:01.740
and emotional pressure
and even inertia.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:06.120
Theory suggests that these two
should wash each other out--

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.647
remember the seesaw.

00:40:07.647 --> 00:40:08.980
Call this leader the enthusiast.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.912
Their subordinates have an
average TOMO of about 14,

00:40:11.912 --> 00:40:12.870
pretty close to the 11.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:16.484
I'd argue rounding error--
pretty much the same.

00:40:16.484 --> 00:40:17.900
Then, of course,
the leader that's

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.580
only using the direct
motives, they're

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:24.110
constantly thinking about how
do I make the work itself play?

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.790
This isn't about the video
game machine in the break room.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.370
It's not about the
ping pong table.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.710
It's about how do I make
the work itself play?

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.620
How do I create purpose
for you in that work?

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.490
How do I make it feel potential?

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.820
And I'm going to minimize
emotional pressure,

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.800
economic pressure, and inertia.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.820
That leader, we call
them the fire starter,

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.390
and that subordinate has, on
average a TOMO of about 38,

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:45.880
so a fairly large increase.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.490
Interestingly,
leadership behaviors

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.415
drive TOMO as
predicted by theory.

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:53.540
So the first thing that
you guys should think about

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:57.710
as leaders is are
you on the journey

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.585
to be that fire starter?

00:40:59.585 --> 00:41:01.960
Are you on the journey to say
to yourself, you know what?

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.700
I'm going to keep practicing.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.330
I'm going to keep experimenting.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:07.930
I'm going to keep trying to
reduce the emotional pressure,

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.960
economic pressure, and
inertia in my people

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.540
and replace it with play,
purpose, and potential.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.740
This is a lifelong journey.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.940
This is something that
we, having study this now

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.950
for a long, long time,
are still trying to learn,

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.060
still trying to master.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.810
The first question you
should ask yourself

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:26.370
is, are you on that journey?

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.670
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: What can
you do in the shorter term?

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:31.870
Three thingss--
first is start to use

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:34.450
the language of adaptive
performance and TOMO

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:36.980
with your team so that
your whole team can

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.710
be involved in creating a
high performing culture.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:42.210
Once you start to
talk about it, you

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.920
can start to address
the areas where

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.890
your culture might be weak.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.360
The second is to
actually measure

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.790
the TOMO of your people.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:50.900
It's very easy.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.360
It's six very simple questions.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.230
They're in "Primed to
Perform," the book.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.730
They're also on
primedtoperform.com,

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.790
where you can send
a quiz to your team,

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:01.680
and it'll come back
with an anonymous report

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.840
of which motives are
strong and which are weak

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.900
and help you
facilitate a discussion

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.050
with your team on how to
increase their performance.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:12.560
The third thing is to hold
a weekly reflection huddle.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.460
This is a way to kick-start
your conversations about play,

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.080
purpose, and potential.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.560
We hold weekly reflection
huddles in our firm

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.460
and many of the
organizations we work with,

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.660
and it has three questions.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.480
Everybody gets together
and answers those

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.880
three questions once a week.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.360
The first question is, what
did you learn this week,

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.850
and that's to inspire play.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.970
Remember, play is that learning,
experimentation, curiosity.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.180
So what'd you learn this week?

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.780
The second question is, what
impact did you have this week?

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.980
The is to inspire
that purpose motive.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.680
And the third is, what do
you want to learn next week?

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.570
And that's, again, to inspire
your play for the upcoming

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.742
week-- three simple questions.

00:42:52.742 --> 00:42:54.950
We're going to turn it over
to questions in a minute.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.970
This is the one-hour
version of a workshop

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.860
that we normally
do in four hours,

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:03.410
so there's lots
more science, data,

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.140
thoughts about how do you
become a high TOMO leader,

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.042
how do you build high
TOMO systems in here.

00:43:08.042 --> 00:43:10.250
But for now, I'm going to
turn it over for questions.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.874
I think we've got
about 10, 15 minutes.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.496
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:20.847 --> 00:43:22.930
AUDIENCE: So I have two
closely related questions.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:25.930
One, you have the
set of questions

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:27.180
that you send out in a survey.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.763
Did you do any form
of experimentation

00:43:28.763 --> 00:43:31.380
to figure out what
questions better fit?

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.340
And the second
question is, you seem

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:37.070
to have these particular weights
for the different categories

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:40.660
of motivators, and
did you actually

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.910
fit this to some data set,
and what data set did you use?

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:47.180
NEEL DOSHI: Let's take the
two question one at a time.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.780
On the actual
questions themselves,

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.238
we've done a lot
of research to try

00:43:50.238 --> 00:43:54.260
to find questions that work
best in a generic context.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.010
So we kind of tested lots
of different questions

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:00.182
to figure out which ones work
the most generically the best.

00:44:00.182 --> 00:44:01.890
However, when we work
with organizations,

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:05.110
we don't want them to be
dogmatic to our language

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:07.529
because every organization's
a little bit unique.

00:44:07.529 --> 00:44:10.070
How people respond to different
words is a little bit unique.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.180
So, for instance,
in one project,

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:15.030
we worked with a Middle
Eastern cable company.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.410
And the way we ask the
economic pressure question just

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:20.620
simply did not work
in the Middle East.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.280
And so we had to
derive a new question

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.010
and do some research
to figure it out.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:26.218
Our encouragement is you
could start with what we've,

00:44:26.218 --> 00:44:27.910
but don't be dogmatic to it.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.640
In terms of the
weights, similarly,

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.280
our goal with the metric
was to create something

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.820
that was as predictive
as we could make it

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.660
in a general context--
generically predictable-- fit

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:44.300
theory, was easy to calculate,
and result in a scale that

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.050
was easy to interpret.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.140
So our scale, the TOMO
scale that we created,

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.950
goes from negative
100 to positive 100,

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.700
which is similar to
the Net Promoter scale

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.070
that a lot of organizations use
to think about their customers.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.640
And so when we
derived those weights,

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.030
we essentially did a bunch
of stats around the surveys

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:02.660
that we created and the
performance that we measured.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.340
Those weights were the ones that
were best fitted to those stats

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:10.467
but also met the other
criteria, it that make sense.

00:45:10.467 --> 00:45:11.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:14.274 --> 00:45:16.190
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: Oh,
there's two microphones.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:17.720
There we go.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.550
We'll swap.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.800
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.240
In your slide toward
the end, where

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.860
you had different
aspects of culture

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.550
and the swing, that first one
about the shape of the role,

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:30.950
can you elaborate more
about the specific

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:36.525
of what it is about role design
that directs that swing to one

00:45:36.525 --> 00:45:37.450
side or the other?

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.620
It's not just having
a role designed,

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.054
but how that design
is structured.

00:45:42.054 --> 00:45:43.720
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: The
very simple answer

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.360
is we look at whether the
role encourages or inspires

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.120
play and purpose.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.740
Those are the two big things
that many jobs are missing.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:54.300
So imagine a job
that inspires play.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.070
It would enable you to see
whether what you're doing

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:01.450
is working, come up with new
ideas about how to improve it,

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.010
test those ideas, and
see the impact of it.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:07.010
It enables curiosity
and experimentation.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:11.200
I'm guessing all of us have been
in jobs where we sit in a cube.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.610
We work on a PowerPoint
slide, and we throw it

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.610
over the cubicle
wall to our manager,

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:17.951
and we never see it again.

00:46:17.951 --> 00:46:20.200
We don't know what worked
we don't have an opportunity

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.674
to innovate or experiment.

00:46:22.674 --> 00:46:24.340
When you don't have
purpose in your job,

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.130
it's usually because you can't
see the impact of your work.

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:29.280
Can you go and see how
it's making a difference

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.660
to organizations?

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.530
So examples of both-- play,
on the Toyota production

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:38.050
line-- you would think that an
assembly line job manufacturing

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.180
cars would have
very little play.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.950
But Toyota enables their
people to actually come up

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:46.220
with new tools or new ways of
doing their job while they're

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.222
working on the line.

00:46:47.222 --> 00:46:48.680
And they have a
group of folks that

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.220
will go and make that tool
when they have an idea

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.260
and bring it back
so they can test it.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.530
That's a way of having
play in that job.

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.470
Purpose, for example--
at Medtronic,

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:03.140
which creates a lot
of health care tools,

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.880
they actually go and see those
tools in action in surgery

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.910
so that they can see the
impact of their work,

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:09.160
and also it inspires play.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.426
They can see what's
working, what's not working.

00:47:11.426 --> 00:47:11.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:12.966
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: Thank you.

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:16.780
AUDIENCE: What if
you have reports

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.660
who just states that
his motivation is

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.930
purely a reward-based
or praised-base,

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:26.140
so he cares about whether
managers think he's doing

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.196
a good job and whether the
company is paying him enough

00:47:29.196 --> 00:47:30.820
and doesn't understand
other people who

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.099
are motivated by play?

00:47:33.099 --> 00:47:35.140
NEEL DOSHI: And it's
someone that's on your team,

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.913
or someone that is
managing a team?

00:47:36.913 --> 00:47:38.412
AUDIENCE: Let's
just say that I have

00:47:38.412 --> 00:47:40.680
a friend who has
someone on their team

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.930
to pretend that's somebody--

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.340
NEEL DOSHI: A lot of
people have friends

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.340
I notice in these talks.

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:49.160
What we've noticed
in our research

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:54.490
is people are notoriously bad
at self-identifying how motives

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:56.240
drive their own performance.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:00.264
So what we see a lot is
organizations do the following.

00:48:00.264 --> 00:48:01.680
They know there's
something that's

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.490
not working with their culture.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:06.172
They don't know that play,
purpose, potential even exists.

00:48:06.172 --> 00:48:07.880
So they asked their
people, what would it

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.610
take to make this
culture better?

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.970
And their people say,
less work and more money.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.220
That's a very common practice.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.219
We see it play out over
and over and over again.

00:48:16.219 --> 00:48:18.230
People are pretty
bad self identifying

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:19.610
their own known motives.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:22.490
So when our work, we don't
advocate asking your people

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:23.590
what they want, actually.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.820
It's not particularly helpful
because play, purpose,

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.070
potential drive
performance consistently.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.860
It is essentially
human instinct.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.780
So even if you're person
says, this is what I want,

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.990
this is what people
want, it doesn't actually

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:41.160
change what actually
drives performance.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.599
And when we have
folks like that,

00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:44.390
we've often been brought
into organizations

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:47.950
because an executive
will say, you know, Neel,

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:49.990
our CEO is a bit toxic.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.740
Like, this is what he believes.

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.520
People just operate
on sticks and carrots.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.530
What we normally do with those
folks is we share with them

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.970
the science, the data, the
research, and the language,

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.324
the tools, the framework.

00:49:01.324 --> 00:49:02.990
And sometimes we'll
make that CEO get up

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.760
and do math in front
of his colleagues.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.041
And by the time that's
done, they get it.

00:49:08.041 --> 00:49:08.984
They get it.

00:49:08.984 --> 00:49:10.400
LINDSAY MCGREGOR:
So, for example,

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.910
we've been able to measure
TOMO among hedge fund portfolio

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.800
managers and proven that TOMO
is what's driving their highest

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.090
performers, not money.

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:21.890
Or there's been research done
in investment banking, where

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:24.515
maybe the reason you go into
that industry is for the money.

00:49:24.515 --> 00:49:27.140
But when you look at who is the
highest performing once they're

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.910
actually there, it's who's
getting up on Wednesday

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.510
morning and doing the best work.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:33.470
It's the person that's finding
the play and the purpose

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.280
and the potential.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.321
AUDIENCE: OK, so your
recommendation to my friend

00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:37.489
is show him the data?

00:49:37.489 --> 00:49:39.780
NEEL DOSHI: Yeah, and help
them understand that there's

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:44.125
a frame of thinking that's
more nuanced than just poke

00:49:44.125 --> 00:49:45.385
and prod your people.

00:49:45.385 --> 00:49:48.140
And once people understand
that frame of thinking,

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.524
they start to self identify.

00:49:49.524 --> 00:49:51.440
They start to see it in
the world around them.

00:49:54.824 --> 00:49:56.240
AUDIENCE: Good-- thank you.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.740
AUDIENCE: So my
question is related

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:03.110
to the general corporate
way of managing employees.

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:06.160
So across several companies,
working for more than decade,

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.740
now what I've seen is that,
all right, those who do well

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:13.810
are rewarded, but indirect
ones and those who do worse

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:18.220
are actually rewarded with
more specific objectives

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.530
that they have to
complete within the time.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.910
If they don't, then
they're thrown out

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:24.110
or something like that.

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:28.240
So typically, both
are doing indirect,

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.070
like those who did very
poorly, now have hey,

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:36.260
your job will be turned gone if
you don't do this, this, this.

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.740
You have to do exactly that.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.450
So high on tactical.

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:42.070
And those who do well,
oh, you did so well.

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:42.862
Here's your reward.

00:50:42.862 --> 00:50:44.444
That's what happens
with the toddlers.

00:50:44.444 --> 00:50:46.740
They were probably taught,
it's not playful anymore.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:47.930
I'm getting something.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.410
Maybe I don't want it.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.260
So what's going on?

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.930
Are we-- am I in a company,
which is completely bogus?

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.280
Have I been company which
are completely bogus,

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.530
and they have no clue
what is going on?

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:01.805
Or why is that like that?

00:51:01.805 --> 00:51:03.430
LINDSAY MCGREGOR:
It's a good question.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:07.160
So money or paying people
is not intrinsically

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.450
a bad things or
intrinsically a good thing.

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.800
It matter is if your
bonus or those rewards

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.030
are changing the reason
why you're working.

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.950
So a counterintuitive example
is we measured the sales

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:21.720
commissions and to see how sales
commissions affected somebody's

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.494
TOMO.

00:51:22.494 --> 00:51:23.910
And before this
talk, you probably

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.280
thought, oh, sales
commissions are a great thing.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.071
At this point in time,
you might be saying,

00:51:28.071 --> 00:51:30.616
sales commissions are
probably a terrible thing.

00:51:30.616 --> 00:51:32.990
But what it turns out, is
that-- excuse me, contact lens.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:37.780
I think you need to take over.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.030
My contact lens is falling out.

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.405
NEEL DOSHI: So what it turns
out-- adaptive performance--

00:51:41.405 --> 00:51:44.349
where it turns out is
that-- there you go, right?

00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:45.640
LINDSAY MCGREGOR: Yeah, exactly

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.014
NEEL DOSHI: --is that when
you have somebody with a sales

00:51:48.014 --> 00:51:50.510
commission who very much
believes that their work is

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:52.390
doing the best thing
for their customers,

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:54.840
that sales commission
actually increases their TOMO.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.990
Because they're not doing it
for the commission anymore.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:57.050
They actually believe
in what they're doing.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:58.350
The commission is just gravy.

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:01.389
Now your question is, why are
there so few great cultures?

00:52:01.389 --> 00:52:03.680
Like, I've kind of flipped
your question around, right?

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.970
So many of the organizations
you work with were using

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:09.262
sticks and carrots to motivate
high and low performers.

00:52:09.262 --> 00:52:10.720
Well, the problem
is, is that, one,

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.299
this research is actually
pretty cutting edge.

00:52:13.299 --> 00:52:14.840
The research that
we've come up with,

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:19.430
this frame, this thinking, this
data, is only a few years old.

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:21.050
We both had MBAs.

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.430
We both went to big
consulting firms.

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:28.320
The practices that we learned
and executed were low TOMO.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.110
And we try it.

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:31.950
You get a very short
term blip in performance

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:34.720
because tactical
performance is quick.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.780
You don't notice that
what you just did actually

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.300
destroyed adaptive performance.

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.380
You don't notice it
because you never

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.840
had a language for
adaptive performance.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:41.798
It's harder to measure.

00:52:41.798 --> 00:52:42.720
It's harder to see.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.510
And if it did go
down, you didn't even

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:45.533
know what caused that.

00:52:45.533 --> 00:52:47.574
And so you kind of throw
your hands up in the air

00:52:47.574 --> 00:52:50.092
and you say, oh, it's
just because we're big.

00:52:50.092 --> 00:52:51.890
Well, Southwest is big.

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:53.970
Nordstrom is big.

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:55.680
It's not that.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.890
It's that we just simply didn't
understand TOMO and adaptive

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:00.841
performance.

00:53:00.841 --> 00:53:03.529
LINDSAY MCGREGOR:
Any other questions?

00:53:03.529 --> 00:53:05.320
All right, thank you,
everybody for coming.

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.070
We really appreciate it.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:07.730
NEEL DOSHI: It's a
pleasure to be here.

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:09.015
[APPLAUSE]
