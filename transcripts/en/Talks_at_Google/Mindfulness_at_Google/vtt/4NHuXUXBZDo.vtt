CHRIS MORROW: Well, thank you.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.250
Thank you for having us.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.410
We thought we'd actually start
with a couple questions for you

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.352
guys, and then we'll get
into our rap a little bit.

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:18.060
Just with a show of
hands, we're curious,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.080
how many people here might
consider themselves meditators?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.886
OK.

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:27.250
How about, how many people
have tried it, but thought

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.160
it quote unquote
"just didn't work,"

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.420
or they weren't good at it?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.090
OK.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.870
And it's all right to be
honest, how many people

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.382
are skeptical that it
works, haven't tried it?

00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:42.684
All right, so not a lot
of skeptics going here.

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:44.350
RUSSELL SIMMONS: They
all read and shit.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.730
These are smart people.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.560
The research is crystal clear.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.725
So it does work, obviously.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:52.850
CHRIS MORROW: It does work.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.170
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.550
I mean, well that's what the
neuroscientists are saying,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.050
right?

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.376
Everybody's saying that.

00:00:57.376 --> 00:00:58.970
And they say the
greatest gateway

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.090
to happiness, right, meditation.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.924
You hear it, and you hear it
enough, you kind of believe it.

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:05.840
But if you have faith
in something, you do it.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.339
Right?

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:09.470
You have total faith,
absolute faith, you do it.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.990
If it makes you
happy, you do it.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.520
Meditation makes you happy,
that's what they say,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.680
that's what the research says.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.700
Meditation gives you
greater brain functionality.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.480
You people work at Google,
you're all brainiacs, right?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480
Greater brain functionality,
greater memory,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.280
calm nervous system, get
rid of your ADD, lower

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.282
your blood pressure,
all that stuff.

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:40.240
You know all that, because
you're sitting here.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.829
You probably studied it
quick, like the quick studies

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:43.370
that you are.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.850
So you already know
what meditation is for,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.830
and what they say it does,
and you kind of believe it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.017
because the proof
is everywhere now.

00:01:51.017 --> 00:01:53.100
CHRIS MORROW: Well let's
rewind it for one second,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.890
because when we asked if some
people had tried it and thought

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.140
didn't work, a lot of people--

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.330
RUSSELL SIMMONS: But the
skeptics, no one would say--

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.580
CHRIS MORROW: No one's
a skeptic, all right.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.540
But the people who said
they tried it, and it quote

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.020
"didn't work?"

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.140
RUSSELL SIMMONS: We're going
to teach them, that's easy.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.723
CHRIS MORROW: Well
let's address that.

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.400
Is it possible to
do meditation wrong,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.465
or is everyone doing it right?

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:10.979
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Well, yeah,
wrong if you don't-- the one

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.580
thing you everyone has to have
in order to be a meditator is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.030
patience.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.040
You have to have
a bit of patience.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.940
You know, my name is
Rush, so I can meditate.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.970
And my kids, they
didn't want to meditate,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.200
and their mother said,
sit your [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.160
They became meditators,
they said, don't move,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.620
you know, and you sit there.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.730
And the mind's
crazy, like a monkey.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.210
It bounces around in the head.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.420
It's like, go to
the refrigerator,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.630
get something to eat, hit
her before she breaks out,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.160
she's gonna leave,
get her this morning.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.080
All kinds of stuff.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.330
And you're sitting
there, and your mind's

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.602
telling you, stop, stop.

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:48.754
And you're saying, I can't
stop until the alarm goes off.

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:49.936
I can't.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:53.165
The alarm goes off,
so you can scratch,

00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:55.580
you can do whatever you want,
but you can't go nowhere.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.340
So the mind is bouncing around
like a monkey in a cage,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.350
and then it settles, and you
say to yourself, oh shit,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.210
I'm meditating.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.240
And then it bounces
around some more,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.780
and it transcends the
thoughts even more.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.830
And as the nervous system calms,
the mind always goes after it.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.789
That's the process.

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:18.580
It's simple, right?

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.570
The reason that we wrote
this book is to demystify it,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.124
meditation.

00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:28.540
It's something I've been so
passionate about for 20 years,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.100
and I want people to do it.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.530
I want kids in schools to do
it, I want adults to do it.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.900
I want the world to
become a better place.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.656
And if I could get
more people to do it,

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:38.530
then I would lift the
vibration of the planet

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.500
just a little bit,
and I'd really

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.673
have contributed something
besides entertainment.

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:49.185
Really contribute to the
happiness of the planet,

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.530
or to the planet's ability
to get along with each other

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.960
or love each other.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.070
And so that's why this
book is so important to me,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.757
and I really have done a
lot of work [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:58.757 --> 00:03:59.840
Chris, you're watching me.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.800
You're kind of surprised, right?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.960
CHRIS MORROW: What
am I surprised about?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.525
RUSSELL SIMMONS: That I'm
busting my ass, I'm everywhere.

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:05.390
CHRISMORROW:Oh no, he's
working for this, it's true.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.556
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I mean, I
give the money to charity

00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:10.220
for my books, I don't
make any money on them.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.430
I've been working, the book's
been on the best seller list,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.160
like seven weeks.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.300
I've been consistently working,
and it's going to continue.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.620
I want to put it in
schools in Chicago,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.060
where the most violence is.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.320
I want people to watch
the reduction in violence,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.810
and see the schools'
vibrations change.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.837
I want to see that happen
with people watching,

00:04:33.837 --> 00:04:35.670
not like the schools
we have all the country

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.167
where it's going on, where
the research is clear.

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:40.250
But I want everybody to
watch us do it in Chicago,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.730
because I want to make
it happen everywhere.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.210
That's just a big ambition, and
so that's why I keep pushing.

00:04:49.275 --> 00:04:50.650
CHRIS MORROW:
Well, let's take it

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.720
back a little bit for the people
who haven't read the book yet.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.780
Talk a little bit about--

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.240
RUSSELLSIMMONS: No
one's read the book.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.698
CHRIS MORROW: Or for everyone
who hasn't read the book yet,

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:01.030
talk about your own
journey to meditation.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.269
What led you there?

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:03.810
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
Well, I went to yoga

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.518
a little over 20 years
ago, because there

00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:06.825
was no guys there, just girls.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.966
All just beautiful girls.

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:13.590
They didn't have
Lululemon see-through,

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.240
no shit like that, just shorts.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.890
You know?

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.430
And I went to yoga, and there
was a gay guy or two there,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.450
but no guys, you know.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.575
So anyway, I went to class.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.250
And when I came out,
I was high as hell.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.989
I was like, oh shit,
if I keep doing this,

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:31.530
I'm not going to
make any more money,

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.680
because-- little bit of freedom.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.240
And I used to think that--
the neurotic kind of person I

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.020
was, the noise that was always
in my head, the rethinking

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.750
and rethinking,
and the insomnia,

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.790
and the things that
I was afflicted--

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.070
that those things were part
of the formula for success.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.500
That working,
overworking, overthinking,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.550
was part of the process.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.020
And so I came out, I
was a little worried,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.790
because for a moment there was
a little freedom from that.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.920
And I learned since then
that the seconds of stillness

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.780
are the only time you can ever
make an informed decision, be

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.700
creative, or ever, never happy
in the future or the past.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.305
So the fluctuations
of the mind are

00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:22.930
the cause of
suffering and sadness,

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.760
and the stillness of the
mind causes happiness.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.290
You know, every prophet has
said it in every language,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.140
and it's promoted throughout
all religious dialogue, always.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.410
But we have not embraced it.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.660
And now all the
doctors are saying it,

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.100
and they have all this proof,
and so we should embrace this.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.650
This idea of quieting
the mind, consciously

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.080
working to quiet the mind.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.430
Everything that we do, really,
is geared towards this.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.190
Everything we do-- take
drugs, dumb the mind down,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.770
get the noise out.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.712
So it's cloudiness or
clarity, are the two choices.

00:07:07.712 --> 00:07:10.170
CHRIS MORROW: But haven't you
always been looking for that,

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.729
even before you understood
what meditation was?

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:14.270
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
Before I took drugs?

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.730
CHRIS MORROW: Well,
yeah, because I remember

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.390
there's a famous story
that Rick Rubin tells--

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.630
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I started
taking drugs very early.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.270
CHRIS MORROW: Yeah.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.090
But from that era--

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.935
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I took
drugs really early.

00:07:21.935 --> 00:07:24.200
Before that, I didn't
think about it much.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.660
Did I misunderstand
the question?

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.701
CHRIS MORROW: I didn't
even get the question out.

00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:30.680
But I mean, what I'm saying is,
he tells a story about-- this

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.130
is probably like early
'85 or mid '80s whatever,

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.510
living in NYU dorm rooms.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.160
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Are you on the
[? past ?] steam room story?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.470
CHRIS MORROW: Yeah,
the steam room story.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.385
RUSSELL SIMMONS: We all
do-- I mean everything--

00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:41.005
CHRIS MORROW: Do you guys
know the steam room story?

00:07:41.005 --> 00:07:42.838
RUSSELL SIMMONS: No,
they don't [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:46.240
Everything is geared
towards quieting the mind.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.150
We don't realize
it, we make the mind

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.850
go crazy while trying
to quiet the mind.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.840
We want the mind to be
still, because that sunset--

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.015
the basketball players,
we want to be in the zone.

00:07:56.015 --> 00:07:58.390
You want to see the ball
coming, catch it with this hand,

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.435
put it around here,
and hand it to your man

00:08:00.435 --> 00:08:02.450
so he can dunk the ball.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.950
Right?

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.950
That's what we
want to do, right?

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.950
Ball players, and they
want to see it coming.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.450
When the mind is fluctuating,
you can't even catch the ball.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.900
But when the mind is still,
the rim is as big as this room,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.440
you can't miss.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.400
That expansive mindset is
what we're all looking for.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.342
In a car accident,
everything's moving slow,

00:08:24.342 --> 00:08:26.800
because you've carved out the
past and future, everything's

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.344
oh shit.

00:08:29.344 --> 00:08:30.760
That's the way the
world is really

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.840
moving all the time, that slow.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.770
It's the fluctuation of
your mind keeping you

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.235
from seeing all the
miracles as they unfold.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.937
All the stuff given to
you, all this beauty,

00:08:43.937 --> 00:08:45.520
you don't see any
of it because you've

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.720
got the noise in the mind.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.120
We want to quiet the mind.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.526
And when we quiet the
mind, we see it all.

00:08:53.526 --> 00:08:55.900
You've read this stuff--
because you're all smart people,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.510
you've read-- it's true.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.930
And having faith in it
gives us more opportunity

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.810
to move towards it.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.260
That means you have the
tools available to you--

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.999
you have meditation, you
have do-good karmic work,

00:09:10.999 --> 00:09:11.540
all the shit.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.840
All this stuff goes together,
but the meditation--

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.100
of all the tools, of all
the eight parts of yoga,

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.090
of all the religious teachings.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.100
Of all the things that are
meant to quiet the mind

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.330
to give you this consciousness,
this heaven on earth,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:31.640
no tool is greater
than quiet time.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.508
Because in here,
is where it all is.

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:37.380
CHRIS MORROW: All
right, but there

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.116
are a lot of different
types of meditation.

00:09:41.116 --> 00:09:42.740
The type that we talk
about in the book

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.210
is mantra based meditation.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:49.520
What brought you specifically
to that style, or that approach?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.050
Or did you to try
other ones first?

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.800
How did you settle on mantra?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.400
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I think
I've tried a lot since,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.340
but I mean I started
out, my first teachers

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.050
taught me to let go.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.910
It's good, it's a good mantra.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.530
It's a mantra based meditation.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.060
And then they taught
me candle gazing.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.195
That's good.

00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:11.110
They taught me
concentrating on a thing.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.909
On a thing that won't move.

00:10:12.909 --> 00:10:14.450
You ever been in
the water in a pool,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.741
and you're just chilling right?

00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:18.367
You want the water
just to like--

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:20.200
and you're just chilling,
that's meditation.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.980
You just feel the fluctuation.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:28.090
So concentration is a
good tool for meditation.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.170
Single pointed
focus-- read a book,

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.740
and you forget to
breathe-- that's still.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.280
That's why when you like to
do your work-- you make music,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.190
my god you make music,
and in between one

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.250
snare drum and the other like
is a lifetime, the melody it's

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.560
beautiful, it sucks
you all the way in.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.260
So we want to be fully
engaged in life, fully engaged

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.100
in its beauty, and meditation
is the greatest tool

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.195
that I'm aware of.

00:11:00.195 --> 00:11:04.550
This is why I want to
give the world this tool.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.940
CHRIS MORROW: Let's talk
a little bit about what

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.346
trips the people up
who do try, it and feel

00:11:09.346 --> 00:11:10.720
like they weren't
doing it right.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.940
Because I know
that when you first

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.760
started talking to
me about meditation,

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.635
I'd be over at your
house, and you'd be like,

00:11:16.635 --> 00:11:18.310
let's meditate for 20 minutes.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.560
And I would sit there, and
I'd go through the motions,

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.150
and I'd have my eyes closed,
and I'd have the right posture--

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.590
but in my mind I kept
thinking, this isn't working,

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.140
I'm faking this.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.002
It isn't happening,
and the reason--

00:11:29.002 --> 00:11:30.460
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
People expect to--

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.530
CHRIS MORROW: Well
that's the question.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.230
RUSSELLSIMMONS: I'm
going to answer it.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.938
CHRIS MORROW: OK.

00:11:32.938 --> 00:11:34.230
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I know you.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.340
CHRIS MORROW: For
everybody else's benefit.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.230
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Will
you ask the question?

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.670
CHRIS MORROW: For me, at least--

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.566
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I've been
working with this guy a lot

00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:39.066
of years.

00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:41.190
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.300
CHRIS MORROW: So
I kept thinking,

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.510
my mind isn't turning off.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.410
I'm still having thoughts.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.610
I'm thinking about the fact
that I'm not meditating.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.700
I'm thinking about
the fact that--

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:48.925
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
You know I'm going

00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:50.430
to include that in
my answer, right?

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.150
CHRIS MORROW: OK.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.950
So the question is, for someone
who feels like their mind just

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.410
can't turn off, why
is that something

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.020
that they shouldn't
let trip them up?

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.210
And do you even
ever get past that,

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.494
or is that just
part of the process?

00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:06.160
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Like
I said, the mind's

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.120
like a monkey bouncing
around a cage.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.310
You'll have seconds of
stillness, and maybe not.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.050
But calming your nervous
system and rebooting the mind,

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.320
it's just like working out.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.310
You do a push-up, you might not
get a muscle after one push-up,

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.777
but it's good that you did it.

00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:25.360
You kind of feel all
up in your chest,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.484
you feel like a muscle man.

00:12:26.484 --> 00:12:29.610
You do 10 push-ups, shit,
and the guys looking at you

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.470
like, you're the
same motherfucker.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.370
You haven't changed a bit.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.500
But you feel like you--

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.610
So it's how meditation is, you
know, the mind needs to settle,

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.450
needs to rest.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.860
In your sleep, your
mind's going crazy.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.690
Your mind's doing all kinds of
shit while you sleep, mostly.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.830
But when you meditate,
it's calming some.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.040
Some days more than others.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.630
Every day your
meditation is different.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.010
Never the same, always
infinitely different.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.370
But you have to sit and
let your brain settle,

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.840
let it rest, reboot.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.970
So people expecting
something from meditation,

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.600
not going to work.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.430
You will see results-- if
you meditate regularly,

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.630
you will see dramatic
results and changes

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.560
in your relationship
with the world.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.580
Changes in the way that you eat
food, you'll be more mindful.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.380
The scanners will show more
gray matter on the brain

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.234
within six weeks of
constant meditation.

00:13:29.234 --> 00:13:31.650
The left side of the brain and
the right side of the brain

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.550
will start to reconnect--
it starts disconnecting

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.820
at eight years old, it
starts to reconnect.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.510
You want that, right?

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.510
Your brain functionality
will be improved.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.780
You don't have to look for that,
that's just going to happen.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.980
So in the short term,
maybe just rest.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.580
The rest and perfection
a little bit,

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.440
the idea of operating
from a calm space.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.470
We want the end result, right?

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.330
Imagine just sitting in a
calm space, needing nothing.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.870
This idea of needing nothing,
that's what meditation is.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.890
OK, watching your
thoughts come and go.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.250
In the world, being
thoughtful in your choices,

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.385
not worried about results,
being present, awake,

00:14:21.385 --> 00:14:24.900
and thoughtful in
your work, focused.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.740
The work is the prayer,
after all there's no payment.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.680
They can't give you shit.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.065
In life you want a
comfortable seat,

00:14:32.065 --> 00:14:34.070
that's all you really want.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.430
If you can have a
comfortable seat in life,

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.280
then that is the goal,
that's happiness.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.374
You're here to be happy.

00:14:42.374 --> 00:14:43.790
And from that
comfortable seat you

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.760
operate from what they refer
to as operating in abundance.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.240
So that's really purpose.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.630
And then from there you
become this great servant,

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.524
because when you take care of
this you become a good servant.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:00.940
And good givers
are great getters,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.210
so the toys come, and the
cycle of giving and getting

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.770
speeds up, even
though you slow down.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.505
So that's kind of the rationale.

00:15:11.505 --> 00:15:13.770
It's why I always put
success in the books.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.996
You know, I called my book
"Super Rich" before this,

00:15:16.996 --> 00:15:18.620
and everybody bought
the book and said,

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.702
how can I-- there's
no [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.560
The first chapter, the
state of needing nothing,

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.643
they say, well, I'm going
to throw this shit away.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.294
But as you listen,
it's a prosperity book.

00:15:36.294 --> 00:15:38.210
The state of needing
nothing-- needing nothing

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.910
attracts everything.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.515
When you go to work
needing nothing,

00:15:42.515 --> 00:15:48.216
and you just do your
job, forget results--

00:15:48.216 --> 00:15:51.050
it's really important,
it's really-- it's a thing.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.170
You get happy from
doing the work.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.160
Making the song is the fun part.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.410
Listening to the song and making
the song, that's the fun part.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.910
If you're a record producer,
you remember making the record,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.922
you don't remember the check.

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:06.410
You get the car, you drive
the car around the block,

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.175
park the motherfucker, and say,
damn, $400,000 for nothing.

00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:13.175
It doesn't mean anything,
the toys, the results.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.070
All of us have to let
go of the needy thing,

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.580
because that is like
this much happiness,

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.660
so quick to come and
go, it's nothing.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:31.670
But the state of consistent
bliss from a calm mind.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.010
I know you know all this.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.850
I'm repeating-- there's
nothing in my book

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.220
new, and nothing I would
tell you that's new,

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.920
but it's just
remember to remember.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.170
You know, why we're here,
and what our purpose is,

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.760
and what makes us good servants.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.100
Prosperity is the result.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.349
CHRIS MORROW: Let's bring
it back to the success thing

00:16:52.349 --> 00:16:53.234
though.

00:16:53.234 --> 00:16:54.650
RUSSELL SIMMONS: It
always comes back to that.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.450
CHRIS MORROW: It always comes
back to the success thing.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.800
We're speaking at Google,
a lot of, like you said,

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.110
smart, ambitious people
focused on their careers.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.369
So specifically for
you, as an entrepreneur,

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.300
as a business person
who's juggling-- I

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.630
can attest to-- a lot of
different things at one time.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.260
How has meditation helped you?

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.258
How has it sharpened you?

00:17:14.258 --> 00:17:16.049
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I can
say that I actually,

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:19.119
look-- every day I meditate
twice, that's 40 minutes.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.419
I go to class, that's
an hour and a half.

00:17:21.419 --> 00:17:22.460
CHRIS MORROW: Yoga class?

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:22.770
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Yoga.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.000
Every day, physical practice.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.541
I don't give a shit
what city I'm in,

00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:28.339
I find a hot yoga room or a
nice vinyasa practice, and I go.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.290
Every single day.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.330
So that's a lot of
time out of my day.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.990
I think I do twice as
much in half the time.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.550
I think, especially as a
person who-- and all of us

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.580
all are-- people who
have to make decisions,

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.071
thoughtful, smart decisions.

00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:49.005
Get a little distance.

00:17:49.005 --> 00:17:51.130
And when you meditate, the
first thing that happens

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.400
is all the thoughts come
racing into your mind.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.110
And you take inventory.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.700
And you see them for
what they are, as

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.630
opposed to every thought giving
you an emotional reaction.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.463
CHRIS MORROW: Now you've
talked about that's

00:18:02.463 --> 00:18:04.690
when some of your
best business ideas

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.220
have actually come to you,
is that first initial stage

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.100
of meditation.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.260
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.090
In the first part, in
the first instance,

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.230
it really is usually
a lot of noise.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.030
Very seldom I sit down
and say, ah, gone.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.540
No, I sit and it's
like-- should I just--

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.160
thoughts-- I was
going to say a bad--

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.800
but the thoughts come, and
you watch them differently.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.760
You watch them.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.970
And what you want to be in
life is why we meditate.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.210
We want to live in
moving meditation.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.430
Want to be a meditative person.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.230
So in life, you want
to be the watcher.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.780
The watcher is
the greatest doer,

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.905
because the watcher's
watching and, oh, let me just

00:18:45.905 --> 00:18:46.810
move this button.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.120
And everybody's like, oh
shit, you see what he did?

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.212
The watcher.

00:18:52.212 --> 00:18:54.670
You know, the brain, you know,
a little piece of your brain

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:55.420
when you meditate.

00:18:58.076 --> 00:18:59.700
I always think of
the basketball thing,

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.934
because I've had it many times.

00:19:01.934 --> 00:19:03.600
And I'm not that good,
in fact, I'm old.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.230
CHRIS MORROW: I
was about to say.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.230
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I don't know
why you were going to say.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.300
CHRIS MORROW: Anyway.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.966
RUSSELL SIMMONS: But
I'm much older now,

00:19:09.966 --> 00:19:11.797
I don't play
basketball that often,

00:19:11.797 --> 00:19:14.380
and certainly not-- I don't have
young guys putting their knee

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.963
in my chest while
they stuff the ball,

00:19:15.963 --> 00:19:17.700
that shit's not
happening anymore.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.750
But there's moments
of when you're really

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.150
doing your thing, because--
He keeps like shaking

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:24.890
his head like, yeah
I'm nice, I'm nice.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.010
Are you a basketball player?

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.489
But the idea of being
awake, fully awake.

00:19:29.489 --> 00:19:31.780
You know runners, you get
there, everything moves slow.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.480
You say, oh shit,
I'm not even tired.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.840
I've been running for 300
miles, I'm not even, ah, awake.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.284
We don't know how to
induce this state.

00:19:41.284 --> 00:19:43.450
We can't as a basketball
player run out on the court

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.950
and say, I'm gonna get in the
zone, I ain't gonna miss shit.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.660
I'm gonna shoot 12
points in two seconds,

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.040
like Reggie Miller in 1912.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.540
When did Reggie--
you remember that?

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.260
CHRIS MORROW: '93.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.134
RUSSELL SIMMONS: '93?

00:19:52.134 --> 00:19:54.030
Thank you.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.480
He shot everybody's eyes out.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:55.980
Why?

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.021
Because he couldn't miss.

00:19:57.021 --> 00:19:58.220
It was impossible.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.220
CHRIS MORROW: So if you
owned the Brooklyn Nets?

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.590
RUSSELL SIMMONS: The
brain has that capacity

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.340
when you're awake.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.180
If I what?

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.638
CHRIS MORROW: I was saying, if
you owned the Brooklyn Nets,

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:08.206
would you make meditation part--

00:20:08.206 --> 00:20:09.330
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Of course.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.585
Phil Jackson did that for
his Lakers, but of course.

00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:14.872
I don't own anything, and
I want people to meditate.

00:20:14.872 --> 00:20:16.830
CHRIS MORROW: But do
you-- you don't actually--

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.610
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I
gave Oprah a teacher,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:18.840
she made her staff meditate.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.510
I gave Ellen a teacher, she
made her staff meditate.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.010
Everybody I've given
a good teacher,

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.450
and they learned to meditate,
they gave it to their staff,

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.020
because it's important.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.250
And once you experience
it, you want it, too.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.040
That's why Rahm Emanuel's got to
sit, never mind just giving him

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.940
this idea, and the
chancellor in Chicago

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:42.160
have to sit, that way they
can give it to all the kids.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.100
Should we get questions
from these guys?

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.860
CHRIS MORROW: Well, I thought
before we opened it up

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.252
to questions,
maybe what would be

00:20:47.252 --> 00:20:48.710
helpful is to
actually-- all right,

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:52.080
let's say someone sits here
today, they listen to this,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.614
they grab the
book, they read up,

00:20:53.614 --> 00:20:55.280
they decide they
actually want to do it.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.594
Can we walk them through the
actual steps of how to do it?

00:20:58.594 --> 00:21:00.760
RUSSELL SIMMONS: We're going
to meditate at the end.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.010
CHRIS MORROW: We'll actually
meditate at the end,

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.100
but I want to
like-- oh, you want

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.980
to take some questions now?

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.580
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I'll teach
them when I teach them.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.100
I'll teach them
when they meditate.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.240
CHRIS MORROW: So we'll take
some questions from them.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.370
RUSSELL SIMMONS: You're going to
meditate with us for a minute?

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.210
You got a few minutes to
meditate at the end, right?

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.305
You're not going to leave,
oh shit, now they're

00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:13.850
going to meditate,
I've got to go.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.933
I mean, why did I sit here
through the whole thing

00:21:15.933 --> 00:21:17.610
if I don't learn
to meditate, right?

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.405
She's like, let me out now.

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:23.564
It's like watching paint
dry, but I promise you

00:21:23.564 --> 00:21:24.564
you're going to like it.

00:21:24.564 --> 00:21:25.412
All right?

00:21:25.412 --> 00:21:27.496
All right, let's
go to questions.

00:21:27.496 --> 00:21:29.662
And there are going to be
like, no questions, right?

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.170
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for
speaking, first of all.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.650
You mentioned at the beginning,
you wanted to bring meditation

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.510
to the schools in
Chicago, and I was

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.410
curious if you had, kind of,
what work you were doing there,

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.632
if you were doing any at all.

00:21:48.632 --> 00:21:49.840
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Very little.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.000
AUDIENCE: What plan you had.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.208
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Very little.

00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:54.310
I write blogs about there.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.730
I have peacekeeper
programs in 25 cities

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.120
that I work with people on,
and I have especially the three

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.770
in Queens.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.630
You know, because kids are
so violent, communities--

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:05.780
we don't talk about it.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:09.090
One hot weekend, 60 kids
could get shot in Chicago,

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.070
and you won't even
read about them.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.980
More kids got killed in a
20 block radius in Chicago,

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.120
than at the height
of the Iraqi war.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.990
You don't talk about
it, no one gives a shit.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.970
So I want to go there--
and they do care,

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.540
CNN did a series of specials,
there's some discussion--

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.840
but there's no solution.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.600
But Quiet Time is a
part of a solution,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.860
or it might be even
a greater solution

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.530
than people could imagine.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.320
It certainly is in other
cities where we've had success.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.865
CHRIS MORROW: And the David
Lynch Foundation is doing it.

00:22:41.865 --> 00:22:42.340
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
I'm going to do it

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.924
with the David Lynch
Foundation, yeah.

00:22:43.924 --> 00:22:46.006
CHRIS MORROW: They are
doing a lot in that regard.

00:22:46.006 --> 00:22:48.170
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Lots of
cities, lots of schools.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.384
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:50.384 --> 00:22:51.800
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
I'm on the board.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.550
We really do do
a lot in schools.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.290
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.040
I have a question.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.939
So how has your approach
to business and to life

00:22:59.939 --> 00:23:01.480
changed since you
started meditating?

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.760
You mentioned some things
about, like maybe you

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.420
were partying before, but
I'm more interested in how

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.960
your business decisions, how
you treat people, and in general

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.020
what impact it had on
you and your businesses?

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:18.290
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I
like to think that I'm

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.120
a more compassionate person.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.050
I think I may be easier to
work for, but maybe not.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.862
You know, because I want people
to be good at what they do,

00:23:26.862 --> 00:23:28.320
and I think the
way that I motivate

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.960
them is different from yelling.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.627
I used to yell.

00:23:33.627 --> 00:23:34.960
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.570
Why did you?

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.195
You know.

00:23:36.195 --> 00:23:37.560
I don't ever do that any more.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.050
I really don't have
any experiences

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.980
lately that I can think
of that I was yelling,

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.330
well fuck you, then bam.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.800
I used to do it all the time.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.700
So I think that my
relationship with my executives

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.050
is different, and with
my business associates is

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:58.540
different, and I think
I'm a lot more productive.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.850
I'm running a lot of stuff
now, three digital companies,

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:06.410
a fashion company, a financial
service company, a music

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:12.990
company-- there's
more-- four charities,

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.890
so I'm running a
lot of stuff now.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:20.010
And I feel like I can do more.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.460
And also, I sleep at night.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.525
Sleep.

00:24:24.525 --> 00:24:29.780
I was an insomniac,
now I sleep well.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.280
I do better.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.363
My personal relationships,
I think, have improved.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.730
I think I'm much better.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.010
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Thank you.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.730
AUDIENCE: So I
was just wondering

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:44.750
if you've encountered
this, especially

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.720
in rolling out meditation
to younger people,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.150
sometimes my
experience is that when

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.650
you talk to people
about meditation,

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.275
or you're having a
discussion about it,

00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:57.270
they tend to have this
almost cartoonish image of,

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.767
you're a swami on
the Ganges in India,

00:24:59.767 --> 00:25:01.100
you know, and you're meditating.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.000
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I'm a Swami?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
AUDIENCE: No, the person
that you're talking to.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.810
Maybe you are, I don't know.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.010
But I'm just
wondering, particularly

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.160
in terms of sort of rolling
it out to young people-- who

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.600
tend to be more
skeptical, I would

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.570
think, of these kinds of
things-- how you plan,

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.450
or if you've had
successes overcoming

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.575
this sort of knee
jerk reaction to it?

00:25:22.575 --> 00:25:24.700
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Well, I've
had lots of experiences

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.635
where I got people who would
not have meditated to meditate.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.890
Ellen DeGeneres, I'm on her
show, I talked her into it,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:37.420
she got the meditation
teacher, she joined the board.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.660
Oprah Winfrey, I was on her
show, we talked about it,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.530
she took in a meditation
teacher, she taught her staff,

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.020
she's not only
joined the board--

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.140
she's the queen of
America's new consciousness.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.430
This idea, not
necessarily religious,

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.940
but the spiritual
awakening that's

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.630
happening in some
parts of America,

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.480
with some people in America,
Oprah is the queen of it.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.030
And opened up lots of
people's minds about it.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.690
In the schools that we have in
both, respectively, in Africa,

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:06.500
and these people
sit in Quiet Time.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.820
So they help to spread the word.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:14.800
And lots of people, I mean even
Puffy-- P Diddy, a meditator?

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.800
So I taught him to meditate.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.210
So yeah, people
would not meditate,

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.189
a lot more of them
are meditating.

00:26:22.189 --> 00:26:24.730
AUDIENCE: But what about young
people, that was the question.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:25.770
Have you found them
more receptive?

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.353
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I like to think
of P Diddy as a young person,

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:30.480
because that makes
me think I'm young.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.430
No, I mean this-- no.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:36.320
I go to schools sometimes, and
work with principals and people

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.550
like-- I've been in
schools like, lots of them,

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:43.030
but I'm thinking in particular
about Dr. Rutherford's school

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:47.070
in Washington, DC, in the hood,
where they were so violent.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.840
And he's just turned the school
around-- the middle school

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.100
and the high school
around dramatically--

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.910
through Quiet Time.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.680
He's a Maharishi, a real
transcendental meditation guy,

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.237
he taught them all, they
all have their own mantra.

00:27:00.237 --> 00:27:01.695
He did the work,
and the school has

00:27:01.695 --> 00:27:05.260
a dramatic shift in everything.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.940
Graduation rates, the scholastic
improvement is dramatic,

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.610
the reduction in violence
is dramatic, everything.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.960
Complete turnaround.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.170
I think I relate to
kids a little better

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.360
than some of the people.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.510
I'm not ideal, it's
not like I'm Drake .

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.046
You know what I mean?

00:27:26.046 --> 00:27:27.140
But I can talk to Drake.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.490
Drake would pick the phone up
if I call him, which is good.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.635
Justin Bieber sent
me a tweet that

00:27:35.635 --> 00:27:38.040
said, Uncle Rush,
teach me to meditate.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.330
Sent me a tweet.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.640
I was like, retweet
that shit, retweet that.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.740
We'll sell some books.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.180
Rita Ora, the it girl.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.260
My daughter is in love with
this new singer, Rita Ora.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.010
You guys all know
who she is, right?

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.400
In love with her.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.160
She tweeted out that she's
really enjoying my book.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.610
It's big deal, because
my daughter's 14,

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.500
and Rita Ora just
told her that she's

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.500
enjoying my book on meditation.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.310
And then Khloe
Kardashian tweeted out,

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.730
my Sunday afternoon--
I asked her to,

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.300
but then she read it, and
called me, and said I loved it.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.602
Because she has eight
million Instagram followers--

00:28:14.602 --> 00:28:17.060
and I don't know how many, she
must have 20 million Twitter

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.810
followers-- and she
Instagramed and tweeted it out.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:25.130
That's how I made the best
seller list, Khloe Kardashian.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:31.540
So that kind of support system,
changing young people's minds

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.000
about it, that's the process.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.870
And they need it.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.530
They're the ones
with the anxiety,

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.970
they're the ones who are worried
that they're not good enough.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.890
Never mind that half
of you are like,

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:47.170
oh my god, you wake up
nervous, anxiety, over nothing.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.870
And meditation teaches
us it's nothing, really.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.090
Right?

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:51.590
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:58.950
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
earlier that major thinkers

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:04.830
and philosophers throughout
time have said over and over,

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.130
in various different
ways, that stillness

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.560
is the link to happiness.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.214
And that every religion
has said in its own way.

00:29:12.214 --> 00:29:13.880
And I was wondering,
in your experience,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.570
if you had any
religious background

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.760
that either contributed to
your involvement in meditation,

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.910
or how it might
have played into it?

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.335
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
Well, I told you,

00:29:23.335 --> 00:29:25.890
I think, it was because
of chicks in class.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.330
That was 20 years ago.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.126
I like to say it because
it's stupid, people laugh.

00:29:30.126 --> 00:29:33.560
It's not that
stupid, [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.360
My brother's a
preacher, he's a kind

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.870
of non-conventional preacher.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.110
My father and mother
are Christians.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.320
I fainted, I was like
12, or something--

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.945
I don't know why, I
never fainted again

00:29:47.945 --> 00:29:50.112
for the rest of my life--
I fainted at the bus stop,

00:29:50.112 --> 00:29:51.111
coming home from church.

00:29:51.111 --> 00:29:52.280
They never made me go again.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.029
Like I don't know, I
could have staged it,

00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:55.600
but I didn't, it just happened.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.760
And they came and got me,
and said, what happened?

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.130
You fell down.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.260
You were out for two seconds.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:29:59.910
We took you to the doctor.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:00.544
All right, OK.

00:30:00.544 --> 00:30:02.460
Mom picked me up from
the doctor, that was it,

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.290
I never had to go
to church again.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.060
Now I go to churches to
speak about meditation,

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.000
or about spiritual matters.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.740
But I do read all the
propaganda associated with yoga.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.700
The Yoga Sutras, the Bhagavad
Gita, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika,

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.930
the Textbook of Yoga
Psychology, you know,

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.280
all the Yogananda stuff,
I've read all that stuff.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.050
I like that, because
it's non-religious--

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.390
until you get to some
of the deity stuff,

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.200
and that relates to Hindu
stuff-- but before that,

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.070
the Yoga Sutras is only a
science book for happiness.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:38.915
The core-- 6,000 years ago this
Yoga Sutras-- and you read it,

00:30:38.915 --> 00:30:40.040
and it's like, so relevant.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.580
It's like 194 threads-- a
sutra is a thread-- So the Yoga

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.550
Sutras.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.910
And yoga is-- the
second sutra is

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.410
[SPEAKING SANSKRIT] in Sanskrit.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:55.690
It means, yoga is a cessation
of the fluctuation of the mind.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.675
Or God Consciousness comes
when the mind is still.

00:30:59.675 --> 00:31:01.360
And that's beautiful, that's it.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.310
We all know we-- you know
you came out of the ocean,

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.640
and you grew a lung,
and you stood up--

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.100
you know that, right?

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.450
That Adam and Eve shit is
hard to digest [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:18.110
So you know that you came out
of the ocean, you grew a lung,

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.950
we believe that, some of us.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.620
And I like what
Krishna said, and what

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.380
yogis have said about union.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.380
If God were the ocean,
we would be a cup of God.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.160
Why do I believe that now?

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.651
Because quantum physicists are
starting to believe it too.

00:31:34.651 --> 00:31:35.150
Right?

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.180
That we're all connected--
all the animals

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.350
we abuse, all the
planet we fuck up,

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.150
all this shit we're with--
that's us we're fucking with,

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.170
us.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.020
We're all connected.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:48.930
So that's a spiritual-- but
in the basis of a lot of what

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.920
the prophets said too, although
it's not what we teach,

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.960
it's separation to me.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.330
I'm not knocking religion, but
it's kind of separate in cases,

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.901
and you have to double
check what they tell you.

00:31:59.901 --> 00:32:00.400
All right?

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.004
The imams, rabbis, preachers,
they might say some shit,

00:32:03.004 --> 00:32:04.420
might put some
people [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.350
they might do anything.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:09.160
They do horrible stuff,
religious leaders.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.860
So I kind of shy
away from all that,

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.970
even though I'm the chairman
of the Foundation for Ethnic

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.660
Understanding, and I
have imams and rabbis

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.692

Including, in Israel
we have 20 programs,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.960
so it's a real--
I really believe

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.900
in religion as a way
of helping people,

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.166
but I don't personally
subscribe to any.

00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:32.130
CHRIS MORROW: Well
how about this though,

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.838
I had an incident--
and this kind of ties

00:32:33.838 --> 00:32:36.920
into your question-- on
Easter Sunday, where my aunt--

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.420
who's a born again Christian,
and very serious about that--

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.270
came up to me, and took
me aside, and said,

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.670
she'd read the book-- and I
could tell she was a little

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:51.040
nervous-- and she was concerned
that meditation would interfere

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.270
with, or kind of--

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.436
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Thinking
for yourself is a problem.

00:32:54.436 --> 00:32:56.750
CHRIS MORROW: Well, hey.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.590
Anti-prayer, I think,
was the term she used.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.048
It would somehow
affect her prayer.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.330
That "C.R.E.A.M."?

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:05.900
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
That's "C.R.E.A.M."

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.280
CHRIS MORROW: All right.

RUSSELL SIMMONS: [INAUDIBLE]
You like that, Wu Tang Clan?

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:16.850
Yeah, you know, the Buddha
said check for yourself.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:17.710
Right?

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.050
Check for yourself.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.541
Double check what they tell you.

00:33:21.541 --> 00:33:23.950
Turn this thing off, I just
want it to stop ringing.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:26.560
CHRIS MORROW: I don't know if
that answered your question.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.855
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I
think I did, right?

00:33:27.855 --> 00:33:28.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.400
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Did I
answer the question, or no?

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.592
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:33:30.592 --> 00:33:32.466
RUSSELL SIMMONS: You
asked me about religion.

00:33:32.466 --> 00:33:36.140
I don't personally
give a fuck, but I

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.120
believe it's good for people.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:43.080
And I have not found a
religion that suits me.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.070
Compassion, religiously
practice compassion.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.570
And the Buddha guy here,
on the bottom of the OM,

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.023
the OM is really-- and
they just put him here,

00:33:52.023 --> 00:33:55.130
he doesn't get in
too many fights.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.330
I like him because he
has the least fights.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.826
CHRIS MORROW: That's true.

00:33:58.826 --> 00:34:00.450
I'm going to take a
question over here.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.844
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
There's no yogis at war.

00:34:03.844 --> 00:34:06.260
AUDIENCE: So my name's Keith,
it's great to have you here.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.420
I really appreciate your time.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.670
So I've got a pretty
simple question.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:13.590
I moved to Manhattan, about a
year ago, from San Francisco.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.072
And I feel like any time
you move to this city,

00:34:16.072 --> 00:34:17.530
you just have this
tendency to want

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.340
to like, triple your workload.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.620
Manhattan is just
moving so quick.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.659
And so I did that, and
realized that I was just

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:27.500
kind of going stir
crazy, and I needed

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.340
to sit down and meditate,
for the first time.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.159
So I try to work it
into my daily routine.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:38.090
So I was trying to
do it 10 minutes,

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.070
every morning, before
I walk to work.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.719
And I remember the
first three times

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.480
I did it, like I
thought I was crazy,

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.570
listening to all the
thoughts in my head,

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.380
I mean there was just
so much going on,

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.060
I'd never done this before.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.510
But eventually,
I kind of gave it

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.860
up, because I was trying to
do everything else, you know?

RUSSELL SIMMONS: If you
don't have 20 minutes,

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.693
you need two hours.

00:35:00.693 --> 00:35:02.630

mean it was tough.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.280

Did you hear me?

you need two hours.

AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:09.685 --> 00:35:11.810
RUSSELL SIMMONS: The thoughts
should bounce around,

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.080
they should have fun,
and they should settle.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.510
And they will
settle for everyone.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.030
No one is exempt.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.090
Everyone will
meditate if they sit.

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.070
And patience, don't
look for anything,

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:28.814
don't expect anything,
and I promise you,

00:35:28.814 --> 00:35:30.870
there's no way you
can't meditate.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.801
And if you have more work--
they say oh, Russell,

00:35:33.801 --> 00:35:35.550

assistants traveling,

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.560
we're going somewhere.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.280

go to do these eight radio

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.880
stations, then you do this
TV, then you have the event,

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.890
and after the event you have
to go to meet with this person,

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.265
then you have this meeting,
and then you have that event,

00:35:47.265 --> 00:35:51.620
and then you have your
yoga at 4:45 to 5:45.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.620
It's only an hour class?

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:52.960
Yeah, it's an hour.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.520
OK.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.940
Then from 6:00 on, you're going
to just be doing interviews.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:03.790
Do I have my meditation
and my yoga class?

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.860
With that, the rest of it's
a game, I do what I'm told.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.150
The idea of the sickness
that comes from,

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:13.283

from the schedule--

I'm going next,

I just go where they
fucking tell me.

I mean, if I have to be
prepared, they prepare me.

and listen to him talk,

to get anxiety over it.

I used to be, I am.

water, the grain, everything.

the animals, and then do that?

It's so hurtful.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:56.260
So that's why we have to
meditate, because society,

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.000
sometimes we go
on a wrong course.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.610
Whole societies,
whole communities,

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:05.100
just say, oh let's genocide, or
we don't like their religion,

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.590
let's kill them,
put them in an oven.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.524
Horrible, horrible stuff.

00:40:09.524 --> 00:40:10.940
So you have to
decide for yourself

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.070
what you want to
participate in, and that's

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.710
why we meditate also,
because then when

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.170
you have the thoughts
settle you say, naw,

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:18.490
I don't want to do that shit.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.600
They can have that.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.170
Or maybe I'll speak
up against it.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:24.832
Maybe I'll use my voice.

00:40:24.832 --> 00:40:27.290
AUDIENCE: So, not to take up
too much time on my question--

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:28.210
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I know I
didn't answer your question,

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:29.754
I just went on a tangent.

00:40:29.754 --> 00:40:31.420
AUDIENCE: How do you
find time for this?

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.510
I mean you're a super busy guy.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.090
You say that it's on
your calendar but--

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:34.420
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
It's on my calendar.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.920
AUDIENCE: I feel
like it's something

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.506
you need to do every single day.

00:40:37.506 --> 00:40:39.130
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
Every day's different.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.700
I have a lot of
businesses, it's true,

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:41.750
and I have a lot
of smart people.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:43.374
Everybody around me
is smarter than me.

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:45.050
Everybody.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:48.580
So that's key, I think, in my
position you need smart people.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.420
Unless you're smart.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.549
Especially smart, I
mean, like really.

00:40:53.549 --> 00:40:54.840
AUDIENCE: All right, thank you.

00:40:59.178 --> 00:41:00.580
AUDIENCE: I think she was first.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:00.680
CHRIS MORROW: OK.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.641
RUSSELL SIMMONS: OK.

00:41:01.641 --> 00:41:03.890
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is
Andrea, thank you for coming.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:04.280
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
What's your name?

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.153
AUDIENCE: Andrea.

00:41:05.153 --> 00:41:06.319
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Hi, Andrea.

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:07.640
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.900
I was just interested
more in this idea--

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.025
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Do you
have a diamond in your eye?

00:41:12.025 --> 00:41:12.649
AUDIENCE: Yeah?

00:41:12.649 --> 00:41:13.780
No, it's an eyebrow ring.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.010
In this idea of
religion, and dealing

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:25.010
with people who may be
resistant to meditation or yoga,

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:29.010
I'm interested in how would you
persuade someone who may not

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.780
be interested, for perhaps,
a religious reason.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.080
For example, I teach
yoga, and I have

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.500
a sister who is very religious.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.833
RUSSELL SIMMONS: You teach yoga?

00:41:36.833 --> 00:41:38.590
AUDIENCE: I do.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:41.280
And similar to the story
you mentioned earlier,

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.250
she's very resistant,
I think she'd

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:47.070
be someone who could
benefit from meditation,

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.920
but I don't really know
how to approach her,

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.900
because I know her
views really influence

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.980
the way that she thinks.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.370
So what would you say
to someone like that?

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:59.240
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Well first
of all, be still and know,

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.860
is in her scripture, right?

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.090
It's quiet.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:10.162
There's no deities in silence,
it's just being quiet.

00:42:10.162 --> 00:42:12.120
You can give her a
vibration, or you could just

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.950
tell her to sit and say let.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:17.380
Inhale let, exhale go.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.310
Let go.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:21.544
It's not against your religion.

00:42:21.544 --> 00:42:22.960
If there is a piece
of God inside,

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.668
you maybe can dig
deep-- and don't say it

00:42:24.668 --> 00:42:27.280
if it scares them-- but
the idea that there's

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.275
the piece of God inside you,
and if you sit closer to God,

00:42:32.275 --> 00:42:34.690
it should strengthen your faith.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:38.140
It should, could,
strengthen your faith.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:44.140
And regarding the yoga,
a lot of Christian yogis,

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.780
and Muslim yogis, and
other religious yogis,

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.310
or yogis who have
faith already separate

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.990
from what's in
the Bhagavad Gita.

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.010
The deities are scary, right?

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.360
Shiva, Krishna, Lakshmi,
all this rap, you say,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.470
wait, who are all
of these people?

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:03.850
But they're just images
of ideas, you know?

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:05.500
The goddess of wealth,
you give and you

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.210
get, the cycle of
giving, you know?

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:08.910
So it's just there for that.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:11.130
But you could leave them out.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.840
You don't have to
use Sanskrit words.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:14.505
Right?

00:43:14.505 --> 00:43:17.280
Upward dog, you don't
have to call it.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.830
I think it's easy though.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.620
Yoga, we're just stretching
to promote circulation.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:25.310
And meditation, we're just
being quiet to reboot our brain.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.290
We don't have to scare
them, and we don't need to.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.360
And I'm having this discussion
with lots of people,

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.060
because we have what we
call Quiet Time in schools--

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.660
we don't use the word
meditation-- Quiet Time.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:40.521
And I think that's all it is.

00:43:40.521 --> 00:43:41.770
In the end, that's what it is.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:46.450
That's what the research is on,
the Quiet Time, not on Krishna.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:47.275
It's true.

00:43:47.275 --> 00:43:49.400
You probably have studied
all the scripture, right?

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.149
As a yoga teacher?

00:43:52.633 --> 00:43:53.466
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.720
AUDIENCE: My question--

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.886
RUSSELL SIMMONS: She's next.

00:44:00.502 --> 00:44:01.210
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:04.460
Hi, I'm Meme, thanks for coming.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.900
So I feel like a
common thing, when

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.310
I try to talk about
meditation, the common push

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:14.490
back that I get, which I'm not
sure I have a good defense for,

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:19.000
is, what if meditation makes
you too complacent in a world

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.280
where there might not be room?

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.350
Like sometimes I feel like for
me it's like, for example--

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:26.180
well this is not
meditation related,

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.600
it's kind of an analogy--
like in high school I wasn't

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.516
very good basketball
player, because I'm like,

00:44:30.516 --> 00:44:32.500
well you take the
ball this time,

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.460
I'll take the ball next time.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.200
Whatever happens, happens.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.650
Or like in work, for example, or
in a relationship or whatever,

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.980
if you're like, OK is
this just me not liking it

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.170
or just me not getting
along the person?

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:48.890
Or is it just a mindset
that I need to shift,

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.010
or if you lose something?

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:54.230
So I guess my question is, how
do you not become too much of,

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:55.760
OK well this is
just a part of life,

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.580
and these emotions
that I feel are just

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:03.330
an instantaneous emotion that
will pass by if I let it go?

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:04.920
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
I think by being

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.529
quiet you get in touch with
a strength, not a weakness.

00:45:09.529 --> 00:45:10.570
I think that's the point.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:16.545
It's like, you sit-- oh,
they're chopping up animals,

00:45:16.545 --> 00:45:19.350
I'm going to go protest.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:22.010
A lot of meditators, you
find they're activists.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:25.680
They're not quiet, they're
more likely to be activists.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.190
To go outside the box, to
do what's in their heart.

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.690
If they're basketball
players, they're more clear.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:36.040
If they go to work every day,
and they're focused and present

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.920
in the moment,
they do a good job.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.310
The work is a challenge
that we accept.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:48.295
The relationship is a challenge,
we accept it in the present,

00:45:48.295 --> 00:45:50.706
we do our best.

00:45:50.706 --> 00:45:51.830
You gotta get the fuck out.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:55.960
You can be strong.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.200
You can say, no, it's
not going to work.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.200
Not mean, but you can be strong.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.895
Meditation helps you
to find the strength.

00:46:02.895 --> 00:46:06.560
It doesn't make you complacent,
that's a misconception.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.430
And I can say that
in all certainty,

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:15.500
you'll feel more in charge,
more confident, more awake.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.670
And so it's not about
being complacent at all.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:20.380
In fact, it's the opposite.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.660
And that's just my argument.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:25.010
If you can tell me an example
of how you've been a meditator

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:29.930
and it made you a doormat, or
made you less likely to fulfill

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:34.350
your dharma, then
I can speak to it,

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.300
but I don't think you
have those examples.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.955
If you meditate, you will take
more control of your life,

00:46:40.955 --> 00:46:42.330
you're not going
to let go of it.

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:50.990
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.590
My question is related
to-- first I guess,

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.430
my name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:57.290
While growing up in
India, I remember

00:46:57.290 --> 00:47:00.690
my grandparents used to have the
similar things to what you have

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.910
any hand, beads and with the OM.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:06.550
And we used to collect in
the evening to do meditation,

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:08.810
they just called it quiet
time because meditation

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.140
wasn't hip with kids.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.910
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
Good, [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:18.350
AUDIENCE: Kind of along
the way, come here.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:21.290
At that time we thought were
wasting about almost half

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.572
an hour to an hour.

00:47:22.572 --> 00:47:24.780
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Is that
what you thought as a child?

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.696
AUDIENCE: Because everybody
was studying hard,

00:47:26.696 --> 00:47:29.550
and I didn't study that much,
but I used to recall more,

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:30.850
I used to remember more.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:33.960
Everybody was surprised,
how do you remember things,

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.120
like, that was taught
six months ago.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.610
I have no idea.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:43.330
But now I kind of lost all
that, because the grandparents

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:44.837
are gone, since then.

00:47:44.837 --> 00:47:46.920
RUSSELL SIMMONS: They
stopped making you meditate.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, nobody
is making me meditate.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.115
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
Yeah, my kids, I

00:47:50.115 --> 00:47:52.330
think the minute they get
from under Kimora's foot

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:54.840
on their throat, that they're
going to stop meditating.

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.070
They meditate every day,
and they're deep meditators.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:59.940
But I think that they're, oh
Daddy, and their mother's like,

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.890
get in there.

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:03.700
And they sit, but in the
minutes-- that half an hour

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.020
you wasted-- do you know how
long it is you sit there?

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.103
And everything was going
crazy, and the next thing

00:48:08.103 --> 00:48:10.735
you know it's like,
meditation's over.

00:48:10.735 --> 00:48:13.880
Or the next thing you
know, you enjoy it.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:18.170
But kids will still resist if
you make them, I make my kids.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:22.279
But I know-- they both go
to school for the gifted.

00:48:22.279 --> 00:48:23.695
My 11-year-old has
been meditating

00:48:23.695 --> 00:48:27.880
since she was eight, my
14-year-old since she was 10.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.010
They've been
meditating a long time.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:33.340
When they meditate,
they're deep meditators,

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:36.400
they just disappear quickly.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:40.350
I don't want to do it-- gone.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:44.120
I look over, because sometimes
they could be fidgeting,

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.809
or they could be like,
Daddy-- they're resisting.

00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:49.850
I'll tell your mom-- and
they just go back to it.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.490
But then they disappear, and
when they open their eyes,

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:54.115
you can just see that
they're so happy,

00:48:54.115 --> 00:48:56.741
and they start giggling,
and laughing, and happy.

00:48:56.741 --> 00:48:58.740
And before meditation
they could have just been,

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.251
Mom, I don't want to--
then they open their eyes,

00:49:01.251 --> 00:49:04.360
and they're happy.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.287
And so I don't know, you
force goodness on people,

00:49:07.287 --> 00:49:09.620
you say, don't eat that, don't
eat that, don't eat that.

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.230
Then one day they're just
going to eat a lot of it.

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.880
So that could be true.

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.320
But you, having had
that experience,

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.870
and having a greater memory,
and greater brain functionality,

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:24.300
and a more expansive mindset and
all that, you don't miss that.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.840
You work at Google, you
don't need your brains.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.660
Go back, meditate.

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.952
Get quiet time.

00:49:31.952 --> 00:49:34.410
AUDIENCE: And quiet time, that's
what I was thinking about,

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:38.290
on my subway that's kind of
an hour long commute to home,

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.130
then my son needs my attention.

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:42.700
So adding on to his
question I think,

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:47.250
[INAUDIBLE], but I was thinking
like, why doesn't the subway

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.930
have screens, where they
just, people say to meditate,

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:53.609
or yoga, and then we all in the
subway would start doing that.

00:49:53.609 --> 00:49:56.150
Because everybody is standing
anyway, just closes their eyes,

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.395
and then you would
know when the stop has

00:49:58.395 --> 00:50:00.832
come because it announces now.

00:50:00.832 --> 00:50:03.270
Have you thought
about putting it--

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.020
because I can't do
that in the office,

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.010
I can't do that at
home, because I can't

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:11.424
make my two-year-old
stay and sit with me.

00:50:11.424 --> 00:50:13.590
RUSSELL SIMMONS: There's
always a place to meditate.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.531
Go to the bathroom.

00:50:15.531 --> 00:50:17.030
Sit on the toilet,
put the alarm on.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:18.696
CHRIS MORROW: I
meditate in my bathroom,

00:50:18.696 --> 00:50:20.273
I put a pillow on
the toilet, that's

00:50:20.273 --> 00:50:21.523
the only place I can get away.

00:50:21.523 --> 00:50:23.790
Why are you looking
at me like that?

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:25.290
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
On the toilet seat?

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:26.855
CHRIS MORROW: I mean, I shut it.

00:50:26.855 --> 00:50:28.230
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
Oh, you shut it.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.410
CHRIS MORROW: Yeah.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:31.860
But I meditate on
the subway too.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.080
I mean it's New York, you've
got to get it where you get it.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.070
RUSSELL SIMMONS: You get the
alarm, you put the alarm on,

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:36.190
and you sit.

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:38.490
You sit, and no matter
what-- the best thing

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.220
is the alarm, for beginners.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.910
You turn the alarm on.

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:45.642
A little sunshine ring,
whatever ring you put on there.

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:46.600
Who's that, you waving?

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.300
Do we have to leave?

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.780
CHRIS MORROW: No,
she's saying hi.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:49.300
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Oh, hi.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:50.690
CHRIS MORROW: We should
do one more question,

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:51.910
and then we should
teach everybody.

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:52.580
RUSSELL SIMMONS: But the idea
is, you put the alarm on,

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.470
and you sit.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.920
AUDIENCE: Is chanting
also a form of meditation?

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.253
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Chanting is
another form of meditation,

00:50:59.253 --> 00:51:00.730
of course.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:03.790
Anything that quiets the mind.

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:06.866
People chat
themselves into bliss.

00:51:06.866 --> 00:51:10.230
You know, kirtan, yogis,
they chant, chant.

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:11.480
I've never been a big chanter.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.746
I chant when they tell
me, I do what they say.

00:51:14.746 --> 00:51:16.692
You know, OM.

00:51:16.692 --> 00:51:18.620
OK, they do it every class.

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:22.350
And they'll chant a few words,
[FOREIGN LANGUAGE], you know,

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:24.340
Hindu prayers.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.250
OK, and people do it,
but people really--

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.169
just like some
people candle gaze.

00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:30.627
They look at a
candle and they just

00:51:30.627 --> 00:51:32.600
stare at the fucking
candle, they stare,

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.070
and they're just out,
staring at a candle.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:38.320
I've done it, it
didn't really grab me

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:43.020
as my form of
meditation, but I'm

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.785
sure I could learn
to candle gaze

00:51:45.785 --> 00:51:49.230
or chant more, any of those
things, they all work.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.010
AUDIENCE: So I
have a friend who's

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.280
gone on these
meditation retreats

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.640
where you kind of leave for
10 days, and you're silent,

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.140
and they have these
people that help

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.264
you go through this course.

00:52:03.264 --> 00:52:06.590
And like, 10 days, you don't
speak, and you meditate.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:11.280
Are there any benefits which you
see to really removing yourself

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.870
for extended period, versus
the daily-- have you done it?

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:17.585
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I
know all about it.

00:52:17.585 --> 00:52:20.540
I've heard about it
from countless people

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:22.537
who had great experiences.

00:52:22.537 --> 00:52:25.120
No one's ever come back from a
10-day silent retreat and said,

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:25.990
that sucked.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.987
No one.

00:52:26.987 --> 00:52:28.570
No really, no one's
ever told me that.

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:31.190
They're always like, oh I went
away, and after a couple days

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:32.900
I was like, I was
fucking gone, man.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.820
I was higher than the
[INAUDIBLE], and I came back,

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.630
and I was so relieved.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:40.500
Everybody, same response.

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:44.680
And I haven't taken 10 days
to do it, but I get it.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:48.820
I'm sure there's benefits,
that's why people do it.

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.372
And they get high, and happy,
and it's good for them.

00:52:51.372 --> 00:52:52.830
I probably should
do it, I haven't.

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:59.050
OK, now if you want to
get out now, you can.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.860
CHRIS MORROW: So
you want to just?

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.327
Let's set it up a little bit.

00:53:05.327 --> 00:53:07.160
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I'm
going to make it short.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:07.460
Seven minutes.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.560
CHRIS MORROW: Do we
have time to do--

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.185
RUSSELL SIMMONS: You
got seven minutes?

00:53:10.185 --> 00:53:12.080
CHRIS MORROW: Seven
minutes is a long time.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.470
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Seven minutes?

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:15.852
CHRIS MORROW: You guys
can handle seven minutes?

00:53:15.852 --> 00:53:17.170
RUSSELL SIMMONS: First of
all, your first experience,

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.070
you sit at home, you
do what I tell you,

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:20.719
you sit for 20
minutes, by yourself.

00:53:20.719 --> 00:53:23.010
So now we're all together,
we'll sit for seven minutes,

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:23.460
it's not hard.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.750
CHRIS MORROW: You going
to set your phone?

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:25.100
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Yeah.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.260
CHRIS MORROW: All
right, but let's--

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:26.670
RUSSELL SIMMONS: I
don't see why you

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.830
would say seven
minutes is a long time.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:29.600
Chris, are you keeping
up on your meditation?

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:30.700
You write a book with me--

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.250
CHRIS MORROW: Yeah, I was
up at 6 o'clock this morning

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:32.450
doing it.

00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:32.983
RUSSELL SIMMONS:
All right, well why

00:53:32.983 --> 00:53:34.180
do you think they can't sit?

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.735
Look, she's like, let
me out of here now.

00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:38.110
OK, look, here's
what we're going

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:41.520
to do, I'm going to
give you a mantra, rum.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.005
The collective is
going to use rum.

00:53:44.005 --> 00:53:45.750
We're all going to use rum, rum.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.830
Say rum, rum, rum, rum, rum.

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:49.730
AUDIENCE: Rum,
rum, rum, rum, rum.

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.510
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Say it really
fast, rum rum rum rum rum.

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:54.220
Now say it slow, rum.

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.800
So that's our mantra, rum.

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.630
Doesn't have any meaning,
so don't think, not alcohol.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:08.315
Not alcohol, it's just
rum, it's a vibration.

00:54:08.315 --> 00:54:10.280
It has no meaning,
but we're going

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.644
to concentrate on this word.

00:54:12.644 --> 00:54:14.810
But we're not going to
concentrate hard on the word,

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:17.410
we're going to concentrate
lightly on the word,

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:20.640
try to keep it in our
sense, in front of us.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.640
And we'll try to focus on
rum, and then the mind's

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.675
going to go crazy.

00:54:24.675 --> 00:54:26.800
It's going to go into
the-- first thing,

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.560
we'll do a few tricks
before we start,

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.332
but that's going
to be our mantra.

00:54:30.332 --> 00:54:32.540
But the mind is going to go
somewhere into a thought,

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.185
and you're going to think
the thought, if you want.

00:54:34.185 --> 00:54:35.726
If it's not worth
it, don't think it.

00:54:35.726 --> 00:54:39.390
Think it, think the thought,
understand the thought,

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:42.700
digest the thought, and
go back to your mantra.

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.920
Go back to your mantra,
keep coming back gently

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.472
to the mantra.

00:54:46.472 --> 00:54:50.490
You hold the mantra, they
should become at some point,

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:53.860
the mantra will be so much more
satisfying than the thoughts.

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.770
That may not happen today.

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:58.140
Nothing may happen today.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.110
But if you are not
looking for anything,

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:05.450
you will definitely find
great peace, even today.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:09.731
You sit and repeat the mantra
to yourself, and that's it.

00:55:09.731 --> 00:55:12.355
Now first thing, we're going to
do a little breathing exercise.

00:55:15.301 --> 00:55:15.800
Two fingers.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.840
Breath in through
your left side,

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:28.402
hold it, breath out
through your right side.

00:55:31.054 --> 00:55:32.785
Let's do that 20 times.

00:55:32.785 --> 00:55:37.150
Go to the right
side now, hold it.

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:54.880
Focus on the space between
the breath when you hold it.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:50.930
Inhale all the way,
hold it, release.

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:57.990
Now do me a quick
favor before we begin.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:00.170
Close your eyes and think
of everything at one time.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.160
Now you all meditated,
because no one had a thought.

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:14.760
Right?

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.120
Everything at once
and no thoughts.

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.960
So we're going to sit.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.118
Open your eyes and sit.

00:57:23.118 --> 00:57:26.360
We're going to sit down and
relax in the most comfortable

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:31.453
position that we
can find, and we're

00:57:31.453 --> 00:57:34.145
going to start to repeat
our mantra to ourselves.

00:57:34.145 --> 00:57:36.500
We're not going to
expect anything,

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.270
not going to
regulate our breath,

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:42.701
just going to repeat the
mantra and rest in perfection

00:57:42.701 --> 00:57:43.450
for a few minutes.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:40.295
[BEEPING]

01:04:40.295 --> 01:04:42.670
RUSSELL SIMMONS: Come out of
it, begin to come out of it.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.440
Breathe deep.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:50.620
Smile.

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:00.470
How was that?

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:06.480
All right.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.010
It doesn't cost shit, it's free.

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:12.460
You can do it every day.

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.960
Thank you so much,
it was a pleasure.
