00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And this concept here of taking an input and

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
transforming it in polynomial time

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
into a new input for another problem

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so that you get the same solution is known as a polynomial time reduction.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And if you want to be precise about what you're applying this reduction to,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you can say that you have a polynomial time reduction from X to Y,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so in other words, you can take a problem X

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and show that problem Y is powerful enough to solve problem X.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So in order to help you wrap your head

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
a little bit more around polynomial time reductions,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we'll do a little quiz here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So I would like you to think about if we

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
manage to reduce a problem X to another problem Y, what does that imply?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I'm going to give you 4 choices here,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and I know it's easy to guess which one of those are correct,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but you should really give this some thought first

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to make sure that you understand the concept of reductions

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
because this is going to play a very important role

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in this unit and also in the next units.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So I'll give you 4 choices here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Does reducing a problem X to a problem Y imply that:

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
X is at least as hard to solve as Y,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and by hardness, I mean the distinction

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
between polynomial time and exponential time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So in this case here for example,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
if Y is only solvable in exponential time,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
does that mean that X can only be solved in exponential time as well

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or is it other way around?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Does it imply that Y is at least as hard to solve as X?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Does it mean that if X can be solved for the polynomial time, then so can Y

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
or does it mean that if Y can be solved for the polynimial time, then so can X?

00:01:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So please check all of the answers here that are correct.
