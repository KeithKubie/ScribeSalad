00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Vipal De Anshu asks about the challenge problems.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
He wants to know if you can give more explanation on tips and techniques

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and tricks to help students solve them before the final to help them prepare.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is a tough question.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There's no magic way that I can give you that's going to really solve this.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The way to learn to solve challenges like this is really to practice

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and to solve increasingly difficult ones.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Doing cryptography depends on persistence in a lot of cases.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It also depends on creativity and being open-minded.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And often people think a challenge is going to be really hard,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so they don't try the easy things.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So definitely make sure that you understand what the challenge is asking for

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and think about the easy things first before assuming that you have to try something

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
really complicated.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Also a big difficulty is deciding are you on the right path

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and should you keep trying that, or are you stuck in a rut

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and you need to try something different?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is one of the things that makes cryptography hard.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The challenges in this class are all contrived challenges.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They are intended to give you a sense of what it would be like to break a cryptosystem

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that's not contrived to be breakable.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But that's a little different, and that means it's a challenge for us

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to construct ones that are good.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I know there was a lot of grumbling about the challenge in Homework 2

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that many people spent a lot of effort on it trying to do complicated things to break it

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and learning about random number generation and the different ways to do that.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I hope you found that worthwhile and got something out of it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It turned out the actual sequence was quite easy to break

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
if you looked at it in the right way.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It was not intended to be quite as easy as it was,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and I apologize for some of the obvious flaws in it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I won't say specifically what they are now

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because I know some people still want to try the challenge on their own.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But that was a mistake on my part, and I'm sorry that it turned out to be

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
as trivial once you looked at it in the right way as it was.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But it was intended to be something where you could break it without doing a lot of research

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
into other types of random number generation schemes.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That wasn't the intent of the question.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The intent was if you looked at it different ways--

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
looking at the bit patterns, looking for any kind of patterns in the sequence--

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that would be what you need to break it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We will have some interesting challenge questions for Homework 4

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that will scale up to levels of difficulty.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I think one of the things to get better at solving challenges

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
is to have the practice of solving ones.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You build your confidence as you solve easier challenges and move on to harder ones.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So what the challenge for Homework 4 will be,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
there will be some that we give you some pretty good hints about how to solve

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and we think will still be hard and involve an interesting challenge to solve them,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and there are others that we're not going to tell you about what to solve.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And we're not going to tell you which ones are the easy ones

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and which ones are the hard ones.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This is going to give you a different kind of experience solving a challenge.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I hope people enjoy it and get something out of it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Definitely to be able to attack it, the first step is to understand

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the underlying crypto behind it, and that hopefully will come out of the lecture

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and solving the other problems.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
But the short answer--and I'm getting a little bit rambling

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
because I don't have a good answer that says if you do X, Y and Z

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
all of a sudden challenge problems will get easy

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and you'll be able to break all these known cryptosystems--

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it really takes practice.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It also takes sort of having an open mind and thinking about different things to try

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and creativity, but the way to learn is to practice

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and to try to solve increasingly hard challenge problems.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The other thing that is really the way to learn is to work with other people.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If you can do that with someone in person who's experienced at solving these kinds of problems,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that's really the best way, to have that kind of back and forth.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
If you can do that on the forums, that also is great.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And so the challenge problems that have worked well,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
we've seen a discussion in the forum where people have suggested the different approach

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
they have tried.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Other people might add to those or suggest an alternative.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Those are the things that will really help you develop

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
in terms of solving problems like this--having that kind of a discussion

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and learning about approaches other people take

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but still putting the work in to try to think of ways to solve it yourself.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So I hope you'll enjoy the future challenge problems

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and they will give you a good sense and build your confidence in solving them.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I realize that it can be frustrating, and that's part of the difficulty

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is if you knew you were on the right path and making progress every step,

00:04:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that would be great. But that's not usually the way things work in cryptography.
