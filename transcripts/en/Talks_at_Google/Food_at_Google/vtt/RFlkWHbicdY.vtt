LIV WU: Chris and
Danny were just

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.400
telling me that this book is
almost-- it is, not almost--

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.930
a journal and a diary
of the backstory

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.840
as they were trying to open
Mission Chinese in New York.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.120
There were ups and downs.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.890
And then they
would operationally

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.090
try to get the restaurant
going, despite some hurdles.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.980
But then they'd spend four
hours, up to around 2:00

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.820
AM at night, talking about,
what are the recipes that

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.100
are going in this cookbook?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.750
How do we actually write
down what we create?

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.900
And so the book is
a labor of love.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.430
It's a record of a conversation
between two people who

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.490
love what they do about food
and are passionate about it.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.440
And it's also a resource.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.180
Because at one point,
Danny, you lost the recipes

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.411
in the restaurant, right?

00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:58.910
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.380
LIV WU: So they actually
had some recipes recorded.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.120
So this is the working
document for Mission Chinese.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.470
Unlike some cookbooks
that are written

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.640
by chefs and restaurateurs,
this is real and alive.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.630
And it has the DNA of
Mission Chinese in it.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.250
So they are both
very accomplished.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.860
I think you know about them.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.860
Danny is a James Beard Rising
Star award winner from 2013.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.200
Chris is the founder
of "Lucky Peach."

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.530
He's a really
fabulous food writer.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.060
And this is a great partnership.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.810
So today, what they're
going to do for you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.200
is a recipe from the book.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.050
And then we're going to
pull in a Googler who

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.910
contributed an idea for what
he wanted these two to do.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.740
And they'll play for you and
be quite creative and Googly

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.940
about this whole thing.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.820
So without much ado,
Danny and Chris.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:12.432
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.390
CHRIS YING: Thank you
guys heard for coming out

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.140
in the middle of your
work day and seeing

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.380
whatever we're doing here.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.492
DANNY BOWIEN: We're gonna
cook some stuff, I think.

00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:23.200
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.750
Like Liv was saying,
this book that I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.570
hope you guys all have
a chance to look at

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.544
is really like-- I've worked
on a fair number of cookbooks

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:32.710
and read a lot of cookbooks.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.180
And I really feel like this,
more than any other book

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.080
I've ever encountered, is
like part of the restaurant.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.500
Like the money that we
got for this cookbook

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.710
enabled us to open-- or
enabled Danny to open--

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.520
a restaurant in New York.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.940
When Danny--

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.200
DANNY BOWIEN: We
ran out of money.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.992
Like, very quickly.

00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:53.699
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.260
And Danny had grand plans to
pay off his student debts.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.540
But instead, the money from
the book opened the restaurant.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.450
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.991
CHRIS YING: We wrote
it in real time.

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:04.970
Everything that happened
for Mission Chinese

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.480
and to Mission Chinese over the
last four years is in there.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.609
So it's a fun one.

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:10.400
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.560
It's really crazy, because--
can you guys hear me?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.190
Is my mic on?

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.560
Oh, there it is.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.032
It's got a feedback [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:16.032 --> 00:03:17.240
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.320
DANNY BOWIEN: OK.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.150
So yeah.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.900
It's really funny.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.214
Because this book was supposed
to be done how long ago?

00:03:24.214 --> 00:03:26.130
CHRIS YING: We were like
2 and 1/2 years late.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.300
DANNY BOWIEN: So when we
actually sold the book,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.122
I was moving to New York to
open-- I had this great idea.

00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:34.122
I was like, let's open a
restaurant in New York.

00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:38.690
Which you should read about
in the book, because it

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.230
was very tumultuous.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.590
So we sold it before Mission
Chinese New York had even

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.090
opened.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.220
So it was all off of
the good faith and trust

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.590
of the San Francisco operation
that we've been running.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.680
So we opened it to much success.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.604
And then we closed it twice.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:04:00.020
It got shut down by the health
department of New York City

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.680
twice.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.540
So that automatically--
we were like, well,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.990
what should we do with the book?

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.280
Because we were behind.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.321
Because we were running
a restaurant in New York.

00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.740
And that's crazy.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.660
So it really has
evolved into this thing.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.620
And we actually had to
cut it off at one point.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.339
I would be calling Chris
and being like, dude,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.709
we have all these new recipes.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.215
We've gotta do this,
this, and this.

00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:24.215
And we just have to do
another book, eventually,

00:04:24.215 --> 00:04:25.790
because there's so much content.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.164
So a lot of the
stuff in the book

00:04:27.164 --> 00:04:29.810
is about the earlier years.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.180
You'll see in the end, we
peppered in a few recipes

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.370
from New York.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.856
Some of the recipes are
going to be on the menu here

00:04:35.856 --> 00:04:36.980
in San Francisco soon, too.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.415
But anyways--

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:40.470
CHRIS YING: So this
recipe you're going to do

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.210
is from the book.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.177
It's one of the classic
Mission Chinese ones.

00:04:44.177 --> 00:04:46.260
DANNY BOWIEN: How many
guys here-- and this is not

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.850
a rhetorical-- this is an
honest question because

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.910
up until recently, I even had
trouble with this as a chef.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.380
But how many of you guys here
know how to boil eggs properly?

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.910
All right.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.701
So there's lots of
different ways to do it.

00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:02.240
And ideally, I don't screw this
up in front of all of you guys

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.360
right now.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.510
But so really, a cool
trick is-- we always

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.806
try to soft-cook eggs
for our porridge.

00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:11.680
We're going to make a
Westlake rice porridge.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.180
So the idea behind
this whole thing

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.750
is Westlake beef soup is a
really classic Cantonese, kind

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.640
of Chinese American
dish that I've

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.060
had at lots of
places, specifically

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.410
R&amp;G Lounge, which is one
of my favorite restaurants

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.840
in the entire universe.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.127
But what it is is kind
of like an egg drop soup,

00:05:30.127 --> 00:05:30.960
but there's no yolk.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.890
It's basically an
egg white soup that's

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.400
thickened with corn
starch, usually.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.800
It's got some stock in it.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.950
And there's always beef,
cilantro, and sometimes

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.000
there's imitation
crab or real crab.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.170
So the idea of
this whole dish was

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.490
we wanted to make a dish
at Mission Chinese that

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.725
wasn't like a corn-starch
thick, slurried soup.

00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:56.350
We wanted to make something that
had the same kind of feeling--

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.640
mouth-feel, texture-- as hot
and sour soup or egg drop soup

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.480
or chicken and corn soup, but
not using the corn starch.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.882
So for me, congee has always
been a really awesome--

00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:09.590
how many people here
know what congee is?

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.830
I'm sure a lot of you.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.100
So usually, congee is--
depending on where you go,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.900
it's very thick and very tight.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.940
You usually eat it in the
morning for breakfast, or I do.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.840
And it gets you going
through the day.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.265
And you're not
hungry for a while.

00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:23.140
But at the restaurant,
what we were seeing is

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.609
we would make this
rice porridge.

00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:26.150
And people would
just get crushed off

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.480
of a bowl of rice porridge.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.500
And they wouldn't be able
to eat anything else.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.980
And you would also
just be losing money.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.510
Because how much can you charge
for a bowl of rice and water?

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.977
So in grand Mission
Chinese style,

00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:42.310
we were like, let's just put
a lot of fancy stuff in it,

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.990
and make it not so heavy so
you can eat other things.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.114
So that was a
long-winded explanation

00:06:48.114 --> 00:06:49.280
of what we're about to make.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.279
And then I'm just going
to demo this super-fast.

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.080
So keep up, if you can.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.630
You just get a pot.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.600
My soft-cooked eggs--
the Westlake rice

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.950
porridge we do always
has beef of some form.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.170
For this recipe, we
use beef cheeks, which

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.900
you guys can find, I'm sure.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.329
Bi-Rite stocks them usually.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:11.120
If you go to your
butcher, you can get them

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.670
if you ask them very
nicely for them.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.950
There's a lot of fat
and connective tissue

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.870
in beef cheeks that breaks
down when you cook it

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.850
very slowly, when you
braise it, and just turns

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.352
into really awesome flavor.

00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:23.726
If you don't have
beef cheek, you

00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:26.490
could use-- we don't even use
beef cheek in New York anymore.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.420
We just cut up raw beef and
throw raw beef into it-- really

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.680
awesome, grass-fed beef tartar.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.210
And then we fold in sea urchin
and trout roe or salmon roe.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.380
But we always do an egg.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.755
I think an egg is
very important.

00:07:40.755 --> 00:07:42.740
So soft-cooking eggs
couldn't be easier.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.070
I always just take an
egg, and put it into a pan

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.740
without water in it.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.440
And then I cover it with water.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.814
And this is cold water.

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:55.480
And then you just
wait for this to boil.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.921
So this should take-- I
don't know-- a while to boil.

00:07:57.921 --> 00:07:59.670
Hopefully it boils by
the time we're done.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.070
When it comes to boil,
you put a lid on it.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.110
And then you just step back
and wait 6 to 6 and 1/2

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.480
minutes off the heat.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.356
Just cover it.

00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:09.230
Take it off the heat.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.460
Let it sit for 6 minutes.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.320
After 6 minutes, take it out
of the water-- preferably not

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.240
with your hand.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.910
And then put it
into some ice water.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:17.485
Shock it.

00:08:17.485 --> 00:08:18.330
And open it up.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.060
You'll have an egg that is just
barely runny in the middle,

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.219
and that white is perfectly set.

00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:25.760
A lot of mistakes
people usually make

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.843
when they're soft-cooking
eggs is they drop eggs--

00:08:27.843 --> 00:08:30.170
and I do this myself--
into boiling water.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.682
What happens is the outside
of the actual egg, when

00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:37.140
it hits that hot water-- usually
the temperature of the egg

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.559
itself from the
refrigerator is cold.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.100
Even if you temper it, the
temperature of that eggshell

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.820
is a lot different temperature
than the boiling water.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.360
And it will actually crack
when it hits the bottom.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.210
And then you don't have
this nice round egg.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.370
You have little strands of
white egg in your water,

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.230
and it doesn't work.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.250
So I think covering
it with cold water--

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:02.970
bring it up to a boil, 6 to
7 minutes, and you're golden.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.050
Another thing that I'm
just going to hammer out

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.000
really fast so we can make fun
of ourselves about this book

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.530
is the rice porridge--
ratios for rice porridges

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.760
can vary wildly.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.327
I like to take a
pot like this size.

00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:19.410
One of the things you want
to remember when you're

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.240
making a rice porridge, if
you guys end up making this,

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.770
is that rice is starch.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.641
So starch, if you don't pay
too much attention to it--

00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:28.890
how many of you guys have
been making mashed potatoes,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.900
and forgot about it,
and then just burned

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.552
your mashed potatoes?

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:35.010
No one's going to
raise their hand,

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.120
but I'm sure it's happened.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.120
The ratio of rice to water
is about 12 to 16 parts water

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.120
to one part rice.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.715
So literally, you need
like a gallon of water

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:50.830
to like a cup of rice.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.580
And it makes a lot
of rice porridge.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.890
So what's great about
this dish is-- you know,

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.009
Thanksgiving is coming up.

00:09:57.009 --> 00:09:59.050
If you wanted to make
something for everyone when

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.105
they come over and they're all
like-- you know, you're hungry.

00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:03.780
You don't want to get too full.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.470
A nice rice broth
is really nice.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.176
It's easy.

00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:07.050
Everyone's impressed.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.295
They're like, wow,
he made congee?

00:10:09.295 --> 00:10:11.070
All you've got to do
is buy fancy stuff

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.770
and put it in this rice broth.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.707
And everyone will
be very impressed.

00:10:15.707 --> 00:10:18.290
CHRIS YING: You're just giving
away the entire business model.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.623
DANNY BOWIEN: This is how you
open Mission Chinese Food.

00:10:20.623 --> 00:10:22.230
Just make rice broth.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.210
Put fancy things in it.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.734
You're good.

00:10:25.734 --> 00:10:27.400
This is working out
perfectly, actually.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.200
So this water is
about to come up.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.530
It's coming up to a simmer.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.859
One of the very important things
to do-- the version of rice

00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:35.650
porridge we make, we
make it a lot thinner.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.590
So it's closer to like a
Vietnamese rice porridge

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.331
than it is a Chinese
rice porridge.

00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:43.580
Neither way is right or wrong.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.410
I just prefer it to
be a little thinner.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.500
Big pot, small amount of
rice-- this goes in the pot.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.610
And then you toast this.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.200
You want to toast this
until it smells fragrant.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.106
I always use jasmine rice.

00:10:58.106 --> 00:10:59.230
I really love jasmine rice.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.862
I think the flavor's amazing.

00:11:00.862 --> 00:11:02.070
You can use short-grain rice.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.820
But know that if you
use short-grain rice,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.540
it's going to get a lot thicker.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.040
Yeah.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.220
So that's it.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.810
Toast this on this
thing-- on a stove,

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.720
or whatever you have
at home, a hot plate--

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.710
until it's fragrant.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.876
You don't want it to be
brown or anything like that.

00:11:18.876 --> 00:11:20.890
And then you want to
add your water or stock.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.450
I always add water.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.090
And then it's kind of
crazy, because the way

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.557
I was taught to do this,
the lady at Duc Loi--

00:11:32.557 --> 00:11:34.390
does anyone know what
that grocery store is?

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.726
There's a market in the
Mission, next to Mission Chinese

00:11:37.726 --> 00:11:38.600
Food, called Duc Loi.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.920
It's a Vietnamese market.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.080
The owner's name is Amanda.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.490
And she was just like, oh,
when I make my rice porridge,

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.110
I just put a whole
chicken in there.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.460
And I was like, OK.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.440
But it really works.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.949
Because all the
flavor in chicken

00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:52.990
is really in the protein.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.240
And there's flavor you
can pull out of the bones

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.670
if you're making
a chicken stock.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.045
But if you just drop a whole
chicken into simmering water

00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:03.819
with rice, the chicken
actually becomes very tender

00:12:03.819 --> 00:12:05.360
because it's cooking
in a rice broth.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.070
There's something about the
rice that helps break down

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.210
the protein gently.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.580
And it makes it really tender.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.755
And then you get all the
wonderful flavor of chicken

00:12:11.755 --> 00:12:13.130
that goes into
the rice porridge.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.590
So a long story
short-- you're not

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.730
making a chicken
stock for four hours

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.370
and then straining it and
then pouring it into here.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.320
Just take a chicken.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.290
Put some salt on it.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.010
Leave it overnight
in your refrigerator.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.160
If you're not making a lot, just
take a couple legs of chicken.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.754
If you're making a big pot
like this, you can do it.

00:12:29.754 --> 00:12:30.920
Put a whole chicken in here.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.290
And then just drop it in there.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.300
Cover it.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.620
Bring it up to a simmer.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.230
And then let it simmer
for about-- until it

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.010
starts to thicken.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.650
Stir it a lot.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.950
Don't let it stick
to the bottom.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.677
This is boiling now, so
I'm going to take it off.

00:12:46.677 --> 00:12:48.260
And then we'll just
put a lid on that.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.610
And then I'm going to act
like I'm toasting this.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.234
Chris, do you have
any questions for me

00:12:52.234 --> 00:12:54.150
at all while I'm
toasting this rice?

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.219
CHRIS YING: Huh.

00:12:56.219 --> 00:12:59.630
Uh-- no.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.630
DANNY BOWIEN: I have not
seen "The Martian" yet.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.570
So I don't know.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.210
Yes, I like Taylor
Swift's new album.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.216
I don't know what
else you-- so anyways.

00:13:09.216 --> 00:13:09.840
Toast the rice.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.580
This is rice that's toasted.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.090
We would have added
like 12 to 16--

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.336
I would start out with
like 12 parts water.

00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:18.710
And then what will happen is
if it starts to get thicker,

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.450
you add more water.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.010
Adjust it.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.551
You're just going to season at
the very end with a little bit

00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:26.150
of fish sauce and salt.
And the ratios for all that

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.959
are in the book.

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:28.500
That's why I'm not
going to tell you.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.442
So you all buy the
book afterwards.

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.650
CHRIS YING: It will look
kind of ridiculous at first.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.305
You'll be like, this
is way too much water.

00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:34.452
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:34.600
It'll look like--

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.016
CHRIS YING: There's no way
this is going to come together.

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:39.240
DANNY BOWIEN: But
it will thicken.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.159
It'll be where you
want it to be, ideally.

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:42.700
And if it's not,
you can just adjust.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.620
That's it.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.320
CHRIS YING: Do you
have a real portion?

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:46.590
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.006
And I guess I can just take a
real portion of the-- do you

00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:50.512
guys have the real bowl of--

00:13:50.512 --> 00:13:52.136
CHRIS YING: Can we
just get a bowl of--

00:13:54.444 --> 00:13:56.110
DANNY BOWIEN: So
really quickly, there's

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.526
a recipe for beef
cheeks in there.

00:13:57.526 --> 00:13:58.760
The beef cheeks are braised.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.970
So after we braise
them, we always

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.835
let-- if you braise
something, that

00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:05.054
means you're just cooking
it in a flavorful liquid.

00:14:05.054 --> 00:14:06.970
You always want to let
that cool in the liquid

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.803
that it's cooked in.

00:14:07.803 --> 00:14:10.560
You don't want to take it out
after you-- it's very tempting.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.640
You pull something
out of the oven.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.940
You're braising a
whole piece of meat.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.900
You're like, oh,
I think it's done.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.704
It's jiggly.

00:14:14.704 --> 00:14:15.370
You take it out.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.260
It just dries out.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.230
You want to let it cool in
the liquid it's cooked in.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.146
CHRIS YING: Thank you.

00:14:19.146 --> 00:14:22.570
DANNY BOWIEN: So it stays
really juicy and delicious.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.640
What happens next, after
it cools, is the stock

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.020
becomes this gel, because
of all the connective--

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.240
all of the collagen
in the beef cheeks.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.420
Save this stuff.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.084
This stuff is like liquid gold.

00:14:35.084 --> 00:14:36.750
We like to add this
back to the porridge

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.980
so you have a little
bit more beef flavor.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.490
I'm going to stop talking
about the rice porridge now.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.730
Let's talk about
the book, Chris.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:42.170
Because that's--

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.266
CHRIS YING: Yes.

00:14:42.266 --> 00:14:43.420
Let's talk about the book.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.336
I mean, an interesting
thing with beef cheeks,

00:14:45.336 --> 00:14:48.620
though, is the reason why Danny
and Mission Chinese started

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.630
using beef cheeks--

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.080
DANNY BOWIEN: They're cheap.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.110
CHRIS YING: Because
they're cheap.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.850
There's these inefficiencies,
sort of-- I mean, you guys all

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.317
know about the nose-to-tail
cooking and using

00:14:56.317 --> 00:14:57.900
the whole animal and
things like that.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.050
Those are realities of having
a restaurant, actually.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:01.812
Danny comes in.

00:15:01.812 --> 00:15:03.020
He looks at a list of prices.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.200
And he's like, oh.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.040
Beef cheeks are like $4 a pound.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.670
Let's do something
with beef cheeks.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.037
And that's really the spirit
of what Mission Chinese

00:15:11.037 --> 00:15:11.870
Food was originally.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.828
It was like, let's do
the best with what we can

00:15:13.828 --> 00:15:16.250
and find out cool
ways to use things.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.860
Since then, beef
cheeks are probably

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.030
quadrupled in price now.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.102
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:15:19.102 --> 00:15:20.018
It's really expensive.

00:15:20.018 --> 00:15:21.890
That's why we just
use raw beef now.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.870
Because that's
the-- you don't have

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.410
to pay someone to braise it.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.250
It just became a
matter of economics.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.170
But it's funny.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.810
Like lobsters-- they used
to just throw them away.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.330
Or they'd send
them to prisoners.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.788
I don't know if
you guys knew that.

00:15:35.788 --> 00:15:38.140
But lobster used to be this
thing that was frowned upon.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.350
And they would--
literally, I think,

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.620
you got lobster
to eat in prison.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.760
That was your food.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.020
Anyway, this is really boring.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.692
Let's talk about
the book some more.

00:15:49.692 --> 00:15:50.400
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.316
I mean, we were sort of
hinting at it earlier.

00:15:52.316 --> 00:15:56.730
This book is-- like Danny
said, we sold this book

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.570
to our publisher before
Mission Chinese had really

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.150
proven itself to be a
national restaurant that

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.740
deserved to have a cookbook.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.590
And so the publisher took
a crazy gamble on us.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.450
And the interesting
thing for me,

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.620
as the person writing this
book with Danny, was none of it

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.120
was reflective.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.740
We were writing
it as these things

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.280
were happening, as
crazy things were

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.530
happening, at Mission Chinese.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.130
I think there was one incident
where Danny and I were hanging

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.255
out talking about the book.

00:16:26.255 --> 00:16:27.950
And he was like,
I'm really proud,

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.910
and we should really talk
about in the book, that nobody

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.310
has ever quit or been
fired from this restaurant

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.305
because we're just
this happy family.

00:16:37.305 --> 00:16:38.430
And then the next morning--

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.420
DANNY BOWIEN: In
San Francisco only.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:39.822
CHRIS YING: In San Francisco.

00:16:39.822 --> 00:16:40.626
DANNY BOWIEN: Not
the one in New York.

00:16:40.626 --> 00:16:42.350
We've had like 190 employees.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.058
CHRIS YING: And then
the next morning, he

00:16:44.058 --> 00:16:46.015
was like-- we were
staying in a geodesic dome

00:16:46.015 --> 00:16:48.140
in the Russian River because
we were hunkering down

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:48.770
to work on this book.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.050
And then the next day, he got
a text that was like, Dan,

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.060
you've got to come
back to the restaurant.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.570
One of the cooks just punched
the other one in the face.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.560
We've got to deal
with this thing.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.420
DANNY BOWIEN: That's
just like-- that's that.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.670
CHRIS YING: That's just how
the book was put together.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.265
It was like every time we
thought we had our story down--

00:17:02.265 --> 00:17:05.210
DANNY BOWIEN: We got punched in
the face by an angry line cook.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.310
CHRIS YING: We got punched in
the face by an angry line cook.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.480
The recipes are true to what
happened at the restaurant.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.290
Like Liv was kind
of hinting, when

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.630
Danny was opening the
New York restaurant,

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.778
the computer crashed.

00:17:21.778 --> 00:17:23.319
And he called me
and was like, do you

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:24.619
have our recipes
backed up somewhere?

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:25.160
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:25.660
Oh, my god.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.640
It was crazy.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.540
It was insane.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.050
We lost everything.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.492
And he, actually--
because of Chris,

00:17:32.492 --> 00:17:33.950
there's still
Mission Chinese food.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.760
Because we didn't have
them written down.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.560
I didn't have them written down.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:36.780
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.400
DANNY BOWIEN: But we do now.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.990
And now we're very organized.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.080
It took a long
time to get there.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.580
But yeah.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.770
I mean, I don't know.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.410
We're super-proud of this thing.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.111
It's like nothing-- I
think it says in the book.

00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:50.610
It's not like we're at the top
of the mountain looking back,

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.240
and this is just a reflection
of what we've accomplished.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.062
It's literally us just trying to
get our shit together, like ah,

00:17:56.062 --> 00:17:57.020
everything's happening.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.420
And all this positive
stuff happens.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.730
All this really
negative stuff happens.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:05.510
And it's just all there.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.500
It's just like,
well, OK, let's--

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.732
I can't even-- we would get
in these yelling matches

00:18:10.732 --> 00:18:12.940
with each other, because
there was never enough time.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.606
How are we going to
get this thing done?

00:18:14.606 --> 00:18:17.441
How are we going to
get this book done?

00:18:17.441 --> 00:18:17.940
It's funny.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.150
Because when it was actually
finished, we were like, oh wow.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.180
This is really amazing.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.374
I thought we didn't have enough.

00:18:23.374 --> 00:18:24.790
You never think
you can do enough.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:25.840
You're like, oh, man.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.327
It needs more of this
and this and this.

00:18:29.327 --> 00:18:30.410
And it has a lot of stuff.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.960
It's a lot of content.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.200
LIV WU: I have a question.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.620
DANNY BOWIEN: Go.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:42.460
LIV WU: So division of labor--
you did the recording, Chris?

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.440
You did the talking?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.220
You said, one cup of rice.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:44.505
DANNY BOWIEN: I talk.

00:18:44.505 --> 00:18:46.420
I'm really good at
just talking at people.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.520
Like you can see,
I'm just rambling on

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.590
and going in circles.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.510
So I just would talk to Chris.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.746
And he would just
painstakingly listen to me.

00:18:53.746 --> 00:18:55.370
Sometimes I think
you were just playing

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.232
Xbox and just recording.

00:18:57.232 --> 00:18:58.690
Because, I mean,
I was in New York.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:59.452
And you were here.

00:18:59.452 --> 00:19:00.160
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.180
It's an odd process,
honestly, to be writing

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.810
a story like this one, or
to be recording recipes

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.554
of a restaurant
that's still evolving.

00:19:10.554 --> 00:19:12.970
And that's why Danny's saying
we kept on adding and adding

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.178
and adding and couldn't stop.

00:19:14.178 --> 00:19:17.960
It's because-- for example,
the recipe for Mapo tofu that's

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.120
in this book is probably
the 35th version

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.770
of that recipe that's been
served at the restaurant.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:28.227
And that's exciting to me
as a diner and as a writer,

00:19:28.227 --> 00:19:30.560
for somebody who wants to
keep on refining and improving

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.470
their product.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.900
It's like nerve-wracking
for a chef

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.879
to put out a version
that they're like,

00:19:35.879 --> 00:19:37.420
this is going to be
better next week.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.456
And everyone who's
going to have the book

00:19:38.456 --> 00:19:40.330
is going to have a
slightly shittier version.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.440
DANNY BOWIEN: No, but
it's good, though.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.090
It's funny.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.820
The way Mission
Chinese started is

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.610
we had no formal-- I've never
cooked in a Chinese restaurant.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.460
I'm not Chinese.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.930
I actually grew up in
Oklahoma until I was like 19.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.060
And then I moved
to San Francisco

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.900
and spent like 10 years here,
and then moved to New York.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.380
So yeah, I'm not a Chinese chef.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.830
It's pretty insane.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.260
So then because of that, trying
to learn all these recipes,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.890
we would come out the gates
swinging for the fences.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.940
It was like, how can we make
Mapo tofu 300 times better

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.940
than it actually is?

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.590
And how many
ingredients can we use?

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.275
And so the first
version of Mapo tofu

00:20:19.275 --> 00:20:21.840
had like 33 aromatic
ingredients in it.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.780
And then we got that
out of our systems.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.185
And then we realized,
well, it's kind

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:29.610
of like linguine and clams.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.450
You can't really do much to
improve linguine and clams,

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.514
in its truest form.

00:20:34.514 --> 00:20:35.680
You're not going to do much.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.810
It's just a perfect flavor.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.170
It's like a caprese salad.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.300
There's tomatoes.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.760
There's insanely good
buffalo mozzarella, and basil

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.920
and olive oil and sea salt.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.250
You can't-- you can do a lot
of things to dress that up.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.650
But we're acknowledging
the fact that yeah,

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.690
maybe sometimes you need
to pull back on the 33.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.530
So now there's
eight ingredients.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.580
And we're just making
regular Mapo tofu.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.380
But we're using a little bit of
aged beef fat and some really

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.885
amazing pork.

00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:04.910
We're just elevating the
ingredients that we use,

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.480
and then learning the
technique, and applying it.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.890
So it's really interesting.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.630
Again, there's no-- I think
the book really spells out

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.610
how to make Chinese food-- or
our version of Chinese food--

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.610
if you feel like it.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.510
And it also is
very entertaining.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.350
Because you can actually see
how it all has been evolving

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.280
and has evolved
into what it is now.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.930
LIV WU: So it's interesting to
me that your process was never,

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:28.870
let's go to China.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:29.870
Let's go to [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.036
CHRIS YING: Oh, we did that.

00:21:31.036 --> 00:21:32.650
DANNY BOWIEN: We did that.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.010
CHRIS YING: We did that three
months-- this is actually

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.560
the craziest story.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.530
LIV WU: Let's hear it.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.610
CHRIS YING: I somehow
talked Danny into,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.260
like, we should do this
cookbook, when the restaurant

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.932
was like a week old.

00:21:43.932 --> 00:21:45.890
I was like, you know what
would be really great

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.200
for this cookbook is
if we flew to China

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.340
and you did a pop-up in
China and saw how that went.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.100
DANNY BOWIEN: So I'd
been working inside

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.709
of Mission Chinese Food
for a little while.

00:21:56.709 --> 00:21:58.750
But Mission Chinese Food
was originally a pop-up.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.820
Mission Chinese Food
in San Francisco

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.420
is owned by a Chinese family.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.762
It's called Lung Shan.

00:22:07.762 --> 00:22:09.220
The restaurant is
called Lung Shan.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.920
There's no actual
Mission Chinese Food

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.776
that exists in San Francisco.

00:22:12.776 --> 00:22:14.150
It was actually
called Lung Shan.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.441
And we did a pop-up inside
called Mission Chinese Food.

00:22:16.441 --> 00:22:17.600
And it just never ended.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.460
So there's no-- I mean,
it's just Lung Shan.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.200
But what happens is, I'm sitting
there in this restaurant.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.400
I don't speak Chinese.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.440
I was working with
only Chinese cooks,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.850
showing them my
version of Chinese food

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.109
and how to make Chinese food.

00:22:31.109 --> 00:22:32.650
They're looking at
me like I'm crazy.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:33.850
And then we go to China.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.100
So I have this weird
chip on my shoulder.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.540
I'm like, well, if I'm
doing everything wrong,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.498
I'm going to see how
everyone's doing it right.

00:22:38.498 --> 00:22:41.170
So the first trip to
China-- we've taken two--

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.490
was kind of an ill-fated trip.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:47.300
And it was just me kind of being
a young, ignorant, immature

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.370
cook, and being like,
prove to me that this

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.720
is better than what I do.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.240
And then the second trip was
actually the most telling.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.500
Because at that
point, I'd kind of

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.350
realized that I was very
far from being the best

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.650
chef in the world, or
knowing anything about what

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.140
I know how to do now.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.290
And that was just
a good life lesson.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.904
It was like, don't be a
little punk, immature kid,

00:23:12.904 --> 00:23:14.320
and you can learn
a lot of things.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:14.820
So yeah.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.340
We've been to China twice.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.920
The first trip
was right before--

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.003
CHRIS YING: The first trip
was specifically funny.

00:23:20.003 --> 00:23:23.370
Because one of the
big newspaper articles

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.360
that made Mission Chinese San
Francisco a big deal was Mark

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.360
Bittman wrote an article
in "The New York Times"

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.230
about Mission
Chinese and it being

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.660
this cutting-edge restaurant.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.437
And when something like that
happens to your restaurant--

00:23:36.437 --> 00:23:38.520
when "The New York Times"
declares your restaurant

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.900
to be one of the most
important ones in the country--

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.770
you are besieged with business.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.070
I think that the
day that article

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.802
was scheduled to come out, Danny
was like, let's go to China.

00:23:48.802 --> 00:23:49.760
Let's just not be open.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.930
Let's just close the
restaurant and go.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:52.540
DANNY BOWIEN: Well,
we couldn't handle it.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.640
CHRIS YING: I don't want
to deal with any of it.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:53.766
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:55.250
So we're getting pretty busy.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.150
And we're orchestrating
this thing.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.040
Because Lung Shan was
still doing Lung Shan's

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.510
150-item Chinese takeout menu.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.860
And we were doing Mission
Chinese Food next to them.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.810
So their wok burner was here.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.560
And ours was here.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.870
And we were just
getting hammered.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.920
And I was like, there's
no way that we're

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.152
going to be able to handle
this onslaught of people

00:24:16.152 --> 00:24:17.110
that are going to come.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.370
So let's just close and
go to China for a week.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.460
And then we'll hopefully
bond with each other--

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.699
because we went
with the owners--

00:24:24.699 --> 00:24:26.740
and kind of get our shit
together so that when we

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.800
come back, we can all survive.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.910
It was a great trip.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.269
It was a good trip
in a lot of ways.

00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:35.310
I was very uncomfortable.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.030
I was probably whining
a lot about stuff.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:37.970
But it was great.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:41.120
Because we came back and then
it got really crazy busy.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.350
I mean, the first year
of Mission Chinese--

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.940
I remember Michael Bauer came
into the Mission Chinese Food.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.740
You guys should know
who Michael Bauer is.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.537
He's the San
Francisco food critic.

00:24:50.537 --> 00:24:52.120
And you know, there's
a song and dance

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.490
that you do in the
restaurants where

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:54.860
you act like you don't
know who the food critic is

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.160
when they come in.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.350
And then they act like
they're anonymous.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:05.000
But obviously, as a chef, you're
like, holy shit everybody.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.030
The food critic is here.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:07.738
Make sure the tables
around them are VIP.

00:25:07.738 --> 00:25:09.680
Make sure that table's VIP.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.190
Just let me taste everything
before it goes out.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:15.120
But at Mission Chinese
Food, we were just

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120
kind of screwing around.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.130
It was our thing.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:22.210
It was like our little
boys club, I guess.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.544
We were just playing around
trying to make Chinese food.

00:25:24.544 --> 00:25:25.459
I remember he came in.

00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:27.720
And I walked next door to
Commonwealth that had just

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.120
opened-- it hadn't opened yet.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.560
And I was talking to Jason Fox.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.500
I was like, hey, how's it going?

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:31.920
He was like, good.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.400
I was like, oh yeah.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.675
Michael Bauer's
next door right now.

00:25:33.675 --> 00:25:34.730
He's just having lunch.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.140
He's like, oh, that's because
you're getting a review.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.299
You should probably go
back over there right now.

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:39.090
I was like, oh, no.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.660
There's no-- why would--
there's no way in hell.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.480
And so I had no idea.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.920
I was like, there's no way.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.510
CHRIS YING: You thought that
Bauer was just stopping in.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.190
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, he
was having a casual lunch.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.590
CHRIS YING: The idea that
Mission Chinese would

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.574
be reviewed was so
preposterous that he just

00:25:50.574 --> 00:25:52.990
assumed that he was hanging
out having lunch or something.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.020
DANNY BOWIEN: I
thought the second time

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.450
he came in, I was going up
to him like, hey, Michael.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.559
What's going on?

00:25:57.559 --> 00:25:59.350
Because I'd seen him
at so many restaurants

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.225
I'd worked at before.

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:01.530
You know who that is.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:08.880
And then the article that
really-- the most proud I've

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.975
been is whenever
Michael Bauer named--

00:26:10.975 --> 00:26:12.516
that's when things
really popped off,

00:26:12.516 --> 00:26:16.650
is when Michael Bauer
named me as a rising star

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.325
chef in like 2011 or 2012.

00:26:19.325 --> 00:26:21.200
And that was when it
was just, like, oh, god.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.480
This is becoming serious.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.800
All while working in this
restaurant that's not mine,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.751
and with owners
that had no idea.

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:28.750
They were like, why do
you make things so spicy?

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.060
CHRIS YING: So the whole
Mission Chinese Food story

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.754
is success in
spite of ourselves.

00:26:38.754 --> 00:26:40.920
Closing down the day that
Bittman's article came out

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.140
is like a Christmas tree
lot closing for December.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.619
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:26:45.619 --> 00:26:46.660
CHRIS YING: It was crazy.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.159
But hey.

00:26:47.159 --> 00:26:49.070
We have to get to
another thing here.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.942
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, is it
time for that already?

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:52.317
CHRIS YING: So ostensibly we
made this porridge because--

00:26:52.317 --> 00:26:53.733
DANNY BOWIEN: We
like to just be--

00:26:53.733 --> 00:26:55.860
CHRIS YING: Here, plate
this thing while we finish.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.760
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh,
this is the porridge.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.620
CHRIS YING: Yeah,
this is the porridge.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.480
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, OK.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.521
CHRIS YING: So Thanksgiving
is around the corner.

00:27:00.521 --> 00:27:03.751
And every single year for
Thanksgiving at my house,

00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:06.000
once the turkey's sort of
picked clean and everything,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.520
we make stock out of the bones.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.820
We just simmer the hell out of
it forever and ever and ever,

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.410
and then make rice
porridge out of it.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.010
So ostensibly this
is a themed thing.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.170
And when we were getting
ready to come out here,

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.890
we were talking to Victoria and
talking to some of the Googlers

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.390
about what would
be a fun thing that

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.190
would help make
this talk go faster

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.660
and give Danny and I
less responsibility.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.870
And the idea was that we
would get one of you guys

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:36.950
to show us a dish that was sort
of Mission Chinese-inspired

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.350
for Thanksgiving.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.230
And so a few of you
guys sent in recipes.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.340
And I picked one
because it seemed

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:50.230
like the one that was
least likely to have ever

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.180
been executed before.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.600
I'm 100% convinced
that you've never made

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.143
this and it's total bullshit.

00:27:59.143 --> 00:28:02.007
So show us what
you're going to make.

00:28:02.007 --> 00:28:03.840
So Danny's just garnishing
this thing with--

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.890
DANNY BOWIEN: I'm just
garnishing this up.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.100
So egg-- yeah.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.210
It's nice.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.364
You don't have to leave it on
the [? rip, ?] on your stove.

00:28:12.364 --> 00:28:14.030
I think this is longer
than six minutes.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.980
But what happens is you get
an egg that's really nice.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.790
Inside the yolk isn't
all brown or grey.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.290
It's nice.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.137
It's just cooked through.

00:28:23.137 --> 00:28:24.970
Usually it's a little
bit runnier than this.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.390
But we talked a little too long.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.010
But yeah.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:27.820
It's like that.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.820
And it peels away really nicely.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.620
There's egg.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.240
There's some of
that beef liquid.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.551
There's some of the beef cheek.

00:28:32.551 --> 00:28:34.550
There's some cilantro and
ginger scallion sauce.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:39.766
And then we like to put a nice
big scoop of salmon roe on top.

00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:41.140
CHRIS YING:
Sometimes we do crab.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.560
But currently crab in
California is poisonous.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.220
So we didn't do that.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.889
DANNY BOWIEN: So I'm going
to pass this over to you.

00:28:47.889 --> 00:28:49.180
You can eat this if you'd like.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.930
CHRIS YING: But everyone
will get a taste.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.640
I think the kitchen team
is hard at work at that.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.150
LIV WU: Everybody
will get a taste.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.040
DANNY BOWIEN: This
makes a noise that

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.460
sounds like it's really bad for
you to stand in front of it.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.168
Just so you know.

00:28:59.168 --> 00:29:00.360
CHRIS YING: This is Jeff.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:00.770
JEFF DALTON: Hi.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.853
DANNY BOWIEN: Let's give
a hand to Jeff, everyone.

00:29:02.853 --> 00:29:04.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.660
LIV WU: So Jeff--

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.720
CHRIS YING: What are
you making for us?

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.011
JEFF DALTON: So you were right.

00:29:10.011 --> 00:29:11.906
I've never made
this dish before.

00:29:11.906 --> 00:29:12.300
He's completely right.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.110
I just kind of made it up.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.930
And actually my friend Alex
over there who's also here--

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.350
we kind of made it up together
at exactly the same time.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.683
We were just kind of looking
through the Mission Chinese

00:29:19.683 --> 00:29:20.650
stuff that we ate.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.410
And we were like, what
do we really love?

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.390
We really love the Mapo
tofu that they have.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.960
And at my house, it's not
Thanksgiving without stuffing.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.238
So how many of you are going to
have stuffing for Thanksgiving?

00:29:31.238 --> 00:29:32.696
DANNY BOWIEN: Come
on, that's not--

00:29:32.696 --> 00:29:34.570
JEFF DALTON: I think
more of you, hopefully.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:35.500
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.670
CHRIS YING: How many
people raised their hand?

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:37.720
Like three people.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.410
DANNY BOWIEN: It's
been these hands

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.970
that would go up this high.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.550
It's like when you're
in class and you kind of

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.870
don't know the answer.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:44.870
I don't know the answer.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:45.270
Don't call on me.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.440
CHRIS YING: What do you
have if not stuffing?

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.120
There's no other point
for Thanksgiving,

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:48.690
other than stuffing.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:49.820
DANNY BOWIEN: There's
a lot of other things.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.280
CHRIS YING: Stuffing
is the main attraction.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.500
JEFF DALTON: Stuffing
is the main thing.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.480
I grew up in the Midwest.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:53.720
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, cool.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:53.780
Me--

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.160
JEFF DALTON: I'm from Michigan.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.920
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, nice.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.995
JEFF DALTON: And so my mom
and grandma-- this is actually

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.370
a riff on my grandma's recipe.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.328
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, cool.

00:29:59.328 --> 00:30:02.730
JEFF DALTON: She took the Betty
Crocker, 1950, classic sage

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:06.260
and stuffing, Wonder Bread--
So we've got Wonder Bread,

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.050
like back in the 1950s.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.580
And this is a classic staple
that we have at my house

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.550
for every thanksgiving.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.603
CHRIS YING: Your
grandmother was Sichuanese.

00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:14.550
JEFF DALTON: Yeah.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.840
So we're tweaking it a
little bit now, right?

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.380
LIV WU: So Jeff,
would you explain

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.890
the process you went through?

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.920
You saw something
in "Go Hungry" that

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.394
said, submit your recipe to
the Mission Chinese guys.

00:30:26.394 --> 00:30:28.060
DANNY BOWIEN: You
were just like, I just

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.760
want to go make this thing.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.510
JEFF DALTON: Yeah.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.590
So I guess I just
saw the "Go Hungry."

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.270
I saw the link that
Danny was coming.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:38.330
And so I saw that there was
a recipe for Thanksgiving.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.550
And it just kind of
happened after that.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.817
It was like, obviously I
have to submit something.

00:30:42.817 --> 00:30:45.150
So I was on the G Bus on my
way into work, and just kind

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.710
of whipped together a
mash-up recipe of what I wish

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.070
I could make for Thanksgiving.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.486
And this is kind of it.

00:30:51.486 --> 00:30:52.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.546
JEFF DALTON: What?

00:30:53.546 --> 00:30:54.421
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:54.421 --> 00:30:55.570
JEFF DALTON: That's true.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:56.706
There's a bunch more
recipes, if you'd

00:30:56.706 --> 00:30:57.750
like to make another cookbook.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.916
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, we will.

00:30:58.916 --> 00:31:02.380
It's like, "Mission Chinese
Cooks Thanksgiving."

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.504
CHRIS YING: I would also
say that-- if anybody

00:31:05.504 --> 00:31:07.920
else submitted a recipe and
we didn't pick it or whatever,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.920
I saw all the recipes.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.378
And I was specifically
like, can we

00:31:10.378 --> 00:31:12.000
just do all of these
and Danny and I

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.083
don't have to do anything?

00:31:13.083 --> 00:31:14.170
But we were shot down.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:16.410
So I wanted to do all of them.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.160
But I was denied my laziness.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.170
LIV WU: Was it a
requirement-- I don't

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.660
remember-- that the recipes
were never cooked, never tested?

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.350
CHRIS YING: No.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.336
I would assume that most of
them had been done before.

00:31:27.336 --> 00:31:28.729
But I saw Mapo tofu stuffing.

00:31:28.729 --> 00:31:29.895
I was like, that's bullshit.

00:31:32.374 --> 00:31:34.540
DANNY BOWIEN: No, it makes--
it's going to be great.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.498
It's going to be great.

00:31:35.498 --> 00:31:37.550
JEFF DALTON: So this
is basically-- bread

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.840
and tofu are pretty much
roughly bland things

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.785
that are used as a base
for whatever you want.

00:31:42.785 --> 00:31:45.160
So this is basically just like
your Thanksgiving stuffing

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.060
recipe that you have here.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.925
You've got celery.

00:31:46.925 --> 00:31:48.980
You've got onions and garlic.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.642
We threw in some chili oil
in there to get things going.

00:31:52.642 --> 00:31:53.600
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, nice.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.433
You do realize you're
doing a better cooking

00:31:55.433 --> 00:31:57.815
demo than I did already.

00:31:57.815 --> 00:32:00.000
I just was like,
put things in a pot.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.890
Boil it.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.250
Not too long.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.135
Toast this rice.

00:32:04.135 --> 00:32:06.010
JEFF DALTON: [INAUDIBLE]
I'm just an amateur.

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:07.540
DANNY BOWIEN: Is there
anything I can do to help you?

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.680
CHRIS YING: Yeah,
put Danny to work.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.530
DANNY BOWIEN: I can actually--
I do know how to cook things.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:10.020
CHRIS YING: Put
Danny to work here.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.978
JEFF DALTON: Go for it.

00:32:10.978 --> 00:32:13.030
DANNY BOWIEN: Yes, sir.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:17.040
If you guys are Instagramming,
make sure you see this part.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.490
Danny Bowien actually does cook.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:19.524
He doesn't just stand--

00:32:19.524 --> 00:32:21.190
JEFF DALTON: This is
Sichuan peppercorn.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.790
So this is one of my favorite
things about Sichuan cuisine.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.581
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:26.260
So you know how to
check-- I've found

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:30.610
a very amazing way to search
for good Sichuan peppercorns.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.700
Because you know,
up until recently,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.890
Sichuan peppercorns
in the US were banned.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.072
The FDA didn't-- they
weren't approved.

00:32:37.072 --> 00:32:39.280
JEFF DALTON: They're not
actually peppercorns, right?

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.238
LIV WU: They thought it
was the same virus that

00:32:41.238 --> 00:32:42.460
caused citrus disease.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.190
So the citrus
industry absolutely

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:46.961
refused to let Sichuan
peppercorns in.

00:32:46.961 --> 00:32:47.960
There was no connection.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.570
DANNY BOWIEN: So a lot
of places-- the way

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.153
they would let it
come into the States

00:32:51.153 --> 00:32:53.440
years ago is they would
heat-treat or irradiate

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.579
the Sichuan peppercorns.

00:32:54.579 --> 00:32:56.120
Because for some
reason, they thought

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.245
that if they brought the
peppercorns to the States,

00:32:58.245 --> 00:32:59.453
something crazy would happen.

00:32:59.453 --> 00:33:01.830
Like we would have some crazy
outbreak of-- I don't know.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.204
But anyways, when
you do that, it

00:33:03.204 --> 00:33:05.982
takes a lot of the numbing
qualities away from them.

00:33:05.982 --> 00:33:07.690
So when you look for
Sichuan peppercorns,

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:11.940
you want to look-- it should
look like an ear canal.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.160
It's actually a berry
from the prickly ash tree.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.290
But they should be open.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:19.920
And it should look
really like an ear canal.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.847
That's a boring fact for you.

00:33:21.847 --> 00:33:22.430
LIV WU: Nerdy.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.570
Perfect.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:23.400
Great.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.840
DANNY BOWIEN: FYI.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.810
Anyways, I'm sorry.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.150
I'm stealing your spotlight.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.554
JEFF DALTON: No, no.

00:33:28.554 --> 00:33:29.970
You can mince the
garlic, as well.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.580
I'm not going to bother
mincing it and grating it.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.925
Otherwise, somebody's going
to get some lucky garlic bits

00:33:33.925 --> 00:33:34.260
in there.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.343
DANNY BOWIEN: That's good.

00:33:35.343 --> 00:33:36.850
JEFF DALTON: So
this is basically--

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.360
if you look in
Danny's recipe book,

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.920
he has a recipe for your Mission
Chinese Mapo tofu spice here.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.130
So this has got the
mushroom powder.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.685
This has got the
Sichuan peppercorns.

00:33:46.685 --> 00:33:47.935
It's got the ground-up chiles.

00:33:47.935 --> 00:33:48.910
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, nice.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.535
JEFF DALTON: So really, it's as
spicy as you want to make this.

00:33:51.535 --> 00:33:53.220
You can crank up
the heat or not.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.470
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, go for it.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.190
CHRIS YING: You're just
going to bam it up.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.850
Bam it up over there.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:56.420
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, bam.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.920
This is your moment, if
you've ever wanted to do that.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.356
CHRIS YING: How are you not
going to bam that right there?

00:34:00.356 --> 00:34:01.574
JEFF DALTON: Bam.

00:34:01.574 --> 00:34:02.270
I missed it.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:03.290
Next time.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.373
DANNY BOWIEN: Everyone's
supposed to-- that's when

00:34:05.373 --> 00:34:07.104
the whole crowd
stands up and like--

00:34:07.104 --> 00:34:09.520
CHRIS YING: Danny in the book
really accurately identified

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.020
that whenever Emeril was
kicking it up or putting

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.610
some extreme amount
of stuff into it,

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.670
it was always actually
a very tiny amount.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.889
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, it's
a ramekin this big.

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:19.389
Yeah.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:21.441
It's like these
things he has here.

00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:24.115
Just, bam!

00:34:24.115 --> 00:34:25.739
It's like when Oprah's
like, everyone's

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:27.429
getting a free trip
to the Caribbean,

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:28.610
or something like that.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.510
He's just like, garlic.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:31.830
Bam.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.721
Everyone's like, yes!

00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:35.137
JEFF DALTON: So
this is the bread.

00:34:35.137 --> 00:34:35.360
DANNY BOWIEN: It
used to be so easy.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.390
JEFF DALTON: This is the bread.

00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:40.192
LIV WU: I have to tell you,
that is not Wonder Bread.

00:34:40.192 --> 00:34:40.900
Did you specify--

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.310
JEFF DALTON: This is--

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.101
LIV WU: Did you-- you
brought Wonder Bread?

00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:44.489
Or did we prep it here?

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.989
JEFF DALTON: I
brought Wonder Bread.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:46.991
LIV WU: OK.

00:34:46.991 --> 00:34:48.510
We don't do Wonder Bread.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.260
JEFF DALTON: Yeah.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.801
I didn't think you'd have Wonder
Bread at the Google kitchen.

00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:53.450
So I had to bring it.

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:54.719
DANNY BOWIEN: Nice, nice.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.100
JEFF DALTON: So
this is basically

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.522
like the 36th
version of Mapo base.

00:34:58.522 --> 00:34:59.480
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, cool.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.830
I wonder how that tastes.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:01.830
I'm sure it's delicious.

00:35:04.252 --> 00:35:05.710
JEFF DALTON: So
this is basically--

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:06.240
DANNY BOWIEN: It looks right.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.050
JEFF DALTON: --Mapo tofu--

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:07.250
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, cool.

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.620
Nice.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:08.530
JEFF DALTON: --minus the tofu.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.360
DANNY BOWIEN: Did you make
all this at your house?

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:10.570
JEFF DALTON: Yeah, I did.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:11.790
I made this last night.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.965
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh my god.

00:35:11.965 --> 00:35:12.860
Man.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.590
JEFF DALTON: I figured
I should make it.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:13.690
CHRIS YING: Crazy.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:14.730
DANNY BOWIEN: You know, you
could have just called him

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.400
and we could have
brought it for you.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.250
And you could have
been like, this

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:25.170
is version 36 of-- so next time,
I can make it easier for you

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:25.990
if you want.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.740
JEFF DALTON: Yeah.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.321
So this has got a lot of the
pork stock, chicken stock--

00:35:29.321 --> 00:35:31.695
it's Thanksgiving, so maybe
you have some leftover turkey

00:35:31.695 --> 00:35:31.857
stock.

00:35:31.857 --> 00:35:33.107
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, of course.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.400
LIV WU: So you call it
stuffing, not dressing.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.630
Because that is a bone of
contention in American culture.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.681
It's stuffing in your
neck of the woods.

00:35:45.681 --> 00:35:47.680
JEFF DALTON: So my mom
always calls it stuffing.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.804
It will always be stuffing.

00:35:48.804 --> 00:35:50.940
LIV WU: It actually
goes in the bird.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.160
JEFF DALTON: It used to.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.000
It doesn't anymore
now that I'm cooking.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.500
LIV WU: OK.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.440
JEFF DALTON: But we
still call it stuffing

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.030
even though it's not stuffing.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.400
LIV WU: OK.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:56.900
Yeah.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.160
It's actually safer.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:58.450
CHRIS YING: Yeah, but--

00:35:58.450 --> 00:35:59.866
JEFF DALTON:
Stuffing is kind of--

00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:01.580
CHRIS YING: Nobody
calls it dressing.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.966
Who calls it dressing?

00:36:02.966 --> 00:36:04.507
That makes no sense
to me whatsoever.

00:36:04.507 --> 00:36:05.850
LIV WU: In the
South, in the South.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.130
DANNY BOWIEN: It's
like calling soda pop.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.190
Who calls it pop, man?

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.270
CHRIS YING: Yeah, man.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.860
I mean, technically,
somebody does.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.990
DANNY BOWIEN: People do.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:12.025
I think it's somewhere.

00:36:12.025 --> 00:36:12.733
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:36:12.733 --> 00:36:13.809
But not in my household.

00:36:13.809 --> 00:36:15.600
DANNY BOWIEN: They call
it pop in Oklahoma.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.130
CHRIS YING: That's true.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.691
DANNY BOWIEN: And they call
it dressing in Oklahoma, too.

00:36:18.691 --> 00:36:19.440
CHRIS YING: [SIGH]

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:19.880
DANNY BOWIEN: Sorry, Chris.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.560
CHRIS YING: We're
in California now.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.060
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, I know.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:23.710
So, cool.

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:25.270
JEFF DALTON: So this
is basically it.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.992
You could have
sauteed some sausage,

00:36:26.992 --> 00:36:28.325
and put everything else in here.

00:36:28.325 --> 00:36:30.300
Or you could have just
gone to Danny's restaurant

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:30.870
and gotten some takeout.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:31.030
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.280
You can just come ask us to
help make your life easier

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.286
and buy some of just the base.

00:36:36.286 --> 00:36:37.660
But I would have
to explain that.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.750
You'll have to translate
for me and tell [? Su and ?]

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.125
[? Yung ?] that people are
going to be coming to buy just

00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:43.192
the Mapo sauce cold.

00:36:43.192 --> 00:36:44.650
CHRIS YING: The
Google Bus is going

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.233
to pull up outside Lung Shan and
people are going to come up--

00:36:47.233 --> 00:36:50.620
DANNY BOWIEN: 86
pints of Mapo base.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.770
JEFF DALTON: And then
it's basically just,

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.930
combine it together, right?

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.220
DANNY BOWIEN: And since the
bread is nice and dried,

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.350
it's going to soak up all
the moisture from this.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.440
And then you would
need to add more stock

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.594
if it's not wet
enough, or-- do you

00:37:05.594 --> 00:37:07.510
like to have your dressing
be more wet or dry?

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.420
JEFF DALTON: That's the
big question, right?

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.090
So how do you like
your dressing?

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.090
Do you like it crunchy?

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:11.800
Do you like it dry?

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.110
Soggy?

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.330
Some people like it
almost like bread pudding.

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:14.090
JEFF DALTON: Yeah.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.340
JEFF DALTON: I like mine
on the crispier side.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.150
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, me, too.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.360
JEFF DALTON: I don't like
it if it gets too soggy.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.960
It's like eating bread pudding.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.252
And the bread never comes back.

00:37:21.252 --> 00:37:22.710
CHRIS YING: Let me
ask you, though.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.430
If you're not a Chinese person--

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:26.650
JEFF DALTON: Yeah.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:27.880
DANNY BOWIEN: Theoretically.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.610
CHRIS YING: And you're
like, oh, family dinner.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:30.568
Everyone's coming over.

00:37:30.568 --> 00:37:32.040
All my white
family's coming over.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.229
And I'm trying to pull out
the Mapo tofu stuffing.

00:37:35.229 --> 00:37:37.270
Are you going to just have
a full-scale rebellion

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:38.679
on your hands?

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:40.220
Like, what are you
trying to do here?

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.190
DANNY BOWIEN: I think
if you didn't tell them

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.818
that it's Mapo
tofu stuffing, they

00:37:41.818 --> 00:37:44.100
would just be like, this is
a really delicious stuffing.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.745
CHRIS YING: But people don't
like their Thanksgivings--

00:37:45.745 --> 00:37:46.060
DANNY BOWIEN: --spicy.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:46.520
CHRIS YING: --messed
around with.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.560
They want Stove Top.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.742
DANNY BOWIEN: There's no
spice in Thanksgiving.

00:37:49.742 --> 00:37:50.450
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:53.750
DANNY BOWIEN: It is just a
bunch of butter and sage.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.140
It's funny.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.355
Whoever grows sage--
when do you buy sage,

00:37:58.355 --> 00:37:59.415
except for Thanksgiving?

00:37:59.415 --> 00:38:00.790
I always see people
freaking out.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:02.164
They're like, do
you have savory?

00:38:02.164 --> 00:38:04.090
Or do you have marjoram?

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.560
That's the one holiday
that the herb growers--

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.310
CHRIS YING: Right.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.480
If you're a sage
farmer, it's tough times

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.040
until November-- or
a cranberry farmer.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.130
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:18.421
I think Thanksgiving should
always be a little spicier,

00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:19.070
personally.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.340
JEFF DALTON: So
how do you like it?

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.310
DANNY BOWIEN: So
my mom used to make

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:22.790
stuffing very similar to this.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:26.260
She would save--
we'd make cornbread.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.175
She would save the
leftover cornbread.

00:38:28.175 --> 00:38:29.920
And she would dry that out.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.370
And she would take Wonder
Bread or white bread

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:35.660
and dry that out until
it was like that.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:39.010
And then she would add a
bunch of dried sage and thyme

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.540
and butter.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.840
And then she would also take
a box of Stove Top stuffing,

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.000
and then canned chicken stock.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.070
I mean, I grew up in Oklahoma.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:52.640
But she would cook
it like a cake.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.880
And it was very-- you could pick
it up and eat it like pizza.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.732
It was really cool.

00:38:56.732 --> 00:38:57.440
There was celery.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.106
It was basically what
you're making now.

00:38:59.106 --> 00:39:02.187
I don't understand how
it's the same thing.

00:39:02.187 --> 00:39:03.520
Hers didn't have any meat in it.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.670
It just had chicken stock.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:08.186
But I like it where you can
just pick it up and eat it

00:39:08.186 --> 00:39:09.390
with your hands.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.140
JEFF DALTON: Yeah.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.100
DANNY BOWIEN: I don't think
anyone here has probably ever

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.350
had it that way.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.440
It's very wrong, but very right.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.500
I liked it.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.724
So do you do egg in there?

00:39:18.724 --> 00:39:20.140
JEFF DALTON: I do
do egg in there.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.800
Yes.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.710
So eggs are optional.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.630
Sometimes I don't
like it too eggy.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.802
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:39:26.802 --> 00:39:27.760
JEFF DALTON: Let's see.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.051
DANNY BOWIEN: You can just
crack them into here, maybe.

00:39:30.051 --> 00:39:32.330
And then we can stir
this together and then

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.206
stir it back in.

00:39:37.925 --> 00:39:39.716
CHRIS YING: Stuffing's
one of those things.

00:39:39.716 --> 00:39:43.185
I didn't-- I don't know what
it's supposed to look like.

00:39:43.185 --> 00:39:44.754
Like, I don't know
what pot roast is.

00:39:44.754 --> 00:39:45.920
I never had that growing up.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.950
So I don't know what that's
supposed to look like.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:47.930
DANNY BOWIEN: It's
like stew, right?

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.263
CHRIS YING: I've never seen one.

00:39:49.263 --> 00:39:51.354
So it's like, if I try
to make one, I'm like--

00:39:51.354 --> 00:39:52.853
DANNY BOWIEN: Where
did you grow up?

00:39:52.853 --> 00:39:53.501
In California?

00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:55.000
CHRIS YING: I grew
up in California.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
DANNY BOWIEN: All right.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.370
Does everyone else in here
know what pot roast is?

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.870
Oh.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:59.240
It's stew.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.740
CHRIS YING: There's
Asian people who

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.990
don't know what pot roast is.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:03.915
We have no idea
what pot roast is.

00:40:03.915 --> 00:40:07.240
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, but
there's-- yeah, you're right.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:07.740
So anyways.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:08.710
The egg goes in.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.890
Mix it all up.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:10.556
JEFF DALTON: Mix it
with a little broth,

00:40:10.556 --> 00:40:12.820
so you don't get little
bits of egg, maybe.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.500
DANNY BOWIEN: Are you-- do
you own a restaurant somewhere

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.595
or something like this?

00:40:15.595 --> 00:40:15.898
CHRIS YING: Dude.

00:40:15.898 --> 00:40:16.856
You're killing it, man.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.260
DANNY BOWIEN: And
then you just want

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.511
to bake it until it just sets.

00:40:22.511 --> 00:40:24.010
JEFF DALTON: Bake
it until it's set,

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.250
until the top gets a little
nice and golden brown.

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.640
Make sure it's crispy.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.085
And I think that's about it.

00:40:29.085 --> 00:40:30.043
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, cool.

00:40:30.043 --> 00:40:33.040
JEFF DALTON: So I think it's
maybe about 45 minutes at 350

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.582
degrees.

00:40:34.582 --> 00:40:36.040
CHRIS YING: Let's
actually stick it

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.490
in the oven so it's
done by the time we're

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:38.670
done signing books and stuff.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.200
JEFF DALTON: Sounds good to me.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.590
LIV WU: So while we wait for
that, are there questions?

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:42.580
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.330
Who has questions?

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.270
LIV WU: Questions
from out there?

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:45.520
DANNY BOWIEN: Hey thanks, man.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.630
Let's give a nice--

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.588
JEFF DALTON: Thank you.

00:40:47.588 --> 00:40:49.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:55.770
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:56.630
DANNY BOWIEN: We
can take heat, too.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.240
So ask us.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.640
You can ask us very
uncomfortable questions.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.170
Please don't ask the
following questions.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:04.939
What's your favorite restaurant?

00:41:04.939 --> 00:41:06.730
So hopefully you weren't
going to ask that.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:07.080
AUDIENCE: No.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.277
DANNY BOWIEN: Please don't
ask New York versus San

00:41:08.277 --> 00:41:10.490
Francisco, because I'm
not going to answer that.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:12.726
And also, please don't
ask the last thing

00:41:12.726 --> 00:41:14.310
I would eat before I die.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:16.647
Because hopefully I
don't die anytime soon.

00:41:16.647 --> 00:41:18.480
Those are the only--
other than that, if you

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.096
want to ask anything else.

00:41:20.096 --> 00:41:20.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.511
So I had a chance to
eat at your restaurant

00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:23.970
in New York in the last month.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:24.580
It was great.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.371
DANNY BOWIEN: Cool.

00:41:25.371 --> 00:41:27.230
AUDIENCE: So I
had two questions.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:31.350
Can you tell us the story behind
how pizza made it to the menu?

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:33.140
And then, did you
ever find it ironic

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.227
that beggar's duck costs $100?

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:38.310
DANNY BOWIEN: Well, to
answer your first question,

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.070
pizza got on the menu when
we moved into the restaurant

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:40.569
in New York.

00:41:40.569 --> 00:41:45.890
The space is like--
everyone here

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.720
has been to Nopa before, right?

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.680
It's bigger than that.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.180
So the restaurant before
was like 40 seats.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.630
And it was in a
1,000 square foot

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.819
space in the Lower East Side.

00:41:55.819 --> 00:41:57.610
And then now it's like--
I don't even know.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.930
It's very, very big.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.810
It's like 140-plus seats.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.550
Plus we have a
private dining room.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.240
So when we moved in-- this
had been a restaurant before.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.780
And there was a
brick oven there.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.720
And for me, we always--
when we reopened

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.690
Mission Chinese in
New York, I had a lot

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:15.370
to prove to myself personally.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.880
But also I was so
tired of living

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.150
by the guidelines of just
being in fear of failure.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.672
Because I'd clearly already
just failed the worst way

00:42:24.672 --> 00:42:26.520
you could possibly
fail as a chef.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.729
So when I opened up
again, I was like,

00:42:28.729 --> 00:42:30.020
I'm just doing this for me now.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.470
I'm not doing it
for the critics.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.770
I don't give a shit
what anyone else thinks.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.730
If I know that it's good, and
it's something that I really

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:36.450
love and like-- and that's
what food and cooking is all

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.300
about anyways-- then
I want to make it.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.030
And then hopefully
that happiness

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.800
that I'm projecting
into this dish

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.200
will translate to people
that are eating it.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.750
And also, because
not everyone wants

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.349
to eat Sichuan
food all the time.

00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:52.390
So a lot of kids would
come in, and their friends

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.300
would come in, to
the old restaurant.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.090
Say David Chang comes in.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.940
And he's eaten at the
restaurant before.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.510
What can we give him that he's
definitely not going to expect?

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.250
We do this to
friends all the time.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.180
So we used to just
order a bunch of pizza

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.100
at the original
Mission Chinese Food.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.200
And if you came in, at
the end of your meal,

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.090
instead of sending
you dessert, we'd

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.000
just drop a whole
pepperoni pizza on you.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.020
And it's kind of like a
smartass way for chefs

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.420
to torture each other.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:20.560
But also it was like, well, if
you come in with your family

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.450
and your six-year-old
is there, they

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:24.664
can't eat ripping
hot chicken wings.

00:43:24.664 --> 00:43:26.080
We should be able
to make a pizza.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.070
So then as a chef, we
just obsessed on that.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.260
And I was like, I really
love Naples-style pizza.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:35.350
I really admire what
Anthony does at Una Pizza

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:38.040
Napoletana in San Francisco.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.180
So I called Chad Robertson
up from Tartine Bakery.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.254
And I was like, hey, I
want to make the sickest,

00:43:45.254 --> 00:43:47.670
authentic-- this is the only
authentic thing I want to do.

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:50.640
I want to make a real,
true, Naples-style pizza.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.190
But I want to use the Tartine
Bakery sourdough starter.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.237
Can you make that happen?

00:43:54.237 --> 00:43:55.070
Chad's very excited.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:55.920
He comes out.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.877
He flies up from San
Francisco to New York.

00:43:57.877 --> 00:43:58.960
And he's like, here's how.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.469
Let's do it.

00:43:59.469 --> 00:44:00.260
Here's our starter.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.420
So we put together
this dough recipe.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.510
All the ingredients that go on
that pizza are certified DOP.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:08.700
So it's San Marzano
tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.060
from [? Concerta ?].

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:14.090
Everything is basically from
Naples that goes on that pizza.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:15.647
But in true Mission
Chinese fashion,

00:44:15.647 --> 00:44:17.730
if you want to just throw
all that out the window,

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.730
we'll throw a pepperoni
on it for you for $0.99.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.280
So that's how that
dish came about.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.380
And it's still my favorite
thing on the menu.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.710
I eat it like once a week.

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:26.460
CHRIS YING: But when Dave came
in, the first thing he did--

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.020
DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, and
then David Chang comes in,

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.320
and just is like, oh.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.944
So DOP is like-- I don't know if
you guys know what that means.

00:44:31.944 --> 00:44:34.410
But it's kind of like
this stamp of approval

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:38.020
that's given to certain
foodstuffs in Italy.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:41.834
So it's basically
a mark of quality.

00:44:41.834 --> 00:44:43.250
So like in the
US-- it's like when

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:47.760
people call champagne champagne,
it has to come from Champagne.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.680
It has to be a certain-- there's
all these specifications it

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.510
has to meet.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:55.090
They do the same thing in Italy
with prosciutto, mozzarella--

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:56.420
CHRIS YING: Parmesan.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.070
DANNY BOWIEN:
Parmesan, especially.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:03.170
So it's all protected by
this stamp of approval.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.320
So a lot of restaurants,
if you go to a restaurant,

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.904
it's like DOP this or DOP that.

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:08.570
You know it's just
the best of the best.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:09.560
David Chang comes in.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.750
And the first thing
he does is just

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:11.916
dump Mapo tofu on his pizza.

00:45:11.916 --> 00:45:14.640
He's like, this is
going to be amazing.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.370
He puts that on Instagram.

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:17.640
CHRIS YING: One of the
ugliest Instagram photos.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.100
DANNY BOWIEN: I can't
tell you how many people

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.320
came in asking for that.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.350
And they would
order the Mapo tofu.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.310
Can I get that when
the pizza comes out?

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:27.690
And they pour it on top.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.890
And then your second question,
which I forgot already--

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.286
what was your second question?

00:45:32.286 --> 00:45:34.516
AUDIENCE: It was, did
you find it ironic

00:45:34.516 --> 00:45:36.680
that beggar's duck costs $100?

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.970
DANNY BOWIEN: So I think
that's a good question.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.150
Because I don't find it ironic
that beggar's duck costs $100.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.364
Because I think if
you go to R&amp;G Lounge--

00:45:44.364 --> 00:45:45.780
the first time I
ever-- I've never

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.050
actually had beggar's
chicken before.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.100
That dish is in
the book, actually.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.070
And that's a riff on
beggar's chicken, which

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:55.980
is a whole chicken that's
stuffed inside of a lotus leaf

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.530
and clay and then baked.

00:45:57.530 --> 00:46:01.790
And the idea behind that
is it was a peasant dish.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:05.790
The fable was that there was
a beggar out in the streets.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:08.140
And the emperor
walked by and smelled

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.669
this beautiful, wonderful smell.

00:46:09.669 --> 00:46:11.710
And this beggar had just
gotten this chicken that

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.725
was thrown to them, and
wrapped it in lotus and clay,

00:46:13.725 --> 00:46:15.520
and threw it into a
fire and roasted it.

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.040
And then I guess--

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.780
CHRIS YING: Well,
so it's not ironic.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.467
Because first of all--

00:46:20.467 --> 00:46:22.800
DANNY BOWIEN: So then he was
like, this is so delicious.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.650
And it became part
of the staple--

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.081
am I fucking this story up?

00:46:27.081 --> 00:46:28.080
Is this the right story?

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.350
CHRIS YING: A little bit.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:28.550
DANNY BOWIEN: All right.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:29.580
Anyways, somebody
Wikipedia that.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.420
Or Google it.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.230
CHRIS YING: First of all,
the whole apocryphal story

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.757
is the beggar had a duck but he
didn't have a way to cook it.

00:46:40.757 --> 00:46:43.090
So he covered it in mud and
clay and cooked it that way.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.548
It was the only
way he could do it.

00:46:44.548 --> 00:46:46.391
And he didn't want
the juices and smells

00:46:46.391 --> 00:46:48.390
and everything escaping
so people would take it.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:52.120
So the whole idea is that
this is a very valuable thing.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.580
And you want to
cook it as carefully

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.700
and protect it as
much as you can.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.850
And then, it's not
ironic that it's

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.910
$100 because I
tested that recipe.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:02.940
It is a fucking pain in
the ass to make that.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:06.500
DANNY BOWIEN: Beyond all that,
if you go-- at your house,

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.060
if you go to buy a
really nice duck, that's

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.910
going to set you back, I
would say, $30 minimally.

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.700
If you buy enough duck fat
to confit a whole duck in,

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.530
that's going to set you back--

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:17.769
CHRIS YING: $60 more.

00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:19.560
DANNY BOWIEN: So it's
actually cheaper just

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.350
to come to the restaurant.

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:22.391
That dish actually is
cheaper just to come eat it

00:47:22.391 --> 00:47:23.394
at the restaurant.

00:47:23.394 --> 00:47:25.560
CHRIS YING: If that beggar
could make a business out

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.520
of selling his duck--

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:26.910
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:28.535
It should just be
called Beggar's Duck.

00:47:28.535 --> 00:47:30.508
That's the next restaurant
we're going to open.

00:47:30.508 --> 00:47:31.258
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:47:31.258 --> 00:47:31.758
Thank you.

00:47:31.758 --> 00:47:33.280
DANNY BOWIEN: Anyways.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.770
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:37.040
How did you two meet?

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.822
DANNY BOWIEN: Well
so we met-- I always

00:47:39.822 --> 00:47:41.696
say the most inappropriate
things when people

00:47:41.696 --> 00:47:44.530
will say how did you meet.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:49.260
But the true story is that we
met at Mission Street Food.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:53.080
And we met through Anthony
Myint, my other half

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.320
of Mission Chinese.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.530
And Chris-- I thought
Chris was a line cook.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.540
Because at Mission
Street Food, it

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.190
would be these guest chefs
that would come in every week.

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.874
And I was just helping out.

00:48:02.874 --> 00:48:04.540
So you would just
meet different people.

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.080
And I would see, Chris would
just always kind of be there.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.776
So I thought he was a chef
or a cook for so long.

00:48:09.776 --> 00:48:11.150
Because he knew
how to line cook.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:12.566
And we would help
other chefs out.

00:48:12.566 --> 00:48:16.116
But that was like-- how long
did I think you were a cook?

00:48:16.116 --> 00:48:17.490
Until you were
like, oh, actually

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:18.810
I work for "McSweeney's"
at the time.

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:19.580
And I'm a writer.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.060
CHRIS YING: Yeah.

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.250
Probably for like six
months we were cooking next

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:21.834
to each other.

00:48:21.834 --> 00:48:23.999
And then maybe when I was
like, we should do a book,

00:48:23.999 --> 00:48:26.150
he was like, what do you
mean we should do a book?

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:27.510
I thought you-- are you
a writer or something?

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:28.830
I was like, oh, I
just come here--

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:31.371
DANNY BOWIEN: He just comes here
every Thursday to help cook.

00:48:31.371 --> 00:48:34.810
And then all the other days
of the week he had a real job.

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:35.790
So that's how we met.

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.840
AUDIENCE: I want to preface
this question by saying I really

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.910
like cooking with MSG.

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:49.335
My question is, one, is
there MSG on the tortillas

00:48:49.335 --> 00:48:50.772
at Mission Cantina?

00:48:50.772 --> 00:48:51.480
DANNY BOWIEN: No.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.520
AUDIENCE: And two,
what role do you think

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.586
MSG should play in the kitchen?

00:48:55.586 --> 00:48:57.710
DANNY BOWIEN: I think it
should play-- so you know,

00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:59.960
Anthony Bourdain asked me
this question the other day.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.940
I am not really
one to ever say--

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.330
I don't like living
by absolutes.

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:08.740
So if you want to
use MSG, use MSG.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.190
If people-- if you like that--
I understand economically,

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.990
for some restaurants and
restaurateurs and restaurant

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.980
owners, if you have a
restaurant that's selling a rice

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:21.194
plate for like $5, and it's
a whole duck leg on rice,

00:49:21.194 --> 00:49:22.860
and there's some MSG
on there to make it

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.830
taste a little better or
whatever, that's on you.

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.840
I don't think there's a right or
wrong way, unless it's harmful.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.720
Which it has not been
proven harmful to your body.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.584
We don't use MSG
in the restaurants.

00:49:36.584 --> 00:49:38.875
No, there's no MSG on the
chips on the chips at Mission

00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:39.540
Cantina.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.916
Although now that you say
that, there probably should be.

00:49:41.916 --> 00:49:43.831
We can get away with it
there because it's not

00:49:43.831 --> 00:49:45.060
a Chinese restaurant.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.768
CHRIS YING: It's like
a shortcut, though.

00:49:46.768 --> 00:49:48.768
It's like a different way
of getting to a thing.

00:49:48.768 --> 00:49:49.559
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah.

00:49:49.559 --> 00:49:51.670
It basically shortens
the path of-- you know,

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.500
when you take something like
a beef cheek, for instance,

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.700
and you sear it and
you braise it really

00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.960
slowly in stock, what happens
is you're basically pulling out

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.940
lots of umami.

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.320
When you sear
something-- there's

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.110
a lot of technical terms
to explain why things taste

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:09.360
better when you sear them.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.520
There's like a Maillard reaction
where protein actually converts

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.470
to flavor when you sear it.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:17.730
But long story short is
MSG is just a shortcut

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:22.290
to get that very unctuous
umami flavor that you

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:25.790
get when you cook a bolognese
sauce for like six hours.

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:27.825
You can just saute
some meat in a pan,

00:50:27.825 --> 00:50:29.200
put some tomatoes
there, and MSG,

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.620
and it will taste pretty good.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:35.300
So I think that MSG plays
a role in lots of things.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.840
You know, it's funny.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.710
I've always thought Chinese
food gets this bad rap

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:41.620
for using MSG.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:45.415
If you go to Japan,
which is also

00:50:45.415 --> 00:50:47.040
one of my favorite
places in the world,

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.831
there's MSG in some of
their sports drinks.

00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:52.300
There's MSG in like
everything in Japan.

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.290
But no one ever says
anything about that.

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:56.620
And I don't understand why.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.120
Because it's not
really a bad thing.

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.274
All the pickles that you
get at Japanese restaurants,

00:51:01.274 --> 00:51:02.440
usually there's MSG in them.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.660
There's NutraSweet in a lot
of pickles in Korea and Japan.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.270
Because when you add
that as a sweetener,

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:12.060
it actually gives it a
different crunch and your palate

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.680
registers it different
than just sugar or salt.

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.400
So I mean, again, it's
not like I'm saying

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.510
go home and cook with MSG.

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.180
But if you buy the book
and you're like, hey,

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.680
I want to do this
and this and this,

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.013
am I going to get mad at you
if you put MSG in the food?

00:51:25.013 --> 00:51:25.765
I don't care.

00:51:25.765 --> 00:51:26.390
It's your food.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:30.060
It's not evil.

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.830
I guess that's the--

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:32.500
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.640
Oh.

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.370
Hello.

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:38.310
Can you talk about the process,
or the thought process,

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:40.310
that you go through when
you create a new dish?

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:42.320
Is it like, oh, I
have this flavor.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.450
What can I do with it?

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:44.200
Or is it like, oh.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.070
Do you take something.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:46.778
You're like, what can
I do to improve it?

00:51:46.778 --> 00:51:49.432
Can you walk us through
how the process starts

00:51:49.432 --> 00:51:51.140
and how you take it
from start to finish?

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:51.931
DANNY BOWIEN: Sure.

00:51:51.931 --> 00:51:54.910
So luckily enough now,
we're five years in.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:57.470
So we're actually
surrounded by lots of really

00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:59.950
great young cooks and chefs.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:03.124
And usually the
thought-- the idea

00:52:03.124 --> 00:52:04.790
in the beginning of
Mission Chinese Food

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:06.956
is like, I just want to
figure out how to make this.

00:52:06.956 --> 00:52:11.210
So I would just go eat at
Spices II in San Francisco.

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:13.520
And I would eat there and
have all these crazy dishes,

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.300
like pig ears tureen in like
tingling oil and Mapo tofu.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.800
And that would serve
as inspiration.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.052
Then sometimes, in
the very beginning,

00:52:20.052 --> 00:52:21.260
that was the thought process.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.699
I'd be like, how
do I decode this?

00:52:22.699 --> 00:52:24.490
Because no one's going
to give me a recipe.

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:26.720
It's not like--
five years ago, you

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:32.600
couldn't really look up a recipe
for tingling pig intestine.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.950
You can't really find that.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:36.890
So then I think now,
where we're at now

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:39.680
is like we'll get an item.

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.310
It could be like we'll have
a good meal at a restaurant

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:45.510
and get inspired by just how
someone's plating something.

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:48.840
Or you'll get a dish
like koji, for instance.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.490
We use koji, which is a
culture that's made with rice.

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:55.860
And it's been used
in Japan forever.

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:59.370
But we will cure things in that.

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:00.440
That's a good example.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.120
So the koji fried
chicken in the book-- we

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.440
had this koji culture.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.500
And we were like,
how can we use this?

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.500
And how do we make this?

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.710
And what is this
thing all about?

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:13.530
And that kind of informed--
it was like, well,

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.320
I've always wanted to make the
best [? Hunanese ?] chicken.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.372
That's my favorite dish.

00:53:17.372 --> 00:53:19.580
But I don't think that a
lot of people get that dish.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.580
Because [? Hunanese ?]
chicken is chicken that's

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.710
just been poached perfectly.

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:25.310
And then it's
usually served cold

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:27.540
with the liquid that
it was cooked in

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.700
and some rice and
ginger scallion sauce.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:32.824
So that process was like,
let's try to use koji.

00:53:32.824 --> 00:53:34.948
Let's try to make fried
chicken without dredging it

00:53:34.948 --> 00:53:39.807
in anything, with super crispy
skin, that's gluten free.

00:53:39.807 --> 00:53:41.390
So you're not putting
any flour on it.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:42.610
And let's make it taste
like [? Hunanese ?] chicken

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:44.650
because that's my favorite
thing in the world.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:47.450
So it's kind of
like a super-ADHD--

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:49.840
like, this is a good idea.

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.780
And then this is
also a good idea.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.150
And hopefully this all works.

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:59.000
But we've been chasing
after trying to recreate

00:53:59.000 --> 00:53:59.940
a lot of other things.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.670
The worst thing you can do
when you're thinking of recipes

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:04.820
or having a through
process is trying

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.790
to match something
you've done before.

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:08.410
I think that for
the longest time,

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:10.300
I was like, how do we make
another thrice-cooked bacon?

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.091
How do we make another
salt cod fried rice?

00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:14.750
How do we make another
sick version of Mapo tofu?

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:18.330
And after a while, it was
just like, how can we just

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:22.900
stay with this and kind of just
push ourselves further ahead?

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:25.290
So I think the thought
process now isn't so much just

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:28.790
trying to decode classic
Chinese dishes as it is just

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:32.740
trying to create our own
vocabulary, our own kind

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.060
of food.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:38.005
Which is like-- yeah, beggar's
duck and koji fried chicken

00:54:38.005 --> 00:54:38.660
and stuff.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.124
So that's it.

00:54:40.124 --> 00:54:41.790
LIV WU: We'll have a
last question here.

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:42.776
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:54:42.776 --> 00:54:43.660
This is super-weird.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.495
Like-- no.

00:54:44.495 --> 00:54:45.350
Thanks for coming.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:45.790
DANNY BOWIEN: No, it's good.

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:46.270
You don't have to use the mic.

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:47.550
We can just hang out right here.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:48.091
AUDIENCE: No.

00:54:48.091 --> 00:54:50.010
I'm just reading a
lot on food blogs

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:54.400
and reading diaries about
chefs and their crazy nights

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:54.910
and stuff.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:56.702
I feel like I just hear
these crazy stories

00:54:56.702 --> 00:54:58.993
of other famous chefs showing
up to other famous chefs'

00:54:58.993 --> 00:54:59.600
restaurants.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.770
And I guess I'm
just wondering, when

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:03.840
do these relationships
start developing?

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.900
Is there a point
where David Chang

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.695
drives up to a new
chef's restaurant

00:55:07.695 --> 00:55:09.300
and inducts him into a secret--

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.880
DANNY BOWIEN: You pee your
pants when that happens.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.005
AUDIENCE: Like a secret
fraternity of restaurants--

00:55:13.005 --> 00:55:14.680
they give you the
keys or like a cloak.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.455
What's going on in
that secret circle?

00:55:16.455 --> 00:55:16.710
DANNY BOWIEN: Nah.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.840
Usually you just make them eat
pizza at the end of their meal

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:19.880
and they get mad at you.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.921
No, I mean, it's like any
other industry, really.

00:55:21.921 --> 00:55:25.570
Especially the food
world-- I'm very fortunate.

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:28.824
I, five years ago, was
just on every one of these

00:55:28.824 --> 00:55:31.490
chef's-- my favorite chefs-- and
I still am-- on their websites.

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:32.531
What's David Chang up to?

00:55:32.531 --> 00:55:34.720
What's [? Dan Boulud ?] up to?

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:37.390
But it is a very tight-knit
community of people.

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:40.662
And it's also still a
very blue-collar job.

00:55:40.662 --> 00:55:41.620
We're not saving lives.

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:42.650
We're cooking food.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:45.920
So there's a lot of
work that goes into it.

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.130
I think that because of
working 90 hours a week

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:52.460
on like a restaurant
or whatever,

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:54.110
everyone just kind
of gets each other.

00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:57.040
And so any spare moment
of time you have,

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.552
when you meet someone
that's a chef you look up to

00:55:59.552 --> 00:56:01.080
or anything, you
always just want

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.130
to try to make that
time count, and make

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:05.830
it the best time for them ever.

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.499
At a restaurant,
that's what my job is.

00:56:07.499 --> 00:56:09.165
It's to make sure
that when you come in,

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:11.140
you just have an amazing time.

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.866
And you leave happier
than you-- ideally, you

00:56:13.866 --> 00:56:15.740
leave happier than you
were when you came in.

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:16.800
And fuller.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:22.030
And so to answer your question,
meeting all these chefs--

00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:23.460
it's very surreal.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:25.820
Especially in this industry,
where you can actually

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:30.330
just-- I'm never going to
meet Michael Jordan, probably.

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.601
I'm also not in the NBA.

00:56:33.601 --> 00:56:34.600
But it's the same thing.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.016
If you're in the
NBA, you probably

00:56:36.016 --> 00:56:37.170
run into these other guys.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:41.850
And if you're not mean,
and you're really nice,

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:45.205
I think that it's
pretty organic.

00:56:45.205 --> 00:56:46.510
And also it's easy for me.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:51.010
Because when I was New York,
I wasn't making anything like

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:56.690
Momofuku or Daniel Boulud or
[? Daniel ?] [? Holm ?] or any

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:58.080
of the fine dining chefs.

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.980
None of those chefs
were-- it wasn't

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.340
any kind of competitive thing.

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:06.380
And I came in and gave out as
much free food as possible.

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.520
And I was like, hey guys.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.320
Here's a bunch of
stuff for your staff.

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.361
I really tried to go into
New York the right way.

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:14.110
Because I was terrified.

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:15.930
San Francisco is the
most amazing city

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:17.520
because everyone is so nice.

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.950
And people kind of
got what we did.

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:21.990
Because they were here,
along for the ride.

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:24.072
But a lot of people
don't get what we do.

00:57:24.072 --> 00:57:25.530
People were just
like, oh, the guys

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:28.590
at that place in the mission
with that other restaurant.

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:31.230
But in New York, I
was really terrified

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:33.260
that people were like,
oh, these guys think

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.468
they know what they're doing.

00:57:34.468 --> 00:57:36.870
And they're going to come
here and get annihilated.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:38.410
Which we did.

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:41.212
But luckily the other chefs
were really nice to us.

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:46.250
LIV WU: Thank you so much
for sharing your story,

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:47.255
and your demonstration.

00:57:47.255 --> 00:57:48.755
DANNY BOWIEN: I
mean, that was-- no.

00:57:48.755 --> 00:57:50.700
Thanks for this demonstration.

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.455
LIV WU: Thank you.

00:57:51.455 --> 00:57:52.350
It was a great story.

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.270
Thank you for coming.

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:54.311
DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, cool.

00:57:54.311 --> 00:57:56.860
LIV WU: There are tastes of the
porridge in three locations.

00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:57.740
They're identical.

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.200
You don't have to
go to all three.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.869
And if Jeff's stuffing is
done, we will pull it out.

00:58:03.869 --> 00:58:06.244
DANNY BOWIEN: Jeff's stuffing
smells wonderful right now.

00:58:06.244 --> 00:58:06.686
I'm not lying.

00:58:06.686 --> 00:58:07.130
LIV WU: I'm sure it does.

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:08.338
DANNY BOWIEN: I'm not joking.

00:58:08.338 --> 00:58:11.811
That smell you're smelling
is not the rice porridge.

00:58:11.811 --> 00:58:12.310
No.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:13.440
LIV WU: Thank you so much.

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.648
DANNY BOWIEN: Thank you guys.

00:58:14.648 --> 00:58:16.790
[APPLAUSE]
