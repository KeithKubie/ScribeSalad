00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.460
SPEAKER: So here's
some food for thought.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.100
Let's talk about
layers of truth.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.340
Let's talk about
shades of perspective.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.480
Because a different
perspective is literally

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.260
a different reality.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.140
So here's a quote by
Christopher [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.110
He reminds us that while
gazing up at the night sky,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.010
one in fact hangs off a
planet, and near the edge

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.900
of a galaxy, vertiginous,
it's suspended

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.710
over the infinity of space.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.460
At any given moment
of our lives,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.600
as we muck about a
flutter, concerned

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.900
with the trivialities
of everyday-ness,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.630
as we tranquilize ourselves
with trivialities,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.660
we in fact are living in a
different truth than when

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.739
we step back, zoom out,
take the long view,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.850
expand our minds,
and consciousnesses,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.545
and perceptions, and realize
that we, in fact, hang

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:13.260
over a planet
suspended in space,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.070
spinning around at a very fast
speed at any given moment,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.180
10 trillion atoms self-organized
into a sentient mind that

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.755
perceives itself as living off
a planet that is hanging off

00:01:26.755 --> 00:01:27.500
of space.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.660
I mean, there is truth to
every single thing I've said.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.660
Every single prospective
offers another angle,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.190
another reflection, of
the present situation.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.270
There are many truths.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.640
There are many realities.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.970
They coexist side by side.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.550
And I think the
role of the artist

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.790
is to visit those
realities, to transcend

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.390
baseline, ordinary consciousness
to change our perspectives,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.320
to bring back souvenirs for
the rest of us to consume.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.850
Art gives us a
glimpse of the other.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.800
