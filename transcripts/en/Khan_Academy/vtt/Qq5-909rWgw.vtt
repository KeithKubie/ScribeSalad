00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] We're told
sugar is freely traded

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.320
in the world market.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.100
Assume that a country, Loriland,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.000
is a price taker in the
world market for sugar.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.760
Some of the sugar consumed in Loriland

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.690
is produced domestically
while the rest is imported.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.320
The world price of sugar is $2 per pound.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.370
The graph below shows
Loriland's sugar market,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.780
and P sub W represents the world price.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.790
So we see our domestic demand,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.580
we see our domestic supply,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.670
and then we see the world price.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.100
All right, now let's try
to answer the questions

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.563
that they have given us.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.080
At the world price of $2 per pound,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.230
how much sugar is Loriland importing?

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.150
So pause this video,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.910
and see if you can figure
that out on your own.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.870
All right, now let's do it together.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.960
So at first, you look at
your domestic demand and see,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.530
well, what would the domestic
demand be at the world price?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.010
So that would be where
these two lines intersect.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.070
So the domestic demand at the world price

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.730
would be 14 million pounds.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.030
You might be tempted to
put 14 million pounds here,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.730
but that would be the
total domestic demand

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.563
at that world price.

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.330
But some of that is domestically produced,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.460
and some of it is imported.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.430
How much is domestically produced?

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.250
Well, at a price of $2, the
domestic producers are up

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.830
for producing two million
of those 14 million pounds.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.650
So this is domestic production.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.290
And so between these
two points, that length,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.400
that represents how much
is actually imported.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.220
So to go from two million
pounds to 14 million pounds,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.290
14 minus two is 12 million pounds.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.620
That is imported,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.570
12 million pounds.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.150
Part b, suppose that Loriland

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.990
imposes a per-unit
tariff on sugar imports,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.650
and the new domestic price
including the tariff is $4.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.820
Identify the new level
of domestic production.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.160
So once again, pause the video,
and try to figure that out.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.670
All right, so they say
the new domestic price

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.303
including the tariff is $4.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.710
So we are now in this situation.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.700
This is the new price.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.250
Now, they say what is the new
level of domestic production?

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.560
So the domestic supply, at that price,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.300
the domestic suppliers look
like they are willing to

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.140
supply six million pounds.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.440
So that is our new level
of domestic production,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.470
six million pounds.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.460
All right, part ii,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.540
calculate the domestic
consumer surplus for Loriland.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.330
You must show your work.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.470
Pause the video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.070
Well, the domestic consumer
surplus for Loriland

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.290
in this scenario, where this is the price,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.690
well, then we are going to,
let me scroll down a little bit

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.430
so we can see the entire consumer surplus.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.800
That is going to be the area

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.310
above this horizontal line at the price

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.610
and below our domestic demand curve.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.510
So this right over here
is the consumer surplus

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.230
in that scenario.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.470
And so that is going to be this width,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.440
which is the quantity demanded,
which is 10 million pounds,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.110
times the height,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.280
which is, you're going from four to $9,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.573
so it has a height of $5,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.100
and then times 1/2.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.130
If I just multiplied the
quantity times the height,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.400
I'd be figuring out the area
of this entire rectangle,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.130
so it's a little bit of a geometry review.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.890
To get half of that, we
would multiply it by half.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.610
So this is going to be,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.440
it's going to be 10 million pounds.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.290
I'll do it right over
here, so I have some space.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.810
10 million

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.060
pounds times,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.087
we have a difference of $5 per pound,

00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:36.990
$5

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.520
per pound.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.290
And then, of course, we want
to multiply it times 1/2,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.950
so this one right over here.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.690
So let's see, the pounds cancel out.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.780
And so, if you multiply it out,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.080
this is going to be $50 million times 1/2.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.883
So it's going to be $25 million.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.650
All right, part iii,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.900
scroll down a little bit.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.660
Calculate the total tariff revenue

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.160
collected by the government.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.800
This also says you must show your work.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.950
Once again, pause the video,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.100
and see if you can work through that.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.750
So the tariff revenue
collected by the government,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.550
well, we went from a world
price of $2 per pound

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.600
to a domestic price of $4 per pound,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.710
so it was a $2 per pound tariff.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.750
And the government is
collecting that $2 per pound

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.260
on the imports.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.110
So in this situation, this
is the domestic supply.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.480
We've already talked about that.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.380
And so this amount right
over here, are the imports.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.130
So if you multiply this amount,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.310
which went from six million
pounds to 10 million pounds,

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.170
so this is going to be
four million pounds,

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.950
times the tariff,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.200
which is $2 per pound,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.290
per pound,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.140
you're going to get this area,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.450
which would be the government revenue.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.410
So this is going to be four million pounds

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.230
times $2 per pound,

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.360
times $2 per pound.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.960
Pound cancels out,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.120
and this is an area of a rectangle here.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.187
And so this is going to
be equal to eight million,

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.263
$8 million.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.083
All right, now let's do part c.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.230
Given the world price of
$2, what per-unit tariff

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.230
maximizes the sum of Loriland's
domestic consumer surplus

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.170
and producer surplus?

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.460
Pause the video once more,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.210
and see if you can figure this out.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.820
All right, so you might be tempted

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.930
to try out a bunch of tariffs

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.430
and figure out if you can
get a higher total surplus,

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.040
but the important thing
to realize is any tariff

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.540
is going to reduce your
total economic surplus.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.540
So you can immediately
go and say that, hey,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.380
the ideal per-unit tariff

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.630
is going to be $0 per unit.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.950
And if you want to see
visually why that is,

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.780
we talk about it in other videos.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.640
Remember, in the first situation,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.050
where we're just at the world
price without any tariffs,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.130
the total economic surplus,

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.360
this is the domestic producer surplus,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.940
which isn't that much, but you
have a huge consumer surplus.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.603
You have all of this area as well.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.000
So those two triangles make
the total economic surplus.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.110
Now, a tariff is going
to raise this level.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.590
And as you raise this level,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.780
as you saw in the case of part b,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.570
well, you're going to
shrink this upper triangle.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.240
You will grow this bottom triangle,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.160
but you're still going to be smaller

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.800
than your two triangles
that you had before.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.410
Because look at that second scenario,

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.980
the scenario in part b.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.080
Your consumer surplus has now shrunk

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.610
to this right over here.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.880
Your producer surplus has
grown to that over there.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.570
But you haven't grown the total surplus.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.520
In fact, now for the
consumers and the producers,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.500
you've lost this entire triangle.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.660
Some of it is captured
by government revenue,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.720
but you also have deadweight loss.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.620
You also just have this section

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.870
and this section as just deadweight loss.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.390
And so any tariff is going to reduce the,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.860
is going to reduce your
possible economic surplus.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.420
So a $0 tariff, theoretically,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.153
would maximize your
total economic surplus.
