MALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, everybody,

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.290
to one more Talks
at Google event.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.220
Today, with us is author
Abby Smith Rumsey.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.100
She's a historian who writes
about how ideas and information

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.770
technologies shape
perceptions of history of time

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.440
and of personal and
cultural identity.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.420
Trained at Harvard
as a Russian scholar,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.350
she has worked in
Soviet era archives,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.720
spent a decade at the
Library of Congress,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.140
and has consulted on digital
collecting and curation,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.690
intellectual property
issues, and the economics

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.930
of digital information for
universities and the National

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.800
Science Foundation.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.850
Abby will be talking
today about what

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.040
it means to preserve
digital artifacts

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.130
and non-digital artifacts,
data storage is not memory,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.210
forgetting is the first
step in remembering,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.940
and memory is not the past,
it's about the future.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.480
So for us, it's
probably relevant

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.750
that the average web
page lasts 100 days.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.620
Ease of online
access dupes people

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.180
into a false sense of
security that information,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.790
our information, will be equally
accessible in the future.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.820
There's many more
things on this topic,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.110
and I welcome Abby,
today, to Google.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.475
This is the book,
which is in print now.

00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:20.540
And please welcome
Abby to Google.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.806
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:25.630
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY:
Thank you very much.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.120
I'm delighted to be here.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.660
I will be talking
about memory, and why

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.950
preserving digital
information is important.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.300
Not because it's about the past,
but it is about the future.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.110
And that's the main
contention of the talk, which

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.700
is that it's actually
from the past

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.364
that we manufacture the future.

00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:45.280
Which I think is a
particularly relevant topic

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.090
for people who are in
the midst of building

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.310
digital technologies, which
in fact are not secure.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.780
We don't know how to
secure them for future use.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.410
But I'd like to
begin this talk, if I

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.780
may, with lines
from a local poet,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.460
written in Berkeley in 1986.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.190
And it goes like
this, the last stanza.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.730
I imagine the Earth
when I am no more.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.139
Nothing happens, no loss.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.340
It's still a strange pageant.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.950
Women's dresses, dewy
lilacs, a song in the valley.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.570
And yet the books will be there
on the shelves, well-born,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.250
derived from people, but also
from radiance, from heights.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.360
That's, of course,
a poetic vision

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.070
of how memory lasts
through physical artifacts.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.140
And those are the words
of Czeslaw Milosz,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.070
who won the Nobel Prize
for Literature in 1980.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.540
He called himself
a poet of memory

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.040
for very compelling reasons.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.280
He lived in Berkeley for
decades as a political exile

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.570
from his native Poland, and
for almost all of his life

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.690
as a linguistic exile from
his native language of Polish.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.820
He had a long and eventful life,
full of great discontinuities,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.450
many of them forced on him by
political regimes he did not

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.500
agree with, and some of them
he chose because of the path

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.710
that he chose as a poet.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.620
But through all those years,
nine decades and more,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.490
he relied on memory
to create a sense

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.430
of meaning in an
autobiographical narrative.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.170
And I think his life is
very instructive in a time

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.220
when cultural change is so
rapid that even the landscapes

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.910
that we know are
changing and will

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.320
be obsolete by the
time you're grown up.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.640
The landscapes, the physical
landscapes you know,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.850
will be gone.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.692
And how will you remember
what those landscapes were,

00:03:27.692 --> 00:03:29.650
not to mention the sort
of knowledge landscapes

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.470
that you grew up in?

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.690
So I just want to give
you a sense of my priors,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.630
a sort of perspective I
have on this as a historian.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.670
Because I rely on memory
too, the traces and written

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.610
records that people
leave behind.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.470
Historians call this evidence.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.285
You'll call this data, but we're
talking about the same thing.

00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:50.909
And it was in 1997,
almost 20 years ago,

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.450
that I first began
to think seriously

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.520
about what would happen
to all the evidence that

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.950
then existed on durable
artifacts, textual, visual,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.840
and oral.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.310
How will that knowledge
survive in the digital age,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.590
and what will be the new
forms of instantiation

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.870
of knowledge for those formats?

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.570
So what will happen when,
for example, this technology

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.780
replaces this technology?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.060
What will be around in
100 years or 500 years?

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.600
This book has a
really good chance

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.150
of lasting all that time.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.610
What about this?

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.830
And this isn't just
a telephone or books.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.310
This is almost all of
my life is on this,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.090
all of my personal data, and
a lot of copyrighted data,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.430
and public data as well.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.240
So it's a very complex issue.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.760
So I wrote this
book first in order

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.810
to answer the
question for myself.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.900
So as an historian, it
seems self-evident, to me,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.960
actually, that everything
and everyone that exists

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.460
has a backstory.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.110
And it's the backstory
that tells us who we are,

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.830
and not only that, who we
are capable of becoming.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.160
Now, I spent my
formative years, as Bohr

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.715
said, doing a
doctoral dissertation

00:05:05.715 --> 00:05:08.846
and research in the
Soviet Union in the 1980s.

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:10.220
At that time, I
learned something

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.553
that I never would have
imagined as an American citizen,

00:05:12.553 --> 00:05:14.870
particularly one going to
a very good school that

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.000
had a library that was
always open almost 24/7.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.040
And that is that I was
routinely denied documents

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.180
that dated back to the 1680s.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.190
And I was, in fact, told
that they didn't exist,

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.800
although I was able to
consult copies of them

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.584
back at Weiner
Library at Harvard.

00:05:32.584 --> 00:05:34.000
My Soviet friends,
of course, when

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.041
I would complain to them
about this, would laugh.

00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:37.470
And they would say, come on.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.080
You know, in this country it's
the future that is certain.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.500
It will be a utopia.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.100
It's the past that
is always changing.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.790
And that's when I
began to realize that,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.040
in fact, when you control
someone's understanding

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.189
of the past, you
control their sense

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.230
of who they are and also
their sense of what they

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.490
can imagine becoming.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.320
So backstories I learned that
way are very powerful, and very

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.450
fragile, and always at risk.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.550
What we know about
ourselves, that

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.700
is what we're allowed
to know about ourselves

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.040
and what we're not allowed
to know about ourselves

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.940
is, in fact, a fundamental
component of our freedom

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.791
and our autonomy.

00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:13.290
So actually, I care
about the future

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.540
of our collective memory.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.520
And I'm alarmed to
think that we don't

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.240
have a way of
securing it, really

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.650
I think in 2016 it's
different than 1997.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.910
At that time, nobody seemed
to understand this problem

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.840
except a couple of librarians
and archivists, honestly.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.910
And now in 2016, if
we just look at what's

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.890
happening on campuses
not just in this country

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.600
but across the
world, we understand

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.500
that people are
growing up demanding

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.820
that they get to know
their own history,

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.880
and they get to tell
their own history

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.150
so that whose history
gets told and by whom

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.440
is fundamental to human
rights and human autonomy

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.639
as freedom is to
choose government.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.180
And that's why I
wrote what is really

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.854
a little book about
a very big idea.

00:06:55.854 --> 00:06:57.270
And today, I just
want to give you

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.856
a sense of some of the topics
that I cover in the book

00:06:59.856 --> 00:07:01.730
that I think will be of
most interest to you,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.984
at least I imagine.

00:07:02.984 --> 00:07:04.900
Although I may be wrong,
in fact, about what's

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.020
most interesting to people
in the technology world.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.230
So I want to start, if I
may, with a fairly well-known

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.210
document.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.160
This document is, obviously,
the Declaration of Independence.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.410
When I was working at the
Library of Congress in 1997,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.006
we put together an exhibition
of the library's treasures.

00:07:26.006 --> 00:07:27.380
And among the
greatest treasures,

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.250
including the first couple
drafts of the Gettysburg

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.760
Address in Lincoln's
hand, is this draft

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.560
of the Declaration of
Independence, written by Thomas

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.030
Jefferson in his hand.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.730
He was 33 years old
at the time, and he

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.260
was tasked to come
up with a draft

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.290
that he would hand off
to John Adams and Ben

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.535
Franklin, who would then
edit it and send it forward.

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:49.660
So when we put this on
display, people would always

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.940
appear and look for
the famous words,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.720
"we hold these truths
to be self-evident

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.650
that all men are created equal."

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.270
But that's not actually
what Jefferson wrote.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.200
He wrote something different.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.690
He wrote that "these truths
are sacred and undeniable."

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.380
The words that we
know now are actually

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.580
a correction by Ben Franklin.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.350
So the whole document,
all four pages,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.111
is like this-- very
heavily edited.

00:08:13.111 --> 00:08:14.610
And it's very
interesting to compare

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.180
what Jefferson saw as
the Declaration of Rights

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.960
and what became approvable
by other people, approved

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.922
by other people.

00:08:22.922 --> 00:08:24.880
And the thing that was
interesting for tourists

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.780
was that at that time
through this artifact

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.600
they could see not just
what the process of editing

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.460
was and the evolution of
thinking in the debate that

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.169
went on, but this
artifact actually

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:41.120
reflects evolution of thinking
and the process of democracy

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.380
itself.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.580
As an artifact, you
can see the arguments

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.500
that took place and the
compromises that were reached.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.360
Although to be
fair, Ben Franklin

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.470
did usually get his way.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.850
After all, he was much older
and thought himself much wiser.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.132
But in 1997, again, only
people in the library

00:08:59.132 --> 00:09:00.590
and in the archives
actually seemed

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.080
to understand what was at risk.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.540
We already knew that the
archives, the National

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.565
Archives, which is
charged with keeping

00:09:06.565 --> 00:09:08.440
the records of the
government and making them

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.120
accessible to the people,
they were, in fact,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.422
being inundated by emails coming
off of Bill Clinton's server.

00:09:17.422 --> 00:09:19.130
I should say, I don't
really mean server.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.010
They were actually
arriving in floppy disks,

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.320
if you can believe it or not.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.440
And people didn't
really know how

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.110
to sort them, let alone preserve
them and figure out what there

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.250
was that needed to be saved.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.280
So this is the
fundamental problem.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.360
We have an
infrastructure in place,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.330
perfected over, really,
centuries and millennia

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.170
for preserving knowledge by
preserving physical artifacts.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.950
We do manage our knowledge by
managing physical artifacts.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.022
And this doesn't
work for us anymore.

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:49.480
Now we have to
manage our knowledge

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.470
by managing electrical grids,
codes, hardware, software,

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.210
many of which is proprietary.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.330
And all of it is very
fragile and dependent

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.690
upon a secure flow of
energy, which, of course, is

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.380
a very contested issue.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.520
What we don't have is the
advantage of durability.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.090
And this is a cuneiform, as
many of you may recognize.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.460
This tablet is 2,700 years old.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.040
There's no chance that
digital informational

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.200
will live for 2,700
years and be like this,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.960
completely i-legible.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.850
I'm slightly kidding
when I say i-legible.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.030
You do have to be able to read
Akkadian to know what it says.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.740
But anybody who
can learn Akkadian

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.640
can understand what this is.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.950
This is, in fact, about
how to divine omens.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.440
It's a divination tablet.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.620
Omens, how to read the birth
defects of humans and animals

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.430
to tell the fortune
of the people who

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.347
are seeking their fortune.

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:50.680
You know, the interesting
thing about these clay tablets

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.110
is that they're the
longest enduring

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.680
evidence we have of humans
outsourcing their knowledge

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.020
on to physical objects.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.310
And unlike all other forms that
were invented from papyrus on,

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.966
when these things go
and are set in flames,

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:06.090
they actually don't perish.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.320
They actually get harder.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.060
As any of you know
who have worked clay,

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.090
firing makes it very hard.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.180
So you can say that,
actually, digital technology

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.850
is the latest instantiation,
but all preservation has

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.850
gone downhill from here.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.090
We can save a lot more.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.620
And we can cram in a
lot more information.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.500
But with each degree
of information,

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.430
we lose a significant
degree of durability.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.670
The thing that's perplexing,
I think, for most people

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.430
is that we have
these systems set

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:40.230
in place to answer the question,
what can we afford to save?

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.930
Because the cost of committing
information to a durable form

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.050
has always been very high.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.440
The upfront costs
have been very high.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.250
Even getting a
book in print, you

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.240
have to go through
many different

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.790
what I think of as filters.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.380
It's not just the
author writing.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.230
You also have to get an agent to
sell the book to the publisher.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.660
The publisher then has to find a
way to publish it and market it

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.770
in the marketplace.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.470
And then libraries
acquire them--

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.290
they don't acquire
all books-- so

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.990
that you have some chance that
something significant will

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.850
last.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.580
And now the question for us
is what can we afford to lose?

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.470
Now that there are
actually no filters

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.880
to creating information
or using information,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.340
it proliferates quite
promiscuously on the web

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.677
and in other forms and other
places besides the web.

00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:27.010
And it all looks about the same.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.520
It's all on the same format,
this electrical code,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.710
and it's hard to place
value on it the way

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.920
you would just by looking at
a book or a film, for example.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.150
And hardest of all,
for most people,

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.710
is that people will not be
making the decisions about what

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.600
gets saved.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.180
Machines will be.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.930
That is, the machines that
people make and program.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.120
But for most people,
the idea that machines

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.050
are what's going to read
all this information

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.500
and make decisions
about what gets saved

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.110
is actually quite formidable.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.000
I think it is a formidable
task because machines can't

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.220
save any of this information.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.660
We're not sure that it's very
secure or readable over time.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.860
So we're at this
particular juncture in time

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.710
when we're going from one
old technology, one memory

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.000
technology, to a new.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.260
And I would argue that although
we've done this before,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.190
the quality of change is
actually quite different

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.760
in this case, because
of issues of electricity

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.060
and non-i-legibility
of some of the formats.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.640
But as I said, we've gone
through this change before.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.110
I won't recapitulate
this, but in the book,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.730
I talk about these
moments of change

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.610
and what's at risk to
our cultural memory

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.570
by using this shorthand model
of cultural change, which

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.775
I think of as the
push-me, pull-you moment.

00:13:46.775 --> 00:13:48.650
Now, some of you may
recognize this creature.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.180
Maybe you don't.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.740
It was invented or first
spotted, I should say,

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.480
in 1923 by Hugh
Lofting, who wrote

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.790
a book called "The
Adventures of Dr. Doolittle."

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.500
Dr. Doolittle was
an animal doctor

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.960
who went to Africa, of course, a
fictional character, and found,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.570
hunted down, this long
extinct, thought to be extinct,

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.910
animal, the rarest creature
of all, the push-me, pull-you,

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:14.850
that had two heads--
a gazelle on one end

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.760
and a unicorn on the other.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.930
And although they could agree
on most divisions of labor,

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.920
for example, what one would
eat and the other would talk.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.010
So someone could always
be eating and talking

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.720
without anybody being rude.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.980
They had a very hard
time whenever anyone told

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.750
them to do something quickly.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.860
Because they had to consult,
and they often didn't agree.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.170
And if they didn't agree, if
they completely disagreed,

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.990
then they would
actually be paralyzed.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.640
But if they kind of
agreed but couldn't

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.020
agree how to leave room,
for example, then they

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.760
would move sideways,
and they would end up

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.639
in a very unexpected
place, even though they

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.680
thought they had agreed
on where they were going.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.830
And the faster they moved,
the more unpredictable

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.640
the resulting end was.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.010
This is a very common feature
in these inflection points

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.250
in memory technology change,
say in the cuneiform time

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.040
and also when papyri
were invented.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.930
Certainly during the
printed revolution,

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.990
which I'll talk a little
bit about as time permits.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.390
But it's pretty reliable,
according to this theory

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:21.390
and according to real life, that
whenever there's a new memory

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.430
technology that comes along,
memory being so personal,

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.640
it's seen by some as
creative and very exciting.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.130
And it's seen by many
others and condemned

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.380
as disruptive and destructive.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.690
And rather than giving you
a lot of piquant examples

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.870
from history, I'll just go to
the granddaddy of curmudgeons,

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.760
Socrates, and tell
you what he thought

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.629
about the invention of writing.

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:45.170
Because he thought
that it would lead

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.170
to ignorance and ultimately
to the death of memory itself.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.682
And this is what he said.

00:15:50.682 --> 00:15:52.390
He said, "for this
invention will produce

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.060
forgetfulness in the minds
of those who learn to use it,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.470
because they will not
practice their memory.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.510
Their trust in writing produced
by external characters which

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.850
are no part of themselves
will discourage

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.960
the use of their own
memory within them.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.570
You have invented an elixir
not of memory but of reminding.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.390
And you offer your pupils
not the appearance of wisdom,

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.820
nor true wisdom.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.350
For they will read many
things without instruction,

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.580
and will therefore seem
to know many things when

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.750
they are for the most
part ignorant and hard

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.200
to get along with,
since they are not wise

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.890
but only appear wise."

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.770
Now, there are many complaints
about what the new memory

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:33.370
technologies do for knowledge
in this current environment,

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.711
but I think Socrates
got it dead wrong.

00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:37.960
Because those societies that
didn't adopt are writing,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.677
in fact, went
extinct very quickly.

00:16:41.677 --> 00:16:43.260
And they were made
extinct by cultures

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.020
that did carry writing with
them, which was rapidly

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.100
adopted by other cultures.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.680
Furthermore, as I think Socrates
must have known himself,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.150
that if Plato hadn't been
writing down every single word

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.640
he'd said that nobody would know
that Socrates had ever existed.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.380
And thus the problem
with vanishing knowledge.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.950
There are many
things that we think

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.569
Socrates said and
were written down

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:06.680
by Plato that
actually did vanish

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.020
when the Library of
Alexandria vanished, we think.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.782
So I won't go into
the inflection points

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:14.490
that I talk about in
the book, but I just

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.349
want to note for your interest
that among the first people who

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:21.200
show up as early adopters of
a memory technology, and this

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.800
is well documented
during the print

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.109
revolution of the 15th
and 16th centuries,

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.650
there are two
categories you can make

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.300
sure will show up right away.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.390
The first are pornographers,
and the second

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:38.210
are ideological
fanatics and terrorists.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.600
This was certainly true
during the Reformation,

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.230
when print was adopted far more
rapidly and deftly by people

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.790
we now, in retrospect, call
Protestants, people who

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.580
were protesting against
the power of the pope,

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.600
than by the Catholic Church
itself, which had as much power

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.510
to defend its hegemony
over the world of ideas.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.020
But somehow because they were
slower at mastering print,

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.430
they didn't get as much
traction as the Protestants.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.180
And believe it or not,
at that time, of course,

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.710
people believed that because it
was in print it had to be true.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.460
And that was one way
that some of the most

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.317
fanatic of the Protestant
sectarians got their way.

00:18:18.317 --> 00:18:20.400
And there's a lesson in
here-- I won't draw it out

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.760
for you-- about what's going on
today with religious terrorism

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.230
of all sorts and ideological
terrorism throughout the world.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.190
Technology is only a tool.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.470
It depends upon who picks
it up as to what its use is.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.220
So I want to talk a
little bit about-- history

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.954
tells us, OK, we've
been here before.

00:18:37.954 --> 00:18:39.370
And some of the
things that we are

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.130
seeing in this period of
transition we've seen before.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.930
It's a temporary
phase, but it's also

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.830
one in which a lot is at risk.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.050
I want to talk just
briefly again about what

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.640
science tells us about
these periods of transition

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.070
and about memory.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:59.050
So I say, as Bohr said, that
memory is not about the past.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.600
It's actually about the future.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.720
Why do we have this idea,
and how is it that science

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.440
buttresses this idea?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.830
Well, first of all, we know that
memory is ubiquitous in nature,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.380
because, in fact, all
matter is information.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.270
Memory is nature's
go-to solution

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.540
for the challenges of adaptation
to changing environments.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.100
From the amoeba to
the zebra, everybody

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.580
has a certain amount of
preprogrammed memory,

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.600
this strand we call DNA.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.490
But every creature
is born having

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:28.550
to learn its environment.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.530
And so nature created this thing
called memory, called learning.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.280
And when that creature
dies, everything it learned

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.850
dies with it, except for human
beings, and some creatures

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.750
that create culture and can
pass things along culturally.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.680
But if you see that creature up
there in the corner, of course,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.090
above the volcano,
that's actually

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.640
a dodo that was extinct when
this book was done in 1841.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.530
Actually, a notation says that
the last dodo was seen in 1691.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.170
And that's what happens
when a creature can't

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.080
adapt very quickly to
a changing environment.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.105
It becomes extinct.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.670
Just think a thought experiment
about how much memory means.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.940
So imagine waking
up in the morning

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.000
and not knowing
where you are, not

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.380
knowing what the room is, not
knowing where you came from

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.050
or how you ended up there, not
having any idea what you're

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.040
supposed to do now that you
see yourself in your body,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.900
and certainly not knowing who
you were, and not knowing what

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.030
your name is, because
you didn't know there

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.810
were such things as names.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.330
In other words,
no memory, no you.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.860
That's the sum of
what memory is.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.370
So the brain has an
incredibly big job to do.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.500
It's basically
trying to sort out,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.110
in this data deluge it's
in 24/7 all the time,

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.270
what's important for
survival and what isn't.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.830
And that's the
ultimate criterion

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.180
for what the brain
sorts through.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.074
So what's valuable in the short
term is anything that's new.

00:20:55.074 --> 00:20:56.490
We pay attention
to all the things

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.000
that are new, that the
brain has never seen before.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.520
And this is one of the keys
that people on Madison Avenue

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.169
learned a long time
ago in the period

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:04.960
of "Mad Men," for
example, that the way you

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.350
get people's attention
is by flashing something

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.530
new or colorful in front of
them to get their attention.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.570
Pay attention.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.100
The brain does pay
attention to those cues.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.390
But it throws most of
that information away,

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.580
and it only keeps that
which is valuable.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.700
So what is valuable
over the long term

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.990
from an animal's point of view?

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.650
Information is
valuable to the extent

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.630
that it has potential for reuse.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.210
And this is the main
lesson, I think,

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.668
that science can teach us now
in this period of information

00:21:30.668 --> 00:21:33.650
abundance in which
we are effectively,

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.030
our cultural institutions,
our cultural memories

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.060
are in the same
position, the same bind,

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.270
as the human brain is, that
only those things which

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.535
can be reused should be saved.

00:21:45.535 --> 00:21:48.160
But the truth is, that's exactly
what librarians and archivists

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.990
do now.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.080
They think very much about
what's possible for reuse.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.100
And so they would just
assume keep everything,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.250
and they can't because of
the physical constraints.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.220
Now they can't keep
everything in digital form,

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.440
because they can't keep
up with the volume.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.920
And this is something that I
think technologies companies,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.360
really, are best
positioned to solve,

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.810
how to keep a lot
of data secure,

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.980
even at low levels
of curation to be

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.450
available to be looked at in
20, 30, 50 years to determine

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.660
its long term value.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.120
I want to point out one of
the things about this image

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.520
that's so remarkable
and that I think

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.730
few people in the information
industry understand.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.510
It's the kind of Genesis
moment of their own work.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.060
And that is this
incredible discovery

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:44.010
made at the end of the
18th, early 19th century,

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.890
that the world is, in fact,
very old and knows everything.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.380
The technologically
advanced data

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.590
rich world we live in today all
devolves from that central one

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.780
discovery, that the universe
was created in deep time,

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.450
extends infinitely
across deep space,

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.310
and leaves a record of
its own history in matter.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.290
So the material universe
is itself in archives,

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.180
and the Earth writes its
own autobiography in matter.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.224
In other words, rocks or clocks.

00:23:09.224 --> 00:23:10.640
This is what
geologists discovered

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.990
at the end of the 18th century.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.820
And this leads up, of course,
to the embrace of materialism,

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.570
scientific materialism, the
idea that the universe and all

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.250
that exists is no
more and no less

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.380
than the material effect
of material causes.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.080
So just to be clear,
technologies always

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.850
arise out of a demand.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.080
And materialism itself began
this really escalating demand

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.720
for more information,
finer data about the world,

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.610
itsy bitsy pieces of matter.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.140
In fact, until we get to
the Large Hadron Collider

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.680
and beyond, we want
more and more data,

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.790
because that's how
we know the world.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:50.760
Technologies appear, as
I say, out of demand,

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.700
and just to give you an example,
this is the Gutenberg Bible.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.010
And the Gutenberg
Bible wasn't invented

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.720
because people wanted a brand
new way of reading the Bible.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.237
In fact, what they wanted
was, they wanted this.

00:24:03.237 --> 00:24:04.570
They wanted a handwritten Bible.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.170
This is a giant Bible of Mainz.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.360
These are both at the Library
of Congress, incidentally.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.260
They were both done in the
1450s in Mainz, the same town.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.110
And one, this one, was designed
to look exactly like this one.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.270
Because people don't want
new newfangled things.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.680
What they were looking for
were old newfangled things,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.970
only cheaper.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.620
And I think that explains a lot
of the initial phases of web

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.170
design.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.650
Why do we call web
pages pages after all?

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:36.020
So this period of time
in the 1830s, 1840s

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:41.860
saw an incredible change in
the culture of all of us,

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.370
in fact, our
fascination with data,

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.870
and gave birth to this
kind of forensic hunt

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.420
for evidence which
has ultimately

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.340
led to the introduction of
computers into our lives

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.600
and our demand for big data.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.080
It also invented, of course, Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle's character

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.760
Sherlock Holmes.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.530
I mean, the grand narrative of
our age is whodunit and how?

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.580
And that's all a riff
on materialism, that is,

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.300
trying to understand the
world through the traces,

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.100
the evidence, of
what it used to be.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.640
The collective memory that have
has made us a unique species.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.790
And all it's taken
are four things.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.750
And the first is these
empirical methods

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.650
that derive from
materialist theories,

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.840
the second is the harnessing
by economic systems

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.600
to apply that knowledge
and create ever

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.560
finer instruments to accumulate
ever greater amounts of data.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.550
Also, dedicated resources to
educate an expert workforce,

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.770
and the fourth, and perhaps
the most contested right now,

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.360
are political regimes that
keep the pursuit of knowledge

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.660
well resourced and protected
from ideological interference.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.720
Without any one of those,
then the entire enterprise

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.110
of science and technology is
threatened and could collapse.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.470
So here we are, a species that's
uniquely strong and uniquely

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.810
dominant over the planet
because of the power of culture

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.820
and knowledge that
builds on knowledge.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.980
So what could go wrong?

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.710
Well, actually a lot, and
I want to talk briefly

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.970
about some of the things
that go wrong with memory.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.660
I'm going to use some
personal case studies.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.230
Memory science has made
extraordinary advances

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.210
in studying memory
in healthy people

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:27.390
by looking at what happens when
memory degenerates or is flawed

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.190
in people who suffer
from memory disorders.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.610
And the two lessons, the two
cases I'm going to look at,

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.310
tell us a lot about
some of the threats

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.857
for our collective memory
in the digital age.

00:26:38.857 --> 00:26:40.440
The first thing we
need to think about

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.250
is the importance of forgetting.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.200
This is a picture of
a doctor, Dr. Luria,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.810
who had a patient well
known in memory science,

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.610
a patient called S. His
real name was Shereshevskii,

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.860
but I'm going to call him S.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.570
He, like Luria, lived in
Russia in Soviet times.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.355
And Luria was his doctor.

00:27:01.355 --> 00:27:05.570
S had a disorder that
Luria very elegantly

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.339
called "he lacked the
art of forgetting."

00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:10.130
In fact, he was a man
who had what we would

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.260
call a photographic memory.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.120
He could remember everything.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.820
And although it sounds
actually quite envious,

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.290
I know many people think, wow.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.060
I wish I had that
kind of memory.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.230
In fact, the art of forgetting
is the faculty simply

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.310
of being able to sort long
term or short term memories

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.790
and consolidating them
into long term memories

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.076
and basically getting
rid of the rest.

00:27:30.076 --> 00:27:31.450
Remember, the way
the brain works

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:35.100
is in fact to sort out what's
valuable and keeping it.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.630
And that's what it does
every night during sleep,

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.550
for example.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.180
Just in case you wonder
why we need sleep,

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.790
one of the many
reasons we need sleep

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:46.320
is because the brain actually
sorts through short term

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.110
memories and begins the
process of converting them

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.820
into long term memories, if
they're meant to be around.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.160
And then it basically
throws out the rest.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.930
So basically the
brain is in there,

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.630
taking out the
trash every night.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.330
And if you don't
get enough sleep,

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.530
that trash hangs around
inside of your brain

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.900
and mucks it up for a long time.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.470
So you need sleep to
have a good memory,

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.370
and in fact, to have a
well-balanced sense of living.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.840
Because what
happened to this man,

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.140
although he made a good living
as a mnemonist for a while,

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.440
as a memory artist.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.330
He was actually quite
miserable in his personal life.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.470
He was really unable
to sort out what

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.520
was important from unimportant.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.790
And he was unable, literally,
to put together a narrative,

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.800
because he couldn't
understand what was important.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.440
Because he couldn't understand
the value of anything,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.890
he actually had no sense
of cause and effect,

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:43.980
how life happened.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.240
So he went through life
as a kind of dream,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.120
not really figuring
out what was going on,

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.210
and never being able to keep
a job, because he didn't

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.990
have a plan for anything.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:54.760
And this is what he says.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.932
At one point, I studied
the stock market.

00:28:56.932 --> 00:28:59.140
And when I showed that I
had a good memory for prices

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.210
on the exchange,
I became a broker.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.210
But it was just something I did
for a while to make a living.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.000
As for real life, that
was something else again.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.350
It all took place in
dreams, not in reality.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.880
And he talks,
actually, at length.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.480
He's quoted by Luria at
length poignantly about how

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.860
he kept groping for things
to actually click in and make

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.590
sense for him, but he
just couldn't understand

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.130
how things really worked.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:26.140
And Luria poignantly says,
and here I quote his doctor,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.990
"that he had a family, a
fine wife, and a son, who

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.930
was a success, but this too he
perceived as through a haze.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.760
Indeed, one would
be hard put to say

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.830
which was more real for him, the
world of imagination in which

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.360
he lived, or the world
of reality, in which he

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.760
was but a temporary guest."

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.526
So remember that forgetting
is really important.

00:29:47.526 --> 00:29:49.400
And you don't need to
think about forgetting.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.770
Your brain does
it automatically.

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:55.000
And one of the things that
we should be thinking about,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.290
or I would like
people to think about,

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.010
is when we teach
our machines how

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:02.800
to sort through all the
incoming information of a day,

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.440
how to search for value,
that pattern matching

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:10.600
with what is determined to
be value is really important,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.810
and that the processes need to
be carried on in individuals

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.060
largely unconsciously
we can't think

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.260
about them too consciously.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:23.500
So this is my image of what
it was like when S would

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.830
go try to retrieve a memory.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.420
In fact, it was
like he was walking

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.320
into this crowded hall, where
all this stuff was unsorted.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.080
And he would trip
over one thing,

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.410
and it would immediately
trigger so many memories

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.930
that he would literally go
off in some other direction

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.570
and forget why he had come
into his memory palace

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:42.830
to find something.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:46.280
So forgetting is very
important, but of course,

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.240
forgetting too much is
desperately horrible.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.050
And here, I talk at some
length about the case

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.750
of Alzheimer's patients,
in this case Iris Murdoch,

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.610
a very prolific writer and
philosopher, who succumbed

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.350
Alzheimer's later in her life.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.556
And we know a lot
about what it meant,

00:31:03.556 --> 00:31:04.930
because her husband,
John Bailey,

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.340
wrote a very moving
memoir of his wife

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.570
as he watched her basically
disintegrate in front

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.530
of his eyes.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.960
He describes her losing
her sense of self,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.250
her sense of direction,
of course, her memory,

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.900
but essentially her
personality, her Iris-ness.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.680
And what was most remarkable was
that she lost her imagination.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.640
If you know Iris
Murdoch's work, you

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.177
know that she was
fantastically imaginative.

00:31:29.177 --> 00:31:30.135
She wrote prolifically.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.030
And everything gave her an idea
for a whole fantastic novel

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.260
or a philosophical speculation.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.820
And this was lost to her
because without a past,

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.430
she had no imagination.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:50.770
And that's why I say that memory
really isn't about the past.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.710
It's actually the raw
material of the future.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.090
And this is well documented
in neuroscientific literature.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.410
Imagination actually is
memory in the future tense.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.210
The true value of the past is
that it is the raw material

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.900
we use to create the future.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.400
And so the greater our
collective memory, ,

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.770
the collective memory from
the very beginning of time,

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.340
the greater the resources
for our imagination.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.730
Think of it as a very
expansive mental toolkit

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.230
for solving near term
and long term problems.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.290
So what now, if the real
problem we're facing now

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.510
is that we don't
know how to secure

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.410
a lot of the past
for the future,

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.180
and we agree that
preserving and making

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.170
the past, a record of the past
accessible for the future,

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.690
is how we're going to
move into the future?

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.230
So what do we do now?

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:41.000
How do we actually move from
this world, this instantiation

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.980
of knowledge,
which was perfected

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:49.160
over millennia, into a world
that looks like this, In fact?

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.730
Let me just stop, if I
may, to go back and talk

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.720
about how at the time
this building, which

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.960
was opened in 1850,
it's by Henri Labrouste.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.880
It was a revolutionary
building very

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.190
influenced by the political
revolutions of 1848.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:06.630
And it was vaunting
this brand new--

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.320
and it was very high tech.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.820
It was built with cast iron,
and it had a very large windows

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.910
to let in a lot of light.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:15.800
And because it was
built out of cast iron,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.199
it was actually a kind of
natural fire retardant.

00:33:19.199 --> 00:33:20.740
And furthermore, it
was for students.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.860
Students didn't have
such a big space before.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.526
They would have to
study in their rooms.

00:33:24.526 --> 00:33:26.460
See, this embodies
these democratic ideals

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.980
of study and access.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.170
They kept this open long hours.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.560
So the question is,
how do we not only

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.210
move that legacy
into this, but also

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.930
how do we aestheticize the
experience of knowledge,

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:44.750
the way knowledge has been
aestheticized over the past

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.560
and made it really attractive?

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.630
I want to briefly talk
about the three things

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.040
that we need to
do now, and sooner

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.020
rather than later, in order to
achieve this kind of nirvana

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.860
of a world in which
we have access

00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.490
to the full, rich memory
of the human past.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.840
First is to take all
of the legacy work

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.760
that's on physical formats now
and convert it to digital form.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.290
And what you see
here is a picture

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.900
of what I think of
as a local hero.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.600
Carl Haber, who works up at
the Lawrence Berkeley Lab,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.070
an experimental
physicist by day.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.949
And when he was building some
of the imaging techniques

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:21.659
he used in the Large
Hadron Collider

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:25.750
to look for traces
of the Higgs-Boson,

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.531
he realized that the
imaging technology

00:34:27.531 --> 00:34:28.989
they were creating
in the lab would

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:33.010
be good for imaging very
fragile analog recorded

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.780
sound formats that were not
capable of being played back.

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.949
I'm sure you know that every
time you play an analog record

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:44.170
back or a wax cylinder, that
the information layer actually

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.139
physically degrades.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:48.469
So people in audio preservation
don't play anything back.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:51.420
They want this sort of
non-contact playback.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.030
And he's able to
take this technology

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.350
and recreate things
that were incalculable.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.800
No one ever thought
they're hear.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.710
You can see on the screen
those tracks behind

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.635
him are actually a pictorial.

00:35:05.635 --> 00:35:09.330
Well, they're
visualizations of sound.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.750
So the sound is converted to
digital format, digital images,

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.570
and then you can play it back.

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.410
So we have an amazing
array of technologies now

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.710
that can extract extraordinary
information from analog.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:26.290
And I just want to point
out that in this day of you

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:30.300
know genetic research,
forensic research, in fact,

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.430
that all those things,
the natural history

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.890
museums with their
drawers full of specimens,

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.970
and bugs and things,
and stuffed birds,

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:44.330
they're actually the Fort Knox
of the genetic research world.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.930
They're the things
that hold specimens

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:49.380
of things already extinct
or unfortunately about

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.800
to become extinct.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.020
So we need to remediate
those analog format materials

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.600
onto digital form as quickly
as we can at the same time we

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.172
preserve the original.

00:36:00.172 --> 00:36:01.880
The other thing we
need to do is to start

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.400
taking care of digital content.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.670
And here's another
local boy, Brewster

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.600
[? Kale, ?] who allows
people using the web

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.820
to upload their own
content in an open format

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.360
to be preserved on
the internet Archive

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.670
and accessible as long as the
Internet Archive is on board,

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.410
and presumably, the
Archives' materials

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.270
will move to another
long term preservation

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.960
institution over time.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.255
What Brewster is able to
do, and what we should all

00:36:30.255 --> 00:36:31.880
be thinking about,
especially companies

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.670
that own a lot of data, like
Twitter, for example, that

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.420
really maintain control
over it for now,

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.390
is to think about
developing a partnership

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:44.580
between that company
and a long term

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.560
preserving institution,
something public,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.170
and handing over the
legacy of their materials

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.707
when they no longer want it
to a long term institution

00:36:52.707 --> 00:36:53.790
for preservation purposes.

00:36:57.636 --> 00:36:59.260
The other thing that
I think about when

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.280
I see the Internet Archive is
the answer to the question,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.540
so how do we know what's
going to be of value?

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.660
How do we know that?

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.567
We can't actually put
digital content on a shelf

00:37:08.567 --> 00:37:10.650
and know that it's going
to be there in 500 years,

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.400
and someone's going
to come along and make

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.770
a decision about whether it
was important now or not.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.320
The thing is, we need to save
as much as we can, as I said,

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.300
but we need to start
each of us with saving

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.590
the thing that is of value to
ourselves and make that easy.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.910
I say as an historian who worked
with a very limited source

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:30.490
base, there's not much that
survives from 17th century

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:31.260
Muscovy.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.041
And not much of it
records information

00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:34.540
that I want to know
about, which had

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.960
nothing to do with, say,
liturgical matters or court

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.620
rolls.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.430
Nonetheless, what information
was available was very useful.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:43.710
So save whatever you can.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:48.150
Save mostly what is
important to you.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.010
And finally, I want
to talk about the last

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:57.480
and I think possibly the
most important invisible risk

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.440
to our cultural heritage.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.330
And that is, it's more
of a mindset, I'd say.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:07.080
It's one that makes us prone
to creating a knowledge

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.040
monoculture, what I think
is a knowledge monoculture.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.210
The idea prevalent
today that there

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:13.700
is such a thing
as progress, which

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.930
renders knowledge obsolete.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.320
This is particularly true
in science and engineering,

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.280
where the idea that
new discoveries

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.130
actually make other
things obsolete.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:25.030
Well, they make them not very
relevant in the near term,

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.340
but there isn't any piece
of cultural information,

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.320
cultural learning, which is
truly obsolete in the sense

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.560
that we can flush it
away, because, in fact, we

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.920
know from our friend biologists
that there are lots of things

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.350
that animals carry around, their
useless limbs that are never

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:45.320
used, for example, that
when environments change,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.940
they can use that useless
limb, that thing, that fin,

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.990
they can use it they and turn
this kind of maladaptation

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:56.320
into what we call an
exaptation, turning it

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.950
into something that can be
useful in a new environment.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:03.765
You know that mammals didn't
evolve legs to walk on land.

00:39:03.765 --> 00:39:06.140
They were able to walk on land
because they had something

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.220
that could evolve into legs.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.230
And I think that particularly
given how much we ourselves,

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.300
our species, is
radically changing

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.670
the natural environment,
we need to actually

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.170
be scrupulous in keeping
as much information

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:21.820
about that environment and
about how indigenous peoples

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.140
understood that environment.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.960
Whether it's scientific
understanding

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.247
or not, we can't afford
to flush knowledge away,

00:39:28.247 --> 00:39:29.830
because we don't
know what we're going

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:34.490
to need when the world changes
as it is changing very rapidly.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.540
So I want to leave
you with this,

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.050
what I think of as a sort
of paleolithic selfie.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:47.900
This actually survives in
the Chauvet Cave in France.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.960
It's dated probably to
35, 40,000 years ago.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:56.290
And truthfully, we know
it was made about then.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:58.110
And we know those
are human hands,

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.510
but we don't know what
they're trying to tell us.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.950
We do know that they
are human beings,

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:08.480
and that they wanted to leave
their mark on the world.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.030
We are such an amazing species.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.290
It's flabbergasting to
think about the fact

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.720
that we not only have
the kind of memory

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.740
that we can share
amongst each other,

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.620
but that our entire worlds,
even my personal mental model

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:25.190
of the world, has been hugely
expanded because of the access

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:28.200
I have to everybody
else's collective memory.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.730
This potential to learn and
to incorporate the world

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.580
through the learning of others--
it was a wonderful thing when

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.010
we had books and people
had access to libraries.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:39.470
But now that we
have the internet,

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.360
it's almost
incalculable the amount

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.860
of information, and knowledge,
and ways of understanding

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.950
what it means to be
human that we can absorb.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.350
So what is at stake
now in human memory

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:55.070
is keeping all of that
knowledge intact and accessible

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:58.470
for the long term, especially
keeping the most diverse

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.470
and maybe unedifying
aspects of it,

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.057
the most backward aspects
of it, because that too

00:41:03.057 --> 00:41:05.140
is part of learning what
it is to be a human being

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.100
and to be humane to each other.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.830
So I think that we
can certainly develop

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:12.090
skills to manage and
take responsibility

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.700
for digital memory
that outlives us

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.750
in a way like books,
derived from people

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.210
but also from radiant heights.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.520
But now it's up to us to
figure out how to do it.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.040
And the future, in that
sense, as well as the past,

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.920
is in our hands.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.930
So I thank you very much.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:32.614 --> 00:41:34.940
And I'd be happy to
take any questions.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.800
AUDIENCE: Fascinating subject.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.290
Actually, when I was in college,
I worked for a little while

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:46.270
at ibiblio, the archive at UNC,
and had a lot of conversations

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.780
on subjects like this.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.880
One of the things that we
were working on at the time

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.670
was a system based
on BitTorrent.

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:01.950
And you touched on
this distributed method

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:06.230
of preserving information
briefly when you said,

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:09.960
we should all decide what
we individually value

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.170
and save that.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:17.870
And I'd love to hear
more of your thoughts.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:24.500
Clearly we have this
idea in large libraries

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:29.500
and archives of we want the
copy of something, maybe,

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:35.500
and we want to preserve it in
as durable a format as possible.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.820
But on the other hand,
now with the internet,

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.370
with digital information
that's so readily copied,

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:45.760
there's this other
mechanism, maybe

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:51.270
this more like direct
democracy, anarchic mechanism

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.880
of just everybody who
wants it, copies it,

00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:00.490
and they put it on the internet,
or they torrent it or whatever,

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.590
and make it available that way.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.940
Do you think there
is necessarily

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.460
a tension between
those two impulses?

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.530
Do they go do they go together?

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:18.150
Is it something that you
see in the future maybe

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.094
one overwhelming the other?

00:43:20.094 --> 00:43:22.010
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: It's
an excellent question,

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.740
and of course, as
you probably know

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.615
by asking when you were
framing the question,

00:43:25.615 --> 00:43:28.111
there is actually no particular
answer to that question.

00:43:28.111 --> 00:43:30.360
I think the model of push-me,
pull-you is pretty good.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.640
It's both end.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:32.700
We want both end.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.640
But you're right, especially
in the short term,

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.590
with the amount of redundant
information that circulates.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:39.820
And that's just on the web.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:41.930
There's a lot of
information on what

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.360
used to be called the dark
web, which is even greater,

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.500
which is redundant.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.030
We really don't want to shut
down our systems by having

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:50.930
too much redundant information.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:52.580
I didn't go into
this, but I think

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.450
that there are a lot of
the problems that we face

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.640
that appear to be
conceptual that

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.690
are in fact quite solvable if
we apply technical minds to it.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.700
I think the challenge
that I've seen

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.480
is that the conceptual models
haven't been worked out.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.040
I mean, I'm really
quite confident

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.250
that any difficult
problem that I

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:16.770
can imagine in the universe
of information in the future,

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.280
there is a technical
solution for.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.590
And one of the things
that is really on me

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:24.560
and most people who think about
these issues at a larger scale

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.960
is to formulate those
challenges in a way that

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.300
actually make them actionable.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.630
I won't say programmable,
but at least understandable.

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.360
How do we actually
develop, let's call it,

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.360
a program to sort through that?

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.700
We're actually still stuck
in this library model

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.750
that we fix a version
to a physical object.

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:46.040
And that's a very sloppy
way of actually saying

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.770
that we take one version.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:52.610
In the old days, the
libraries of record

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.080
would collect one copy
of a newspaper every day.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.920
And there was something the
New York Times produced called

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.380
the official copy of the day.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.770
This problem disappeared
during the first Iraq War,

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:10.720
when CNN became something
that was updating news 24/7.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.490
Television audio,
television archivists

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.570
have known this problem from
the beginning of archival time,

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.430
actually.

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.410
They have developed
things, kinds of sampling.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.810
So we have a lot to learn about
sampling of real time data.

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:27.317
I also think that's an issue
that the GIS communities

00:45:27.317 --> 00:45:28.150
thought a lot about.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.110
We have a lot of real
time data, and not

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.910
just from satellite data but
about water, sewage, and things

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:38.530
like that, all of which is in
these very dynamic systems,

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.844
geographic information systems.

00:45:40.844 --> 00:45:42.760
They also need to think
about intelligent ways

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.926
of sampling the information.

00:45:43.926 --> 00:45:45.980
They don't want to keep it all.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.650
Astronomers,
unfortunately, also face

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.157
this problem, because every
day is a new day in space.

00:45:52.157 --> 00:45:53.490
Every day is a new day in space.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.240
It's history.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:00.090
As to what BitTorrent
and individual action

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:04.510
has to do with this, I expanded
the problem to a larger one,

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:08.019
but to get back to
individuals, I just

00:46:08.019 --> 00:46:10.560
want to say that when we were
working on the National Science

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.330
Foundation Blue
Ribbon Task Force

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:16.910
on the economics of
digital archiving,

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:21.040
economists were really
frustrated, because we,

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.440
the historians and
archivists and librarians,

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.670
couldn't concretize for
them what the long term

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.790
value of information was.

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:31.050
And it was very hard
for them to come up

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.560
with an economic model for
this in the capitalist market

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.200
system.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:41.340
They had to rely on public
goods models, which are greatly

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.570
disadvantaged in this
country right now.

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:46.020
And the best we
could come up with

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.560
was these partnerships
between private companies

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.470
that control a
lot of information

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.890
and public institutions
for the long term.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:56.140
I point to the Internet
Archive as an example.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.490
Unfortunately, it's
one of the few examples

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:03.270
of a scalable archive that is
open to the public in general,

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.960
not just to researchers in
a research library world.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.950
But I think that all I can
offer is the short term

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:15.860
solution, which is to
keep as much as possible,

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.890
and to identify what
is valuable for you,

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:23.730
and make it clear that
we need to develop,

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:28.260
need to be developing now,
computer intelligence that

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.670
will be able to
dedupe, that is get

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:34.265
rid of duplicate information
the way librarians

00:47:34.265 --> 00:47:36.390
and archivists actually
get rid of duplicate copies

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:37.690
in their collections.

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:39.280
I mean, all of the
practices there

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.900
are now from the
archival world need

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.190
to be ported into
the digital world.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:47.670
I actually don't think that
will be that challenging.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:49.760
The challenging part is
the human engineering.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.270
So how do you get people
from old memory institutions

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.980
and that model to sit down
with people from a new world,

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.110
make them aware of the
problem, get them interested,

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.340
and then come up with
shared solutions?

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.554
I've spent much of
the past 20 years

00:48:04.554 --> 00:48:06.220
in rooms with people
who've been talking

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:08.250
past each other
about this issue.

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.990
And I'm very hopeful
that it's not going

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.300
to be an issue for much longer.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:17.830
I will say as an addendum, and
it's a very important addendum,

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:21.070
a lot of the things which are
a stopping progress right now,

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.417
regrettably, have nothing
to do with either technology

00:48:23.417 --> 00:48:25.000
or concept, and they
have purely to do

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.070
with political
information policy.

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:32.210
So we really have issues
around privacy and security

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:34.370
about copyright
ownership and access

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.780
of data, issues
that are unresolved,

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:37.930
haven't gone to court.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:39.500
They're not updated.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.790
The copyright law hasn't really
been appropriately updated

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.200
for the digital age.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:48.550
And until we solve
those policy issues,

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.210
we're just going to be stopped
dead in our tracks, actually.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.860
Once we solve those, I
think a lot of these issues

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.900
will actually-- I won't say
they'll solve themselves,

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:01.080
but the explosion in innovation
in digital practice, people

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.550
feeling free because
they now know

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:05.640
what rights they have
in their own data

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.380
and the responsibilities
that they have

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.399
to take care of their
data, because no one else

00:49:09.399 --> 00:49:10.940
is going to take
care of it for them,

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.820
this is really going
to be a huge change.

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:17.560
And I think people who are
in their 20s and 30s who

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.940
understand the issue
now will be living

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.940
through an extraordinary
period of creativity

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.150
in another decade, as they
themselves apply themselves

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:28.230
to solving some
of these problems.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:30.230
That doesn't really answer
all of your question,

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:33.627
but it points to a direction.

00:49:33.627 --> 00:49:34.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:36.770
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:40.310
So it seems like for the
bulk of human history,

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:43.400
knowledge was passed on
through oral tradition

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.260
and watching people do stuff
and learning from example.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.370
And then we started
writing things down.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:51.980
And we did that for
a few millennia.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:55.470
And now we don't write it down.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:56.690
We type it in.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:01.070
And so it exists
more ephemerally.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:03.130
A bit similar to
the oral tradition,

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:05.680
except it's now,
instead of being stored

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.220
in a human mind, which lasts
only a few decades, it's stored

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.920
in computer systems, which can
last as long as we really want

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.110
them to, as long as we care
to maintain it, and migrate

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:18.660
the formats and so forth.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:22.650
So it seems like a third age
is being entered at this point.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:25.170
And you know, I
just wonder what we

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:29.330
can learn from the previous
two to keep that going.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:32.950
Or how many of the rules
that worked in the second age

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:35.624
need to apply in the
third age, so to speak?

00:50:35.624 --> 00:50:37.540
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: It's
an excellent question,

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.414
and I agree with you.

00:50:38.414 --> 00:50:40.900
It is a fundamentally
different age.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:44.430
And I certainly know
about anthropologists

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:47.630
and paleontologists who
believe, in fact, we're

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.540
becoming a totally
different kind of animal

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.710
because of this technology
and the way that we cooperate.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.640
I am very fond of this
image, in particular,

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.240
because I think of this as
the first concrete evidence,

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.700
no pun intended, that humans are
distinct because, in fact, they

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.030
did figure out how
to cheat death.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.210
I really don't know
whether they decided

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:08.300
to invent writing that
outlived to them when

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.940
they began to realize that
they were mortal or vice versa.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.020
But it is through our
culture, and especially

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.870
our concrete, concretized
physical culture,

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.900
that we are capable
of cheating death.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:27.410
And that's a major investment
that we need to keep going.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:32.160
We are returning to many of
the most wonderful aspects

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:40.130
of oral culture, including the
sharing and the sociability

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:44.320
of the most social
animals on the planet

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.610
that was lost to a large
extent in the writing world.

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:49.740
Writing is vaunted
now-- or a book

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.380
I should say-- it's
vaunted as having

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:55.530
a very singular and solitary
experience, which is true.

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:57.450
But it's actually
not solitary at all.

00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.811
You're reading the book.

00:51:58.811 --> 00:52:00.810
The person who wrote the
book is talking to you,

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:03.070
and everybody who ever
read the book in some ways

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:04.780
is in on that conversation.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.090
And everyone that author
ever read to produce the book

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.050
is also in on that.

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:13.200
The question, I think,
is one for oral culture,

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:17.250
it was always limited
by physical proximity

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:19.840
to the person who
had the memory.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.440
In artifactual culture,
our access to that culture

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.380
was always limited
by physical access

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.920
to that physical artifact.

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:35.830
Now, our oral conversation
or our virtual conversation

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.450
is limited by our
access to this.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:39.871
I'm holding up a phone.

00:52:39.871 --> 00:52:41.870
And there have been these
wonderful experiments.

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:47.060
I'm sure many of you have read
about the experiment performed,

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.510
and the results were what
they called the Google

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:53.670
effects of memory, that people
have an emotional reaction

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:58.270
to being separated from this,
which is neurologically very

00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:59.830
similar to the
emotional reaction

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:01.812
they have being separated
from a family member.

00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:03.270
If they need a
piece of information

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:06.330
that their mom knows,
and mom's not around,

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:08.520
that's the same
kind of reaction.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.010
So people, I think, are
being able to, in a way, move

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:16.290
to a third kind of
mental instantiation

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:20.540
of human connections in
this very miniature form.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.980
And we know that it's
rewiring the brain, which

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.880
is not a bad thing.

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.730
It just it's a fact.

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.010
It's rewiring, and where
we pay attention to

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:32.490
and how we receive information.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.250
But again, the
question is, how do we

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:39.530
transmit what is
valuable across cultures,

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.580
like the oral tradition did,
without the filters that

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.020
are yet built in, the filter
either a physical proximity

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.570
to the source or
physical proximity

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:49.767
to the artifact itself?

00:53:49.767 --> 00:53:52.100
And you have something which
is ubiquitous and everybody

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:56.090
has, how do you learn how to pay
attention to which conversation

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:58.240
to have?

00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.950
So that's, I think, a challenge.

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:02.630
I mean, I can't quite
conceptualize how that is.

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:04.974
And I hope other people
can conceptualize it,

00:54:04.974 --> 00:54:06.390
because it is,
actually, something

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:11.749
that makes us, in a way,
fundamentally different.

00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:13.540
And this really is a
very interesting point

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:16.060
of inflection in our time.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:20.100
I think about the answer
to the general question

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.270
that you posed is something
that as an historian,

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:25.000
I can just stand back
and say, well, you

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.166
know we're not going to
know this is the answer that

00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:30.430
for at least several decades.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:32.620
And I say that as an
historian because, I mean, I

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.090
spend a chapter in the
book talking about one

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:36.820
of the first printed
natives, a man

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.830
called Michel de Montaigne, who
invented the personal essay,

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:43.130
for example, a very famous
book that is still in print

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:45.260
and read today and
widely imitated.

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.090
But he was among the first
of the print natives.

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:53.910
And what people who grew up with
the manuscript culture assumed

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:55.800
was going to happen
with print was not

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.100
at all what actually turned
out to be that the case,

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.840
and that what was
native to Montaigne

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.590
turned out to be
something completely new.

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:06.360
I mean, they were new writers,
like Montaigne, new genres,

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.270
new audiences,
completely new topics,

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:13.370
and also a new-- what can I say?

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:15.950
Engendered the most
amazing kind of curiosity

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:19.290
in people that had never
been awakened before,

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:22.020
because there wasn't access
to this kind of information.

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.580
So there's this kind of
feedback loop of providing

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:29.960
the information, and it
engenders a sort of curiosity

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.790
that leads to the pursuit
of more information.

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:35.740
One of the things that
I think will evolve,

00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:38.200
which is a return
to oral culture,

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:44.400
is that with this sharpening of
our pursuit of curiosity, which

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.470
is basically-- there
are no barriers

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:48.810
to the pursuit of our
curiosity if we're always

00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:52.590
online-- is that we will
return to this glorious state

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:56.030
of pursuing knowledge basically
for aesthetic reasons.

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:58.710
And when I say aesthetic,
I mean for its own sake,

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:00.350
not because we want
to build a tool

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:03.400
or want to do something
that really makes

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.070
a huge difference in the world,
but simply for its own sake

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:07.260
itself.

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:11.410
And that, again, this is
what history tells us.

00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:15.014
That, actually, is a question
of profound morality.

00:56:15.014 --> 00:56:16.680
And this just gets
back to what Socrates

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:21.470
was saying and Thomas Jefferson
said as well, that pursuit

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.780
of knowledge for its own sake
as opposed to just to create

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.170
a tool, or even to
create progress,

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:30.640
is the beginning of morality and
the beginning of understanding,

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.489
not just how to find the
information that you want

00:56:33.489 --> 00:56:35.030
but ultimately to
take responsibility

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:36.466
for how it's used.

00:56:36.466 --> 00:56:38.340
And so that's, I think,
a development of that

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.400
was well known in oral culture.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.920
There were etiquettes
about that,

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.380
mores around responsibility
for information,

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.410
what you do with it.

00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:50.291
And in the print culture and
now online, it's a free for all.

00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:52.790
And that's why I was saying,
it's not really until, I think,

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:57.110
we have the kind of policies
and mutual understandings

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:01.080
about how I treat your
data and you treat my data

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.230
that we will actually
see a real flourishing

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:10.708
of that aspect of oral culture,
which is purely fun and gaming.

00:57:10.708 --> 00:57:13.630
AUDIENCE: I have a couple
of quick questions.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.740
So one thing is, I
mean, we may find a way

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.280
to preserve things and select
which things to preserve.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.696
How do we actually ensure
that what people in-- I

00:57:22.696 --> 00:57:25.350
don't know-- 10,000 years
will be able to read that,

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:26.330
understand that?

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:29.070
I mean, you have the
example of Linear B.

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:31.170
There's a lot of preserved
Linear B tablets.

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:33.339
We have no idea what
they're saying to us.

00:57:33.339 --> 00:57:34.380
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: Right.

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:38.920
Just as we had no idea what
those cuneiform said until some

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.760
really curious people decided
they would figure that one out.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:44.040
The truth is, we don't know.

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.570
And really, this is
one of the models

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.370
that we need to shake
off from the print world

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.470
and from this world of
well, we put it in print.

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:54.490
We put that book in
storage to keep it safe.

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:58.150
We can read it in 5,000
years or 10,000 years.

00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:01.255
No, I think the new model is
that we keep information alive.

00:58:01.255 --> 00:58:02.630
And so rather than
thinking about

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:06.104
whether we can read it in
5,000 years or 50 years,

00:58:06.104 --> 00:58:08.520
I think we ought to focus on
keeping it alive and readable

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.080
five years out, and then
renewing it, doing another five

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:12.580
years.

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.913
AUDIENCE: But that's what
they were doing in Alexandria.

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:19.820
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: Yeah,
and Alexandria, I mean,

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:21.319
I'm not sure what
the connection is,

00:58:21.319 --> 00:58:23.690
but they never had an
intentional Alexandria

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:26.835
of creating this information
for that long a period of time.

00:58:26.835 --> 00:58:28.210
AUDIENCE: I mean,
what I'm saying

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.584
is they were trying to preserve
the information that they

00:58:30.584 --> 00:58:34.120
had about their
world, the best job.

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:34.704
You may have--

00:58:34.704 --> 00:58:36.036
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: Yeah, I know.

00:58:36.036 --> 00:58:36.750
You're right.

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:38.250
AUDIENCE: You may
have the intention

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:41.140
to do the best job that you
can, but that doesn't guarantee

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:42.707
that it will actually survive.

00:58:42.707 --> 00:58:43.790
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: Oh, no.

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:44.420
Absolutely.

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:48.550
I mean, if the business of
creating knowledge is basically

00:58:48.550 --> 00:58:50.920
out of fashion or some
religion or ideology

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:52.900
tells you that
it's not good, when

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.200
you force a monoculture
on somebody,

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.950
then that knowledge
itself will disappear.

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:58.366
And there is nothing
we can do now

00:58:58.366 --> 00:59:00.120
to guarantee that
it won't happen.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.410
But the only thing we
can do is make sure

00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:03.076
that it survives to
the next generation,

00:59:03.076 --> 00:59:04.980
and that we inculcate
in the generation

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.780
the value of keeping it alive.

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:07.460
But no.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.570
No, there's no guarantee.

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:10.111
AUDIENCE: But we do
have many models.

00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:12.090
I mean, he mentioned--
the previous questioner

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:13.570
mentioned peer-to-peer, right?

00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:18.770
So even if a monoculture appears
in one part of the world,

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:22.720
if you make multiple
copies, one will survive.

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.044
But in 10,000 years
time, I mean, who knows?

00:59:25.044 --> 00:59:26.460
I mean, there's a
lot of problems.

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.780
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: In
theory, multiple copies

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.040
keep things safe.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.290
But that's only as long as
people care about the past,

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:35.030
or actually about the future.

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.696
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:59:35.696 --> 00:59:36.900
That's why we have you here.

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.600
And the other
question that I had,

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:42.760
for technology companies
specifically, like the Googles,

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:46.350
the Facebooks, the people
who have lots of information

00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:51.670
in, so to speak, walled gardens,
what would be your top three

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:53.740
recommendations?

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:58.270
We talked before this talk about
how I'm doing my backups now

00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:02.570
of all sorts of things into
Google Photos, where it doesn't

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:05.250
cost me anything, and I'm
uploading miniDV tapes

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.540
from the 2000s.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.210
I mean, would it
be useful for users

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:14.890
to have a specific
archive this button?

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:18.980
A tag, if you will, to tell
everybody else in society,

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:22.280
I think this is
worth preserving?

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.680
The Library of
Congress may not agree,

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.070
but it is a signal
that an individual,

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:31.037
that a citizen could give,
hey, I think this is worthy.

01:00:31.037 --> 01:00:33.120
ABBY SMITH RUMSEY: Yeah,
that is a very good idea,

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.250
and it's been
proposed many times

01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:38.970
in libraries, who are trying
to figure out what to collect.

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:41.610
I think the Internet Archive
is actually such a thing.

01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:47.430
It's practically trivial
to actually upload things

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:48.750
to the Archive.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.980
But more to the
point, or at least

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.580
answer the question,
what is it that companies

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:57.470
that hold a lot of information
assets close to the chest,

01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:58.325
shall we say?

01:00:58.325 --> 01:01:00.200
There are a couple things
that the rest of us

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.500
are hoping that you will do.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.310
And it's not just
technology companies.

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:06.120
It's also the military,
which has solved innumerable

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.413
digital preservation problems,
which, I have to assume,

01:01:09.413 --> 01:01:10.246
they're not sharing.

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:16.720
First of all, make it abundantly
clear to the people who

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.080
use your products that-- and
I go into this in the book--

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.730
that the services
you provide that are

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:28.490
free at the point of transaction
are actually not free.

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:31.020
And I think many
people know that now,

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.117
but I think we all need
to raise our children

01:01:33.117 --> 01:01:34.700
and tell each other,
remind each other

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.010
that even emails that are
used, Gmail because it's free,

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:40.240
isn't actually free.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.760
I mean, it's not necessarily.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.830
it's not totally
mine to control.

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:49.109
So I do my own backup.

01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.650
I'm a writer.

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.820
I backup every day.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:56.940
I also backup on lossy
at a second home.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.700
It's also in the
earthquake zone.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.870
And then I keep some
things on the cloud.

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:04.880
But for the things that
are truly important,

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.180
I print some things out.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.730
I mean, I think everybody will
have their own way of ensuring

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:10.440
what's valuable for them.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.420
But in terms of the
big companies that

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.790
are building this
digital universe,

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:19.310
I've always been convinced
that, like the military, certain

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:24.104
companies like Google and
Apple and Sony Pictures,

01:02:24.104 --> 01:02:25.520
they invest a huge
amount of money

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.790
in keeping those assets alive,
because they're profitable.

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:31.460
The day that Sony Pictures
decides that these films

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.380
or whatever it is
not profitable,

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.480
they shouldn't just
unplug the server.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.650
They should actually
hand off those assets,

01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:42.110
which are now cultural assets
and not economic assets,

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:44.320
to a not-for-profit or
some organization which

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.550
will preserve it for
future generations,

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:47.850
present and future generations.

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:51.690
Those handoffs are
very hard to craft.

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.610
Twitter has one with a
the Library of Congress

01:02:54.610 --> 01:02:57.240
now, which is quite wonderful.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.110
But I think that Google
and other companies

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:03.510
can be doing far more controlled
experiments in how we actually

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:07.540
identify a block of
cultural information, which

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:10.740
may lose its economic
interest, economic value.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.050
And how do we move that
into the not-for-profit,

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:16.897
the public sector
for its eternal life.

01:03:16.897 --> 01:03:17.730
Thank you very much.

01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:18.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:21.560
