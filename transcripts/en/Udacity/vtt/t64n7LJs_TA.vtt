00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.790
So far we've been making games that only
display one logical thing to the user.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.450
But real games have lots of
different sorts of stuff to display.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.090
There's the game world itself, but
you might also have menus, settings,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.360
inventory screens, and so on.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.230
You could accomplish this by putting
switch statements everywhere, but

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.830
there's a better way.

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:24.130
Libgdx provides a screen protocol and

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.360
an implementation of application
listener called game, which delegates

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.500
all the application listener callbacks
to an implementation of screen.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.170
Then to change from
the game world to a menu,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.290
you just have to call
set screen on your game.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.790
Let's check it out.
