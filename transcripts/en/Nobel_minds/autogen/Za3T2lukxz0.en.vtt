results of cosmological research imply

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
results of cosmological research imply
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.470
results of cosmological research imply
any constraints on the progress of

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480
any constraints on the progress of
 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.690
any constraints on the progress of
particle physics in the future and I

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
particle physics in the future and I
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.859
particle physics in the future and I
think the answer is not yet we that have

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869
think the answer is not yet we that have
 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.540
think the answer is not yet we that have
measured the properties of the Big Bang

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
measured the properties of the Big Bang
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.090
measured the properties of the Big Bang
material have a few mysteries that are

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100
material have a few mysteries that are
 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.400
material have a few mysteries that are
open and we hope that future particle

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410
open and we hope that future particle
 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.500
open and we hope that future particle
physics results will help us explain

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
physics results will help us explain
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.990
physics results will help us explain
them we think that we're supporting the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
them we think that we're supporting the
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240
them we think that we're supporting the
inflationary theory of the Big Bang and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
inflationary theory of the Big Bang and
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.680
inflationary theory of the Big Bang and
we hope to learn a little bit more about

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690
we hope to learn a little bit more about
 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.470
we hope to learn a little bit more about
the Big Bang eventually particle physics

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
the Big Bang eventually particle physics
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.230
the Big Bang eventually particle physics
we hope will explain quantum gravity and

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240
we hope will explain quantum gravity and
 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.510
we hope will explain quantum gravity and
why the Big Bang material did what it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
why the Big Bang material did what it
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.830
why the Big Bang material did what it
did so far this is a hope it's not

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840
did so far this is a hope it's not
 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.330
did so far this is a hope it's not
obviously something that particle

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
obviously something that particle
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040
obviously something that particle
physics will be called on to explain

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
physics will be called on to explain
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319
physics will be called on to explain
when we ever get to the place where we

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
when we ever get to the place where we
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.790
when we ever get to the place where we
think that we have a theory of all the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
think that we have a theory of all the
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010
think that we have a theory of all the
particles it will have to understand and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
particles it will have to understand and
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.470
particles it will have to understand and
explain the Big Bang can this happen I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
explain the Big Bang can this happen I
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.790
explain the Big Bang can this happen I
don't know but we're certainly hoping

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
don't know but we're certainly hoping
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130
don't know but we're certainly hoping
for it
