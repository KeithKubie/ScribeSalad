00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.570
Today we'll discuss logic. Logic is a formal language that allows us to

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.540
make assertions about the world in a very precise way.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.350
We learn about logic both because it is an important topic and

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.810
also because it forms the basis of additional topics such as planning.

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:22.700
We'll start talking about a formal notation for writing sentences in logic.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.885
This formal notation will have things like conjunctions and

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:29.540
disjunctions. Then we'll talk about truth tables, a topic that you probably

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.591
already know. We'll talk about rules of inferences like modus ponens and

00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:39.530
modus tollens. Finally we'll discuss methods for proving theories [UNKNOWN]

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.520
by repetition. One of those methods is called, resolution theorem proving.
