00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, this was an easy one. No problems.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I don't want to only be able to tell time at night under special instances

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
when the moons are passing behind the planet.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Furthermore, telescopes are going to be almost impossible to use on the ship

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
as it bounces around on our waist.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is going to wind up being the biggest problem, that telescopes are so hard to use on a ship.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So Galileo actually invented something that he thought would help adjust this problem.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What he invented was this ridiculous contraption called the celatone which you can see here

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the black and red and it's basically just a helmet where one eye had the telescope over it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and the other eye was just an open hole, and the idea was you could sight and find the idea

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
for where Jupiter was through this hole and then what he's doing then in focus

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and watch the transit of the moons through the telescope.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
As you can maybe imagine this didn't work so well.
