00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.310
It's the next day and we're back in our last video

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.870
We took the silicon pokeball molds and melted down candles and filled them up with Wax

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.120
[I] tried a couple of different [methods] for melting down the  wax one method was just putting it in a pot and letting it slowly

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.949
Melt but I found a much faster way is just to stick it in the microwave for about three or four minutes this whole thing

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.209
Would go completely liquid with virtually no effort at all and at that point could just pour it in now

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.720
I let these sit overnight and the interesting thing about wax is as it cools

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.029
it actually shrinks so I had to come back multiple times throughout the evening and top it up with Wax and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.209
Hopefully, we got a nice solid wax casting now. I say

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.829
Let's start with the red one. [I] didn't do a very good job pouring this I spilled all [over] the place

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.179
I was hoping that this would just dry off to the point where we could just peel it up and off the counter and it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.680
looks like that's going to be the case now all we need to do is take our little acrylic sleeve here and

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.789
Pop that off the mold

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.849
I'm just going to push around the edges here to kind of

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.909
Crack that wax and then we'll see if we can just peel it away. I'm really curious to know what this looks like

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.199
It's really amazing how well that Seals back together?

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.569
Okay, there. We have it. There's our wax pokeball

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.600
Some areas look absolutely fantastic

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.989
Other areas look a little bit popped and bubbled it might be enough to work with though anyway

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.489
There's our red cast let's see. How the blue one turned out now with a blue one

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.769
I actually poured in a little bit of extra wax on the top

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.000
Because I was hoping that as it shrunk it would suck that in but instead

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.700
I think

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.780
the top

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.750
Solidified before the bottom did if you look down here near the bottom of the mold you can see it's really smooth and really clean

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.999
But as we get closer to the top where the air bubbles would have got trapped [it] starts to get [very] contaminated with pockets from

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.519
The Air Bubbles and you can clearly see how that translates into the casting as well so air bubbles are our number one enemy

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.710
when it comes to casting

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.009
The front of the ball came out looking really good though

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.719
And the top of the ball is super smooth because there weren't any bubbles there that would have been on the bottom of the mold

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.649
So all the bubbles who have traveled upward and that came out looking pretty clean pretty nice

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.879
I cut two more pieces of five-inch acrylic tubing and glued them to the space here

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.843
And then I took a

00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:04.750
couple of wooden

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.720
Dowels and glued them to the basis of our pokeballs what I was hoping to do with these was make some kind of a mold

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.770
Say out of plaster

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.149
And then we could melt the wax out which would leave a cavity that we could perhaps turn into aluminum now

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.580
I don't expect it's going to be perfect, but I think it will be fun, so let's try that next

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.000
[oh]

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.200
[my] ball this came off [dang it] no

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.760
Once the plaster is hardened

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.680
we should be able to take it out and put it in the oven to bake out the wax which will hopefully leave a

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.090
Pokeball cavity that we can fill with Molten aluminum, but in the meantime, we still have some of our leftover gummy chicken

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.119
So what if we tried melting that down and filling up our molds with that as well? Oh yeah there we go. Good stuff

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.260
[melts] down pretty quickly doesn't it?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.120
It's been about an hour. Let's take a look at those plaster molds and see if they're ready to come out

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.149
So the wood dolls did actually stay down because the wax balls that floated up. That's a bummer

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.720
There we go. [I] sure wouldn't plug. It's your wax ball still in there very nice, okay

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.089
We got our plaster of Paris out of the molds now

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.220
And they've got these holes here exposing the wax the idea is if [we] stick them in the oven upside down

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.279
we should [be] able to melt the wax and collect it down here this should leave a cavity of a pokeball mold inside which we

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.220
May be able to fill up with aluminum who knows we're about to find out right?

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.620
So just to recap what [happened] today

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.500
we took Wax

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.720
PokÃ©balls we solidified them in a mixture of plaster of Paris and sand and then we put those

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.899
Castings in the oven to melt the wax and leave a cavity that we can pour mold aluminum into with any luck though that's left

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.640
the perfect [Pokeball] cavity in there

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.330
I mean

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.600
It's perfect as we can get it

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.169
The idea is if we can cook out most of the gases from the plaster today, then if we pour Molten aluminum tomorrow

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.279
We'll have a better chance at getting a good cast and as for our gummy and chocolate pokeballs

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.690
I'm going to leave those in the fridge overnight

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.359
And we'll open those up and see how they turned out tomorrow as well

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.290
The other benefit [to] heating these things up in the oven is it's going to make these molds warm

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.220
So when we pour our aluminum?

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.489
Casting it's not going to have to warm it up so will our plaster molds work will our Molten aluminum

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.870
Actually form a solid aluminum, pokeball you're gonna have to find out in the [next] video, so in the meantime

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.620
Thanks for joining me [for] this experiment. I'll be looking for you in [the] next one talk to you then!
