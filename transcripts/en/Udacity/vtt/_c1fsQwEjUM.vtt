Now there are three distinct memory systems. Each involve different things to

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.455
remember. First, we learn to do things such as implicit procedures. This is the

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:12.253
procedural memory. The output for this type of memory mainly goes to the

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:17.425
Cerebellum and Striatum. When we experience emotional events. The output mainly

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:21.336
goes to the amygdala. When we consciously and explicitly remember a personal

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:26.043
event, or if we're trying to recall an answer, for say an essay exam. The

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:30.478
output goes to the hippocampus, which is just the first part of the process.

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:35.066
Then, these long-term memories get sent to various parts of the cortex for

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:40.429
long-term storage. So remember, elicit and procedural memory is involved in the

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:45.114
cerebellum and striatum. The Amygdala is involved in emotional memories, and

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:49.954
the Hippocampus is important for explicit and declarative type memories.
