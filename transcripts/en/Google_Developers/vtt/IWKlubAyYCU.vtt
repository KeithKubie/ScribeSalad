SAMEER IYENGAR: Beautylish is
a virtual makeup counter.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.130
We have a huge community of
people sharing looks,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.720
tutorials, and reviews to help
each other find products and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.410
brands that would work
really well for them.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.320
Our Sign-In integration helps
personalize the experience for

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.080
new users by finding people's
friends from their Circles who

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.810
are already on Beautylish and
then using that information to

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.140
recommend them content
that they might like.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.460

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.520
discovery by location.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.870
We're using Google+ profile data
to create Banjo profiles

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.800
so we don't have to recreate
the wheel.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.855
Google+ Sign-In integration
was really easy.

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.330
It just took about a day, and
already we could share amazing

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.720
content, connecting with people
in our Google+ Circles.
