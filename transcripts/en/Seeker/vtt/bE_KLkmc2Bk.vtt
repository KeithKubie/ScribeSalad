00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:05.125
Does having kids REALLY make us happier?

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:08.795
Or is that just a filthy, filthy lie?!

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:15.615
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and is there
anything in the world that’s better than

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.535
the promise of a new child?

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:22.935
Hourly feedings, midnight crying fits, cleaning
out vomit and feces from all of your clothes….

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.474
it truly is a magical time.

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:26.804
Just kidding - it’s terrible.

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:30.375
But we do it anyway, in hopes that our kids
will grow up to be productive human beings

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.665
who will someday do all of that stuff for
us when we get old.

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:35.485
Among other reasons, of course.

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:38.785
Some people have kids because they feel like
they should - others do it ‘cause they feel

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:42.834
like it’ll bring them boundless joy that
no other source could possibly provide.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:47.795
But when you really look at it in retrospect,
you wonder - DOES having kids actually make

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:48.795
us happier?

00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:52.865
That’s the question posed in a new study
published this week in the journal Demography.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.395
And the answer - is yes.

00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:56.904
But only for some of us.

00:00:56.904 --> 00:00:58.625
And only up to a point.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:03.724
According to this research, parents’ happiness
tends to increase in the year before and after

00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:05.195
their first child is born.

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:09.444
But after that point, their happiness quickly
decreases and returns to the same level is

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:10.554
was pre-child.

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:15.105
Second children also follow a similar pattern,
but peak happiness levels only reach about

00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:17.444
half of what they were for the parents’
first child.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.874
And if you decide to have a third one, the
difference in happiness from doing so - is

00:01:20.874 --> 00:01:21.874
pretty much negligible.

00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:26.334
Of course, that’s not to say that having
a third child isn’t a joyous experience.

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:30.215
But researchers believe it could just be a
product of parenthood becoming less novel

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.534
and exciting by that time.

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:35.645
Or maybe it’s all the extra pressure that
having three kids puts on your resources.

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:40.124
It’s also possible that an unplanned pregnancy
becomes more likely, the more children you

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:43.245
have - which brings its own share of stresses
to the table.

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:46.815
What’s interesting, is that this study found
that when it comes to having children,

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.514
women tend to experience more happiness than
men.

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:54.315
But they also have steeper drop-offs during
the year AFTER their child is born.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:58.135
After a few years, those happiness levels
taper off - and men and women become pretty

00:01:58.135 --> 00:01:59.135
much the same.

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:02.315
But there are a few other factors that also
influence this.

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:07.305
Parents who are more educated, and older - between
the ages of 35 and 49 - are shown to have

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:11.974
the most positive response to their first
child, and they tend to stay happier for longer,

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:13.254
once that child is born.

00:02:13.254 --> 00:02:19.094
By comparison, teen parents actually experience
a decline in happiness, both before and after

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:20.425
the birth of their child.

00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:24.264
And researchers believe this could be at least
part of the reason, adults are now choosing

00:02:24.264 --> 00:02:27.064
to postpone having children until later in
life.

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:28.725
What do you guys think about this?

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:32.575
And if you have children - how did your happiness
compare to what you thought it would be?

00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:34.585
