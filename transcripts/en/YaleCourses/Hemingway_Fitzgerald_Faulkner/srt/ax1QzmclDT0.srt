1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,380
So I'm going to get started on,
um,

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,130
as I lay dying. And, uh, as
with the sound of the fury, um,

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,090
there's, uh, very, um, uh,
kind of long genealogy, uh,

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,890
behind the title of the novel.
Once again,

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,330
there's a very learned
illusion, uh, behind the title,

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,290
and it doesn't go back to the Beth.
This time it goes back,

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,520
actually goes back farther. It
goes back to the Odyssey. Um,

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,570
and you guys might remember
said in book 11 of the Odyssey,

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,120
um,

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,020
bill ducs goes down to the
underworld and he sees all the,

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,650
he sees his mother,
uh,

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,700
but he also sees all the illustrators
dead from the Trojan war and amount of

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,630
debt that he talks to
his Agamemnon. And, uh,

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,610
we know that the mammo was killed when
he got back from the Trojan war. Um,

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,690
and so they see as ones to find out the
circumstances of his death and Mammo and

16
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,730
says, as I laid w
obviously translation, um,

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,570
as I lay dying the woman with the dogs,

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,280
I would not close my eyes
as I descended into hades.

19
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,210
Um, so it, um, there's no, um,

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,440
that's, that's a very good,
uh, record within the APIC.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,330
It is also picked up in various Greek
tragedies because that's one of the

22
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,940
central tragedies, um, in, in
the classical world is, uh,

23
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,300
the killing of Agamemnon,
uh, bias, wife's lover.

24
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,850
But there's a long story behind dad's,
um,

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,960
the reason that Chitin Nestra and I
want you to remember that name because

26
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:56,730
Kaiser Nestor will come up again,
um, in light in August as a very,

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,510
um, no, actually, sorry, she
doesn't come up in later in August,

28
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:03,810
she comes up in another novel.
I'm in absolute Absalon,

29
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,100
so it's a name that is very
important to Faulkner, but, uh,

30
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,880
within the confines of
a, as I lay dying, uh,

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,120
Clyde nest or Ashley didn't just
want to kill her husband, you know,

32
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,860
to have an affair with producers.

33
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,160
She was actually a seeking revenge
for the killing of her daughter.

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,940
Ivision I, uh, uh, when the, uh, the,

35
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,090
the Greek ships were not able to
sell because there was a dead calm.

36
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,080
And so if should,

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,950
I was sacrificed by Agamemnon
in order to get them going.

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,660
Um, and she knows that
grievance for 10 years. Uh,

39
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,180
and so when Agamemnon comes home,
um,

40
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,460
he was with his mistress,
Cassandra from tri. Um,

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,270
he was killed by adjusters
with, uh, Chitum Nesta,

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,800
egging him on. So this is the, in many
ways, the sort of defining moment,

43
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,260
the defining tragic moment
in the classical world. Um,

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,300
and then numerous representations of that,
um,

45
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,770
of adjusters killing Agamemnon
with Patten, Lester looking on.

46
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,310
Um, and this is a really
handy, um, identifications, uh,

47
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,530
illustration for us, all the names given
to us. So a cleanliness, Nesta is there.

48
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,020
It's just this is the one who actually
does the killing at a [inaudible]

49
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,180
electrode is his daughter and
she will bring her brother back.

50
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,250
Wrist is to kill. It just is. So,
it really is back and forth killing,

51
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,840
um, across many generations. And
Cassandra will in time. Well,

52
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:43,870
we actually right there, uh,
be killed by cattle Astra.

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,950
So lots of violence, lots
of hatred. And this is, um,

54
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,660
the defining feature
of the House of Atreus.

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,840
So it's very important for Faulkner to
be referring back to this ancient epic a

56
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,890
moment. Um, because he's obviously
talking about a family, uh,

57
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,320
were fairly complicated
emotional relationships, right?

58
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:13,310
Is a family that is not
entirely defined by love. Um,

59
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,760
you know, we would like
families to be defined by love,

60
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,380
but usually most families are a little
bit more complicated than this. Um,

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,000
and in this case, the house of
the abundance that the family,

62
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,250
um, is infinitely more complicated
than just being defined by love,

63
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,510
even though it's on the other
hand, the social spectrum. So, um,

64
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,310
let's keep that epic tradition in mind,

65
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,670
but I also want to just to highlight,
um,

66
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,500
the immediate chronology for
the writing of as I lay dying.

67
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,800
Um, it's a very, very pat chronology,

68
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,510
basically for six months,
um,

69
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,920
from the summer of 1929 to January,

70
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,840
1930, less than six months.
Really. Um, a lot of things happen.

71
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,460
So June 20th, a thought
never married, has, um,

72
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,760
childhood sweetheart.
It's all of them. Um,

73
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,740
and there was only two months
after her divorce from her husband,

74
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,300
Paul Franklin, um, ferry. You know,

75
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,000
when something like that happens,
you just wonder, you know,

76
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:29,780
what the aftermath would be.
Uh, what led up to it? Um,

77
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,070
so anyway, two months after that
is a very hasty marriage, uh,

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,210
in many ways unseemly marriage.
Um,

79
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,010
and she brought to the marriage
two children with Cornell,

80
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:46,240
Franklin, Malcolm, and Victoria. Um,

81
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,700
then October the seventh,
1929,

82
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,840
the sound and the fury was published.
Uh,

83
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:56,620
and the few weeks after that
was to stock market crash.

84
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,900
That in many ways was anticipated
by the Jayson section in the sound,

85
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,480
the theory, and the
day after that, I mean,

86
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:08,750
if that was still going on
because the 24th was a Thursday,

87
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,430
so Friday was actually the official day
of the stock market crashed on that very

88
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,610
day.
Faulkner started writing as I lay dying.

89
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,480
So we can think of a better,
uh,

90
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,760
novel occasion by the Great Depression,
um,

91
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,120
to have and have not as
his title analysis. Um,

92
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,240
it's very much a great depression novel,
but as ELL as I lay dying is as well.

93
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:36,470
So we have to keep that in
mind. Um, and it was finished,

94
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,050
uh, really fast, um, in just
a few weeks. January 12,

95
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,060
1930, uh, as Ali, Diane was finished.
And [inaudible] talks about it.

96
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:51,680
He makes it very emphatic point
about how fast it was done. Um,

97
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,330
so in an interview with
Marshall Sniff, um, 1931,

98
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,410
he said, God, a job rolling
coal in a power plan,

99
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,070
found the sound of the dye them have
very conducive to literature road.

100
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,350
As I lay dying in a coat bunker beside
the diagonal between the working spouse

101
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,070
on the night shift,
finished it in six weeks.

102
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,790
Never change the word.
If I ever got rich,

103
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,850
I'm going to buy a dynamo
and put it in my house.

104
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,900
I think that would make writing easier.
So don't even shake is always, you know,

105
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:30,290
you should never trust a
word Faulkner says. Um,

106
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,200
but I think that there's some things that,
um,

107
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,350
not to be disputed and not
to be a fabricator. Um,

108
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,060
and that was the fact that he was
working, um, in a power plant,

109
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,400
working night shifts.

110
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:47,401
So this is very different from the
Faulkner that we might've imagined just by

111
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,460
looking at his house.
Um,

112
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,770
and I'm going to show you a picture
of his house a little later,

113
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,130
but, um, it, um,

114
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,530
it looks like a very stately house,

115
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:08,130
but actually when sophomore
first bought the house, um,

116
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,790
it was decrepit and was deemed
unfit for human habitation. Um,

117
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,290
so he really was someone,

118
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:20,291
a writer who was writing his great novels
when he was working at a power plant,

119
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,470
doing nice shoes. Um, and that is
the world that he knew very well.

120
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:29,390
So his circumstances were actually not
that far and move from the circumstances

121
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:33,140
of the London family
poor ways, obviously. Um,

122
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:35,990
so this is a picture of the House,
um,

123
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,340
25 years after he brought it and we
can see that it actually still looks a

124
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:46,840
little too private. It's very,
it's very stately shaped, uh,

125
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,580
used to be afraid grant house. Um,
but it's unpainted. And then Ashley,

126
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:57,110
not afraid, you know, even 25
years he saw owning the house.

127
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,480
It was nice. Still not repair. Um,

128
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,200
so basically you spend the rest of his
life trying to fix up that house. Well,

129
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,080
we also see there is his wife Istyle.
Um,

130
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,640
and it turned out it was very good
marriage and his bite of the haze, um,

131
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,420
it lasts for the rest of his life.
Um,

132
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,210
and here's the picture of the
two of them side by side. Um,

133
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,000
and so it's kind of a unexpected,

134
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,710
the trajectory for that unseemly
marriage, uh, back in 1929.

135
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,353
Um,

136
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,390
and so that's the family situation and
is probably very complicated relation to

137
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:35,190
his two stepchildren.
Um,

138
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,970
Polly do and what exactly
what constitutes a family. Um,

139
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,810
those questions would have been
front and center for Faulkner. Um,

140
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,860
in 1929 when he was writing this novel
about families in general about generic

141
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,530
poor white family,
um,

142
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,380
since the depression was right
there in the middle of August,

143
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,270
I thought that I'll show you a very
iconic picture by Dorothea Lange.

144
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,870
Uh, my mother, uh, 1936.

145
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,170
This is an image this reproduced over
and over again as the defining image of

146
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:11,190
the Great Depression.
Um,

147
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,250
and it actually is quite different from
the spirit in which as I lay dying,

148
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,380
uh, was written. So, um,

149
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,730
I think that this represents one way
to think about the great depression,

150
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,780
but actually the way that Faulkner
things about the Great Depression,

151
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,380
I argue is closer. Um, to
another class at work about, uh,

152
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,930
the rural South James
Agee and Walker Evans, uh,

153
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,860
collaboration, um, is a text
with lots of photographs.

154
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,390
It's a collaboration between the two of
them called let us now praise famous men.

155
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,760
And I'll just show you a few pictures.
A Walker, Evans, uh, pictures of,

156
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,960
um, what it, how it feels
to be a poor white, um,

157
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,760
in also the same year as the
Dorothea Lange picture. 1936.

158
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,470
Um, so, you know,

159
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:05,700
this is a little later after Wagner of
Finnish has already finished as I lay

160
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:06,420
dying,

161
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,400
but this is what the house of a
share cropper would have looked like.

162
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:15,600
And I think, um, the common
estimate was that 80%,

163
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,540
maybe more than 80% of,

164
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,500
of farm laborers in the south were
sharecroppers. They didn't own the land.

165
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,030
Um, so this is the
interior of the house, uh,

166
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,980
of the poor whites and other,
and here in the bedroom.

167
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:37,260
Um, and I love this picture is
Ellie Mae, um, beautiful phase,

168
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,730
very proud and very sad and very resigned,
but not giving up.

169
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,500
And that's exactly my
image of addy. Um, and as,

170
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,470
um, poor white. So anyway,

171
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,510
that is the background too as I lay dying.
Um,

172
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,310
and I think that we just need to,

173
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,810
we you about two pages,

174
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,290
two or three pages into
the novel to see it.

175
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:08,291
This is another highly experimental novel
experimenting in Different Points of

176
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:10,000
views.

177
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,920
And this is really a dazzling
array of narrators. Um,

178
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,510
so in the first 18 chapters,
these are the narrators, um,

179
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,160
and nobody, nobody has to
keep track of them. Um,

180
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,050
just pick the ones that you can remember.
Uh,

181
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,010
but they also tend to have
three distinctive voices.

182
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:33,230
They actually are very easily
recognizable, so don't worry, um,

183
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,140
that in fact there's no danger that you
get them mixed up. Um, so in order to,

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,970
um, talk about, um, this very rich, um,

185
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,590
establish of, um, of,

186
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:49,120
of points of views and styles
of speaking and speaking voices.

187
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,810
Um,

188
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,810
I thought I'll introduce to other
critics or theories about the novel Obama

189
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,700
Narrative in general, actually not
just about the novel because, um,

190
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,840
narrative goes much further back
than, um, than the novel. So the epic,

191
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,510
the Odyssey would be one kind
of ancient narrative. Um,

192
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,050
although Bactine very celebrated
Russian theories of the novel,

193
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,730
um, doesn't like the epic
are that much things.

194
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,310
The novel is really the greatest thing
replacing the APIC. Um, but in any case,

195
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:26,311
that's what he says about the novel and
what makes the novel so great is that

196
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,080
even though there's this illusion
when we just see words on the page and

197
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:33,430
everything seems unified,

198
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:39,030
that the novel is actually a highly
diversified genre with loss of internal

199
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:44,680
fractures. And what generates
those internal fractures,

200
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,730
um, is that there are multiple
languages in the novel,

201
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,960
which is what he says [inaudible]
is made up of social dialects.

202
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,260
It kind of touristic group behavior,

203
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,280
professional and Joggin's
generic languages,

204
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,670
languages or generations and age groups
can then show to contentious languages,

205
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,690
languages of the authorities or various
circles and the passing fashions.

206
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,480
So I think to express
authority or intentions,

207
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,520
but in a refracted way.
Um,

208
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,600
so we all know that that novels actually
do register passing fashions very well.

209
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,520
Right? So, um, uh, novel about a,

210
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,340
the valley girl would have to work like,
you know,

211
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,750
the light would be repeated constantly.
It wouldn't be realistic if it weren't.

212
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,050
Um, so that's the, it's the
nature of the novel. Um,

213
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:45,040
two is to mimic her and speech.
Um, and so [inaudible] is very,

214
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:45,920
very,
um,

215
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,900
accurate in his description
of the currency, uh,

216
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,960
and the way that the novel is always
up to date on the language that people,

217
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,290
um, uh, using actual living people using.

218
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,010
Although novels can also
choose to be historic novels,

219
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:07,820
in which case they will be try to mimic
the language or the 18th century of

220
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:11,210
whatever as pension, you
know, sometimes does. Um,

221
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,230
and is a master at doing that. Um, so, um,

222
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,320
so bacteria is great in terms of,
um,

223
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,810
talking about the social dimension of
language and I don't think that you guys

224
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:27,950
need to be reminded that this is directly
related to our discussion of social

225
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:31,610
types, right. And Hemingway
and Fitzgerald. Um,

226
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:36,050
so basically this is the social
dialogues of various, um, label, label,

227
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,970
label a social groups. Um,
but I think that as we read,

228
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:41,960
as I lay dying,

229
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,990
we can also see that there's something
else going on other than social dialects

230
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,330
that back teens theory actually is
inadequate to describing the spectrum of

231
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,140
linguistic phenomena.
And as I lay dying,

232
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,930
so to supplement Bactine,

233
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,660
I would like to introduce
one other critic.

234
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,420
Distinguished British critic died in

235
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,320
2010 a commode.

236
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,280
And this is actually a book
that he wrote earlier, um,

237
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,480
quite early in his career called
the genesis of secret safe.

238
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,430
The interpretation of narrative,
um, and about teens theory.

239
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,460
Um, is that, uh, that yes,

240
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:29,810
we tend to interpret narratives
when we given a narrative. Uh,

241
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,600
most of us attended to
interpret it in some fashion,

242
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,180
but his argument is also that narrative's
themselves our interpretations of

243
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:42,440
reality. So, you know, the, when we
actually try to interpret a narrative,

244
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,360
we actually doing a kind of Mather
interpretation in the sense that the

245
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:52,040
narrative itself is an
interpretation of, uh, of reality.

246
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,570
And not only that,

247
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,840
but that secrecy or sequence emerge
in the course of that interpretation,

248
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:04,790
which is a fascinating notion
of how secrets are generated,

249
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,420
not when we are trying to hide
something from other people.

250
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,600
But when we go about interpreting reality,

251
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,890
that is when secrets become a reality,
becomes a,

252
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,350
when they become a recognizable a
reality, maybe not legible, but, uh,

253
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,460
they become registered as a
dimension of reality. So very,

254
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,310
very interesting idea and
move basically, um, is,

255
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,490
is interested in the Bible that says
is great reading of the gospel of mark,

256
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,980
of Saint Mark. Um, and,
but he's also interested in
narrative in general. So let's,

257
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,060
um, think about how
his idea, uh, with, um,

258
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,680
could be,
um,

259
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:51,130
incorporated or combined with back
teens theory of social dialects,

260
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,360
uh, to think about the basic linguistic
paradigm. And as I lay dying,

261
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,760
so while I like to suggest is that we can,
uh,

262
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,730
very schematically,
uh,

263
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,640
classify speech in as I lay
dying under two headings.

264
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:13,550
One is the social dialect and it has to
do with functionally coders speech. Um,

265
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,360
when you're within a particular group,
a generic group,

266
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,840
um, because there's so much
commonality among that group,

267
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,000
quite often you would just use, um, a
shorthand. So, you know, for Liberals,

268
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,750
Sarah Pailin would be one such shorthand,
right?

269
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,230
You don't need to say any thing more
of his roof reference therapy. And,

270
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:35,460
and that's,
that's enough.

271
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:40,080
So that's one example of a currently
functionally coders speech.

272
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,430
Uh, it obviously is a dialect
of the subgroup is not
representative of the entire

273
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:47,370
population. Um, and, uh,

274
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
because it is so intimately
formative of our subgroup,

275
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,010
um, it, the,

276
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,020
the very use of language can function
as a socio economic and psychological

277
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,090
portrait of that subset of the population.
So this is very all witch,

278
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,200
all those concepts are very important
too about tea in that population is made

279
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:15,201
up of various subsets and their lines
of division among those subsets based on

280
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,500
the linguist usage.

281
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,900
So this is the social dimension and we'll
think obviously about how poor whites

282
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,710
would use the English
language. Um, but um,

283
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,350
almost move very beginning.

284
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:31,230
And we also see that the English language
is used in a different way and as I

285
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:34,710
lay dying, so those are the worst
with the secrets and it's very,

286
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:37,950
very hard not to read
as I lay dying without,

287
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,470
I'm sensing that those was
a pregnant with meaning, uh,

288
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,170
quite often were denied
access to those meetings. Um,

289
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,200
they sort of flaunt their toddlers with
a meaning that is not available to us

290
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,600
and that's part of the traction
and power of those words.

291
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,010
So I would like to think about those
words with secrets. Um, along two lines.

292
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:07,011
One is relatively short term
and relatively transparent
in the sense that we can

293
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:12,621
get to them sooner or later and the
other would be long running worse with

294
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:14,930
cigarettes,
um,

295
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:20,110
that are very resistant to
our investigation was to
hold on to the secrets for a

296
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:24,000
long time and maybe never
giving up the secret,

297
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:26,640
never yielding anything to the reader.
Um,

298
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,140
so let's start with the
easier part of the spectrum,

299
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,340
which is a very recognizable speech.
Um,

300
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,450
and I'm taking both those
examples from Cora who is, um,

301
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,520
I think it's fair to say is a fairly
good example of a poor weight.

302
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,043
Um,

303
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,860
so I saved all the eggs
and bade yesterday.

304
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,260
The cakes are turned out real well.
We depend a lot on our chickens.

305
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,810
They are good layers with few.

306
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:02,950
We have left after the
Parsons and such snakes too.

307
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:07,951
In the summer I had to be more careful
than ever because it was on my final say.

308
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:11,930
So we talked on,
we could have stopped cheaper chickens,

309
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,610
but I gave my promise and
as Miss Lowington said,

310
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,810
when she advised me to get a good breed
because Mr towel himself and miss the

311
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,710
good breed of cows or
hogs pays in the long run.

312
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,080
So when we lost so many of them,

313
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:31,530
we couldn't afford to use
the eggs ourselves because
I could not have had Mr Tao

314
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,440
chides me when it was on my say.

315
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:40,150
So we talked on so very proud woman.

316
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,900
Um, but obviously under very
difficult circumstances.

317
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,730
These are the people who cannot afford
to eat the eggs laid by their own

318
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:51,670
chickens, um, and um,

319
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,740
is because they lose so many chickens.
Um,

320
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,970
and just from the possums and the snakes.

321
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,350
And because those chickens
are so expensive, um,

322
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,940
they losing one means a lot to them.

323
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,730
So all of that,

324
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,960
which theme to be chorus responsibility.
And I think that this is really,

325
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,180
um, fatness, basic
portrait of the poor. Wise.

326
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:24,140
I'm very, very proud people
in spite of the poverty. Um,

327
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,300
we've lost some moral rectitude,
um,

328
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,310
in the sense that they're willing to
take our responsibility upon themselves

329
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,700
without recognizing that actually someone
else should also be held responsible.

330
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,790
The person who advises them to
buy all these expensive chickens,

331
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,170
which turns out to be very,

332
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:48,910
very bad advice but not a
word of complaint from Cora.

333
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,390
So what we can say about this world
is that this is a world and was moral

334
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,850
responsibility is tightly and capsulated
within the compass of the speaking

335
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:01,774
voice.

336
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,140
That there's the basic
coincidence incidents between
the boundaries of the self

337
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,930
and the circumference of accountability
so that you are completely responsible,

338
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,680
accountable, answerable to
anything that happens to you.

339
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,970
It is truly unfortunate that your chickens
get taken by the possums in his neck,

340
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,670
but it is your responsibility.
Um,

341
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,700
so Ms Lowington is reference is alluded
to but no blame is attached to her.

342
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,230
And I would say that this was really the
defining future according to Faulkner,

343
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,660
I'm of the mentality of the poor waste.

344
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:41,830
And we can see one other instance of that.
Um,

345
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,760
so I bade carefully. Cora has been told
by not intent again to do something.

346
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,330
So I bade carefully
more careful than ever.

347
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,250
I bet in my life and the
cakes turned out right. Well,

348
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,920
but when we got to town this morning,

349
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,660
Islams and told me the lady had changed
her mind and was not going to have the

350
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:07,100
party after all,
she wanted to taken those cakes anyway.

351
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:11,240
Case that well I say,
I reckon she never had no use for them.

352
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,700
Now she ought to taken them.
Kate says,

353
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,930
but those rich town ladies can
change the minds for folks. Can,

354
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,180
Richard's is nothing in the face of
the Lord for he can see into the heart.

355
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,460
Maybe I can sell them at a basalt
Saturday. I said they turn out real well.

356
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,320
Um,
once again,

357
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,440
the same mentality that we s that
we saw just in the earlier passage,

358
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:40,730
uh, that full encapsulation
of responsibility within
incumbents have a single

359
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:42,170
person,
um,

360
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,090
and that couple with a certain kind of,

361
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,990
um, psychologically redeeming piety, uh,

362
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,900
that even though something is be
falling unfortunate is the following,

363
00:24:56,901 --> 00:25:00,860
the right now that God is the
ultimate judge of everything.

364
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,420
And once again,

365
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,430
there's the deep reluctance to
extend the blame to anyone else,

366
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,660
either. Ms Lowington, other rich town
lady who changes her mind about the cakes.

367
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,090
Um, so, um, this is, uh, um, I
would say a very sympathetic,

368
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,490
um,
although obviously critical,

369
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,500
both sympathetic and critical
portrait of the poor wife. And, uh,

370
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,560
it basically is the baseline is the
baddest given a linguistic given

371
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:35,051
psychological given the social
given in the world of SLA dying.

372
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,140
Um,

373
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,140
and just about everything else that
we see in the rest of the novel is a

374
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:44,840
departure is a deviation from that given.

375
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:49,430
So Cora is the styling
point and everyone else,

376
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,500
uh,
moves away a bit from that starting point.

377
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:59,530
And we can measure the degree of
deviation or maybe a degree of dailene's,

378
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,850
um,
because as I lay dying,

379
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,170
it's also about deviance
and the consequences of
deviance and to annul novel

380
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:07,670
that we sleep.
Um,

381
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,940
but this is a very important
starting point for Faulkner.

382
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,970
So let's look at the various points of
departure and most of departure from that

383
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:20,150
linguistic baseline.

384
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:25,610
And move on now to talk about the
various kinds of worse with secrets. Um,

385
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,450
one is very short term and I think that
you guys know what I'm talking about

386
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:31,200
doing del State Grid.
Um,

387
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,510
and then the long running asleep grid in
the bundling family coming into us from

388
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,010
Dow judo. Naturally I've
added one other vitamin. Um,

389
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:45,170
so, um, let's look at the
short cigarette Duda. Um,

390
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,470
and she, she was picking cotton
with leave, right? So, um,

391
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,500
and she's decided in her own
mind that if a bag is for,

392
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,420
then she would do something.
Um,

393
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:02,370
so the decision is hinting strictly
on whether or not the bag is for,

394
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,050
and it turns out that Labor
soon picking into her back.

395
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,590
So it was four when we came to the end
of the row and I could not help it.

396
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:18,240
And so it was, I could
not help it. It was then,

397
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,610
and then I saw Dow and he knew,
he said he knew without the words,

398
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,540
like you told me that Maya is
going to die without words.

399
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,530
And I knew he knew because if he
had sat in you with the words,

400
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,260
I will not have believed
that he has seen there,

401
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,000
that he had been there and saw us
police that he did know. And I said,

402
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,930
are you going to tell part? You're going
to kill him without the words I said it.

403
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,420
And he said, why? Without the words.

404
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,600
And that's why I can
talk to him with knowing,

405
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,960
with hating because he knows who this is
the first indication that the bundling

406
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,180
family,
my have something in common.

407
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,280
The House of Atreus is the importance
of the word heat in that family.

408
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:03,983
Um,

409
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,990
and it seems that hate hatred can come
about because someone knows something

410
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,090
about you and all of that.

411
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,660
All of this ferry into hands
exchange is conducted without words.

412
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,260
So in many ways, this is, you know,

413
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:25,210
fuck that obviously is not
responding to about 10.

414
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:28,350
He wouldn't have been thinking
about [inaudible]. Um,

415
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,380
but he's obviously thinking of a
dimension of language that is not covered,

416
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:39,861
that is not encompass by a social
dialogue and in fact is not encompass by

417
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,920
actual actually spoken worse other than
other two towers that those emotions are

418
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:52,170
going through. Do a doubt. Faulkner has
to use words to convey that, that, that,

419
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,230
that, um, experience to us. Um,

420
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,760
so Faulkner's using words but do though
is not using words and dao is not using

421
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:03,330
words either. And we know exactly what
it is that the downloads, you know, that,

422
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,120
that, um, that do that as in
fact go into town, you know,

423
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,250
because she is in such a condition,
um,

424
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,240
that she needs to do something about
herself. Um, and it all comes from, uh,

425
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,190
they've picking the cotton into her
bag and what happens with a bag is for,

426
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,530
um, so it really is a pretty
transparent cigarettes. Um,

427
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,330
and um, you know, I think the
offers are in the know, uh,

428
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:28,600
almost right there.

429
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:34,060
They're not that many secrets that a young
girl in her circumstances could have.

430
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,710
So this is almost the only secret
that she have and she does have it.

431
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,340
Um, so, um, that in itself was surprising.

432
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,330
It's not surprising that she
would get pregnant out of wedlock.

433
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:54,130
There's not surprising.
Um,

434
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,190
it is surprising that she would
hate dial so much because of that.

435
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,800
So let's turn out to the
more deep seated deep rooted,

436
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,900
uh, kind of see with, um, that
is not always disclosed to us.

437
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,540
Um, as the words are spoken, uh,

438
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,570
maybe not disclose to us as the narrative
unfolds and maybe never disclosed to

439
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:23,110
us ever. So, um, dow it turns out, um,

440
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,420
as in fact,
as soon as the novel opens,

441
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:30,421
this is the opening paragraph of SLA
dying right there in this very neutral

442
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:35,710
looking, um, statement from
Dow. This little secret,

443
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,430
Joe and I come up from the field
following the path in single file,

444
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,790
although I am 15 feet ahead of him.

445
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Anyone watching us from the cotton house
can see Jews frayed and broken straw

446
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:55,150
had a full head about my own.

447
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:00,660
So it seems a kind of odd kind of
emphasis on the spatial orientation of the

448
00:31:02,301 --> 00:31:07,300
bundle and how's the colony house and
what anyone in the cotton house we'd be

449
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:09,970
able to see.
And the difference in height,

450
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,070
the train Dow and Joel. Well
difference in height, you know,

451
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,720
is not public, not most difficult
thing in the world for most people.

452
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:20,740
Um,

453
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,740
but within the family difference in
height actually is kind of interesting in

454
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,810
potentially significant.
Um,

455
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,580
so let's just keep that in mind that this,
uh,

456
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,620
what seems to be a kind of a telling
difference in height between Dow and jewel

457
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:43,150
and just leave that stick with
bright there because Dow is not,

458
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,610
maybe dad doesn't even know himself.
Uh,

459
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:51,630
but he's certainly the carrier of a
secret that is revealed that is sort of

460
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,420
given to us or slung at us,
you know,

461
00:31:55,421 --> 00:32:00,421
that we just met to receive this thing
that we don't fully understand at this

462
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:05,770
moment. Um, but this passage is, uh,

463
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,030
in many ways deceptive in the sense that
there's not any complicated language

464
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,680
and there's nothing that we obviously
don't understand, um, about the,

465
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,131
about it.

466
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:21,131
So I was still classified as being fairly
close to the do Dell kind of cigarette

467
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:22,390
is long running,

468
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,410
relatively long running but it
potentially could have the same kind of

469
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:31,200
transparency there as do Dell cigarette.
But let's look at um,

470
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,590
something I was where the language itself,
uh,

471
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:39,440
becomes very different and this is coming
from Joe himself and I really don't

472
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,420
actually think I can read this
very well so I would try it.

473
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,611
But for them it's only,

474
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:46,610
it's not making it easy for
anyone who tries to read this.

475
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,110
If it had just been me when cash fell off
of that church and if it had just been

476
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:56,780
me when pie late sake without low,
the woods fell on him,

477
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,780
it would not be happening
with every bastion in the
country coming into there as

478
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,550
well because if there is a god,
what the Hell is he?

479
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:09,550
Four it would just be me and her on a
high hill and me rolling the rocks down

480
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:12,440
the hill at the faces,

481
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,830
picking them up and throwing them down
the hill phases and teeth and all by God

482
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,700
until she was quiet and not that
got them as going one lake less,

483
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,930
one lake less. And we could be quiet. Um,

484
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,940
I truly don't know what
to say about this passage.

485
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,620
Other than that there's a lot of hatred
in there, just like Dewey, those passage.

486
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,130
Um,

487
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:42,130
and it seems that for some reason
hatred is the most powerful bond in this

488
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:48,460
family. Um, and Jill
seems these, you know,

489
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,470
one conjecture that we could have about
this passage is that he wants to throw

490
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,450
stones down the hill as someone.
Um,

491
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,230
and it appears that he wants to throw
stones at the rest of his family.

492
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,460
Um,
and we have no reason to understand.

493
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:11,240
It's not just that we are not good
enough leaders that we don't understand.

494
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:15,280
We actually have no reason to
understand what's going on here. Um,

495
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:18,740
because Faulkner does not want
us to understand at this point.

496
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,280
So all we know is that jewel
is furious about something.

497
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,950
He is furious that cash
is making a coffin,

498
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,080
um,
for Addie for some reason.

499
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,930
And he can stand that
as going one lake less.

500
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,050
That is the sound that he can stand,
um,

501
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:44,230
as well as the fact that Addie is on full
display for the entire neighborhood to

502
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:48,980
come and look at her, uh, when cash
is trying to get that coffin. Radic.

503
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:54,010
So these are the immediate circumstances
that he really hates that she is,

504
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,520
um, in disgrace because everyone,
every bastard in the country,

505
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:02,640
you can come in and look at her when
she was waiting for her coffin and the

506
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:06,620
calciums to be taking his time, making
the coffin, but not maliciously,

507
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:07,250
we would think.

508
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,820
Cause he's a very good carpenter and he
wants to be a thorough in making a very

509
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:13,820
good coffin. Um, but, um,

510
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,770
but for some reason Jewel's
hatred also extends to his father.

511
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:22,520
And if it had been him when that low,
the worth felt,

512
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:27,920
um, uh, on him, that
would have been good too.

513
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,690
So it, it's just really,
um, it's very peculiar. Uh,

514
00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:36,140
we don't know, uh, the long history,

515
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,020
the long emotional history,
um, behind all those people.

516
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,080
They obviously are a very close knit
family because there are so few people

517
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,540
around that there's just not
enough distance separating them.

518
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:56,370
They're really basically all stuck in
the same place. Um, and that creates,

519
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,590
um, uh, kind of, uh, uh, the,

520
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,400
the ideal condition to maximize
any kind of hostility, uh,

521
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,670
amount of family members.

522
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:10,890
This seems to be one of the consequences
of poor ways in a very small town with

523
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:15,810
very few few neighbors. Um, so, um,

524
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,870
it seems at the very least that you as
he imagines himself or is he experiences

525
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:27,780
himself in relation to the rest of his
family that he sees himself very much as

526
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:29,160
an outsider.
Okay.

527
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:34,020
So Joe sees himself as an outsider
that he would like to do something.

528
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,700
He would like to throw stones
at the rest of his family. Uh,

529
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,230
and combined that with the fact that,

530
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,460
um, Dow seems to be really, uh,

531
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,520
fixated on that otherwise
innocent fact that Joe is,

532
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,240
um, whole head taller than he is. Um,

533
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,600
the dose to the same link in some
fashion. There's kind of a very, um,

534
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:06,650
deep seeded in violent and
always explosive kind of
hatred coming from Geo and

535
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,540
the neutral observation from
Dow, the dose to the uh, uh,

536
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,380
the pieces of some kind of jigsaw
puzzle that we have to figure out, uh,

537
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,380
in the course of SLA
dying. So let me just, um,

538
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,520
give one more addition,
uh,

539
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,110
to that kind of configuration.
Uh,

540
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:36,140
based on what seems to be unmotivated
or unaccounted for hatred,

541
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,850
the hatred is undeniable, the
violence is undeniable, um,

542
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,960
is just that we're not able
to read them very well.

543
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:50,961
So Franklin low is actually right that
this is a narrative that in the cause of

544
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:58,610
making us compelling us to come up
with interpretations is also generating

545
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:05,150
secrets in that very act that the fact
that we have to interpret the words that

546
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:09,690
are given to us also generate secrets
about the bundle and family. Well,

547
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:14,460
he just do it all back again. Um,
and we know that she's already, uh,

548
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,690
been the carrier of one kind
of secrets about herself. Um,

549
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,140
that seems pretty
transparent. Uh, but this is,

550
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,950
seems to be secret of
somewhat different order.

551
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,090
And jewel don't care about anything.

552
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,090
He is not kin to us in caring,

553
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,600
not care can and cash Lysol on the
long hot yellow days up into plants,

554
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,260
nailing them to something.
And I did not think that thou would,

555
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,500
that sits at the supper table with his
eyes gone further than the food and the

556
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:51,730
land full of the land.

557
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Degaulle is cow and the hose feel
with distance beyond the land.

558
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,050
Um,
I think this is Ashley.

559
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,080
Thoughtless belated attempt to write what
he doesn't ride in the sound of fury,

560
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,060
which is the portrait of three brothers
toe from the standpoint of this sister.

561
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,690
Um,
do though is nothing like catty,

562
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,870
but it's almost as a father
is showing us that yes,

563
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,020
he can certainly capture a young girl's
point of view and maybe this is what

564
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:30,010
comes out. So not exactly
flattering or, uh, very,

565
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:35,070
uh, uh, is, is a very intimate
portrait of the three brothers. Um,

566
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:40,000
but it's not one that they
would especially invited
to see or hear about. Um,

567
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,550
so something about jewel,
um,

568
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,700
seems to be emerging just in a
course of what Dow is saying,

569
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,910
what Joe himself was saying.
And what do you do is saying that this is,

570
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,260
it's a common pattern. Uh,
the Jew is not kin to us.

571
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,190
He's not care can he doesn't
care for the rest of us.

572
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,690
His interest seem to lie
somewhere else. Um, so that, that,

573
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,820
that fact is, is, um, you know,
is, is fairly straight forward.

574
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:06,880
Um,

575
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,880
the little bit of observation
about cash is interesting.

576
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:12,880
Um,

577
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,290
we know that cash is a good carpenter
and Faulkner really want us to highlight

578
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:20,920
that fact. The basically he's the one
who brings in money to the family. Um,

579
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,320
he's the one who's always
hired by other people.

580
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,460
It's the only one who is capable of
bringing in real income into family. Um,

581
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,690
and he really wants to make a
good coffin for addie. So, um,

582
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,880
all that is not in dispute,

583
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,240
but the way in which duly doubt looks
a doubt that he's sewing up the long

584
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:41,371
heart,

585
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:46,371
said yellow days into plans suggest that
maybe there's kinds of metaphoric and

586
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:50,110
psychological dimension
to concentrate as well.

587
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,410
That even though he was
a very skilled laborer,

588
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,260
this also something very skilled workman.

589
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,660
He's more than just labor is
actually is an all listen,

590
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,280
it's very skilled artisan.
There is something about, uh,

591
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:08,310
that act of frame methodically sawing
the wood that says something about the

592
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:11,830
mindset of cash.

593
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:17,310
And so that is what do we
doubt is noticing that as if,

594
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,310
uh, even though no matter how
good and all the sudden he is, uh,

595
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,340
there's something maybe just a little
disturbing or worrisome about the fact

596
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:31,531
that he's so much into carpentry
and then for portrait of doubt is,

597
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,520
um, truly, um,

598
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,140
I don't know what to make of that is
very surprising coming from Dewey Dell,

599
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:43,030
um, who so far has not been
a very deep thinker or any,

600
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,180
someone with very deep emotions
actually. Um, you know,

601
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:50,750
she's worried about something very
immediate and very simple really. Um,

602
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,810
but this portrait of doubt that,
um,

603
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,940
that his eyes are gone food
and this food and the land,

604
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:03,920
he's not obviously not just registering
the food and the landers is different

605
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,890
degree of death between
what his eyes register, um,

606
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,370
and the quote service phenomenon
of the third and the land.

607
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:16,170
So there's a difference, um, in, in,
in, in just the radius of, of uh,

608
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,740
perception, uh, between
what Dow is registering, um,

609
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,410
and the most immediate physical
world, food and land. Um,

610
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,210
and I think that is because
of that difference in the
radius of perception, um,

611
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,520
that the whole land seems to be embedded
in his scout or dug out of the scout

612
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,330
and then, um, their holes
filled with distance.

613
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:41,420
That in some sense the vastness,
uh,

614
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,980
both the vastness of the land,
uh,

615
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,550
they're enormous distance
but also the holes,

616
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,580
the gaps in that distance of
those our path into Dallas skull.

617
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:57,140
Um, I mean I'm just paraphrasing
the, they're not really
elucidating that passage.

618
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,870
Um, and I think that that's
all we can do at this moment.

619
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,390
That there's something special about Dao,
uh,

620
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,790
that he's not so easily
describable in everyday language.

621
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:11,330
So this is almost a direct
reputation about teen.

622
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,660
That social dialogue quite often cannot
capture the psychological reality even

623
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,320
of what appears to be the most important,
you know,

624
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,880
deprive a person, um,
disadvantaged person.

625
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:31,040
Um, so I want to um, give
you one more example,

626
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:35,810
uh, of, uh, of, of uh, a
specimen linguistic specimen.

627
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,360
Um, and the specimen that
isn't the right word.

628
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,320
Specimen would have been the right word
for Hemingway would have been the right

629
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:45,770
word for, um, for Fitzgerald
in the short stories.

630
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:50,330
But they're strictly ironic in the sense,
but I use that word anyway. So this,

631
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:55,331
this one instance of language that is
also country completely incomprehensible

632
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,830
to us. Coming from a child from
vitamin, it is dark, I can hear,

633
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:03,200
would silence,
I know them,

634
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,440
but not living sounds now live in him.

635
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,290
It is as though the dark.

636
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:14,291
We're resolving him out of his integrity
into an unrelated scattering of

637
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:18,170
components.
Snuffing was in stampings,

638
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:22,220
smells of cooling flesh
and ammonia at hair,

639
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:27,670
and the illusion of a coordinated hole
of splodge high and strong bones within

640
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:33,641
which did hajj and secret and familiar
and is different from my ears.

641
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,030
I see him dissolve legs rolling.

642
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:43,950
I a Gaudy splotching
like co flames and flow,

643
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:46,290
the bond,
the dark and fading solution,

644
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,390
all one yet neither or either yet.
None.

645
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,700
I can see hearing called [inaudible]
caressing, shaping is hard shape,

646
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,250
fetlock hip,
shoulder and head smell and sound.

647
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,030
I am not afraid.

648
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,040
This comes right after
two very dramatic moments.

649
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:13,041
The chapter before development chapter
is when we know that Allie is that the

650
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,250
Eddie Bundra, there's like
that is announce towards the
very end of that chapter.

651
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:22,370
And then the chapter that is vitamins
chapter right after that is when he

652
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,300
actually goes into Peabody is
bond the bond or the neighbor,

653
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,920
um, and uses a stick to beat on the
horses so that they all run away.

654
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:36,840
And most of the, um, that chapter
is devoted to bottom and, uh,

655
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:41,790
beating on the horses and saying
that they not even the day,

656
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:46,410
but you killed my ma. Uh, so
that in itself is kind of,

657
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,330
you know, sort of understandable
but strange in that he would pin,

658
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:56,510
unlike Cora who would pin the
responsibility on herself,

659
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,020
vitamin pins,

660
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:03,021
the responsibility for killing
addie on it appears on Peabody.

661
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:08,040
Um, and that's why he's beating on
his horses. Uh, and, and in fact,

662
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,570
uh, you know, just destroying the whole
team. Uh, the, the horses run runaway.

663
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,990
Um, and then after the
peer buddies, horses,

664
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,250
runaway vitamins,

665
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,810
themes to be preoccupied
with something else.

666
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,310
And this is a moment where [inaudible]
really is having a great time.

667
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:30,780
If his pronouns of, you
know, who is this kid? Okay.

668
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:34,620
I think they are at least two candidates.
I think it possibly is,

669
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,300
is Joe's horse, you know,
this horse doesn't run away.
And there's something about,

670
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:42,510
there's nothings and
stampings and a splodge hi,

671
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:47,130
that suggest that it is to horse, um,
that, that, that volume is talking about.

672
00:46:47,131 --> 00:46:50,580
This is the one thing that's remaining,
um, this horse that doesn't run away,

673
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,580
but there's also a possibility,
um,

674
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,810
that and is different from my is uh,

675
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,980
just because of the syntactical
construction or that
sentence suggests that it

676
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:06,210
probably, it might not be an animal, but
the human being I'm a human being who is,

677
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,050
is,

678
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:12,050
is different from vitamins is in which
case that human being could only be two.

679
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,200
Right?

680
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,200
So I think that this passage is meant to
be deliberately misleading in the sense

681
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:24,741
that we can tell exactly where Jude begins
and where his horse with jewel end at

682
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,880
way horse begins. Um, the boundaries
between the human being, um,

683
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,890
and the horse, um, and also clear cut
and in fact the identity. So the tube,

684
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,590
uh, same to the interviews. Uh,

685
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,740
and that is one of the great
innovations in as I lay dying, um,

686
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,550
those, uh, very ambiguous, uh, and,

687
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,770
and southern boundaries between
the human and the nonhuman. Uh,

688
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,880
which actually is also one of the great
defining attributes of the classical

689
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,460
attic tradition.
Um,

690
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:08,260
so we'll come back to this and talk about
the southern boundaries between human

691
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,800
and nonhuman, both by going back
to homer and Dante and so on,

692
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:14,890
but talking about the
implications in SLA dying.
