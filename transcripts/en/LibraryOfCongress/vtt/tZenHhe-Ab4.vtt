&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.650
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Please
welcome, please join me

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.510
in welcoming, Roxane Gay.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:20.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.340
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Thank you, Linda.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.930
Thanks for coming out
on this hot, rainy day.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.250
It's actually not hot outside.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.640
It's just hot in here,
but, that's a Nelly song.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.940
Sorry.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.240
[ Laughter ]

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.510
I almost broke into song,
but I'm going to save that.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.160
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah,
we'll hope it'll happen.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.770
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Oh, it will.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.980
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: So, "Hunger", one
of the reasons why I was so excited

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.530
to come here and talk
to you about "Hunger" is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.830
that when someone first
said to me, "Oh,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.210
did you know Roxane wrote a book?

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.410
It's about weight, and
it's a memoir of the body.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.710
And, it's all this stuff.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.010
It's going to be great."

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.310
And I said, "I'm sure
it's going to be great."

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.610
And, I said, "Oh, you
should read it."

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.910
And, I said, "Oh, no, no, no."

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.210
I said, "I can't."

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.310
I said, "I can't."

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.600
And, I couldn't even, to think
about reading it was to think

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.040
about something that I knew
was going to be very raw.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.330
And, you say in the book that
it's the hardest writing project

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.630
that you've done.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.440
Can you talk a little
bit about why that is?

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.740
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.040
Definitely.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.490
When I decided to write
this book, it was 2014,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.420
just before "Bad Feminist" came
out, and my agent said, "Hey,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.300
let's pitch another book idea."

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.340
And, I was like, "Yeah, let's
do it before the book comes

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.140
out in case it flops, so
I have another book deal."

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.750
Which is how I think.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.050
Big mistake.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.290
Huge. And, that was "Pretty Woman".

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.050
Anyway. I thought the thing I want
to write about least is fatness

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.370
and my body and the experience of
living in my body in this world.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.920
And, that's when I
knew, oh, god damn it,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.900
this is the book I'm
going to have to write.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.900
Because the things that I like
writing about the least end

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.920
up being, oftentimes, the most
intellectually satisfying.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.880
And, that was, indeed,
the case for this book.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.540
But, it was difficult.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.840
It was really hard.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.700
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: What's, what is
satisfying about having written it?

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.510
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Having written it.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.130
[ Laughter ]

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.150
What's satisfying is that when
you're fat, people project a lot

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.240
of bullshit onto your body
and make a lot of assumptions

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.040
about why you're fat
as if they deserve to.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.610
As if they have a right
to the story of your body.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.370
And so, to tell the story
of my body for what it is,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.100
neither good nor bad, just it is
what it is was really satisfying.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.730
And, the people who are
most inclined to project

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.440
onto me aren't going to
read a book like "Hunger",

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.480
but I didn't write it for them.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.450
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah, one of the
words that really jumped out at me

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.110 position:56%
in "Hunger" is the word unruly which
you use quite a lot when you talk

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.690
about unruly bodies
and unruly appetites.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.540
What is it about the word "unruly"
that appeals so much to you?

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.540
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah, it started
with an erotica collection edited

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.090
by Hanne Blank called "Unruly
Appetites", and I loved that phrase

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.710
for thinking about appetite
and how sometimes it is unruly

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.810
and untamed and uncontrollable.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.660
And, I think we can apply
that to body sometimes,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.260
and at times throughout my life,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.760
my body has felt unruly
and beyond my control.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.760
And so, I think it's a
really appropriate phrase.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.060
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.170
I referred to this somewhat in
gest, but it has been my experience

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.620
that since you wrote this book,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.970
it has invited a tremendous
amount of advice.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.270
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yes.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: And, I'm
wondering why it is that people seem

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.230
to not be able to receive
a memoir as anything other

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.200
than a request for input.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.580
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: That's
a great question.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.660
I think because everyone thinks
they're an advice columnist,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.520
and I think that when
it comes to fatness,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.960
people see the fat
body as a problem.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.080
And so, they want to
offer a solution,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.890
and they need to rethink
their framework

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.510
because the fat body
is not a problem.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.300
And, yet, every day, even now,
I get all sorts of weird email

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.740 position:56%
and sometimes in person advice
about eating, exercise, and therapy.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.100
Even though I'm 42 and I have
health insurance and a brain.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.720
So, I'm, and I also, like, I
wrote the book, and I'm capable

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.730
of handling all of
these things on my own.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.300
Like, a man from Washington
actually named Mark.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.100
So, if he's here.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.180
[ Laughter ]

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.480
Emailed me, and he said, "You know,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.830
if you exercise three days a
week, it'll be really useful."

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.780
And, I was like, "But,
did you not read my book?

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.080
I exercise all the time.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.560
Like, what are you talking about?"

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.610
And, it's just like
basic ass advice, like.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.060
A woman in Canada emailed
me and said

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.510
that she would give me a
gift worth $100 Canadian.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.040
[ Laughter ]

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.600
If I went vegan for three
months and lost weight.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.480
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Three
months for $100 Canadian?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.050
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: It gets better.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.310
[ Laughter ]

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.950
And, if I went vegan
for three months

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.030
and did not lose weight,
I had to send her $150.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.040
[ Laughter ]

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.350
That was like the incentive.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.510 position:56%
And, I was just like, "Bitch, what?"

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.380
[ Laughter ]

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.680
And.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.340
[ Applause ]

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.340 position:56%
I wrote her back a very nasty email,
and she responded very nastily.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.640
She was hurt.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.600
And, I was like, "You
should be hurt.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.510
I was trying to hurt you."

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.050
[ Laughter ]

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.740
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: It's funny
because I feel like the intimacy,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.190
the sometimes, like, false
assumed intimacy of Twitter

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.130
and the internet is compounded
by when people hear you talk

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.310
about topics, and I
think fatness is one.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.730
Trauma is another.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.030 position:56%
That they associate with such shame
that they would only talk about them

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.020 position:56%
with people they feel very close to.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.620
That when you talk about
them, they feel, now, like you

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.920
and they know each other.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.220
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Absolutely.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.540
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: And so, you get
this, kind of, let me talk to you

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.100
as a friend because
now we know each other.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.400
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Absolutely.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.330 position:56%
And, I think women writers face
this quite a lot that when you write

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.600
about the personal, people,
then, think we're friends

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.190
and that you're there to comfort
them or be their best friend.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.490
And, we're not friends.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.010
I like all of you, sure, but.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.310
[ Laughter ]

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.610
You don't know me.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.220
You know what I have
allowed you to know about me,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.310
and it's really important
to understand that boundary.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.920
And, people have no boundaries
when it comes to women writers.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.020
Like, all the time, people
say, "Can I hug you?"

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.960
And, I'm like, "No,
because you're a stranger,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.640 position:56%
and I don't like hugging strangers."

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.530
And, they get really
upset, but I'm like,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.130
"Do you ask Jonathan
Franzen for a fucking hug?"

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.240
[ Laughter ]

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.590
I know you don't.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.590
I know you don't, and it's
incredibly frustrating

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.490
that male writers get to
be treated as intellectuals

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.950
and as having gravity and women
writers are treated as friends.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.250
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.360
Is it a, is it a, is it a burden?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.970
I keep struggling for a better word
than burden, but that people want

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.610
to tell you how much
your work means to them?

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.910
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: No, absolutely not.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.210
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: But, I mean,
do you know what I'm saying?

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.510
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: You can
tell me that all day.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.810
I'll be fine.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.110
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: But,
there are people who say.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.410
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I'll carry that one.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.710
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: There are
people who say, "This, you know,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.010
reading about you, reading things

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.560
from you is how I stay,
how I keep going?"

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.150
And, I've talked to other
women writers about that.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.550
Is that something that
is difficult for you?

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.430
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: No, it's flattering.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.140
It's, sometimes I find it strange.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.440
Just because I never
thought of myself

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.200
as ever being that kind of person.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.390
And, writing is such a
difficult, well, not difficult,

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.960
but challenging, I
guess, experience.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.540
And, you always hope that your work
is going to be noticed as a writer.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.620
And, so often, really
good work goes unnoticed

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.410
that to have your work not
only noticed by understood

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.200
and appreciated is
really overwhelming.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.710
And, I'll never take
that for granted.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.440
The challenging thing can be

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.320
when people tell me
their personal stories.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.620
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Right.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.920
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: A lot of
times, people will, then,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.670
tell me their own histories of
trauma or dealing with body shame

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.650
or anything related to the
kinds of subjects I write about.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:09.490 position:56%
And, I always try to respect and
honor that, but I'm not a therapist.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.740
And, I don't know what to do with
all of these sad stories sometimes.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.420
It can be really overwhelming for
people to just tell me everything,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.550
and I recently did an
event with Ann Patchett.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.080
And, she gave me some
really good advice.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.710
She says that at the end of her
reading, before her signing line,

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.870
she says, "I already lost my best
friend, and so you can't come

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.000
in the signing line and tell me
about how you lost your best friend

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.790
or something equally horrible

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.130
because my story is
enough for me to carry."

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.540 position:56%
And, I was really impressed by that
that she has developed that boundary

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.980
after she wrote about her
relationship with Lucy Grealy,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:53.120
and so, I'm trying to hold on
to that and use it when needed.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.420
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.550
One of the things that comes
up, I think, for a lot of people

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.910
who are writing memoir is what
to reveal and what not to.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.410
And, there are places in the book

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.140
where things are fairly
specifically alighted in terms

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.150
of these are details
I choose not to give.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.680
These are things I
choose not to share.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.990
Was it difficult to draw
those boundaries and feel

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.830 position:56%
like you could say here are the
things that either I'm going to keep

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.720
for myself or I don't want
other people in my life

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.320
to read or to have to read.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.060
What as that like for you?

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I just made sure
that I knew what my boundaries were,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.490
and I tried to stick
to them as often,

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:35.240
and so one of the key things I
did was treat this as a memoir

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.590
of my body quite literally.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.770
And so, if a detail was not
related to my body in some way,

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.560
then I did not include it.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.100
There are things that
I write around,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.050
and people have sent me emails
saying, "You were talking

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.510
about this, weren't you?"

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:51.060
And, like, yeah, but, there are
other people involved, and so,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.200
I have an ex-boyfriend
who's wonderful.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.680
And, I write about him very nicely
in the book because it's true.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.980
We're still friends.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.460
But, he's really private,
and so I respect that.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.270
And so, he was like, please
don't ever write about this.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.620
And, I said, "I won't."

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.790
And, I believe that.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.800
I don't write about my current
relationship situation because,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.470
again, I am fine with all of this,
but the people in my life don't ask

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.930
for this level of scrutiny.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.430
And, it's not fair to them.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.090
And so, that also helps.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.440
I just, sometimes you have
to save stuff for yourself.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.740
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.040
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: And, that
helps keep it yours.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.340
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.400
I heard you talking about the
book and saying that you hoped

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.020 position:56%
that your parents would not read it.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.320
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I do
hope they don't read it.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.620
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Not [inaudible].

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.030
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I just
sent them copies.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.140
[ Laughter ]

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.440
Last week.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.740
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Not because
there's anything in it

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.040
that is specifically
a secret from them,

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.050
but just because there are
things that you don't think

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.720
that they need or would
want to read.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.020
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.520
I don't think that
parents need to read

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.630
about how their 12-year-old
child was raped.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.100
Like, you don't need
that in your head.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.060
I think the broad strokes
are enough.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.360
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.990
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: And, they
don't need to know a lot

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.940
of things I put in the book.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.780
But, they've come to tour events,
so I, I did not prepare them

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.840
for "Bad Feminist"
which was a mistake.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.680
They found out about
it from Time Magazine.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.440
It was bad.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.300
I was really passive about
it, and now it's much better.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.550
But, for this book, I told them,
"Look, I wrote a book about fatness

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.090
and sexual assault," and I prepared
them in the ways they would need

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.240 position:56%
to be prepared because everyone else
in the family has read the book.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.350
And, I didn't want
them to be blindsided,

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.070
and they've been really good.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.800
They've respected my
little boundary with them

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.100
and have not read the book.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.600
They did read and excerpt in The
Guardian which as tough for them,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.150 position:56%
but only because they're really good
parents and we're still very close.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.860
We talk every day, and they
were just hurt that something

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.100
like this happened to their child.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.400
Yeah.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.310
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Did you worry
knowing the kind of scrutiny

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:59.010
that you come under and how much
people judge you who don't know you

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.830
that people would judge
your parents?

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.130
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: No, not at all.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.180
I wrote about them
very well in the book.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.480
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Oh, no.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.950
You did. You absolutely did.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.250
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I'm
confident about it.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.260
When I do something well,
I know I do it well,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.030
and so, in that regard, I was.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.050
[ Applause ]

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.440
I knew that they would be able
to show their face in church

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.960
and with their friends and family.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.760
I wanted them to be able to walk

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.690
around holding their heads
high as they deserve to.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.920
So, I didn't worry
about that at all.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.290 position:56%
And, if people did judge them for
not figuring things out or whatever,

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.340
then I would put them
in their place.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.490
Because my parents did everything
humanly possible to help me.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.620
I just did not know how to
allow myself to be helped.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.920
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.220
I feel like I should have
a little card that I hold

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.520
up every time I'm thinking

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.950
because this is what I would be
thinking about if it were me.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.310
And, every time I've thought about
writing about weight and stuff,

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.600
I always think I don't want
anybody to blame my parents.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.900
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.200
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: You
know what I mean?

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.500
Because the advice
was so different then.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.800
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.100
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: The advice
parents was so different.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.400
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: It was
very different.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.700
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: In, you know, like
the '80s when I was a teenager.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.000
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.590
And, you know, there are
things that they did wrong,

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.890
and I write about that in the book.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.050
And, there are definitely
issues that I have with them

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.610
because they're both thin.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.710
And, Haitian culture is obsessed
with fatness in that nobody's fat.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.490
And so, when you're fat, it
becomes a family project.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:19.610
And, that's really overwhelming
and painful, but when I turned 40,

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.970
I really started having
firm boundaries with them.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.820
And, I said, "My fat, my
body is no longer going

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.910
to be a source of family
discussion."

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.760
And so, when they would
talk about my body to me,

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.060
I would hang up the phone.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.590
And, they learned, and
it only took like a week.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.240
No, it took three weeks,
but after getting hung

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.090
up by your daughter for, you
know, three or four weeks.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.390
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Right.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.690
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: You get the message.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.990
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Right.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.290
When you were writing, I want
to switch gears a little bit.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.940 position:56%
When you were writing the stories in
"Difficult Women" one of the things

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:51.110
that I found so interesting about
that book is the formal variation

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.210
between things that are, for
one thing, they are divided

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.310
in some cases in interesting ways.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.700
Which "Hunger" is also.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.130
It's in kind of short,
numbered sections,

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.550
and some of those stories
are differentiated

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.660 position:56%
by addresses or something like that.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.420
And, some of them are
very, very short.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.500 position:56%
Is there a, do you feel like
there's a point that you have to get

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.360
to before publishers and
other people are comfortable

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.870
with that kind of formal
experimentation in fiction?

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.170
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Absolutely.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.470
Absolutely.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.140
"Difficult Women" is the first
book I ever tried to sell,

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.890
and it's the fourth
book I had published.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.930
And, when I was first, well,
when my agent was first shopping

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.120
"Difficult Women" around,
publishers said,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.150
"We love the writing,
but it's just so dark.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.020
It makes me want to kill myself."

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.070
And, I was like, "Yeah,
that's what I was going for."

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.130
[ Laughter ]

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.560
So, job well done, and it was just,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.160
they were not willing
to take a chance.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.560
And, short stories in general tend
to be more challenging to sell,

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.630
and so, it was what it was.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:01.670
And then, finally, after
"Ayiti", "Bad Feminist",

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.800 position:56%
and "An Untamed State", a
publisher was willing to say, "Okay.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.870
Now, we'll publish
this little book."

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.170
And, it did fine.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.470
It did well.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.770
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.480
You have been, I feel like you have
been out, you know, promoting books

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:21.220
and selling books for a
really long time right now.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.570
What is the process of, like,
what is sort of the, yeah,

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:29.320 position:56%
the process of going out and talking
to people day after day after day,

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.160
particularly with a
book like "Hunger"

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.370
that is so personal and raw.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.700
How do you take care of yourself

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.990
so that you can kind
of keep doing that?

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.290
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I don't know.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.070
It's a good question, and I
have to answer it very quickly.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.370
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.670
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I'm a
workaholic for sure.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.470
I've been on the road basically
since 2014, and I'm a hustler.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:54.370
And, I am willing to
hustle, and I have found

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.510
that in-person events have
worked really well for me

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.320
which is unexpected because
I'm actually shy and weird.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.880
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: But, it's been
challenging and has been exhausting,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.510
and I have, I'm definitely
at the end of my rope.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.600
Like, the paperback of "Difficult
Women" is coming out this fall,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.220
and I'm actually not
going to tour it.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.880
I just feel like I've done enough.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.180
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.450
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: And, I need a break.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.530
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: What, so one of
the other things I want to talk

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.270
about that I forgot to
mention in the introduction is

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.690
that you're working with Marvel.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.990
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.290
Yeah.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.590
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Let's talk
about Marvel a little bit.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:28.890
What are you doing for them?

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.430
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I wrote a comic book
for them called "World of Wakanda"

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.410
which is part of the
Black Panther universe,

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.790
and it focus on the Dora Milaje,
the all-women elite fighting guard

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.590
that protects Black Panther.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.450
[ Laughter ]

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.010
Yeah.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.310
[ Applause ]

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.000
It was a lot of fun.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.300
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah?

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.070
Are you a long-time comics person?

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.370
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: No.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.670
That was my first foray.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.970
I read Archie Comics growing up.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.270
[ Laughter ]

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.570
Which is different.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.040
[ Laughter ]

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.340
Just a little bit.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.640
So, I was very new to comics.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.470
Ta-Nehisi Coates emailed me
one night, and he was in Paris

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.190
at the time so it was really
late for me, early for him.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.520
And, he said, "I have a crazy idea.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.310
How would you feel about
writing a comic for Marvel?"

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.350
And, I didn't think he meant
Marvel, the mothership.

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.480
So, I was like, "Oh, that
sounds really interesting.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.840
Sure. I'll do it."

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.060
And, I thought, I don't know
what Marvel I thought he meant.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.110
[ Laughter ]

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.490
But, I just, it couldn't
possibly be "the" Marvel,

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.720
so just thought maybe it's just
like a little tiny upstart.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.460
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: The
Parisian Marvel Bakery.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.270
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yes, exactly.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.780 position:56%
And, then, my editor, Will Moss,
emailed me from Marvel, and he said,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.380
"Ta-Nehisi gave me
your email address.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.680
Let's do this thing."

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.550
And, his email was @marvel.com.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:47.340
So, I typed in marvel.com to
see if it was the real Marvel,

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.500
and it was the real Marvel.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.770
And then, I was like,
"Oh, holy shit."

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.310
And then, it was fun.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.610
It was different.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.420
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: How have you,
what's different about it?

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.780
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: The
collaborative nature of it.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.080
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Right.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.380
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: In that
you work with an artist.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.080
And so, you're just
one cog in the process,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.090
and that's actually been really
useful for me and refreshing

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.890
to not have it all on my shoulders.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:16.110
And so, I write the story, and then
the artist does the line drawings.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.590
And then, there's an
inker and a letterer,

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.190
and just watching each issue
come together was really,

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.980
really satisfying, and my editor,
Will Moss, was super helpful

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.800
because I didn't know
anything about this universe.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.600
I knew who Black Panther was, but I
didn't know about the Marvel canon,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.200
and so sometimes, I
would write storylines

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.470 position:56%
that could not have happened because
the Avengers were in New York

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.770
at that time or something.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.070
[ Laughter ]

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.560
And, he would always
know, and I would just be

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.700
like how do you know that?

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.890
It was thrilling to
work with people who are

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.900
so passionate about what they do.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.590
And, I do that, and also
at my regular books.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.740
Publishing people,
regardless of genre,

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.650
are just very passionate
about what they do.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.050
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.620
When you mention that the
people who originally looked

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:08.750
at "Difficult Women" thought it
was too dark, I know that there is,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.350
that you have fondness for
a lot of parts of culture

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.370
that are significantly more
lighthearted, Ina Garten

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.030
and Channing Tatum and
all that good stuff.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.040
[ Laughter ]

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.160
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I don't think
light thoughts about Channing.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.300
[ Laughter ]

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.150
But, we can go with that.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.670
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Differently
dark, perhaps.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.970
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yes.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.890
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Do you ever want
to spend some time writing things

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.890
that will not take you to
those same dark kind of places

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:41.470
but will be more, sort of lighter
on your, perhaps, heart to write?

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.770
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yes.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.790
My, I just sold two nonfiction
books, and they are not depressing.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.140
I told my agent, "I need
to write something happy,"

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.610
and they're not necessarily
happy, but they're positive

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.720
and not grounded in darkness.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.670
And, I'm really excited
for the opportunity

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:03.370
to just do something
different and yeah.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.510
I do have that desire, and that's
why I do a lot of humor writing

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.760
on the side, just because
it's the spoonful of sugar.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.160
And, it makes it possible
for me to go

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.320
to the dark places that
I go in my fiction.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.620
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.230
Did you, one of the things
that I remember recommending

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.870
to people was the blog
posts that you used to write

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.390
that were baking combined with.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.690
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.480
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Sort of
very personal writing.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.090
What is personal about
baking to you?

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.390
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Well,
it's so intimate.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.450
You get your hands really into
the ingredients most of the time,

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:42.230
and there's an intimacy about
preparing something for someone.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:46.150
And, even if it's yourself,
and so oftentimes, I would bake

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.520
and I would have all these
thoughts while I was baking.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.680
And, I never have a lot
of free time, so for me,

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.370
when I do take the time to cook
or bake, that's actually downtime

00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.430
and relaxing time, and it's time
for me to think and have feelings.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.730
And so, I would write these long,

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:05.530
meandering blog posts interspersing
the recipe I was making

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.220
and my feelings.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.770
And, it was fun, and that
was actually the inspiration

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.070
for "Hunger".

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.370
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.670
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: And, it turned
out that it wasn't going to work

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:14.970 position:56%
in book format as well as I thought,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.450
so "Hunger" evolved
into what it is today.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.750
But, yeah.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.050
I enjoyed those blog
posts very much.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.350
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.650
Do you know the scene
in "Bridesmaids"

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:23.950
where she makes the cupcake?

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.250
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yes.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.550
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: How do
you feel about that scene.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.850
This just popped into my head.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.150
Purely curiosity.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:30.450
I'm just seeing how it goes.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.460
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: How do I
feel about that scene?

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.620
It was fine.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.920
Yeah. I mean, I thought,
doesn't she throw it away

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.220
at the end of the scene?

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.610
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Well, she eats it,
but like miserably and alone and.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.910
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.200
I thought, the whole, that whole
storyline actually bothered me

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.620
because she had this talent and
this dream and she gave up on it.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.830
Now, she had every reason
to be down in the dumps

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.980
because her store was,
this is not a spoiler.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.470
The movie's been out forever.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.660
[ Laughter ]

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.790 position:56%
Like, she was foreclosed on, but she
could have done something different,

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.570
and it just felt like a
cop out that she wouldn't,

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.560
like, hold onto that passion.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.720
And so, that scene, and that
whole storyline depressed me,

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.020
and then when she made the cake

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.190
for the boyfriend, I
thought that was cool.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.370
[ Laughter ]

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:16.670
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.970
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: That was better
because, like, there was joy in it.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.620
But, when she was making it
for herself, it was like,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.630
oh, look how talented I am.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.270
I'm giving up on myself.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.520
It was just lazy, and I just hate
seeing women give up on themselves,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.820
even if they're not real.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.470
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.810
[ Laughter ]

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:36.200
Do you have other, I have heard
things off and on about you and TV

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.480
and movies and other things.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.880
Where do your interests
lie in that kind of stuff?

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.180
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Like
in terms of watching?

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.480
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: No, no, no.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.870
In terms of writing and making.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.390
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Well, I have, I
wrote a screenplay for my novel

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:56.640
"An Untamed State", and I'm writing
it with Gina Prince-Bythewood.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.100
And, it was supposed to be
going into production this year,

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.400
but then, fucking Marvel.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.110
[ Laughter ]

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.360
Marvel gave her a movie, and
how do you say no to Marvel.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.660
You don't.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.780 position:56%
And so, now, we're probably going to
go into production in February 2019.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.080
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: I forgot
you were part of the "Love

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.620
and Basketball" renaissance.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.920
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yes.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.220
I was.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.520
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: That, which is
a Gina Prince-Bythewood movie.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.820
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Movie.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.120
It's my favorite, one
of my favorite movies.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.420
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: 2000.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.720
One of my favorite movies.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I had the opportunity
to do a talk back with a director

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.840
and screen their movie at The
Silent Theater in Los Angeles,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.420
and so that's how I
ended up meeting her.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.130
And, I just thought she
was incredibly talented,

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.830
and when my producers
asked me who do I want

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.470
to direct the movie,
I had one choice.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.770
And, she was it.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.270
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: What do you
think it is about that movie?

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.570
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: It's romantic.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:43.990
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: It is romantic.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:48.960
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: It's romantic
and the ending is perfect.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.540
The ending, I thought,
was really groundbreaking.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:55.600
And, I think, sadly, it's still
groundbreaking that I don't want,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.960
this is one I'm not going to
give away if you haven't seen it.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.280
Because I don't want to take
that away from you guys.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.410
But, it's just a beautifully
written movie.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.710
It's tender.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.090
It doesn't try to be
more than it is.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.070
It's a romantic, not comedy.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:11.550
It's a romantic drama with comedy,
and it's just beautifully done.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.460
So, I have written that screenplay,

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.210
and I'm going to write
some other movies.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.420
And, I also, I'm writing a TV show.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.950
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: So,
it doesn't sound

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.520
like you're going to
get a lot less busy.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.820
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: No, I'm not.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.120
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Anytime soon.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.420
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I'm not.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.810
We're actually piloting right
now, and that's exciting.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:35.750
And, I hope it gets picked
up for a series, and I mean,

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.060
I hope the pilot even gets made.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.710
I mean, we're at the very
beginning of the process,

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.390
but it's going to be great.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:45.640
It's through Amazon, and it's being
produced by Freedom Road Pictures

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.620
which is Common's production
company.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:53.070
And, I think we're going
to make a really good show.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:54.660
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Just before
we go on, I'm going to tell you

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.100
that in about, like,
maybe four minutes or so,

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.600
we're going to do some Q and
A. The microphones are here.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.420
You're welcome to line up.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.310
Please be aware that we're going
to have a limited time for Q and A,

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.690
so please make sure the
question is a question.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.560
I know that sounds mean, but if
you've sat at a lot of Q and As,

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.440
you know what I'm talking about.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.790
Ask Roxane a question, and
I, and she will share things

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.540
that will be meaningful
to everybody in the room.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.660
And, just be understanding of
the fact that we're only going

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.140
to have time for so many questions.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.410
So. But, if you want to
line up, that's cool,

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:31.330
and that way we can get started as
soon as we're read to get started.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.350
So, do you still like teaching?

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.560
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I love teaching.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.860
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.160
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I do.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.510
But, I hate Indiana.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.130
[ Laughter ]

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.090
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: What do
you hate about Indiana?

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.740
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: What's not to hate?

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.080
[ Laughter ]

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.950
Sorry. It's Indiana, and I'm black.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.210
So, that should sum it up for you.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.510
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.810
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: It's just
a lousy place, and I,

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.980 position:56%
my dad is always like, "Be careful."

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.880
I'm like, "Be careful of what?"

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.390
I hate Indiana.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.740
It's not the Midwest.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.040
I'm from Nebraska.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.340
I love Nebraska.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.140
Indiana and I have not gotten
along since I moved there.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.570
It's a challenging place.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.830
I live in Lafayette which
is in the middle of nowhere,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.630
and it's a reasonably sized town.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.510
There's a Chipotle, but.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:22.060
[ Laughter ]

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.950
It's a small town, and
it's really insular.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.110 position:56%
And, it's hard to break in, in
terms of the social circles in town.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.950
There's very little to do.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.080
The clan is very alive and well.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.320
The confederacy is alive and well.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.550
White supremacists drive
down the street openly,

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.850
and they don't hide it.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:44.170
And, it's not a place where I feel
safe, and that's the first time

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.750
in my life I've ever lived in
a place where I feel unsafe.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.300 position:56%
It's the first time in my life where
I've ever considered buying a gun.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.240
It's an open carry state.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.990
And, they openly carry.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.960
It's just, I find it uncomfortable.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.750
Purdue is fine.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.280
I love my students.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.250
The Purdue students
are incredibly bright

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.760
and engaging and a true delight.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.770
Actually, I have a really
great class this semester.

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:13.990 position:56%
So, the teaching is really good, but
your job can't be your only thing.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.730
And, again, like turning 40
really changed things for me

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:22.650
where I was just like I don't have
to be unhappy where I live anymore.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.910
And so, I don't know how much
longer I'm going to teach.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:30.010
Not because I don't love it, but
also because you can't do it all.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.930
And so, I teach once a week
on Mondays, and then I travel

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.290
for the rest of the week.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.050
Most of the time, I'm in
a long-distance situation.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:42.630
So, I live part-time in L.A.,
and I'm a little over that.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.290
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Would L.A.
be a good place to live?

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.590
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.890
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: You think?

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.190
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I'm
going to move there.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:49.490
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Yeah.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.790
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.090
Oh, I guess I should be
quite, "I'm moving to L.A."

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.390
[ Laughter ]

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.690
Full-time.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:55.990
I just don't know when.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.290
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: Fair enough.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:58.590
All right.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.890
Let's do some Q and A. Should
we take some questions?

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.190
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yes.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.490
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: All right.

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.790
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: We have a sign.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.090
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes: We have a sign.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.390
I know, right?

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.690
Let's go over there first.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.990
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name's Lyric.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.290
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Lyric?

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Lyric, like.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.890
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: That's lovely.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.490
I wanted to say thank
you for coming,

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.790
and I really enjoyed
hearing you talk.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.090
And, I wanted to talk
to you about giving up.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.390
Like you said with the
scene in the "Bridesmaids",

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.760
like I hate it when women give up.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.830
And, I feel like with what
you're talking about now

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.630
with the resurgence of white
supremacists being in public,

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.570
a lot of women, especially
black women don't feel,

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:36.310 position:56%
I guess the fortitude to keep on
fighting the good fight so to speak.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.860
And so, what would you say, and
would you even feel responsible

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.750
for saying anything responsive?

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.050
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: That's
a great question.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.780
Black women have every right
to give up at this point

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.430
in terms of the political fight.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.490
We did what we were supposed to do.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:50.970
We voted.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.150
[ Applause ]

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:57.050
94% of black women voted for
Hillary Clinton even though a vote

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.660
for Hillary Clinton
was, for many of us,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.710
a vote against our own interests.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.480
And, I say that as a
fan of Hillary Clinton.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.010
And, I think we've always been
there, and we've always fought.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.960
And, that's why so many of us
opted out of the women's march

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.930 position:56%
because we marched whenever you were
killing our friends and our husbands

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:19.920
and our sons and our fathers,
and white women rarely showed up.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.390
And, white men rarely showed up.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.310
And, how many more
times do we have to show

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.850
up when no one has our backs.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.900
If you want to give up,
I support you entirely.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.890
I really do.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.200
At the same time, I think

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:41.320
that sometimes you just give
up for now, not forever.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:47.220
You give up enough to recharge
because you know that our children,

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.560
our nieces and nephews our
neighbors need us to keep fighting

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.770
so that we're not having these same
fights two generations from now.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.880
So, it's a balance of finding
that time to take care of yourself

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.630
and recharge and also recognizing
it's no longer all on us.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.510
Other people need to step up now.

&gt;&gt; Hi. Thanks for coming.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:17.750
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Hi.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.050
&gt;&gt; This is [inaudible]
interesting question.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:23.000
But, I'm interested in, like, what
your processes are as a writer,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.520
especially with, like, doing
this really emotional memoir.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.470
Like, do you write in blocks?

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.830
How did you decide what to
write and what not to write?

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.130
Etc.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.650
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah, I don't
have a writing process, really.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.500
I just write.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:43.100
The, for this book in particular,
I mostly wrote it from August 2016

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:48.430 position:56%
to February 2017 after dragging my
heals and writing a few pieces of it

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.860
in the three years prior.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:55.940
And so, I was writing it while
teaching and living and being

00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:00.060
on the road and, so I would
just make myself sit down

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.470
and write in large blocks.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.850
I tend to be, I write every day,
but when I'm really writing,

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.650
I go for hours at a time.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.680
And, I enjoy that very much.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.100
And, as I said earlier,
I had a focus.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.730
Did it connect to my body or not?

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.410
And, if it didn't, I knew
that it had to come out.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:18.170
And, that really helped
me in terms of focus.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:21.970
I also did a lot of looking through
the blog posts that I had written

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:26.540
about food and body and looked
at what themes I wanted to take

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.550
from that and bring into the book.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.440
I did quite a lot of
research, and sadly,

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.030
a lot of those chapters
didn't make it

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.000
into the final book about fatness.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.770
And, it was just, that stuff
was more appropriate for, like,

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.590
a straight nonfiction
instead of a memoir book.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:45.290
So, I made choices in that regard,
but mostly, I just wrote as often

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.730
as I could when I could
when I got down to the point

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.070
where my editor was like,
"If we want to hit June,

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.410
you're going to have
to turn the book in."

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.510
And, I was like, "Oh,
stop making sense."

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.000
&gt;&gt; Linda Holmes, you
made a comment about how

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.880 position:56%
when someone writes a memoir, people
feel like they can give advice,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.180
and I thought that was interesting

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.650
because there's another memoir
that's come out in the past year

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.740 position:56%
or two that I won't name by a
young, white man growing up in Ohio.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.120 position:56%
That somehow his growing up
experience, he now gets asked about,

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.430
like, food stamps and Medicaid
which he is not a policy expert on.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:20.900

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.560
&gt;&gt; He's doing a lot, and
that's a conversation.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.380
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: I believe
I've heard of this book, yes.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.870
&gt;&gt; Yes. And, I was
wondering if you could talk

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:38.050
about the different relationship
you've seen between your memoir

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.370
and giving advice and
getting advice as opposed

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.230
to other memoirs that
have been released.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.530
Thank you.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.830
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yeah.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.230
You know, the challenge
with my memoir is

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.830
that the media oftentimes likes
to find a singular narrative,

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.740
and so several people in the
media have tried to position me

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:58.820
as a fat activist and
as the fat activist.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.910
And, the issue with that is

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:04.970
that there have been fat activists
working in this space for decades,

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:08.730
and their work should not be
ignored or overlooked simply

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:13.470
because I wrote a book that is not
a piece of activism inherently,

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.650
or explicitly, that is
explicitly a memoir.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.940
And, implicitly, I think whenever
you write about the black body,

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.010
you're doing some sort of
activism, but is, you know,

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.490
that wasn't its first goal.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:30.890
And so, that's been really
frustrating, and I've also just,

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.200
again, as I've said earlier,

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.490
received so much advice
about weight loss.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:38.000
I even wrote a blog post about all

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.660
of the stupid things
people have suggested to me.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.490
One of the things this
book has shown me is

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.520
that people really do
believe fat people are stupid.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.540
They genuinely believe that we
don't know anything about diet,

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.080
but the reality is that fat
people know about exercise, diet,

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.640 position:56%
and weight loss, and we know it all.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.110
We know it all because
we've tried it all.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:01.120
We've read all the books.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.160
There's nothing I don't know, and
I also, and it doesn't even need

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.500
to be said, but I have two
nutritionists and a trainer.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.800
I'm good.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.220
[ Laughter ]

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.520
I don't need the advice.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.170
I'm fine, and so it's
been really frustrating

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.950
to see how I haven't
been given the benefit

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:24.790
of the doubt while the
Ohio man, we'll call him,

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.780
is being seen as an
expert on something

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.100
because he wrote about
growing up poor.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.810
And now, people are trying to
position him to run for the Senate,

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.030
and like, watch whiteness work.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.040
[ Laughter ]

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.790
Like, you, like, I write
a book about the body,

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:46.260 position:56%
and people talk to me like I'm four.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:50.460
And, this dude writes a book about
growing up poor, and respectfully,

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.760
I'm sure it's a good book.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.690
But, like, he's treated
as an expert.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:56.680
Like, you know, I just
met an expert,

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.510

wrote "Evicted."

And, I cannot recommend
that book enough.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.180
It taught me so much about what
American poverty is truly looking

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.350
like these days and
the insidious ways

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:14.100
in which we are infrastructurally
designed to keep poor people poor.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.030
Like, he's an actual
expert, and that is a man

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.330
that we should be running

including the Presidency.

because I recognize
it for what it is.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.750
I watched the season
of "The Bachelorette".

but my tour schedule was
relentless, so I couldn't.

I saved it on my DVR,

and I'm not watching it specifically

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.250
because of what happened
between Mario, was it?

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.550
It's DeMario.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.380

&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: And Corinne.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.260 position:56%
The way they framed it, they made
it seem like DeMario committed rape.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.500
And, to do that to a
black man in a country

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.280
that is actively hunting
black men is so irresponsible.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.100
And, that it was a white producer

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.350
that reported it was
racism right there.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:02.790 position:56%
And, then, Corinne did not dissuade
anyone until the video evidence came

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.270
out that she was lying,
and I'm sorry,

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.400
but this is why you have
to know your history.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.690
This is how Emmett Till
began, and so we can laugh

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:13.220
and say, "Oh, it's silliness.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.520
It's just 'The Bachelor'".

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.700
But, it's not just "The Bachelor"
because she put DeMario's life

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.940
at risk, and that was unacceptable.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.800
We know he's trash from
"The Bachelorette",

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.730
but he's trash for being a cheater.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.850
He's not a rapist, and
there, he's allowed to cheat.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.190
That's what people do.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.490
It's not a man thing.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:30.790
It's not a woman thing.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.590
It's a human thing, and for
him to be defamed like that.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.030
He's never going to
get his name back,

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.390
and you can't put a
price on your name.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.600
So, I think it's a disgrace,
and I do not know if I'm going

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.380
to watch the next season of
"The Bachelor" because of it.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.830
Because they haven't apologized.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.410
They've done nothing to
rectify the situation.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:52.090
Once they discovered that
he had done nothing wrong,

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:56.050
they didn't even really come out
and defend him for what they did.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.850
And, you know, I think that
sometimes we have to vote

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.550
with our advertising dollars,

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.290
and I think it would be
a really nice statement

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.530
to show them you cannot do this.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:54.910
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: That's a good
question, but I don't know.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:58.760 position:56%
I think we're seeing a lot of weird
retrenchment happening right now not

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.650
only in terms of niche sites
like "The Butter" and "The Toast"

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:08.720
but even, like MTV was doing some
really great prose based journalism

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.800
and cultural criticism, and
then they pivoted to video.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.710
And, several other sites
have fallen, followed suite,

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:20.260
and those are mic.com
is pivoting to video.

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.860
And, I never watch video online.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.050 position:56%
The minute the video starts
loading, I move on to something else

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.800
because I don't have
that kind of time.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.830
I can read faster than
your stupid video can play,

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.920
and I also get more from reading.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.630
If I want to watch TV,
I'm going to watch it

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:35.540
on my 70-inch screen
because I'm old.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.370
I'm not going to look at
my phone and watch a movie.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.700
Get a grip.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.000
I'm sorry.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.640
I have a whole thing about that.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.840
So, I don't know where our
voices are going to go.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.450
I really don't, and I'm
really worried about it,

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:53.830
and I think that we need
to continue creating sites

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.890
where our voices can thrive.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.890
But, it's so hard to sustain.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.210
Nicole and Mallory closed

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:03.370
"The Toast" even though
it was a successful site

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.440
because it was not sustainable.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.450
And, it's not sustainable
because they had steady traffic,

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:13.250 position:56%
but it wasn't enough to sustain what
was happening, I mean to pay writers

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.860
which you need to be able to do.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.180
So, I don't know.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.480
It's a frustrating thing.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hello. First of all, I would just

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.090
like to thank you so
much for coming.

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.850
So, I'm here with my friend

majors at Howard University.

Thank you.

I know this is a broad question, and
feel free to take your time on it.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.810
But.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.610
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Well, thank you.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:43.330
[ Laughter ]

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.630
&gt;&gt; So, yeah.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.900
So, I come back and report
to my friend and write this

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.580
up for an assignment as
a co-curricular activity.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.730
I want to ask you why is it
important that young women

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.950 position:56%
of color just continue telling their
stories and all of their iterations.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.250
&gt;&gt; Roxane Gay: Yes.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.550
Good question.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.540
Why should women of color
continue telling their stories?

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:06.480
I think that we have to
continue making people aware

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.700
of what our lives are like.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.560
For so long, there has
only been one standard,

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.930
and that is of the
white middle class.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:17.460
So, even impoverished white people
haven't necessarily had their

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.760
stories told.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.940
People with disabilities
haven't had their stories told.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.380
Queer people, people of color.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:27.800
I think anyone who isn't considered
part of the mainstream or the norm,

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.260
even though we are the norm,
needs to write our story

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.870
so that we become the norm.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:34.440
And, when you look at the shifting
demographics of this country,

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.520
we are becoming the norm, and yet,
our stories go untold and unheard.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.100
And, when we do tell our stories,

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.480
people act like we've
done something,

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.690
like, majorly groundbreaking.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:48.980
And, it almost gets overinflated
because they're so surprised,

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:53.700 position:56%
especially for black women, that you
can string together two sentences.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.000
Like, I have a PhD.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.910
I hope, I hope I can string
together two sentences or three.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:03.880
And so, I think that's why
because you need to be heard,

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.370
and our stories need
to be seen as part

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.870
of the norm, as part of the main.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:15.510
We are not unknowable, and
we are not so different

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:21.170
as to be unwelcome in this world.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.470
