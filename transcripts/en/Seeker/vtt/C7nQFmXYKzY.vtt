00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:01.989
Information wants to be free!

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.380
But if that free information is a calorie
count for my favorite donut, then lock it

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.310
up! Lock it up!

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.599
You know what i mean?

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.190
We are living in the ultimate age of information
… you’re watching this video because you

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.210
have access to an awesome portal of collective
knowledge called the internet.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.500
And having more information can often help
us make better choices.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.230
Which is all well and good except for the
fact that humans are not always information

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.230
seekers.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.760
Sometimes we even avoid information that could
help us!

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.500
For instance, you probably have an idea about
how much money you’ve spent lately, but

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.980
you might avoid actually looking at your bank
account so you don’t see the exact amounts

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.230
you splurged on a new purse.The information
is riiight there, but you just don’t want

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.230
to know.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.719
And not knowing might have consequences.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.859
This psychological phenomenon is called “active
information avoidance.”

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.850
You’re actively avoiding information when
these three things happen: you know the information

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.199
exists, it could be costly to avoid, but you
still go out of your way to ignore it.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.799
A recent paper from Carnegie Mellon University
found that people have a wide variety of strategies

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.190
to avoid information and they do it to protect
themselves...And this seems like a no-brainer,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.140
people avoid information that might be painful
to receive.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.250
We don’t want to know how many calories
are in that hot fudge sundae because we want

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.250
it and it looks amazing.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.439
We don’t want to know it’s 1,000 calories
because knowing that number might deter us

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.340
from having it.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.439
Might.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.029
Avoiding the calorie counts in a dessert happens,
we all do it because we need to live a little

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:39.079
... but what are the consequences of avoiding
something more serious… like medical issues?

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.969
Another study looked at people who were at
risk for Huntington's Disease, a fatal brain

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.609
disorder, and found that a large fraction
of people avoided getting tested.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.890
Carnegie Mellon researchers called this: an
optimism bubble.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.890
Basically, people won’t get tested because
they want to live their lives without fear

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.689
or consequence; they don't want their bubble
bursted.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.610
This is why people don’t get tested for
cancer, why people don’t follow the news

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.499
-- they want to live in a optimism bubble!

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.200
But… living there isn’t living in reality
-- think about sexually transmitted infections.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.900
If i’m living in my optimism bubble, I could
be infecting others.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.849
And speaking of bubbles -- this extends to
how we reinterpret information that counters

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:20.849
our beliefs.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.170
For example, there’s a growing body of scientific
research that is widely available disproving

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.330
the link between vaccines and autism.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.260
And yet, a bunch of unscientific websites
linking the two are cited by people who already

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.870
believe vaccines cause autism.So even if the
data is right there, it will be discounted

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.019
if it goes against what people want to believe.

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.909
Active Information Avoidance is a psychological
protection strategy because we’ve spent

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.650
months or years building brain pathways and
patterns of behavior around our worldview.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.909
Changing those pathways takes energy and work
-- it causes stress, and uncertainty!

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.470
Avoiding it is so much easier (though not
necessarily better).

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.720
So what should we do about this?

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.740
How do we break out of being active information
avoiders?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.519
Well, according to the researchers at Carnegie
Mellon, if you want to change someone’s

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.660
mind make a personal relationship with them
first!

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.180
If you form a meaningful relationship with
a friend you could maybe remind them to get their prostate checked

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.689
for cancer, or breast cancer checks. You could remind them to keep tabs on their finances

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.319
Or, maybe not to eat that sundae.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.280
If you know you’re avoiding information
-- maybe try and work a little hard to, well,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.280
not.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.880
For example, you might try and avoid information
about why New York has the best bagels.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880
Water?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.880
Location?

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.880
Tradition?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880
It’s a debate.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.720
I LOVE bagels.Thrillist just launched a brand
new show Food/Groups.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.939
My buddy Dave hits up a cast of food experts
as they hunt down a dish that’s authentically

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.150
tied to a different neighborhood, nationality,
or lifestyle.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.819
Check out his bagel adventure here I love
Essa, that place.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.820
Omg.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.800
But let’s say you’re in an argument, and
you want to convince your friend you’re

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.740
right -- science has the best way to do that!

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.880
In this video over here.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.819
What information do you definitely avoid?

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.759
