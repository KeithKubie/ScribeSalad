1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.870
Um,

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.550
w w what are your thoughts on if you have any about the startups that are

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:10.551
actually taking the blood of young people and in injecting it into the bodies of

4
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:12.624
older folks?

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.000
So I don't think there's a scientific reason to say it won't work.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.490
And the scientists who were involved or some of my great colleagues,

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.590
very smart people.
Have you ever done it?
No.
No.
That's a bit extreme for me,

8
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:30.000
but I think it could work,
right?
It's just a little bit out there for me.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.560
But what they're going to do,

10
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:35.100
what they're doing actually is treating people with neurological disorders.
Um,

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.360
a lot of these startups,
and I'm involved in probably 15 startups right now.

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.670
What we're trying to do is to treat diseases of aging,
uh,

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.330
and even rare childhood diseases because you can't treat it aging,
uh,

14
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
as a business model.
There is no disease called aging yet.
Right.
But anyway,

15
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.360
came back to the science.
I think that it's based on solid science,

16
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.493
but the future is,

17
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.420
is I think a better way to go about this is to find what the actual molecules

18
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.770
are in the blood.
And just make those,
don't give the whole kitten caboodle.

19
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.410
Yeah.
And when you said this twice,

20
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.730
you think aging is a disease or maybe perhaps should be treated as a disease or

21
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:15.510
classified?
Oh,
absolutely.
Think aging should be classified as disease.

22
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.460
We should think of it as a disease.
I mean,
why,
why shouldn't we?

23
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.670
Everything else that goes on in the body over time that's bad for us is

24
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.330
considered a disease.
Do you know why aging isn't considered a disease?

25
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.270
Because it happens to everybody.
Exactly.
That's the only reason.
Well,

26
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:33.870
it happens to most people.
90% of people in the developed world.

27
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.440
But why is that a reason to say,
oh,
it's natural.
We should just deal with it.

28
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.130
We used to say that about cancer and we used to say it about dying from an

29
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:44.880
infection.
When you say it happens to 90% of the people in the developed world,

30
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.480
what happens?
The other 10 they die.
Hit bypass,
I guess.
Oh,
okay.

31
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.100
I see what you're saying.
So they die young.
Yeah.
Okay.
Just clarifying.

32
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.010
Um,
yeah,
I agree.
I mean it's,
I mean,
this ease,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a problem,
right?

33
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.873
Aging is a problem.

34
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.650
I saw an old gentleman yesterday and it was painful just to watch this poor guy

35
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.940
walk,
um,
you know,

36
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.900
hunched over and just struggling to move at an incredibly slow pace.

37
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:12.780
That seems like a person with the disease.
Well,

38
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:16.770
it is an imagine if we were on a planet now,
um,
or you know,

39
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.650
an island where everybody leaves 300 years.
Uh,

40
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.200
and we'd show up and you and I in our,
you know,
Midlife,

41
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.650
we signed to look old already.
They are going to look at us and say,

42
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.670
what is wrong with you guys?
We need to treat you urgently.

43
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:32.910
We need to call this a new type of syndrome.
Right?

44
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:36.450
And it's only because we all tend to go through this,

45
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:37.740
that we think it's acceptable.

46
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.250
But I would argue it's the biggest threat to the health care system is the

47
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:45.180
biggest threat to the world's economy,
actually,

48
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.100
is the inability of us to treat people in their old age and keep them healthy.

49
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.051
Now,

50
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:56.940
some people look at it a different way and their consideration is that there's

51
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:59.380
an overpopulation problem as it is.

52
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.120
And folks like you want to want to walk around and live in to be 300 years old

53
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.170
and have a gang of kids,
you can create a mess.
Right?

54
00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:13.310
Well I have three kids.
That's enough.
That's more than I was going to have.

55
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.670
Uh,
but yeah,
it,
we do you have to do the math though?

56
00:03:16.671 --> 00:03:18.880
How much would the population grow?
And

57
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.600
I'm actually working with a number of people to try and calculate this.

58
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.230
A couple of economists in London,
um,
that we're working on.

59
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.030
So this is this really a problem.
I agree with you that if this comes in,

60
00:03:32.031 --> 00:03:35.000
I would actually say when this comes,
when this company,
this is,
I mean,

61
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:38.750
it's coming.
There's,
there's dozens of companies working on drugs,
uh,

62
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.720
the scientists here.
So let's say it's coming anyway,

63
00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.780
so we have to deal with this.
How are we going to deal with it?
Well,

64
00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.850
let's first of all understand what the future looks like.

65
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.070
We can't look backwards.
All right?

66
00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:52.130
Cause no one's ever invented this stuff before.
So we have to look forwards.

67
00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:55.190
What's the world look like?
Um,
in terms of population,

68
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.810
it's not as bad as you might think.

69
00:03:56.811 --> 00:04:01.811
If you stopped aging today and everybody just went on forever,

70
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.140
the population growth rate would be less than the rate of immigration.

71
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.000
Now that's not,
I can go on forever of course.

72
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.260
But what we find is as people healthier,
especially in developing nations,

73
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.340
they have fewer kids.

74
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.640
So the calculation shows that it would eventually taper off.

75
00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:23.480
So the human population will taper off about nine to 10 billion people and in

76
00:04:23.481 --> 00:04:26.150
stay there and that population will be the happiest,

77
00:04:26.151 --> 00:04:29.080
healthiest people in the world.
But now they predict that,

78
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.780
cause I was having this conversation with someone the other day,

79
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:36.781
that as people become more affluent and society becomes more urban,

80
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.800
people will have less and less children and the population will stabilize.

81
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:44.780
Is that the theory behind this?
Right.
And we'll actually,

82
00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:46.970
education is a major part of that as well.
Yeah.

83
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.620
Women's education is the main thing.
Uh,
but also just being healthy or,

84
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.300
um,
lifts the,
the wealth of a nation.
And by women's education,

85
00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.680
do you mean extended education so that they,
they pursue careers?

86
00:05:00.681 --> 00:05:03.030
Is that the the idea or is it,
I mean,

87
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.820
obviously most people understand how babies are made.
Like where,
where's,

88
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.380
where's the education contributing to a lower population?
Well,

89
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:13.380
so my understanding is that the first thing you do if you,

90
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.500
if you educate young women is that they can make choices for themselves and

91
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:18.930
they're not just subjugated.
Uh,
you know,

92
00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:22.100
most men would like to have more subtle,
right?

93
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.590
So you're thinking of like third world and write the real developing hope.

94
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.840
But that's where the population is a real problem in Europe.

95
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.010
They actually are struggling to keep up with their population,
uh,
you know,
with,

96
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.370
they've got an aging tsunami,
so to speak.
Same with Japan.

97
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:38.250
The average farmer in Japan is 65 years old.
They got a real problem.

98
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.050
China's about to head that way too.

99
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.320
And that's going to drag the economy of the planet down and it's gonna be a real

100
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:43.950
problem.

101
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.040
We're going to waste so much money on keeping older people alive for the last 10

102
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:51.150
20 years of their life with dementia.
Frailty,
that could be trillions of dollars,

103
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.710
just $50 trillion just in this country alone that could be spent on figuring out

104
00:05:55.711 --> 00:06:00.020
how to solve global warming,
better education,
the environment,

105
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.740
saving the,
the one third species that are becoming threatened.

106
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.040
That that's why I think tackling aging isn't a selfish act.

107
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.980
It's probably the most generous Dec action that I could give the planet.

108
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.680
That's an interesting way of looking at it.
