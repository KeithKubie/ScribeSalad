SONYA HAYDEN: I love songwriting, and
particularly songwriting

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.670
for musical theater because
it's all about telling a story.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.420
So the music is helping
to tell the story,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.250
the lyrics are helping
to tell the story,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.960
the libretto is helping
to tell the story.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.800
So it's all organically
combining to --

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.080
for the purpose of
telling a story.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.450
And so I really
love that process

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.570
of thinking about how is each
note and each song really going

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.350
to help forward the story?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.430
Why am I making these choices?

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.230
What music would
work best with this?

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.520
What am I saying lyrically?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.840
Last semester I took a course
with Stacy Wolf and a couple

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.680
of guest lecturers from the
New York University Musical

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.290
Theatre Writing
program, one of whom

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.810
is a Princeton alum, Robert Lee.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.380
And we talked all about
how to write musicals.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.460
So all of this has been
really helpful in writing

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.150
my thesis, which is a musical,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.380
an original musical.
The title of the show

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.570
is "The Luckiest Girl".

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.740
And there's a song
called "Lucky Girl"

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.530
in which the
protagonist is thinking

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.340
all about how lucky she is to
be getting ready for her wedding

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.130
and she, of course, is
feeling unsure about

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.400
whether this is the right
decision to be making.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.970
And in order to find
my way into that song

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.510
I was thinking about how
incredibly lucky, on one hand,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.900
I am to be here at Princeton.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.980
But I think that
sometimes, here, there

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.600
are so many demands, and
so much is expected of you,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.420
and sometimes it can feel hard
to meet all those expectations.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.210
So that was sort of might
way into writing that song,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.670
was from these
personal experiences

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.330
of being at Princeton and
thinking about how lucky I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.980
am to be here.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.030
