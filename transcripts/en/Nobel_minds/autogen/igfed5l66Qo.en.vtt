you

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950
 
 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.549
 
friendly Dean you mentioned that

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559
friendly Dean you mentioned that
 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.509
friendly Dean you mentioned that
nowadays the chemistry is in this

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519
nowadays the chemistry is in this
 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.060
nowadays the chemistry is in this
cyberspace I thought it's far away I

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070
cyberspace I thought it's far away I
 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.710
cyberspace I thought it's far away I
thought that chemistry is just in

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720
thought that chemistry is just in
 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.540
thought that chemistry is just in
laboratories well of course chemistry is

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550
laboratories well of course chemistry is
 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.839
laboratories well of course chemistry is
an experimental science but what has

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849
an experimental science but what has
 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.850
an experimental science but what has
happened over the past few years it's

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860
happened over the past few years it's
 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.350
happened over the past few years it's
it's really a fascinating development

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360
it's really a fascinating development
 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.310
it's really a fascinating development
when I was a young chemist theoreticians

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320
when I was a young chemist theoreticians
 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.770
when I was a young chemist theoreticians
would come to us with ideas about how

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780
would come to us with ideas about how
 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.740
would come to us with ideas about how
system behaved and if they if their

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750
system behaved and if they if their
 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.440
system behaved and if they if their
predictions would scan with our

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450
predictions would scan with our
 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.460
predictions would scan with our
experiments and they would be happy if

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470
experiments and they would be happy if
 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.260
experiments and they would be happy if
the two did not agree we were always

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270
the two did not agree we were always
 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.520
the two did not agree we were always
sure that that there are teachers were

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530
sure that that there are teachers were
 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.240
sure that that there are teachers were
wrong again today when theoreticians

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250
wrong again today when theoreticians
 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.140
wrong again today when theoreticians
come with the prediction that we cannot

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150
come with the prediction that we cannot
 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.330
come with the prediction that we cannot
prove is correct or disprove well

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340
prove is correct or disprove well
 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.610
prove is correct or disprove well
normally we as experimentalists go back

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620
normally we as experimentalists go back
 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.340
normally we as experimentalists go back
and check our experiments again because

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350
and check our experiments again because
 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.310
and check our experiments again because
it may just as likely be we who are in

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320
it may just as likely be we who are in
 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.060
it may just as likely be we who are in
the wrong today this is how far

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070
the wrong today this is how far
 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.709
the wrong today this is how far
theoretical chemistry has come to become

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719
theoretical chemistry has come to become
 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.209
theoretical chemistry has come to become
one of the tools i would say of

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219
one of the tools i would say of
 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.969
one of the tools i would say of
experimental science because the sort of

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979
experimental science because the sort of
 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.160
experimental science because the sort of
theoretical chemistry that this year's

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170
theoretical chemistry that this year's
 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.739
theoretical chemistry that this year's
low rates have been laying the

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749
low rates have been laying the
 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:23.289
low rates have been laying the
foundation for our simulations they're

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299
foundation for our simulations they're
 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.319
foundation for our simulations they're
really numerical experiments that tell

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329
really numerical experiments that tell
 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.719
really numerical experiments that tell
us a lot about how chemical systems work

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729
us a lot about how chemical systems work
 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.489
us a lot about how chemical systems work
so I would say to us Theory has become

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499
so I would say to us Theory has become
 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.060
so I would say to us Theory has become
the new experiments

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070
the new experiments
 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.040
the new experiments
what's happened then what made the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050
what's happened then what made the
 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.710
what's happened then what made the
theory to be in this role now definitely

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
theory to be in this role now definitely
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.940
theory to be in this role now definitely
the contribution of this year's

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950
the contribution of this year's
 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.130
the contribution of this year's
laureates is central to that because

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140
laureates is central to that because
 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.980
laureates is central to that because
what they have done is marrying the two

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990
what they have done is marrying the two
 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.890
what they have done is marrying the two
worlds of quantum physics and classical

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900
worlds of quantum physics and classical
 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.830
worlds of quantum physics and classical
physics quantum physics will really

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840
physics quantum physics will really
 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.140
physics quantum physics will really
provide us with all the answers that we

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150
provide us with all the answers that we
 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.780
provide us with all the answers that we
could possibly look for quantum physics

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790
could possibly look for quantum physics
 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.200
could possibly look for quantum physics
has the wonderful ability to stop time

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210
has the wonderful ability to stop time
 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.830
has the wonderful ability to stop time
and to expand space so that we can look

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840
and to expand space so that we can look
 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.130
and to expand space so that we can look
at the tiniest detail of a system and we

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140
at the tiniest detail of a system and we
 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.590
at the tiniest detail of a system and we
can look at this during any fraction of

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600
can look at this during any fraction of
 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.040
can look at this during any fraction of
time that we choose the problem is that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050
time that we choose the problem is that
 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.650
time that we choose the problem is that
the demands on computer power are

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660
the demands on computer power are
 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.680
the demands on computer power are
immense and it's completely impractical

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690
immense and it's completely impractical
 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.420
immense and it's completely impractical
to use this for any system of size

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
to use this for any system of size
 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.979
to use this for any system of size
therefore we have to use classical

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989
therefore we have to use classical
 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.530
therefore we have to use classical
physics to describe the bulk of the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540
physics to describe the bulk of the
 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.390
physics to describe the bulk of the
system and it turned out that to marry

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400
system and it turned out that to marry
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.210
system and it turned out that to marry
these two is no simple matter and it

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220
these two is no simple matter and it
 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.370
these two is no simple matter and it
really took a large concerted effort

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380
really took a large concerted effort
 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.020
really took a large concerted effort
over a number of years to show that it

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030
over a number of years to show that it
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.729
over a number of years to show that it
was even possible which is of course

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739
was even possible which is of course
 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.430
was even possible which is of course
what the laureates get quantum physics

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440
what the laureates get quantum physics
 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.229
what the laureates get quantum physics
is a lot about probabilities and mystics

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239
is a lot about probabilities and mystics
 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.460
is a lot about probabilities and mystics
is this a difficulty yes quantum physics

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470
is this a difficulty yes quantum physics
 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.520
is this a difficulty yes quantum physics
is one way of parameterizing the world

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530
is one way of parameterizing the world
 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.870
is one way of parameterizing the world
classical mechanics is a completely

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880
classical mechanics is a completely
 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.000
classical mechanics is a completely
different way of giving a model for

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
different way of giving a model for
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.810
different way of giving a model for
basically the same system now one thing

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820
basically the same system now one thing
 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.569
basically the same system now one thing
is that you can make the two and compare

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579
is that you can make the two and compare
 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.910
is that you can make the two and compare
them and that works beautifully the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920
them and that works beautifully the
 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.580
them and that works beautifully the
problem is to take one part of a system

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590
problem is to take one part of a system
 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.280
problem is to take one part of a system
and describe it in terms of quantum

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290
and describe it in terms of quantum
 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.110
and describe it in terms of quantum
physics and another part of the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120
physics and another part of the
 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.690
physics and another part of the
chemistry of the system and describe it

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700
chemistry of the system and describe it
 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.630
chemistry of the system and describe it
in terms of classical physics you then

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640
in terms of classical physics you then
 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.660
in terms of classical physics you then
have to find the correct boundaries to

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670
have to find the correct boundaries to
 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.990
have to find the correct boundaries to
put between the two systems and to use

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000
put between the two systems and to use
 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.330
put between the two systems and to use
the input from the classical mechanics

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340
the input from the classical mechanics

and vice versa and this means that we

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290
and vice versa and this means that we
 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.289
and vice versa and this means that we
can look at systems of I shouldn't say

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299
can look at systems of I shouldn't say
 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.890
can look at systems of I shouldn't say
any size but we can look at vastly more

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900
any size but we can look at vastly more
 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.300
any size but we can look at vastly more
larger systems and more complicated

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310
larger systems and more complicated
 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.789
larger systems and more complicated
systems and this is of course what we

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799
systems and this is of course what we
 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.400
