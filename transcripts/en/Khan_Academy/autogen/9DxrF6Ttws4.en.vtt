00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.670
 Let's show some examples of equation solving. 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.110
 You will see the equations in this video. 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.320
 This will not require a lot of steps, but I really do 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.970
 I want to focus on what is really happening on 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.020
 Equation, and why it makes sense I follow the steps that 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.910
 We do it. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.495
 This is the first equation here, we have - I will write it. (x = x in Arabic) 

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:22.890
 - Set to 11 equals 7 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.280
 So this tells us - we have that little point here, let me 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.510
 Clear, let me clear that point. 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.950
 Do not you think I have some types of decimal numbers there. 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.820
 There you go. 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.200
 Let's go back to the problem now. 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.130
 So, what does this mean? 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.950
 This means that the total number to 11 equals 7. 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.840
 And you are probably able to do this in your head. 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.730
 Do you know, what should I add to the 11 to become 7? 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.650
 If it is we will have some types 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.375
 Negative numbers. 

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.780
 But we will learn how to solve this in an organized way. 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.860
 So what do we want to do this, when we solve the equation 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.885
 It should be on this formula, when we finish everything, 

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:56.890
 O Something worth. 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.950
 That will be our answer. 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.840
 We will know what figure this formula replaces. 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.470
 Now, to bring it, we just want it to be put 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.460
 The unknown x is in the left side of the equation. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.000
 We do not want this 11 there. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.150
 We want to get rid of 11 somehow, on the left side 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.220
 Of the equation. 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.570
 Now to do that, we can not just get rid of it just on 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.310
 The left side 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.950
 You probably want to say, wait, let me get 11 from 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.640
 The left side of the equation. 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.130
 But this is an equation! 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.310
 Anything you do on an aspect of the equation has to do 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.110
 On the other side of them. 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.850
 If x is set to 11, it is equal to 7, x set to 11 from 11 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.230
 It will not be worth 7 anymore. 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.820
 You must also subtract 11 out of 7. 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.230
 Now they are equal. 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.950
 Remember, I really want to stress this. 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.300
 I really want you to think about what 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.840
 This means equality. 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.810
 Equation, it comes from the concept of equality. 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.670
 This is equal to this. 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.640
 These two things are equal amounts. 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.050
 Now, in order to be able to equality properly, anything I do 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.470
 For this, if I put 11 of this quantity, in order 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.480
 This equality is true, I must also ask 11 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.530
 Of the quantity that is here. x plus 7 are equal. 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.940
 If they are still equal after 11. 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.830
 Now let's focus on the left side. 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.360
 Negative 11 (-11) plus 11, negative 11 plus 11, 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.480
 You will be tested, right? 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.910
 11 minus 11 equals 0. 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.270
 So you will have only the left side X equal 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.446
 For 7 rails of 11. 

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:29.910
 Now what 7 - 11? 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.810
 You can draw the line of numbers out, if you want. 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.030
 If we draw the number line here - 0.1,2,3,4,5,6,7. 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.880
 7 There. 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.550
 And if we subtract 11 from that, you return back 1,2,3,4, 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.460
 5,6,7,8,9,10,11. 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.790
 8,9,10,11. 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.320
 It takes you to -4. 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.370
 7 - 11 = -4 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.560
 This is our first equation. 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.120
 Now we have 7 multiplied by a number - these 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.570
 The new problem - 7 multiplied by X equals 21. 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.860
 This X will be different from this 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.750
 Who is here. 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.560
 How, once again, did we bring it in the form in which X is equal 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.120
 Something ? 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.770
 Remember, we made X equal to Achi. 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.460
 How do we form that body? 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.000
 Let me rewrite the problem. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.020
 7 multiplied by equals 21. 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.250
 Well, I can think of it in two ways. 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.360
 If you divide 7 multiplied by X on 7, for what 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.250
 I will get ? 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.920
 If you divide it to 7, what will remain? 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.780
 7 multiplied by a divider divided by 7, so only it will be 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.470
 Something . 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.090
 It will only end with X. 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.620
 But if left on the left of 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.500
 Equation, I must make it on the right side 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.340
 Of the equation. 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.280
 Remember, 7X equals 21. 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.130
 It's the same as 21. 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.190
 In order to make this equal to that when I divide 7 on 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.020
 Left side, I must also I swear 7 on the right side. 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.020
 When I do that, 7 multiplied by X divided by 7 - only that 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.250
 Will equal X - and 21 divided by 7 equals 3. 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.710
 If the solution for this equation is X = 3. 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.900
 You can prove it. 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.880
 Take 3, put it in the equation. 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.130
 7 * 3 is already equal to 7. 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.329
 Same thing up there. 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.120
 Make X equal -4. 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.550
 -4 + 11 Same as 11-4, 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.180
 Already equal to 7. 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.090
 Let's do this here. 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.700
 This time it seems a bit tricky, but you 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.700
 You'll see, it's not too bad. 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:38.020
 If we have 5X on 12 equals 2 \ 3. 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.290
 Now, how do you isolate the X here? 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.960
 What can I multiply or divide to isolate? 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.220
 Well, what if we want to hit both sides of these 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.850
 Equation in 12 \ 5? 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.230
 What will happen ? 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.520
 So if we hit the left side with 12 \ 5 - f 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.630
 Remember, anything I do on one side, must 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.550
 I do it on the other side of the equation. 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.140
 If you hit the left side by 12/5, you should 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.320
 Hit the right side with 12/5 in order 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.200
 The equivalence is correct. 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.470
 But why did you want to choose 12/5? 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.990
 Because I wanted to, I choose a number that completely cancels 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.000
 5/12. 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.180
 is not it ? 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.340
 I've got 5 \ 12 here. 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.820
 12 \ 5 multiplied by 5/12, the 12 canceled, the 5 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.390
 Canceled, and you are now with the X only. 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.260
 If X has been made equal to 2 \ 3 multiplied by 12 \ 5 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.910
 You can divide 12 by 3 and have 4 output. 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.120
 You can measure 3 on 3 and have 1 output. 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.160
 If you can get 2 multiplied by 4 equals 8 \ 1 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.620
 Multiplied by 5, which is 5. 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.940
 If X is equal to 8/5. 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.590
 Now maybe you say, wait, sit up, there you divided on 7, 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.130
 Here you are struck by the inverse reflex. 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.390
 How do I know what to do? 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.080
 The answer is, you can do well. 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.790
 I can do this exactly for the same problem that way. 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.100
 I started with 7X equal to 21. 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.630
 Instead of dividing by 7, how much I said, let me 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.910
 Strike with the inverse reflection of the 7. 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.800
 If I can, I can strike the opposite of the 7 on both sides 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.870
 Of the equation. 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.020
 This is equivalent to dividing by 7. 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.930
 You can prove it. 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.640
 When you hit 1/7, that's exactly the same when 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.130
 Divide on 7. 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.580
 If it does, these will be canceled. 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.750
 This is 1/7. 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.940
 The 7 are canceled. 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.890
 X is equal to 21/7, which equals 3. 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.950
 Similarly, there, I have 5X / 12. 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.150
 Let me write it that way. 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.360
 I can type it as 5 \ 12X, equal to 2/3. 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.650
 This is exactly the same problem. 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.990
 I just posted the X a little. 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.890
 5 \ 12 multiplied by 5X \ 12. 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.490
 Now here, I can only say, let me swear both parties on 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.940
 The inverse inversion 5/12. 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:00.520
 If I just could I swear by 5/12. 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.550
 But what do I mean by I am 5/12 ?? 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.070
 That's the same thing when I hit a 12/5. 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.725
 Division of the same factor when beating 

00:07:10.725 --> 00:07:11.500
 With the inverse reflex. 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.140
 If this is this, we've done the same thing. 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.750
 Whether divided by laboratories, as we did here, 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.320
 Or whether they are hit by a traverse reflex 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.350
 For laboratories, you do exactly the same process. 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.760
 Now let's do some of these other problems. and this is 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.990
 Really only to introduce you I variable is not always X. 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.180
 We can bee for Q 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.610
 We can bee for Z. 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.740
 We can bee for s. 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.100
 We can bee for anything. 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.710
 So let's solve this down here. 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.790
 If we have - and will write - you have q less than 13 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.540
 Equals -13. 

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.380
 If again, we want to isolate q. 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.300
 We will be, q equals something. 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.880
 Then we will solve our problem. 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.220
 So how do we isolate q? 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.590
 How can we get rid of these 13. 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.315
 What if we add 13 to both sides of this equation? 

00:07:58.315 --> 00:08:02.300
 If you add 13 for both parties in this equation 

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.110
 I add 13, because if I add 13 to -13, or 

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.680
 -13 Here, I will get 0. 

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.910
 If the left side of this equation becomes q. 

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.900
 And then what is the right side now? 

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.720
 So that will cancel. 

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.480
 And the right side -13. 

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.590
 +13, the result is 0. 

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.775
 If resolved, q is equal to 0. 

00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:23.230
 We can check it out. 

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:28.100
 It is 13. 

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.120
 If this works. 

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.810
 Actually I've forgotten who I'm checking out here. 

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.380
 Let's check it out. 

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.500
 The fun thing about algebra, is that you can 

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.919
 Always check your answer. 

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.600
 We got an X equal to 8 \ 5 here. 

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.010
 Let's check our answer. 

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:44.880
 5 \ 12 multiplied by X multiplied by 8 \ 5 What equals ?? 

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.910
 5 Canceled. 

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.990
 You can divide the 8 by 4 to get 2. 

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.130
 You can divide the 12 by 4 to get 3. 

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.990
 It is equal to 2/3. 

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.200
 If we can check. 

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.950
 That's a wonderful thing. 

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.600
 First answer your answer, you can always be sure, if you are 

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.500
 Have enough time, so I got the right answer. 

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.180
 Let's do the last two. 

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:11.330
 Our Z +1. Equal to 3.0001. 

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.810
 Again, we want to get rid of 1.1 on 

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.840
 The left side . 

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.370
 The best way to do this is that I can think of asking 

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.970
 1.1 from both sides, or add negative 1.1, anyway 

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:22.750
 You want to do it. 

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.290
 If you do it on the left side, I have to do the same thing on the right side. 

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.205
 Otherwise equality will not remain true. 

00:09:27.205 --> 00:09:30.880
 If this is equal to this, so that both sides 

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.530
 Equally, anything I do on the left side must 

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.070
 I'm doing it right. 

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.630
 So let's see. 

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.390
 If 1.1 is introduced from Z + 1.1, these two are deleted, and 

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:50.960
 Only Z remains equal to 3.0001 - 1.1. 

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.852
 If here we will do a little 

00:09:51.852 --> 00:09:53.500
 A tenth offer. 

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.590
 That's probably the hardest part of this problem. 

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:00.030
 If 3.0001 - 1.1. 

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.320
 You want to align decimal numbers. 

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.570
 1.1. 

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.830
 1.1.1. 

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:06.510
 Just keda costume. 

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.890
 And we can even add some zeros there, to make things clear. 

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.260
 And let's do the subtraction. 

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.730
 1-0 = 1. 

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.360
 0-0 = 0 

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.460
 0-0 = 0 

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.180
 Oh, we do not have, --- we can not say 0-1. 

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.470
 We can regroup or borrow. 

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:28.840
 If this becomes 10, which is 1. 

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.090
 We will take 1 from here, so 

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.120
 It becomes 2, right? 

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.970
 We borrowed from the 3, we recombine the numbers 

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.260
 We took the whole one and put it in the double digits, so I have 

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.840
 It becomes 10/10. 

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.660
 If 10 - 1 = 9. 

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.100
 We have our decimal point. 

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.460
 And then 2 -1 = 1. 

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:53.380
 If our answer is Z = 1.9001 

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.220
 We can check them. 

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.470
 What is z + 1.1 ?? 

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.365
 What is z + 1.1 ?? 

00:11:00.365 --> 00:11:01.980
 Let's collect it. 

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:08.090
 You made 1,00,9.1 be 10.1 + 1 + 1 to be 3, we have 

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.870
 Our decimal point, we have brought 3.0001. 

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.770
 That's a good review to put the numbers down. 

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:15.290
 OK . 

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.390
 We have this last problem. 

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.920
 21S is equal to 3. 

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.890
 As we have said, we can do this in two ways, namely 

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.530
 Especially the same way. 

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.750
 21 * Some numbers = 3. 

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.670
 Well, what happens if we hit both 

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:33.550
 The sides b 1 \ 21? 

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.050
 B. 

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.050
 Inverse inversion only is the figure that arises from the introduction 

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.450
 Variable, so multiply variables. 

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.990
 Well, 1 \ 21 * 21 \ 1 = 1, if we made S equal 

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.000
 3/21. 

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.830
 The 3/21 itself is 1/7. 

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.180
 We can check them. 

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.540
 What is 21 * 1/7? 

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.360
 It's equal to 21/7. 

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.370
 21 \ 7. 

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.000
 Which is 3. 

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.940
 To achieve the main purpose, I can solve 

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.520
 This is the problem - instead of multiplying by 1 \ 21 - 

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.240
 let's see . 21S equals 3 - I could, instead of 

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.640
 Multiplication in 1 \ 21, the equation is completely something 

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.000
 Would like to divide only both sides on 21. 

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.290
 So these are deleted. 

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:26.590
 S has been made equal to 3/21 which is equal to 1/7. 

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.840
 Anyway, we hope you have found these examples useful to you. # (Translated by Dr. Sulaiman the Spectrum).
