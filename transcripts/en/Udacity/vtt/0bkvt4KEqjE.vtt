Now that you're familiar with the basic R commands,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.200
let's look at some more data. This time we'll be

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.215
looking at data collected from a survey of Reddit users.

00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:11.220
Reddit's a social and entertainment website where users can post

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.620
links and comments about trending news. This survey asks users

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.940
about demographic information such as gender, age, nationality and employment

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.720
status. It even asks users what type of cheese they

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.160
would be. And whether they prefer dogs, cats, or turtles.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.740
Download the data set from the instructor notes and load it into

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.400
R. Once you've done that, take a look at the data by

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.560
using the str function. Now when I try to read in the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.060
file, sometimes I might get an error, and this is pretty common,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.000
so I would suggest looking at your current working directory to figure

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.380
out the problem. Often times your directory isn't where your file is

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.320
stored. Alright, so I've set my directory, and now I'm going to try

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.448
this code up here again. And there we go, there's our data.

00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:53.600
Running the str command, we can see that there's lots

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.150
of data here. Most of these variables have a type

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.170
of factor. Now, a factor's a categorical variable that has

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.200
different flavors or levels to it. An example of this

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.660
would be employment status. This variable has many different levels

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.440
such as employed full time, or employed part time. Or

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.950
not working. One thing we might be interested in is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.040
how many people are in each group of employment status.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.270
We can table that variable to see the number in

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.250
each of these groups. Running this code I can see the

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.950
table. We can also get these counts and other data points

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.970
by running the summary function on our data frame. I encourage

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.640
you to check out the output of this for yourself. In

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.840
addition to factor variables like employment status, the R programming language

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.520
also has other data types like list and matrices, but we

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.150
really won't be working with them in this course. We've included

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.650
a reference for data types in the instructor notes, so if

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.580
you would like to learn more about those, check it out.
