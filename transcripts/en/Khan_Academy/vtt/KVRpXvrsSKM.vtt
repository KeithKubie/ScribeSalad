00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.160
So I'm looking forward to the
end of this problem as much

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.390
as I'm guessing you are.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.000
And I think we're
in the home stretch.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.970
We just have to simplify this to
get the possible values for x.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.470
So let's simplify what we
have here in the radical.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.470
So let's see.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.809
Square root of 3 minus 2.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:20.600
And we're going to
square this whole thing.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.683
That's going to be square
root of 3 squared, which

00:00:22.683 --> 00:00:25.490
is 3, minus 2 times
their product,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.870
so that's minus 4
square roots of 3.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.390
and then plus 2
squared, so plus 4.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.940
And then we have minus
4 times-- square root

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.410
of 3 times square
root of 3 is 3.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.050
Square root of 3 times 1 is
plus the square root of 3.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.800
And then negative 2
times square root of 3

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.280
is negative 2 square roots of 3.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.870
And then negative 2
times 1 is negative 2.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.900
So this is going to
be equal 3 plus 4 is

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.410
7 minus 4 square
roots of 3 minus--

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.920
so let's see, this 3 and
this negative 2 over here,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.120
that becomes a 1.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.530
And then the square root of
3 minus 2 square roots of 3,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.950
that just becomes a
minus square root of 3.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.872
So that just becomes
negative square root of 3.

00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:15.080
My brain is starting to hurt.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.620
So you have a
negative 4 times 1.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.239
So it's minus 4.

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:20.530
And then a negative 4 times
negative square roots of 3.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.120
So plus 4 square roots of 3.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.140
And thank God something has
finally simplified here.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.980
And so that cancels
out with that.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.302
So you have 7 minus
4 is equal to 3.

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:36.010
So the whole thing
under the radical sign

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.320
is the square root of 3.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.270
So then this becomes
our potential values

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.190
for x. x is equal to 2
minus the square root of 3

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.100
plus or minus the square root
of this thing, which simplified

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.010
to the square root
of 3, all of that

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.354
over 2 square
roots of 3 minus 4.

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.270
So let's try to see what
our answers could be.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.180
If we add a square root
of 3-- so one answer is

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.020
if we add the square root, if
we go with the plus option,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.190
this would be 2 minus
square roots of 3

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.800
plus square root of 3.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.990
So it would be 2.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.800
The square roots of 3
will just cancel out.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.830
2 over 2 root 3 minus 4.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.180
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.220
And we get 1 over the
square root of 3 minus 2.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.350
And then to rationalize
this, we want

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.290
to multiply it times the
square root of 3 plus 2

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.570
over the square
root of 3 plus 2.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.850
We do that so that when
we take the product here,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.070
it takes the form b
squared minus a squared.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.720
So this is equal to the square
root of 3 plus 2, all of that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:59.690
over-- square root of 3
squared is now 3-- 3 minus 4.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.000
So this is going to be
equal to-- this part here

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.340
is a negative 1.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.210
And so we could
view it as negative,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.500
and I'll just write it as 2
plus the square root of 3.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.830
So that's one
possible value of x.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.500
And the other
possible value of x,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.479
if we subtract the
square root of 3.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.020
So then on the
numerator, we're going

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.054
to have 2 minus--
square root of 3

00:03:21.054 --> 00:03:22.470
minus the square
root of 3, that's

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.260
2 minus 2 square roots of 3
over-- we could write this

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.982
as negative 4 plus
2 square roots of 3.

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:32.440
The first thing we
might want to do

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.689
is just divide the numerator
and the denominator by 3.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.660
I swapped these
down here to divide

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.490
the numerator and
the denominator by 2.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.050
So this is equal to 1
minus the square root of 3

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.750
over negative 2 plus
the square root of 3.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.710
And now we can rationalize this
by multiplying it by negative 2

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.880
minus the square root
of 3 over negative 2

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.260
minus the square root of 3.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.175
And what do we get here?

00:04:05.942 --> 00:04:08.150
So this is going to be equal
to-- in the denominator,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.108
we're going to have
negative 2 times negative 2

00:04:10.108 --> 00:04:13.220
is 4, 4 minus 3.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.220
So we just get a 1.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.230
So this is equal to
1 in the denominator.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.001
In the numerator, so let me
just multiply 1 times negative 2

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:21.959
minus square root of 3.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.170
So it's negative 2 minus
the square root of 3.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.430
And then the negative square
root of 3 times negative 2

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.510
is plus 2 square roots of 3.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.220
And then negative
square roots of 3 times

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.900
negative square
roots of 3 is plus 3.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.920
So you have 3 minus 2 is 1.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.030
And then 2 roots 3 minus
the square root of 3

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.050
is plus the square root of 3.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.970
So this is kind of exciting.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.390
This was an unbelievably
hairy problem.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.500
And if any of y'all know a
faster way to do this problem,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.370
let me know.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.650
I've thought about it a lot.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.060
It doesn't seem like there is a
faster way to do this problem.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.950
But my possible
x-values are negative 2

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.760
plus the square root of 3 or
1 plus the square root of 3.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.070
Now, we have to be careful.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.250
If it wasn't enough that we got
this far, we did so much work,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.890
we finally got these answers,
we have to be very careful,

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.350
because both of
those are options.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.027
This is one of the options, and
then this is the other option.

00:05:26.027 --> 00:05:28.610
And once again, these are one
of those multiple correct choice

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.470
answers, so you can actually
select more than one answer

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.970
here.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.790
Or you maybe need to select
more than one answer.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.480
So you might, after doing all
of that work, say oh, finally.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.640
OK, bam and bam.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.530
But be very careful.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.610
Remember the context
of the problem.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.940
These sides had to be positive.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.140
And if you put this
number in here,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.390
all the sides will
not be positive.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.580
In particular, if x was
2 plus the square root

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.390
negative of this value right
here, this value over here

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.839
is going to be, I don't know,
3 point something something.

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.380
And if you took the
negative of that,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.430
and you put it right
here for C, you're

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.900
going to get a negative
distance for C.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.110
And C cannot be negative.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.550
It's the length of a
side of a triangle.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.640
So A is not a valid choice.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.110
So these guys are really
trying to trip people up.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:26.924
The correct answer is
only B. That was tiring.
