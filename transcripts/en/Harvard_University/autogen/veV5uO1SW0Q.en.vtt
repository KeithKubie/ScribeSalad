of
thing but I'll bracket that and maybe

00:17:01.179 --> 00:17:01.189
thing but I'll bracket that and maybe
 

00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:04.659
thing but I'll bracket that and maybe
come back to it when I put this all

00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:04.669
come back to it when I put this all
 

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:10.569
come back to it when I put this all
together so um this came about this idea

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:10.579
together so um this came about this idea
 

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.439

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:19.620
apply that to anything and and then
 

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.100
apply that to anything and and then
after the reading we would write and

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:22.110
after the reading we would write and
 

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:24.710
after the reading we would write and

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.450
there'd be so but once the reading was
done there would be no talking and we

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.460
done there would be no talking and we
 

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.830
done there would be no talking and we
would just immediately start writing
