00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.050
- Hi, I'm Dave Travis, I'm
the Test Prep Content Manager

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.230
at Khan Academy.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.740
It's especially challenging
when you make a mistake

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.830
again, and again, and again,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.570
and you know that you did it wrong,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.020
you know immediately
when you did it, that,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.020
oh, I did that thing again,
and I need to fix that,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.690
I need to go back and
fix it and iron it out,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.690
and get it smooth, and there's
a motto that I like a lot,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.050
which is very simple, which is,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.010
the more you do it, the better you get.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.640
And I heard somewhere that you
actually need to do a skill

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.207
for 10,000 hours if you
really wanna get good

00:00:35.207 --> 00:00:39.801
and that's true with martial
arts, it's true with ceramics,

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:42.350
it's true with writing,
it's true with a language,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.980
it's true with musical instrument.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.800
If you wanna get good at
something it takes time

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.930
and you need to be patient with yourself,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.890
you need to trust yourself

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.883
and trust that your brain
can do these things.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.190
And just because you bump up against

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.410
a frustration or a challenge,
that's an opportunity to grow,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.840
it's an opportunity to develop a skill

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.290
that you didn't have before.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.100
I think, you know, one of
the things that's exciting

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.190
about learning a new skill

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.460
is that the more you do it,
not only the better you get,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.190
the more fun you have doing it,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.640
it can be hard to have a fun time

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.660
when you're learning
the basics of, you know,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.300
grammar in French, or
you're learning how to ski

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.770
and you're falling over all the time.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.940
But the more you actually do those things

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.540
and you improve your skills,
it actually becomes more fun

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.340
because you gain confidence,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.173
you gain

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.420
you gain an ability to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.957
look back at what you've
accomplished, and say,

00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:41.567
"You know what, last week I
was making all these mistakes,

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.197
"and now I actually get this,

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:45.247
"and now I can actually
build upon this skill

00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:47.837
"and do more than I was
able to do last week."
