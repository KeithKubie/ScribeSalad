Android apps that we've examined during
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.429
Android apps that we've examined during
the app clinic often quite candidly so

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
the app clinic often quite candidly so
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.289

you know and but they're really build

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
you know and but they're really build

taking some of the feedback that we've
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670
taking some of the feedback that we've
given to create something which we

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
given to create something which we
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.649
given to create something which we
really like right it's also a small way

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
really like right it's also a small way
 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.850

of saying thank you to all the
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.969
of saying thank you to all the
developers who submit their apps to our

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979
developers who submit their apps to our
 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.740
developers who submit their apps to our
constructive criticism and who then turn

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
constructive criticism and who then turn
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.880
constructive criticism and who then turn
around and make their apps even better

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
around and make their apps even better
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.950
around and make their apps even better
and so we're going to be adding to this

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
and so we're going to be adding to this
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660
and so we're going to be adding to this
list slowly so there's only a couple of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
list slowly so there's only a couple of
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.039
list slowly so there's only a couple of
apps that will be adding today and we're

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
apps that will be adding today and we're
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.780
apps that will be adding today and we're
going to hope to try and find a couple

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
going to hope to try and find a couple
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.520
going to hope to try and find a couple
of really good examples maybe every week

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
of really good examples maybe every week
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.380
of really good examples maybe every week
maybe every other week so I've got a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
maybe every other week so I've got a
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510
maybe every other week so I've got a
little early yeah this there's lots of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520
little early yeah this there's lots of
 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340
little early yeah this there's lots of
great apps out there but we want to make

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
great apps out there but we want to make
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.410
great apps out there but we want to make
sure we give each app the opportunity to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
sure we give each app the opportunity to
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.120
sure we give each app the opportunity to
really shine by itself so that's why

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
really shine by itself so that's why
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.100
really shine by itself so that's why
we're going to go slowly and every time

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

ducting to apps into pure Android both
of which we looked at in the very early

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
of which we looked at in the very early
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.839
of which we looked at in the very early
days of Android developers live and

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
days of Android developers live and
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.000

they've also taken a lot of care with
 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.839
they've also taken a lot of care with
the pixels themselves you know they do

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849
the pixels themselves you know they do
 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.430
the pixels themselves you know they do
have a little bit of a drop shadow but

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
have a little bit of a drop shadow but
 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.349
have a little bit of a drop shadow but
it's not obvious just to separate

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359
it's not obvious just to separate
 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.059
it's not obvious just to separate
themselves the pattern from the

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069
themselves the pattern from the
 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.670
themselves the pattern from the
background and they've they've done some

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680
background and they've they've done some
 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.440
background and they've they've done some
design absolutely and and that's really

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450
design absolutely and and that's really
 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.849
design absolutely and and that's really
important for the sort of app that this

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859
important for the sort of app that this
 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.220
important for the sort of app that this
is something which is visual which

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
is something which is visual which
 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.750

people who care about designing it to be

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760
people who care about designing it to be
 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.539
people who care about designing it to be
interested in it really pays to take

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549
interested in it really pays to take
 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.979
interested in it really pays to take
that extra step and make that extra

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989
that extra step and make that extra
 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.349
that extra step and make that extra
effort exactly it also gives you a great

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359
effort exactly it also gives you a great
 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.409
effort exactly it also gives you a great
idea of what the apps going to do

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419
idea of what the apps going to do
 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.330
idea of what the apps going to do
exactly so I throw out the app the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340
exactly so I throw out the app the
 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.069
exactly so I throw out the app the
design language is really clean really

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930
design guide you can see that as you
 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.270
design guide you can see that as you
move through the app you never left

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280
move through the app you never left
 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.099

they've tried to keep it as visual as

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160
they've tried to keep it as visual as
 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.400
they've tried to keep it as visual as
possible and as non intrusive as they

for me to see a great tablet experience
 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.369
for me to see a great tablet experience
that works in both orientation so we

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379
that works in both orientation so we
 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.189
that works in both orientation so we
spoke to the developer of pattern Lucas

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199
spoke to the developer of pattern Lucas
 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.839
spoke to the developer of pattern Lucas
earlier and we asked him to tell us a

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849
earlier and we asked him to tell us a
 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.129
earlier and we asked him to tell us a
little bit more about his experience

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139
little bit more about his experience
 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.100

what's unique about it is that like
 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.490
what's unique about it is that like
instead of the usual photo-based

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500
instead of the usual photo-based
 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.410
instead of the usual photo-based
wallpapers that you get from other apps

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420
wallpapers that you get from other apps
 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.070
wallpapers that you get from other apps
it offers you gives you access to more

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080
it offers you gives you access to more
 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.050
it offers you gives you access to more
than 200,000 patterns created by the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060
than 200,000 patterns created by the
 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.110
than 200,000 patterns created by the
color levels community so and the cool

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120
color levels community so and the cool
 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.690
color levels community so and the cool
thing about working with patterns in the

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700
thing about working with patterns in the
 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.640
thing about working with patterns in the
context of wallpapers is that because

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650
context of wallpapers is that because
 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.530
context of wallpapers is that because
they are child they will always work

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540
they are child they will always work
 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.750
they are child they will always work
great on any form factor because they

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760
great on any form factor because they
 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.480
great on any form factor because they
don't stretch or crop or anything so it

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490
don't stretch or crop or anything so it
 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.990
don't stretch or crop or anything so it
always what works great so that's that's

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000
always what works great so that's that's
 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.340
always what works great so that's that's
the cool thing and I think that's one of

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350
the cool thing and I think that's one of
 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.690
the cool thing and I think that's one of
the things that is attracting a lot of

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700
the things that is attracting a lot of
 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.150
the things that is attracting a lot of
attention to the app now if i'm not

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160
attention to the app now if i'm not
 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.430
attention to the app now if i'm not
mistaken pattern was one of the first

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440
mistaken pattern was one of the first
 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.100
mistaken pattern was one of the first
apps to implement like proper design for

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110
apps to implement like proper design for
 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.590
apps to implement like proper design for
nexus 7 and i think maybe that was one

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600
nexus 7 and i think maybe that was one
 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.180
nexus 7 and i think maybe that was one
that one of the things that caught like

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190
that one of the things that caught like
 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.690
that one of the things that caught like
the attention of the google folks so so

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700
the attention of the google folks so so
 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.280
the attention of the google folks so so
that was an interesting thing and

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290
that was an interesting thing and
 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.250
that was an interesting thing and
actually I that I started working on the

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260
actually I that I started working on the
 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.130
actually I that I started working on the
tablet UI because of the Nexus 7 it's a

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140
tablet UI because of the Nexus 7 it's a
 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.409
tablet UI because of the Nexus 7 it's a
great device i love it i have one so and

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419
great device i love it i have one so and
 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.270
great device i love it i have one so and
as part of the process i also

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280
as part of the process i also
 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.420
as part of the process i also
implemented the 10-inch you I of course

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430
implemented the 10-inch you I of course
 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.659
implemented the 10-inch you I of course
so it just made sense so responsive

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669
so it just made sense so responsive
 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.230
so it just made sense so responsive
design what is like one of the like

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240
design what is like one of the like
 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.580
design what is like one of the like
probably one of the most challenging

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590
probably one of the most challenging
 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.390
probably one of the most challenging
things I had to do in pattern although a

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400
things I had to do in pattern although a
 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.100
things I had to do in pattern although a
pattern is a kind of in a kind of a

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110
pattern is a kind of in a kind of a
 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.530
pattern is a kind of in a kind of a
privileged position in terms of

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540
privileged position in terms of
 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.780
privileged position in terms of
scalability just because the content is

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790
scalability just because the content is
 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.560
scalability just because the content is
so it's so flexible in terms of like

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570
so it's so flexible in terms of like
 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.380
so it's so flexible in terms of like
stretching like filling areas because

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390
stretching like filling areas because
 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.390
stretching like filling areas because
we're Charlie all the time so you don't

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400
we're Charlie all the time so you don't
 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.900
we're Charlie all the time so you don't
have to worry about like you don't have

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910
have to worry about like you don't have
 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.370
have to worry about like you don't have
a lot of constraints in terms of the

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380
a lot of constraints in terms of the
 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.050
a lot of constraints in terms of the
content you are presenting so that

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060
content you are presenting so that
 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.000
content you are presenting so that
helped a lot so I had a lot of freedom

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010
helped a lot so I had a lot of freedom
 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.610
helped a lot so I had a lot of freedom
to like sighs things properly without

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620
to like sighs things properly without
 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.219
to like sighs things properly without
caring about like looking bad in some

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229
caring about like looking bad in some
 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.140
caring about like looking bad in some
form factors for example so there was

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150
form factors for example so there was
 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.620
form factors for example so there was
one suggestion by Roman Nurik which was

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630
one suggestion by Roman Nurik which was
 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.350
one suggestion by Roman Nurik which was
to use cred on landscape on phones and

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360
to use cred on landscape on phones and
 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.210
to use cred on landscape on phones and
that's something I didn't do just

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220
that's something I didn't do just
 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.040
that's something I didn't do just
because I didn't have time to but like I

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050
because I didn't have time to but like I
 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.880
because I didn't have time to but like I
definitely want to do it it's just yeah

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890
definitely want to do it it's just yeah
 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.529
definitely want to do it it's just yeah
one of those things that like details

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539
one of those things that like details
 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:18.310
one of those things that like details
that mattered like

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320
that mattered like
 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.750
that mattered like
make a lot of difference and I just

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760
make a lot of difference and I just
 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.740
make a lot of difference and I just
didn't have time to do it yet but but I

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750
didn't have time to do it yet but but I
 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.360
didn't have time to do it yet but but I
do get a lot of the inspirations from

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370
do get a lot of the inspirations from
 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.220
do get a lot of the inspirations from
other apps like then this is one of the

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230
other apps like then this is one of the
 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.370
other apps like then this is one of the
reasons i watch the show like not live

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380
reasons i watch the show like not live
 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.140
reasons i watch the show like not live
most of the time but I always try to

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150
most of the time but I always try to
 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.280
most of the time but I always try to
watch them just because especially the

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290
watch them just because especially the
 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.780
watch them just because especially the
designing action stuff that's especially

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790
designing action stuff that's especially
 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.240
designing action stuff that's especially
that series of like proposed designs

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250
that series of like proposed designs
 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.220
that series of like proposed designs
from the community that was really

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230
from the community that was really
 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.560
from the community that was really
inspiring and I think the the big

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570
inspiring and I think the the big
 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.490
inspiring and I think the the big
message from that like amount of designs

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500
message from that like amount of designs
 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.690
message from that like amount of designs
great designs that we got was that was

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700
great designs that we got was that was
 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.360
great designs that we got was that was
that like there is clearly a design

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370
that like there is clearly a design
 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.090
that like there is clearly a design
language arising in the Android platform

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100
language arising in the Android platform
 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.350
language arising in the Android platform
and that helps a lot of like especially

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360
and that helps a lot of like especially
 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.260
and that helps a lot of like especially
for like developers getting started in

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270
for like developers getting started in
 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.710
for like developers getting started in
the platform they they have a reference

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720
the platform they they have a reference
 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.360
the platform they they have a reference
visual design to get started if that

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370
visual design to get started if that
 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.890
visual design to get started if that
helps a lot especially if you're not if

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900
helps a lot especially if you're not if
 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.260
helps a lot especially if you're not if
you don't have a designer working with

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270
you don't have a designer working with
 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.790
you don't have a designer working with
you so that helps a lot I'm not a

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800
you so that helps a lot I'm not a
 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.100
you so that helps a lot I'm not a
designer I tend to see myself as a

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110
designer I tend to see myself as a
 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.920
designer I tend to see myself as a
developer with a with a design I two

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930
developer with a with a design I two
 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.310
developer with a with a design I two
things but so having this design

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.320
things but so having this design
 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.080
things but so having this design
language helps a lot the thing is with

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090
language helps a lot the thing is with
 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.780
language helps a lot the thing is with
any platform like just like definitely

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790
any platform like just like definitely
 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.880
any platform like just like definitely
just going through api docs doesn't help

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:33.890
just going through api docs doesn't help
 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.170
just going through api docs doesn't help
at all so having some discussion and

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180
at all so having some discussion and
 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.540
at all so having some discussion and
some reference designs or even reference

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550
some reference designs or even reference
 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.400
some reference designs or even reference
implementations of certain aspects of

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.410
implementations of certain aspects of
 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.440
implementations of certain aspects of
the platform helped a lot so this is

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.450
the platform helped a lot so this is
 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.560
the platform helped a lot so this is
this is where i think the design in

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.570
this is where i think the design in
 

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.290
this is where i think the design in
action shows helped a lot in terms of

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:50.300
action shows helped a lot in terms of
 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.560
action shows helped a lot in terms of
like discussing one topic and maybe

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:53.570
like discussing one topic and maybe
 

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.480
like discussing one topic and maybe
talking about existing reference

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:55.490
talking about existing reference
 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.610
talking about existing reference
implementations and like that helps a

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:57.620
implementations and like that helps a
 

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.030
implementations and like that helps a
lot implementation wise to be honest it

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.040
lot implementation wise to be honest it
 

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.240
lot implementation wise to be honest it
wasn't that challenging i think the big

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.250
wasn't that challenging i think the big
 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.060
wasn't that challenging i think the big
thing with weather with parent was

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.070
thing with weather with parent was
 

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.750
thing with weather with parent was
finding the right design for for it and

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:10.760
finding the right design for for it and
 

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.860
finding the right design for for it and
i usually spend much more time thinking

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:14.870
i usually spend much more time thinking
 

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.100
i usually spend much more time thinking
about how things should look then

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.110
about how things should look then
 

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.630
about how things should look then
implementing one thing i did for pattern

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:19.640
implementing one thing i did for pattern
 

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.970
implementing one thing i did for pattern
that helped a lot was I did

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:21.980
that helped a lot was I did
 

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.030
that helped a lot was I did
fragment-based

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:24.040
fragment-based
 

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.450
fragment-based
implementation from the day one so i

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:27.460
implementation from the day one so i
 

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.240
implementation from the day one so i
didn't have to ring Clemente the app to

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.250
didn't have to ring Clemente the app to
 

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.850
didn't have to ring Clemente the app to
support tablets so every screen like I

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:32.860
support tablets so every screen like I
 

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.610

started with a phone UI pretty much with

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:35.620
started with a phone UI pretty much with
 

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.400
started with a phone UI pretty much with
one fragment inside one activity is a

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:38.410
one fragment inside one activity is a
 

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.070
one fragment inside one activity is a
one-to-one relationship for every bit of

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080
one-to-one relationship for every bit of
 

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.060
one-to-one relationship for every bit of
the UI so when I came to start working

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.070
the UI so when I came to start working
 

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.090
the UI so when I came to start working
on the tablet UI it was a natural thing

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:48.100
on the tablet UI it was a natural thing
 

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.690
on the tablet UI it was a natural thing
to just like put two pieces together in

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:51.700
to just like put two pieces together in
 

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.280
to just like put two pieces together in
a different layout so that helped a lot

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.290
a different layout so that helped a lot
 

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.970
a different layout so that helped a lot
I sketch a lot like he died I look at a

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:56.980
I sketch a lot like he died I look at a
 

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.920
I sketch a lot like he died I look at a
very thick notebook and I have like

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:58.930
very thick notebook and I have like
 

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.710
very thick notebook and I have like
several versions of the UI and I just

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720
several versions of the UI and I just
 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.260
several versions of the UI and I just
like and only start implementing when I

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:04.270
like and only start implementing when I
 

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.510
like and only start implementing when I
feel good about it it doesn't need to be

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:06.520
feel good about it it doesn't need to be
 

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.310
feel good about it it doesn't need to be
perfect but I need to be feel good about

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320
perfect but I need to be feel good about
 

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.300
perfect but I need to be feel good about
the direction of things and that helps

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.310
the direction of things and that helps
 

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.010
the direction of things and that helps
in terms of like avoiding like

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.020
in terms of like avoiding like
 

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.990
in terms of like avoiding like
replanting stuff just because you change

course like as any like software

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:20.860
course like as any like software
 

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.500
course like as any like software
development you'll learn as you do like

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:22.510
development you'll learn as you do like
 

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.850
development you'll learn as you do like
there's nothing in software development

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:23.860
there's nothing in software development
 

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.100
there's nothing in software development
that is like deterministic like you know

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:26.110
that is like deterministic like you know
 

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.960
that is like deterministic like you know
what you're doing and you go until the

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:27.970
what you're doing and you go until the
 

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.210
what you're doing and you go until the
end with this same idea so as you do it

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:30.220
end with this same idea so as you do it
 

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.430
end with this same idea so as you do it
you change direction you tweak something

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440
you change direction you tweak something
 

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.280
you change direction you tweak something
so I start actually like that's

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:35.290
so I start actually like that's
 

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.840
so I start actually like that's
something interesting about the design

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:36.850
something interesting about the design
 

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.760
something interesting about the design
of patent like I started pattern I

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:38.770
of patent like I started pattern I
 

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.680
of patent like I started pattern I
wanted to do something like a flick

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:40.690
wanted to do something like a flick
 

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.490
wanted to do something like a flick
board thing of wallpapers so it would

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:44.500
board thing of wallpapers so it would
 

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.540
board thing of wallpapers so it would
look like a magazine thing and in the

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:48.550
look like a magazine thing and in the
 

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.790
look like a magazine thing and in the
end I just like couldn't find a way to

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800
end I just like couldn't find a way to
 

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.810
end I just like couldn't find a way to
make it look not right and nice so and

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:54.820
make it look not right and nice so and
 

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.990
make it look not right and nice so and
that was about the time I started like

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000
that was about the time I started like
 

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.090
that was about the time I started like
the the whole hollow things started to

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:00.100
the the whole hollow things started to
 

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.110
the the whole hollow things started to
to to pop up so once I saw again like

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120
to to pop up so once I saw again like
 

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.260
to to pop up so once I saw again like
once I got the design language of like

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:07.270
once I got the design language of like
 

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.350
once I got the design language of like
hello the ICS stuff it just felt natural

we can think we have kind of a problem

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680
we can think we have kind of a problem

so this is kind of a trade-off between a
 

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.220
so this is kind of a trade-off between a
useful feature and not being able to

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:51.230
useful feature and not being able to
 

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.970
useful feature and not being able to
think that but it helped a lot for our

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:54.980

sink part like the whole it's it sounds

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:04.790
sink part like the whole it's it sounds
 

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.019
sink part like the whole it's it sounds
really simple like if they're to sync

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:08.029

all your tasks with the Google back-end

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:09.910
all your tasks with the Google back-end
 

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.579
all your tasks with the Google back-end
sounds really simple but it gets really

00:14:12.579 --> 00:14:12.589
sounds really simple but it gets really
 

00:14:12.589 --> 00:14:14.379
sounds really simple but it gets really
complicated because you can have nested

00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:14.389
complicated because you can have nested
 

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:17.530
complicated because you can have nested
subtasks and then what happens if you

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:17.540
subtasks and then what happens if you
 

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.360
subtasks and then what happens if you
delete the parent what happens if the

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:19.370
delete the parent what happens if the
 

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.269
delete the parent what happens if the
child and all this stuff and what you

00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279
child and all this stuff and what you
 

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:24.699
child and all this stuff and what you
did there is kind of really tested the

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:24.709
did there is kind of really tested the
 

00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:28.059
did there is kind of really tested the
whole thing so that we were sure that

00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:28.069
whole thing so that we were sure that
 

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:31.329
whole thing so that we were sure that
the sink is working properly because the

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:31.339
the sink is working properly because the
 

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:33.490
the sink is working properly because the
same code is kind of the heart of the

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:33.500
same code is kind of the heart of the
 

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.290
same code is kind of the heart of the
application it's kind of the most

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:35.300
application it's kind of the most
 

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.179
application it's kind of the most
important stuff that the sink always

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:37.189
important stuff that the sink always
 

00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:40.150
important stuff that the sink always
works and yeah that's that is kind of

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160
works and yeah that's that is kind of
 

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.920
works and yeah that's that is kind of
little filly challenging but it worked

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:41.930
little filly challenging but it worked
 

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.710
little filly challenging but it worked
out and we had like almost no box we had

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720
out and we had like almost no box we had
 

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.230
out and we had like almost no box we had
some few bugs there but we figured it

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240
some few bugs there but we figured it
 

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.829
some few bugs there but we figured it
out our app adapts itself to the

00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839
out our app adapts itself to the
 

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:52.329
out our app adapts itself to the
different device configurations you

00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:52.339
different device configurations you
 

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:53.769
different device configurations you
basically designed the app to be

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:53.779
basically designed the app to be
 

00:14:53.779 --> 00:14:56.889
basically designed the app to be
compatible with like before nor three

00:14:56.889 --> 00:14:56.899
compatible with like before nor three
 

00:14:56.899 --> 00:14:59.769
compatible with like before nor three
the three main markets like the size of

00:14:59.769 --> 00:14:59.779
the three main markets like the size of
 

00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:02.079
the three main markets like the size of
the nexus for the size of a nexus 7 and

00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:02.089
the nexus for the size of a nexus 7 and
 

00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:02.440
the nexus for the size of a nexus 7 and
the size

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:02.450
the size
 

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.890
the size
nexus 10 like on a nexus 4 you just see

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:05.900
nexus 10 like on a nexus 4 you just see
 

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.380
nexus 10 like on a nexus 4 you just see
the task list and then if you end with

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:08.390
the task list and then if you end with
 

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.810
the task list and then if you end with
your petrol task you can edit it on a

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:10.820
your petrol task you can edit it on a
 

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.930
your petrol task you can edit it on a
nexus 7 it's kind of the same but if you

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:13.940
nexus 7 it's kind of the same but if you
 

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.750
nexus 7 it's kind of the same but if you
rotated into landscape you see your

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:16.760
rotated into landscape you see your
 

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.630
rotated into landscape you see your
tasks on the left and the the task

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:19.640
tasks on the left and the the task
 

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.760
tasks on the left and the the task
detail on the right so you can like edit

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:21.770
detail on the right so you can like edit
 

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.300
detail on the right so you can like edit
a task while viewing other tasks and on

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:25.310
a task while viewing other tasks and on
 

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.400
a task while viewing other tasks and on
the Nexus 10 it's still like the same

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:27.410
the Nexus 10 it's still like the same
 

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.400
the Nexus 10 it's still like the same
but with more spacing and bigger font

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:30.410
but with more spacing and bigger font
 

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.070
but with more spacing and bigger font
sizes and all this stuff so but we

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:33.080
sizes and all this stuff so but we
 

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.160
sizes and all this stuff so but we
really designed to to to work like from

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:36.170
really designed to to to work like from
 

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.080
really designed to to to work like from
the ground up you're clear like this app

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.090
the ground up you're clear like this app
 

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.120
the ground up you're clear like this app
has to work if all kind of devices and

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.130
has to work if all kind of devices and
 

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.430
has to work if all kind of devices and
Android makes it really easy i have to

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:42.440
Android makes it really easy i have to
 

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.560
Android makes it really easy i have to
say like the really powerful resource

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:44.570
say like the really powerful resource
 

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.740
say like the really powerful resource
system select the correct resources

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:47.750
system select the correct resources
 

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.400
system select the correct resources
helped to design apps with that work

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:51.410
helped to design apps with that work
 

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.670
helped to design apps with that work
with all screen sizes so our design

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680
with all screen sizes so our design
 

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.000
with all screen sizes so our design
process likes like we do some sketches

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.010
process likes like we do some sketches
 

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.520
process likes like we do some sketches
but then like start implementing right

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:00.530
but then like start implementing right
 

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.580
but then like start implementing right
away because you're like more developers

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:03.590
away because you're like more developers
 

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.180
away because you're like more developers
and we also like it's really easy with

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:07.190
and we also like it's really easy with
 

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.020
and we also like it's really easy with
with the if the tool in Eclipse now to

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:11.030
with the if the tool in Eclipse now to
 

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.090
with the if the tool in Eclipse now to
do these mugs like writing code and

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:13.100
do these mugs like writing code and
 

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.400
do these mugs like writing code and
right to use it when you really want to

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.410
right to use it when you really want to
 

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.250
right to use it when you really want to
implement it to the whole design and we

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:18.260
implement it to the whole design and we
 

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.890
implement it to the whole design and we
go normally light from sketches to to

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:20.900
go normally light from sketches to to
 

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.170
go normally light from sketches to to
implementation right away and then

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.180
implementation right away and then
 

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.590
implementation right away and then
iterate of course with designers so my

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600
iterate of course with designers so my
 

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.720
iterate of course with designers so my
very favorite part about developing on

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:28.730
very favorite part about developing on
 

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.650
very favorite part about developing on
android is that you can like this to

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:32.660
android is that you can like this to
 

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.050
android is that you can like this to
click you can like design one app and it

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:35.060
click you can like design one app and it
 

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.540
click you can like design one app and it
runs on like I don't know like thousand

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:37.550
runs on like I don't know like thousand
 

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.190
runs on like I don't know like thousand
different devices that's really great

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:39.200
different devices that's really great
 

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.680
different devices that's really great
and also Android provides a lot of

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:41.690
and also Android provides a lot of
 

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.680
and also Android provides a lot of
useful tools to achieve that like to

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:44.690
useful tools to achieve that like to
 

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.990
useful tools to achieve that like to
have a responsive design on area of

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000
have a responsive design on area of
 

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.190
have a responsive design on area of
these devices so for example the density

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:51.200
these devices so for example the density
 

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.790
these devices so for example the density
independent stuff like you have it just

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800
independent stuff like you have it just
 

00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:00.760
independent stuff like you have it just
runs everywhere and the also down the

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:00.770
runs everywhere and the also down the
 

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.760
runs everywhere and the also down the
whole thing with fragments and and the

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:03.770
whole thing with fragments and and the
 

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.470
whole thing with fragments and and the
resource system that you can have

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480
resource system that you can have
 

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.900
resource system that you can have
fragments for this device and but then

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:07.910
fragments for this device and but then
 

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.960
fragments for this device and but then
not on this screen size and that's

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:10.970
not on this screen size and that's
 

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.179
not on this screen size and that's
really that's really pleasing that you

00:17:13.179 --> 00:17:13.189
really that's really pleasing that you
 

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:16.090
really that's really pleasing that you
know like now I developed

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:16.100
know like now I developed
 

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:20.150
know like now I developed
basically for testing used like these

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160
basically for testing used like these
 

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.199
basically for testing used like these
three devices like a four-inch iphone 7

00:17:24.199 --> 00:17:24.209
three devices like a four-inch iphone 7
 

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:26.000
three devices like a four-inch iphone 7
inch tablet in a 10 inch tablet and also

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.010
inch tablet in a 10 inch tablet and also
 

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.150
inch tablet in a 10 inch tablet and also
like a legacy device with android 2.2

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160
like a legacy device with android 2.2
 

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.670
like a legacy device with android 2.2
for backwards compatibility but then

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:31.680
for backwards compatibility but then
 

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.310
for backwards compatibility but then
after that we didn't have like a single

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320
after that we didn't have like a single
 

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.080
after that we didn't have like a single
issue that he didn't run a device that

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.090
issue that he didn't run a device that
 

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.720
issue that he didn't run a device that
was really great that you have like four

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:38.730
was really great that you have like four
 

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.770
was really great that you have like four
devices to test and it runs everywhere

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:41.780
devices to test and it runs everywhere
 

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.260
devices to test and it runs everywhere
so our next steps for for the app is

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:45.270
so our next steps for for the app is
 

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.350
so our next steps for for the app is
kind of to integrate the emails into the

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360
kind of to integrate the emails into the
 

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.480
kind of to integrate the emails into the
test you know there there is a featuring

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:50.490
test you know there there is a featuring
 

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.560
test you know there there is a featuring
team every can like add an email to your

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:54.570
team every can like add an email to your
 

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.770
team every can like add an email to your
task list and we just don't show it on

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780
task list and we just don't show it on
 

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.000
task list and we just don't show it on
the device so we really would like to

you're using the app and you know launch
 

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.570
you're using the app and you know launch
and you're like oh this is this is kind

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580
and you're like oh this is this is kind
 

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.340
and you're like oh this is this is kind
of just totally works yeah it feels

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:52.350
of just totally works yeah it feels
 

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.320
