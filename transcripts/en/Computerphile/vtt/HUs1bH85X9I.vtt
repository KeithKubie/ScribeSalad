00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.700
So today I would like you to talk about zero-knowledge proofs.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.100
So the reason why I would like to talk to you about that is that today

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.060
there are a lot of useful technologies coming out, so more and more technologies are very great,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.420
but they have the big drawback that they need your data. And your data can actually be pretty private or sensitive.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:26.820
In that scope, actually, privacy enhancing technologies aims to let you have both. So you can benefit from

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.180
modern technologies without having to give back your data, or, on the other way around, you can have your privacy

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.000
without having to go back to the Stone Age, for instance. One nice example of privacy enhancing technologies

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.880
is the zero-knowledge proof and it's the thing I'm going to talk about you today

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.000
What actually zero-knowledge proofs are -- they are protocol which let a prover, let's say me, to prove you

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.720
a statement about a secret,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.840
without actually giving up that secret. So I can prove to you that I know a secret, and

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.660
something about that secret, without revealing that secret. So this is how it works in general,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.909
but an easy way to understand the intuition behind zero-knowledge proof

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.790
It's actually the game with these two pens.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.070
So I will give you these two pens and the idea is that you are color blind and you cannot distinguish

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.229
which one is the red and which one is the blue.

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.849
But you don't believe me. You think that actually there are no way to distinguish these pens

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.589
and now I would like to prove you that these pens are actually distinguishable without

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.900
giving away the information of which one is the blue and which one is the red. So I don't want you to know which one

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.860
is the red which one is the blue, but still be sure that you believe me when I say: one these two are not equal

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.770
So how does it work?

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.960
So I will give you these two pens in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.080
random order and now I will ask you to put it behind your back and to swap your arms.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.520
Either you do either you don't at randomly.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.590
As far as I'm concerned,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.580
I don't know if this is blue or this is red, these are just two pens that look the same to me.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.220
Exactly, you are color blind, but I can distinguish them. Okay, so I'm putting these behind my back.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.340
You swap them or you don't.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.580
And now I can tell you, you didn't swap the pens. So now

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.040
you actually kind of believe me, but you're not really sure, because I could have simply said it at random.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.180
I had a 50% chances to guess, to guess the right answer, so let's say you do it again.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.540
All right okay, going behind my back and,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.720
yeah.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.860
Now I can say you swapped the pen.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.980
So now you're a little bit more convinced because you know that I could have cheated only with a chance of 25%

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.240
And that's the idea behind zero-knowledge proof.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.580
We can repeat that experiment as often as you like, decreasing the probability

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.180
to 12.5% and so on until you're fully convinced that I couldn't have cheated about that.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.560
This is the first example and I have a second one to make things absolutely clear.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.020
It's about these cards, so let's say that we have a classic card deck of 52 cards,

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.999
and I'll take like one randomly from this. And

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.849
now I would like to prove you that this card is actually red

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.069
But I don't want to give away the information about the number on that card and nothing else about that.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.030
How does it works to convince you about that without giving away the number?

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.000
So I will simply put that here so you can see it

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.980
and I take the other one. Now what I will do is, I will show you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.500
exactly

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.370
26 cards

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.370
that are actually black.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.340
So now you can count them, and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.480
if you do you, will notice that if there are here 26 cards which are black, this one here must be red. So this is

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.640
our nice example on how zero-knowledge proof works and the intuition behind them.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.240
To make this thing a little bit a little bit more mathematical for the people that may like it,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.140
zero-knowledge proofs

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.780
actually have three criteria.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.440
If the protocol respects these three criteria, you can say, "Okay

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.100
I did a zero-knowledge proof." The first is correctness.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.860
It simply states that, if both people are honest, so if I'm honest and you are honest, everything works fine

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.389
The second one is soundness. It's also kind of obvious. It means that if I don't know the secret

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.529
I cannot prove the statement, and I cannot prove that I know the secret so with the example of before if I couldn't

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.180
recognize the color of the pens

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.160
I wouldn't be able to tell you if you swapped or not pens behind you back

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.740
and the third one is what makes the whole point of having zero knowledge proof is the is the characteristic called

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.239
zero-knowledge in itself it means that

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.180
after following the protocol you learn nothing more than the statement that I wanted to prove you

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.429
So in the example of the card you learn nothing more that the card here is actually red

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.369
Nothing, no side information. That's the whole point. How can you use your knowledge proofs in the real life?

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.560
So an example for that, a very nice one, is about e-voting how to use zero-knowledge proof to make

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.329
e-voting work fine, so let's say that we want to vote for an election

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.259
which has two candidates two candidates are the pen that we had before and

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.530
Have two envelopes here and my vote

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:24.799
Let's say I want to vote for the pen on the right here What I do is I'll write a 1 here and

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.240
0 here

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.039
now I put

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.440
My vote inside the envelope and putting the vote inside the envelope actually means and encrypting them using

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.860
Specific type of scheme which is not the scope of that video

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.509
so the vote one, which means I want to vote for pen blue, I'll put here

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.440
and 0 I don't want to vote for this pen here now

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.280
How does it works you do the same ok so I have to write 1 and 0 and you put them here

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.300
Do you have to look away at this time?
Yes

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.660
ok, let's get my one and then zero, there we go

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.279
And so everybody does this voting such way, the envelope means that the voted are encrypted, the idea

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.860
is that at the end we use protocol to aggregate the results inside all the envelopes without revealing

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.320
particularly each vote we will only reveal the sum of all the votes having blue and all the votes for red

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.919
But if we do that

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.140
there is many ways that we, the voter, can cheat

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.420
The first thing we could do actually is not write 0 or 1

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.939
and the election it's all about voting for exactly one candidate, not both, and not none of them

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:43.178
So the first zero-knowledge proof we could include inside that e-voting protocol is the proof that

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.500
The sum of our votes, so the sum of the things that are inside your envelope, sum up to 1

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:57.740
Which means you voted for exactly one candidate, but now imagine that you were about cheating and what you did was you put?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.480
minus 1 in one envelop and plus 2 in the other one the sum is still 1

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.069
But you could not do that, so a second zero-knowledge proof

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:08.620
you should add to the protocol is the proof that

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.760
the encrypted values are binary, so either 0 or 1, so these makes two zero-knowledge proofs

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.160
And now let's say another one which is also optional

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.820
Let's say, for instance, that I know nothing about Pen's politic, but I do know that you know a lot about it

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.440
So what could I do is I take your envelope, your previous vote

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.300
I copy/paste it without knowing what's inside and then I vote it on top of it.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.340
To avoid that, the third zero knowledge proof

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:43.200
would be to prove that I actually know the inside of the envelope that actually know what am I voting for and

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.140
this mitigates the three problems that we could have with naive e-voting.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:55.440
This is one of the example and this could be applied actually in the same way for assigning petitions online for e-petitioning system

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.980
So it's an idea where you can vote electronically so having the benefits of technology without giving away your privacy

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.480
when you mentioned looking inside and checking that things are binary and add up to one

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.220
people could look inside those anyway, could they? Or is there a special protocol?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.180
No, so actually the envelope here are not really envelope

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.720
These are encryption of what is inside so there is no way to decrypt it

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.120
and no one is really willing to and has not the

00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:28.118
possibility to decrypt each single vote you can only decrypt once all the votes have been summed up

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.980
So there is no way to recover which person voted for which a pen at the end

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.580
There is only way to know that the person actually

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:42.100
Did a binary vote which also sum up to 1 and that he knew the content of the vote

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.640
This is part of the encryption protocol, is it?

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.520
Yeah, the second part is part of the zero-knowledge protocol that comes over and

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.480
works with the encryption protocol. The idea is that, the fact that the vote is binary is your statement

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:01.120
but the votes content is your secret so it's still in the definition of zero-knowledge proof about proving you

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.580
statements about the secret without revealing you the secret

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.500
so for instance the fact that the card is red, back in our cards example

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.080
but not what the numbers, right? Exactly, yes.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.320
That's an example or also the secret is my vote, so the secret is: is it zero or one?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.700
I don't tell you that, but I want to tell you the statement that it is binary

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.120
It then there will be no energy cost to computing

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:34.750
No energy cost. No energy cost, because, here's the fascinating thing, what costs the energy is not the

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.529
computation itself, it's a raising information
