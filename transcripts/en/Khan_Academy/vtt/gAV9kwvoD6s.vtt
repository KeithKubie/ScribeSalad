00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.540
Let's compare 0.1 to 0.070.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.130
So this 1 right over here,
it is in the tenths place.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.990
So it literally
represents 1 times 1/10,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.709
which is obviously the
same thing as 1/10.

00:00:18.709 --> 00:00:20.750
Now, when we look at this
number right over here,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.430
it has nothing in
the tenths place.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.480
It has 7 in the
hundredths place.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.110
So this is the hundredths
place right over here.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.520
And then it also has nothing
in the thousandths place.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:41.339
So this number can be rewritten
as 7 times 1/100, or 7/100.

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.130
And now we could compare
these two numbers.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.046
And there's two ways you
could think about it.

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:47.797
You could try to turn
1/10 into hundredths.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:50.380
And the best way to do that, if
you want the denominator to be

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.173
increased by a factor
of 10, you need

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:55.030
to do the same thing
to the numerator.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.790
So all I did is I multiplied
the numerator and denominator

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.580
by 10.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.810
Ten 100's is the exact
same thing as 1/10.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.220
And here it becomes
very clear, 10/100

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.220
is definitely larger than 700.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.970
Another way you could
think about this is,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.070
look, if you were to
increment by hundredths here,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.150
you would start at
7/100, 8/100, 9/100,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.119
and then you would
get to 10/100.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.660
So then you would
get to that number.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.180
So this number, multiple ways
you could think about it,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.550
is definitely larger.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.780
So let me write this down.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.460
This is definitely
larger, greater than.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.260
This is greater than that.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.150
The greater than symbol
opens to the larger value.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.490
So here we have 0.093
and here we have 0.01.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.860
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.010
So this 9-- get
a new color here.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.620
This 9 is not in the
tenths, the hundredths.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.080
It's in the thousandths place.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.570
It's in the thousands place.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.580
And this 3 is in the-- I'm
running out of colors again.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.960
This 3 is in the ten
thousandths place.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.740
So the 3 is in the
ten thousandths place.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:14.455
So you could literally view
this as 9/1,000 plus 3/10,000.

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:17.080
And if you just wanted to write
it in terms of ten thousandths,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.380
you can multiply the
9 and 1,000 by 0.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.002
And so it becomes 90/10,000.

00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:25.460
And if you want to add them
together, you could, of course,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.386
write this as 93/10,000.

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:31.280
Ten thousandths.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.700
I always have trouble with
that "-ths" at the end.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.100
Now, let's think about this
number right over here, 0.01.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.662
Well, this 1 right over here
is in the hundredths place.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.870
It's in the hundredths place.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.040
So it literally
represents 1/100.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.931
So how can we compare
1/100 to 93/10,000?

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:53.306
So the best way
to think about it

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:56.270
is, well, what's 1/100 in
terms of ten thousandths?

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.720
Well, let's just multiply
both the numerator

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.897
and the denominator
here by 10 twice.

00:03:00.897 --> 00:03:02.980
Or you could say, let's
multiply them both by 100.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.290
If you multiply by 10 once,
you get to ten thousandths.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.310
It's the same thing as 1/100.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.940
Multiply by 10 again, you get
100/10,000 is the same thing

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.580
as 1/100.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.270
And we know that, 100
times 100 is 10,000.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.630
So here it becomes very
clear, 100/10,000, or 1/100,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.110
is definitely a
larger than 93/10,000.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.910
So this quantity
right over here is

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.320
less than this quantity there.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.957
Less than symbol, the small end
points to the smaller number,

00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:34.290
larger end to the larger number.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.720
In fact, that's true with the
less than and greater than.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.770
So let's see, this one right
over here, 0.6 versus 0.06.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.620
So here, I have a 6
in the tenths place.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.250
So it literally represents 6/10.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.440
And in the second, I have a
6 in the hundredths place.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.830
Well, 6/100 is definitely
smaller than 6/10.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.920
A hundredth is a
tenth of a tenth.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.680
So this one is pretty
straightforward.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.450
This is going to be
the larger value.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.670
0.6 is greater than 0.06.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.640
Now, let's think
about 0.3 versus 0.06.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.010
So this 3 literally
represents 3/10

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:24.450
while this 6 right over
here represents 6/100.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.430
And if you wanted to
compare them directly,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.030
you could multiply 3/10 times--
well, both the numerator

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.700
and the denominator by 10 so
you're not changing its value.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.170
10/10 is essentially
1, or it is 1.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.100
So this becomes 30/300.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.916
3/10 is the same
thing as 30/100.

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:45.440
And 30/100 is a lot
larger than 6/100.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.280
So this is greater than.
