1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.600
Dude.
How about Roy Nelson and Cro cop fight last night to crow grappler.

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:08.190
Good God.
What's he,
what happened?
I don't know.
Cro.

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.870
Cop wanted decision,
right?
Yeah.
One decision.
You,
did he take Roy Jones down or,

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.350
or no,
no.
Nelson Roy to a,

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.580
I tell you look the same though today.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.560
Once a creature with a black guy talking about writing notes in was one of the

7
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:26.200
greatest boxers of all time.
When do,
yeah,
they both,
you know,

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.210
they both look like exactly how they liked they,
it was like,

9
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:32.590
I bet going Nelson hits harder than Roy Jones right now.
How do,

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.280
uh,
yeah.

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.010
<v 1>Oh,
miles George just tagged Andre Fili.
He just tagged him with a left hand.</v>

12
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.360
Uh,
yeah.
I think if you had him on that power meter,
I think,
uh,

13
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.510
I think Roy probably hits harder [inaudible] hundred and 50 pounds more close.

14
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.390
He's probably Roy.
Roy Jones Jr is probably about 200 pounds these days.

15
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.010
But when Roy was fighting shape,
God,
he was fun.
Well,
when he was at his heaviest,

16
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:02.750
he was about 200 right when he fought John Ruiz won the heavyweight title.
Yeah.

17
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.230
That was a phenomenal fight when you watch that me,
that was just artistry,

18
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.240
speed and precision versus a,
you know,
a world champion.

19
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:14.360
And John Ruiz who's a real good fighter.

20
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.700
He's a real good heavyweight fighter.
But Roy Jones was at that time,

21
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.650
you know the big fucker,
the big fuck up.
Rather it was going from that fight,

22
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:29.651
dropping down to fight Tarver at one 75 and back down using 25 pounds and

23
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:33.360
looking like shit,
looking like do and Tarver is a monster.
He's a monster.
Yeah.

24
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.840
Yeah.
There's also Tarver and him had gone to a drug,

25
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.150
a decision in one fight earlier and Tarver thought he won.
And you know,
Roy,

26
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:44.400
he like,
he's Roy apparently had something to say about,
you know,

27
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.770
why he didn't perform at its best.

28
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.980
So when they were faced off tonight and the referee goes,
any questions?
He goes,

29
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.140
God,
excuses tonight Roy.
And then he went and knocked him out.

30
00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:56.010
Got To have a full Tara.
So

31
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.700
<v 0>he was so good about these guys.
Forget about Tom.
He's still doing it,
man.
Stills.</v>

32
00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:05.400
It was six people know what you're talking about.
Oh No,

33
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.150
you got know
the magic man.

34
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.260
You don't know fight companion fans don't know.
Get the fuck Outta here.

35
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.270
