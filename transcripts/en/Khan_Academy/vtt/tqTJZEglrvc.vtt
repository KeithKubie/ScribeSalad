00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's say that we have
a ball that we dropped

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.780
from a height of 10
meters, and every time it

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.380
bounces it goes half as
high as the previous bounce.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.100
So for example, you
drop it from 10 meters.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.010
The next time its peak height
is going to be at 5 meters.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.050
So the next time around,
on the next bounce,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.220
let me draw in that
same orange color.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.700
And the next bounce the ball
is going to go 5 meters.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.720
This distance right over
here is going to be 5 meters.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.450
And then the bounce after that
is going to be half as high.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.500
So it's going to go
2 and 1/2 meters.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.120
And it's just going
to keep doing that.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.440
So it's going to go 2 and
1/2 meters right over here.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740
And what I want to think
about in this video

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.660
is what is the total vertical
distance that the ball travels?

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.600
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.630
So it's first going to travel
10 meters straight down.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.530
So it's going to travel
10 meters just like that,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.990
and then it's going to travel
half of 10 meters twice.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.970
It's going to go up 5
meters, up half of 10 meters,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.140
and then down half of 10 meters.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.630
Let me put it this way.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.872
So each of these is
going to be 10 meters.

00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:28.830
Actually, I don't have
to write the units here.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.603
Let me take the
units out of the way.

00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:33.890
Let me write that clear.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.960
So the first bounce,
once again, it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.910
goes straight down 10 meters.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:45.150
Then on the next bounce it's
going to go up 10 times 1/2.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.451
And then it's going to
go down 10 times 1/2.

00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:51.700
Notice we just care about
the total vertical distance.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.310
We don't care about
the direction.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.760
So it's going to go up 10
times 1/2, up 5 meters,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.540
and then it's going
to go down 5 meters.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.260
So it's going to travel a total
vertical distance of 10 meters,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.200
5 up and 5 down.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.340
Now what about on this jump, or
on this bounce, I should say.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.230
Well here it's going to go
half as far as it went there.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.750
So it's going to go 10 times 1/2
squared up, and then 10 times

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.710
1/2 squared down.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.210
And I think you
see a pattern here.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.870
This looks an awful lot
like a geometric series,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.150
an infinite geometric series.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.030
It's going to just keep on going
like that forever and ever.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.220
So let's try to clean this
up a little bit so it looks

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.030
a little bit more like a
traditional geometric series.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.930
So if we were to simplify
this a little bit

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.635
we could rewrite
this as 10 plus 20.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.340
20 times 1/2 to the first power,
plus 10 1/2 times 1/2 squared

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.590
plus 10 times 1/2 squared
is going to be 20 times 1/2

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.550
squared, and we'll just
keep on going on and on.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.820
So this would be a
little bit clearer

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.100
if this were a 20
right over here.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.350
But we could do that.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.610
We could write 10 as
negative 10 plus 20,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.820
and then we have plus all of
this stuff right over here.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.590
Let me just copy and paste that.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.570
So plus all of this
right over here.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.420
And we can even
write this first.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.170
We can even write this 20
right over here is 20 times

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.840
1/2 to the 0 power
plus all of this.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.690
So now it very
clearly looks like

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.480
an infinite geometric series.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.850
We can write our entire
sum, and maybe I'll

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.410
write it up here since I don't
want to lose the diagram.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.970
We could write it
as negative 10.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.590
That's that negative
10 right over here.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.790
Plus the sum from
k is equal to 0

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:18.959
to infinity of 20 times our
common ratio to the k-th power.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.029
So what's this going to be?

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.120
What's this going
to turn out to be?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.380
Well we've already
derived in multiple videos

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.480
already here that the sum of an
infinite geometric series, so

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.780
the sum from k equals 0
to infinity of a times

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.050
r to the k is equal
to a over 1 minus r.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.887
So we just apply
that right over here.

00:04:39.887 --> 00:04:41.470
This business right
over here is going

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.570
to be equal to 20
over 1 minus 1/2,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.300
which is the same
thing as 20 over 1/2,

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.440
which is the same thing
as 20 times 2, or 40.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.580
So what's the total vertical
distance that our ball travels?

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.410
It's going to be negative
10 plus 40, which

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.450
is equal to 30 meters.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.000
Our total vertical distance that
the ball travels is 30 meters.
