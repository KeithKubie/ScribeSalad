00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:01.822
 Let's see if we can calculate 

00:00:01.822 --> 00:00:06.822
 4/3 minus 1/5 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.377
 If you learn how to put them 

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:12.984
 I encourage you to pause the video and calculate the output 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.821
 When you first consider the matter 

00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:16.724
 It will appear to you 

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:18.785
 That our fractures have different sanctuaries 

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:23.704
 Thus, it may be unclear how to subtract 1/5 from 4/3 

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:25.939
 For their different positions 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.418
 And how to put fractions with different denominators are rewriting the fractions 

00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:30.212
 To two fractions of the same name 

00:00:30.693 --> 00:00:33.240
 How can we find the same place for fractions? 

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:37.479
 Well, we'll find the common multiplier between the three and five 

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.937
 Ideally we will find the smallest common multiplier between the two properties 

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:41.502
 The three and five 

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:42.768
 How can we calculate that? 

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:45.017
 Well, we'll start with the two largest numbers 

00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:47.739
 It is the five and we find its multiples 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.239
 Until we reach a multiplication of the five, the division on the three is fully accepted 

00:00:51.538 --> 00:00:53.996
 The five do not accept dividing the three 

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:57.804
 The ten can not be divided on the three fifteen can be divided by the three 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.997
 In fact the fifteen are five hit three 

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:02.422
 Therefore, I can write both of these fractions 

00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:04.075
 As a number on the fifteenth 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.572
 Thus, how will it become 4/3 when written as a number on the fifteen 

00:01:08.572 --> 00:01:11.743
 Well, in order to get fifteen in the place instead of three 

00:01:11.743 --> 00:01:16.339
 We beat in five 

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:18.630
 And if we hit the place in five 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.418
 We did not want to change the value of the fracture 

00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:22.679
 We must hit the rugs in five 

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:25.863
 Well, I'll hit the rugs in five 

00:01:25.863 --> 00:01:28.693
 Four hit five equals twenty 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.207
 If, fraction 4/3 represents the same fraction 20/15 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.856
 Okay 

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:39.037
 Now how can we rewrite the fraction 1/5 as a number on fifteen 

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:41.197
 If so, we will have the number fifteen in the denominator 

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:45.808
 In order to get fifteen in the place instead of five, we hit in three 

00:01:46.757 --> 00:01:48.444
 If we hit the place in three 

00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:50.584
 We will also multiply the rugs in three 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.859
 If three hit 

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:54.667
 One hit three equals three 

00:01:55.087 --> 00:01:58.501
 We were therefore able to rewrite the wording of Question 4/3 minus 1/5 

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:02.032
 To the formula 20/15 minus 3/15 

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:04.450
 Now, the issue has become clearer 

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:05.689
 How much is the sum of the sum? 

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:07.857
 Well, the output will be a certain number of fifteen parts 

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:09.342
 We have 20/15 

00:02:09.342 --> 00:02:11.762
 We will take 3/15 

00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:13.688
 If, the result becomes 

00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:16.024
 If we had twenty of something and took three of them 

00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:18.692
 We will get seventeen of this thing 

00:02:18.727 --> 00:02:20.317
 In this case we are talking about the fifteen 

00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:23.771
 Consequently, the result will be 17/15 

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.244
 And if we want to write the fraction as fractional number 

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:28.946
 The division of the seventeen to fifteen equals one 

00:02:28.946 --> 00:02:30.212
 The rest are two 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:35.265
 Thus, the fraction is equal to 2/15 1 to solve another example 

00:02:35.265 --> 00:02:40.265
 To see if we can calculate 7/10 minus 5/8 

00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:49.579
 Minus 5/8 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.677
 I encourage you to turn off the video 

00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:53.378
 To see if you can calculate it yourself 

00:02:53.442 --> 00:02:55.231
 Well, like we did before 

00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.531
 We have different sanctuaries here 

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:59.090
 We need to rewrite it in the same place 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.296
 In this way we can perform the subtraction 

00:03:00.757 --> 00:03:05.734
 Well, what is the common multiplier between the numbers ten and eight 

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:07.122
 Ideally, what is the smallest common multiplier between the two properties 

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:08.275
 It is not necessary to find the smaller common multiplier 

00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:09.702
 But it will make it simpler 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.967
 Well, we'll start with the largest number in the list 

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:15.385
 Then we find multiples 

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:18.575
 Until we reach a multiplier that is fully divided over the other number 

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:19.530
 Here we look for a smaller common multiplier for the ten that can be divided by eight 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.536
 Well, the ten do not accept the division on the eight completely or not on the twenty 

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.347
 And not on the thirty, while the forty are divided by eight 

00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:29.383
 Forty of the ten complications and also of the eight complications 

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:31.644
 The 40 is the smallest common multiplier between the ten and eight 

00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:34.665
 Thus, we can rewrite both fractions 

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:35.871
 As a number on the forty 

00:03:36.393 --> 00:03:40.010
 If the number becomes forty minus 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.681
 Number on forty 

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:46.700
 Minus the number of forty equals the number of forty 

00:03:47.303 --> 00:03:49.930
 7/10 is a number of forty, what is this number? 

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:54.492
 Well, let's get forty in the place instead of ten 

00:03:54.492 --> 00:03:55.798
 We beat in four 

00:03:56.198 --> 00:03:57.783
 We will also do the same thing in the rugs 

00:03:57.783 --> 00:04:01.407
 We multiply the rites in four and seven hit four equals eighteen 

00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:04.494
 Thus, fraction 7/10 represents the same fraction 28/40 

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:07.400
 Now we will do the same thing with the other fraction 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.034
 In order to get forty in the place instead of eight 

00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:11.646
 We beat the place in five 

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.144
 Eight hit five equals forty 

00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:16.475
 If we hit the place in five 

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:18.960
 We will also multiply the rugs in five 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.499
 Five hit five equals twenty-five 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.942
 If 7/10 minus 5/8 equals exactly 

00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:30.942
 28/40 minus 25/40 and now became more pronounced 

00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:34.197
 We will get a certain number of 40 parts 

00:04:34.496 --> 00:04:39.231
 If we find twenty-eight of the forty, we have taken twenty-five of them 

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:41.125
 How much is the rest of the forty? 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.808
 Well, the rest is three parts of forty 

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:47.942
 28/40 minus 25/40 equals 3/40 

00:04:47.952 --> 00:04:52.952
 Twenty-eight minus twenty-five equals three .. And it ended 

00:04:53.782 --> 00:04:58.409
 7/10 minus 5/8 equals 3/40
