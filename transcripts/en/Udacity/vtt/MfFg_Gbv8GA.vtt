00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.260
DNA, the basic molecule of life, is all about chemistry. Although the structural

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.310
differences between the base letters may look

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.450
small to you, in the chemistry world,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.700
it does make a really big difference. These differences are what

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.590
essentially dictate which other chemicals can interact with.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.540
For example, DNA is most commonly double-stranded. It's double-stranded

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.410
because each base letter can form a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.910
chemical pair with another letter across from it.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.430
In fact we call this basepairing and it

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.420
follows very specific rules. In fact see if

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.170
you can look a the image here

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.590
and determine what those basepairing rules are. Look

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.840
at the text boxes below, and enter in

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.260
which base letter can partner with the other.
