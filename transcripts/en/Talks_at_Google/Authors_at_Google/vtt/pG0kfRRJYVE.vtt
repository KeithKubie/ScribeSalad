BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
Thanks for coming!

00:00:02.526 --> 00:00:05.010
Obviously, this is a
very special thing for me

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.192
as well, because this is my
husband, Christian Picciolini.

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:12.595
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:13.095
Thank you.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.030
For those of you who I haven't
met, I am Britton Picciolini.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.990
I've been here in
the Google Chicago

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.284
office for almost 13 years.

00:00:21.284 --> 00:00:21.950
It's 13 in June.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.300
So it's really exciting for
me to have Christian here

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.350
because he's grown
up with Google

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.210
and I've grown up with him
in the last 15 years or so.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.840
So just to start,
I'm going to play

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.637
a quick video that was part
of his Kickstarter efforts,

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.100
just the first couple minutes.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.055
It gives a little context on
Christian's life up until now.

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:45.510
So I'm just going to play that.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.360
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: My
name's Christian Picciolini,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.570
and I'm a 40 year-old
husband and a father of two.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.279
I grew up in a small, south side
Italian neighborhood of Chicago

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:03.070
called Blue Island.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.710
I was a good kid from a
hardworking, Italian immigrant

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.565
family until one day.

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:23.856
I met the most dangerous man in
America and everything changed.

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:25.314
[MUSIC SKREWDRIVER, "WHITE
 POWER"]

00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:38.760
From the time I was
14 years-old in 1987

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.800
until I hit bottom
in 1995, I was

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.472
one of the leaders of America's
most violent neo-Nazi hate

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:44.972
groups.

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:51.316
The white race suffers
from the rest of the world,

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:52.780
and it [INAUDIBLE] a lot.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.620
In America, the racial
tension's boiling over.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.910
Thankfully, a lot's
changed since then.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.420
Now I lead a different
group of pioneers.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.460
I co-founded a
nonprofit organization

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.310
called Life After
Hate in 2010 that's

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.155
made up of former
racist skinheads who

00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:12.475
have dedicated their
lives to combating hate

00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:14.230
through peaceful means.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.790
For two decades, I've
searched my own soul,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.520
wondering how I could have
strayed so far off track,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.896
committed vile acts of
hatred, and advocated

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:23.950
for the annihilation
of someone based solely

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.680
on the color of their
skin, who they loved,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.390
or the gods to
which they prayed.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.200
In 2008, 13 years after I
left the American white power

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.660
movement that I'd helped found,
I started to document my story,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900
hoping that others would
read it and realize

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.984
how disturbingly easy it is to
enter a world full of prejudice

00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:44.420
and violence.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.870
"Romantic Violence" is fully
written, but I need your--

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:54.194
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: All right.

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:54.694
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:58.606 --> 00:03:01.070
OK.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.212
OK.

00:03:03.212 --> 00:03:04.180
This is my dream job.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.084
I get to grill my husband.

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.364
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
That's not the deal.

00:03:09.364 --> 00:03:11.030
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
OK, by way of intro,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.196
let's just run through this.

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:13.630
Are we still good on volume?

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.630
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Yes.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.090
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Right.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.360
Christian Picciolini is an
award-winning television

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.055
producer, visual artists,
and reformed extremist.

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:23.835
After leaving the
violent hate movement

00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:26.250
he was part of
during his youth, he

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.724
began a painstaking process
of rebuilding his life.

00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:30.890
Picciolini earned a degree
in international business

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.100
and international relations
from DePaul University,

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.416
began his own global
entertainment and media firm,

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.711
and was appointed a member
of the Chicago Grammy

00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:39.970
Rockies [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.570
In 2010 and 2011,
he was nominated

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.820
for three regional Emmy
awards for his role

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.447
as executive
producer of JBTV, one

00:03:47.447 --> 00:03:50.005
of America's longest running
national broadcast music

00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:51.865
television programs.

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:55.150
He's worked as an adjunct
professor at the college level

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.310
as the community partnerships
manager for Threadless.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.065
Additionally, in
2013, he contributed

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:03.000
to Google Chairman Eric
Schmidt's and Director

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.850

New York Times bestseller

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.335
"The New Digital Age."

00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:10.970
Most notably, in 2010, he
co-founded Life After Hate,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.220
a nonprofit
organization dedicated

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.860
to helping communities
and organizations gain

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.370
the knowledge necessary
to implement long term

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.720
solutions that counter
all types of racism

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.080
and violent extremism.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.000
Please help me
welcome Christian.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:30.330
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Thank you.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.913
I remember coming
to Google when there

00:04:31.913 --> 00:04:35.730
were this many people working
in the Chicago office total.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.700
It was pretty cool.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.185
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Less.

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:38.560
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Yeah, less.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.620
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Less.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.090
So why write the book?

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.835
Could have kept it private.

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:45.960
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Yeah.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.932
It's taken me 10 years
to write the book.

00:04:48.932 --> 00:04:49.780
Why write the book?

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.448
So after I left the
movement in '95,

00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:55.878
I went through a
pretty dark depression.

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:59.770
It was a really dark
period of my life

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.230
until '99 when I started
working a temp job for IBM.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.725
A friend of mine recognized
I was going through a pretty

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:12.140
dark depression, and she
may be apply for a job

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.060
that I had absolutely no skills
for, I wasn't qualified for,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.860
but I decided I was gonna
fake it until I made it.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.980
I got the job with
IBM, and the first out

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.560
of all the millions of places
that big blue could have put me

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.380
for a job, the one place that
they placed me for my first job

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.200
was the high school that I'd
gotten kicked out of twice.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.955
And I was terrified.

00:05:37.955 --> 00:05:41.090
I thought for sure somebody's
going to see me in the hallway,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.994
an old teacher, an old
principal, whatever.

00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:43.950
And they're going to rat me out.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.199
They're going to tell my boss.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.190
I'm going to get fired.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.020
Here I've got this somewhat
of a decent temp job,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.530
and I'm just going
to get called out.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.580
And my second day at my high
school for this computer

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.110
rollout that we were doing,
I saw an old security guard

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.222
that I'd gotten in
a fistfight with.

00:06:02.222 --> 00:06:04.930
And I don't know why.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.300
I decided to run after him.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.782
And I tapped him
on the shoulder,

00:06:07.782 --> 00:06:11.107
and I said Mr. Holmes,
I'm Christian Picciolini.

00:06:11.107 --> 00:06:12.440
I don't know if you remember me.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.648
And he stopped me right away.

00:06:13.648 --> 00:06:15.440
And his just dropped
as he turned around.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.980
And he said, oh
yeah, I remember you.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.295
And right then and there,
I said, Mr. Holmes, I just

00:06:22.295 --> 00:06:24.045
want you to know that
I'm not that person.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.530
And I told him my story.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.290
And he shook my hand and
this redemptive light

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.250
encapsulated us and I started
to cry and he started to cry.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.065
And he made me promise that I
would tell the world my story.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:41.440
So that was one
of the catalysts.

00:06:44.897 --> 00:06:46.980
I'd gone through this
period where I really didn't

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.990
want to talk about my past.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.830
I thought if I
didn't talk about it

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.225
and I just worked
down a different path

00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:57.020
that it would never
come back to me.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.600
But I, internally,
wasn't healing.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.420
I wasn't living a positive life.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.500
So when I saw Mr. Holmes
the security guard,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.454
and he urged me to tell
the world, it clicked.

00:07:08.454 --> 00:07:11.780
I knew that at that moment
that, in order for me to heal,

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.803
I really needed to tell
the world about what

00:07:13.803 --> 00:07:15.538
I went through.

00:07:15.538 --> 00:07:18.037
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Well, let's
actually hear from the book.

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:23.252
So you want to read the
first full chapter, correct?

00:07:23.252 --> 00:07:25.950
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Yeah,
the book is actually out today.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.686
Today is the first
day that it's out.

00:07:28.686 --> 00:07:30.920
And I want to read the
first chapter, which

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.600
goes back to 8th grade.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.960
For me, it was a
significant moment

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.543
because it really introduced me
to violence for the first time

00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:41.480
and the power of it.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.330
I was a pretty
innocent, normal kid.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.250
My parents were
Italian immigrants

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.526
who came to this country in the
'60s, and I was pretty lonely.

00:07:52.526 --> 00:07:54.942
They had moved to an Italian
neighborhood on the southwest

00:07:54.942 --> 00:07:56.820
side of Chicago
called Blue Island,

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.140
what you saw in the video.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:04.680
And my parents were seeking
this slice of the American pie.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.900
So they went and they worked.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.400
And they started
their own business,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.330
and I rarely saw them.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.074
So I was raised while they
were at work by my grandparents

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:14.420
and my aunts and
uncles in Blue Island.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.780
But they moved me
to Oak Forest, which

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.170
was a middle class,
upper-middle class neighborhood

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.920
at the time to school there.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.700
So if you can envision
this, Monday through Friday,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.580
I would go to school
at this Catholic school

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.510
with a bunch of white kids,
privileged white kids.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.470
And I was picked up
every day at 3 o'clock

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.771
and shipped back to Blue Island
with all the Italian kids.

00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:38.270
So I never really
got an opportunity

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.561
to make friends in Oak Forest
because I didn't hang out

00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:41.500
after school.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.668
And I never made friends
with anybody in Blue Island

00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:45.626
because I didn't really
go to school with them.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:47.862
Kids are cruel, so--

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:49.320
I'm going to read
the first chapter

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.070
book that sets everything up.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.000
Jake Reilly picked be randomly
that soggy, April afternoon

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.460
to be the target of his
malicious playground taunts,

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.700
insulting me for anything
he could think of.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.790
He was the quintessential
class bully, Goliath,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.507
as we had secretly referred
to him since the 1st grade.

00:09:07.507 --> 00:09:09.590
And he took great pleasure
in routinely tormenting

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.890
his less fortunate eighth
grade classmates at St. Damian

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.410
Elementary School.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.120
Today, for what seemed the
millionth time, he chose me.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.992
Fuck you, I fired off.

00:09:20.992 --> 00:09:23.575
I instantly wished I could take
back my words as I spun around

00:09:23.575 --> 00:09:25.658
straight into the puffed
out chest of the grinning

00:09:25.658 --> 00:09:27.630
Goliath, who I realized
had just rifled

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.240
a handful of frozen grapes
at the back of my head.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.300
Fuck me.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.895
The whispering chatterboxes,
and plaid smocks and pig tails,

00:09:34.895 --> 00:09:36.735
and the skinny
jungle gym rats who

00:09:36.735 --> 00:09:38.210
were gathered around
various puddle

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.700
clusters on the playground
wasted no time sensing

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.500
the fresh blood in the water.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.480
Like hungry sharks smelling
chum, they closed in around us

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.615
in a flash.

00:09:46.615 --> 00:09:47.750
Oh look.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.237
Isn't it Pick-My-Weenie
tough, Jake

00:09:50.237 --> 00:09:52.070
snickered while jabbing
me hard in the chest

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.630
with his chubby index finger.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.340
He loved to mangle
my foreign last name

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.200
and never ran out of
creative ways to do so.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.840
How I longed for a normal name
like Eddie Peterson, Dan Cook,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.230
or Jimmy Mayfair.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.220
Anything but the impossible
to say Christian Picciolini,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.020
pronounced Pee-cho-lee-nee,
which made for all kinds of God

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.560
awful rhyming nicknames--
Pick-my-weenie, Suck-my-weenie,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.045
Lick-my-weenie--
basically anything Weenie.

00:10:19.045 --> 00:10:21.420
You gonna sic your greasy Blue
Island dago friends on me,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.350
he mocked, making fun of the
largely Italian neighborhood

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.830
just outside of Chicago,
where my parents had moved us

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.275
from before landing in the
suburban hellhole of Oak

00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:30.820
Forest, Illinois.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.315
After school, cheesedick, I'm
kicking your slimy Italian ass

00:10:34.315 --> 00:10:36.506
back to the ghetto
where you belong.

00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:38.380
Jake didn't flinch at
calling another student

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.640
an assface or a dick with ears
whenever her felt like it.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.740
And he never lied about
delivering a beating.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.031
But no one had ever dared
challenge him with a fuck you

00:10:46.031 --> 00:10:47.040
before.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.250
Even if it had escaped my
mouth by regrettable accident,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.550
I was a dead man and
everybody knew it.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.102
Certainly was nice of him to
suggest I had friends though.

00:10:57.102 --> 00:10:58.810
And if you don't show
up again this time,

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.410
pussy, he sneered, reeling me
in close by my hood strings,

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.977
I'll fucking kill you.

00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:06.810
Throughout eight years
of elementary school,

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.730
I'd managed to
invent enough excuses

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.290
to avoid getting physically
rearranged by Jake.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.990
But before I could muster a lie
good enough for me to skip out

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.030
on this particular jam, word
spread faster than Nutella

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.080
on warm toast.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.450
And by the time the
final recess bell rang,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.160
everybody knew about the
fight, except for the adults,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.020
of course.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.240
They were never there
when you needed them.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.240
I prayed one of the
teachers or the principal

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.940
herself would catch wind of the
fight and put and end to it.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.470
But my prayers went unanswered.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.130
Doom loomed over me.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.800
Jake Reilly was much bigger,
thick, and tall, and strong,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.110
and he'd surely have
his cronies behind him.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.764
I'd be in it alone.

00:11:42.764 --> 00:11:44.430
I didn't have any
friends in Oak Forest,

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.604
or even Blue Island for
that matter, to back me up.

00:11:47.604 --> 00:11:49.020
Other than a few
moves I picked up

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.144
when I watched "Rocky"
beat up Mr. T in the movies

00:11:51.144 --> 00:11:52.560
or how "Rowdy"
Roddy Piper smashed

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.490
Hulk Hogan over the head with
a steel chair on TV wrestling,

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.280
I had no clue how to
fight or defend myself.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.620
But I couldn't back
down now, not this time,

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.100
not with four years of
Goliath-dominated high school

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.830
and an endless supply of
ridicule on the horizon.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.100
Running away and being
forever branded a pussy

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.322
would be infinitely worse
than getting pummeled.

00:12:11.322 --> 00:12:12.780
Hoping that with
more time, I might

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.150
be able to come up with a
believable last minute excuse

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.808
to not show up and
get my ass kicked,

00:12:16.808 --> 00:12:18.891
I took the longer route
home after the final class

00:12:18.891 --> 00:12:20.880
bell rang.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.840
No such luck.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.090
All I could think about was
how to convince my parents

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.110
to let me transfer
schools by tomorrow

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.110
so I wouldn't have to
deal with the mockery that

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.830
was sure to be heaped on me by
my classmates the next morning.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.010
My parents weren't home.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.030
I changed out of my light blue
school uniform and navy slacks,

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.440
grabbed my Santa Cruz skateboard
and apprehensively rode

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.650
the six blocks to the park
where the fight was to happen.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.650
I knew the entire 8th
grade class would be there

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.480
to witness my slaughter.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.760
People even placed
bets and proclaimed

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.760
the loser, who everybody
full expected to be me,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.186
would have to pay
the winner 10 bucks.

00:12:52.186 --> 00:12:53.848
The moment the
fight was over, I'd

00:12:53.848 --> 00:12:58.080
be ruined forever, beaten,
stigmatized, and forgotten,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.670
cast atop the growing heap
of junior high nobodies who'd

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.910
already been
humiliated by Goliath.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.410
I couldn't care
less about where I'd

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.202
get the money to pay
off to the stupid bet,

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.493
knowing I could easily swipe
that from my grandmother's

00:13:08.493 --> 00:13:10.100
purse without her knowledge.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.770
But I also knew that once I was
dispatched into nothingness,

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.130
there was no coming back.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.220
No one ever recovered from that.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.485
As I rode up, I spied the
giant lumbering confidently

00:13:19.485 --> 00:13:21.110
among the large group
that had gathered

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.697
like buzzards anticipating
a fresh roadkill buffet.

00:13:24.697 --> 00:13:26.280
Attempting to steady
my shaking knees,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.766
trying to keep my
fear under wraps,

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:29.140
I stepped off my
board, struggled

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.189
to take in my
finals gulps of air.

00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:34.730
Wiping away the nervous sweat
that was already trickling down

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.059
my brow, I thought one last
time about running away.

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:39.725
Maybe being exiled
from the ranks of St.

00:13:39.725 --> 00:13:41.580
Damian's lower order
wouldn't be worse

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.010
than getting my face pounded
in by this massive beast.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.350
As I retreated backwards,
planting my foot back

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.510
onto my skateboard,
and turning to push off

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.560
with my unsteady leg, some of
the more spiteful onlookers

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.480
suddenly broke into a clamor.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.490
Pick my weenie, pick my
weenie, pick my weenie!

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.070
Sensing my dread, the whole
crowd had turned against me.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.320
I felt myself becoming dizzy
and detaching from reality,

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.870
fading into the ether.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.570
As I inhaled another
series of quick,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.770
shallow breaths to
try to calm my nerves.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.030
I turned toward my tormentor
to accept my fate, just

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.630
as a colossal was of
spit flew through the air

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.560
and landed with a wet, dewy
thwack dead on my cheek.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.680
Hushed silence, except
for Jake, whose loud,

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.780
guttural snort only meant that
another loogie was imminent.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.390
Anxious panic of
flushed through me.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.570
And before I could wipe
his spit from my face,

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.120
another glob of
thick yellow phlegm

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.520
struck me in the chest
like a sniper's bullet,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.910
and slowly dribbled down
my turquoise ocean Pacific

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.490
T-shirt.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.870
What's wrong, dickbreath,
Reilly jeered,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.390
pudgy arms crossed
over his chest.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.890
Are you chicken?

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.790
Bawk, bawk.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.730
The crowd formed
a wall around us.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.790
Suck-My-Weenie ain't got
no balls, he proclaimed.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.040
A shock of laughter broke
out from the enclosing group

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.040
of spectators.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.540
Jesus Christ, this kid was big.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.170
Goliath was growing twice as big
as he stood before me, while I

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.235
shrunk smaller and smaller.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.390
This is suicide, I thought.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.530
He took a step towards
me and spat a third time

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.330
at ground near my feet, as if to
mark the spot of my execution.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.805
as the grip of the taunting
mob tightened around us,

00:15:13.805 --> 00:15:18.110
we circled each other, the
requisite trash talk spewing

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:19.730
from the ogre's crooked smile.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.120
Jake was name-calling.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.700
I was stalling.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.485
My swollen purple
eye from last week,

00:15:24.485 --> 00:15:26.860
the one I'd gotten when three
black kids from Blue Island

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.550
jumped me and stole my bike,
was finally beginning to heal.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.050
And i didn't want
to have to explain

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.200
a fresh one to my parents.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.829
Terror overtook me
and I could barely

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:36.620
hear the crowds
increasingly muffled chants

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.117
over my own fearful thoughts
and the dull, echoing crackle

00:15:40.117 --> 00:15:42.210
of crisp leaves under my feet.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.990
Quit being a faggot like
your pussy hairdresser dad,

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.996
and stand still so I
can frickin' kill you.

00:15:47.996 --> 00:15:50.750
Jake made a beeline towards me.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.090
The tendons in my arms
tightened, pulsed.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.485
My mind spun with fear,
becoming further detached

00:15:55.485 --> 00:15:56.700
from my surroundings.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.610
My heart thumped out of chest.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.405
Out of sheer despair, I summoned
the nerve to step in with him

00:16:01.405 --> 00:16:04.410
and throw the first
punch-- kill or be killed.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.390
What more could I lose?

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.140
At least I go to
my death valiantly.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.005
My baby brother
buddy would be proud

00:16:10.005 --> 00:16:12.080
that I wasn't a complete coward.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.720
I shut my eyes and tensed
my sweaty right hand,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.720
pulled it back, and swung
wildly, landing squarely.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.412
Jake went down.

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:20.840
Holy shit.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.690
My first instinct was
to bolt, but my legs

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.270
weren't cooperating.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.630
From a sudden jumble of
gasps and groans behind me,

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.007
I made out the frenzied
voice of Jake's goon,

00:16:29.007 --> 00:16:32.200
Kyle McKinney, yelling,
hit him, hit him!

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.660
But Jake stayed put on the
ground, confused, whimpering,

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.155
covering his bleeding nose.

00:16:37.155 --> 00:16:40.120
Hit him again, his pal shouted.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.000
Shocked, I realized
he actually wanted

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.150
me to beat up his best friend.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.700
Could it be?

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.042
Was everyone as sick of
Goliath's bullying as I was?

00:16:48.042 --> 00:16:49.500
Or was it that the
rush of fighting

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.350
was so intoxicating even
his most loyal subjects

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.474
savored the blood and violence
over their friendship?

00:16:55.474 --> 00:16:56.890
I shook the thought
out of my head

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.550
and fell hard on that
bastard Jake Reilly

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.758
with eight solid years of
Catholic school retribution

00:17:00.758 --> 00:17:01.885
on my mind.

00:17:01.885 --> 00:17:04.010
Adrenalin pumping, I pinned
him down with my knees,

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.029
pulled back my fists and slammed
them onto his face again,

00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:10.010
and again, and again.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.079
Sobbing, he cried,
stop, stop, I quit.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:12.930
Just stop.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.329
You win.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.250
Steams of tears turned
into crimson rivers

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.540
flowing down his bruised cheeks.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.940
I rose to my feet and wiped
my bloodied, swollen knuckles

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.790
across my T-shirt.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.357
You owe me 10 bucks,
was all I could

00:17:24.357 --> 00:17:26.895
mutter through a mouth that
was absent of any saliva.

00:17:26.895 --> 00:17:29.976
I turned to leave, though
my wobbly legs were barely

00:17:29.976 --> 00:17:32.784
able to carry me, and I
thought I might pass out

00:17:32.784 --> 00:17:35.200
right there in front of the
whole stunned 8th grade class.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.780
Just then, my oxygen-deprived
lungs remembered to breath.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.500
I inhaled deeply as the faint
sounds of hooting and hollering

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.440
slowly become audible
and then filled my ears.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.870
The giant lay
defeated before me.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.298
The next morning, my
classmates swarmed around me

00:17:50.298 --> 00:17:51.890
the moment I got to school.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.305
My once nonexistent stature
had grown to epic proportions

00:17:54.305 --> 00:17:55.530
overnight.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.600
I'd become a bully-slayer.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.100
Even the cool kids who'd ignored
me for the last eight years

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.143
looked up to me because I'd
taken down one of their own.

00:18:03.143 --> 00:18:04.684
Not to mention I
was 10 bucks richer.

00:18:04.684 --> 00:18:07.300
I was drunk with my
new-found significance.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.694
Suddenly, I wasn't
the weird Italian kid

00:18:09.694 --> 00:18:11.360
who spent all his
after-school free time

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.680
with elderly grandparents
in their Blue Island

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.660
ghetto instead of the stale
upper-middle class confines

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.830
of this Oak Forest suburbia.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.975
For a brief moment, I
wasn't the little boy

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.375
with the peculiar
mom and dad who

00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:25.084
couldn't speak proper English,
who owned a beauty shop

00:18:25.084 --> 00:18:27.500
and brought their kids sloppy
lunches in oil-stained paper

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.620
sacks.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.690
No, I was the tough kid, the
most dangerous kid in school,

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.639
in all of Oak Forest, even.

00:18:35.639 --> 00:18:37.930
And if Oak Forest had been
any closer than the 20 miles

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.124
away it was from
downtown Chicago,

00:18:40.124 --> 00:18:42.582
then perhaps the mayor would
have even thrown a parade down

00:18:42.582 --> 00:18:44.460
State Street in my honor.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.300
During my first period
class, I flexed my fists,

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.806
silently studying them,
trying to take in the reality

00:18:49.806 --> 00:18:51.740
that these two balled
up, bruised hands

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.330
were my ticket to
respect and power.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.060
My baby brother
wouldn't be the only kid

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.840
that looked up to me anymore.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.570
I took this lesson to
heart, absorbing it

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.110
in every fiber, every
muscle, and organ in my body.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.378
It would end up serving me
well in the years to come,

00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:07.873
when I'd help build one
of America's most violent

00:19:07.873 --> 00:19:09.370
home terror organizations.

00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:15.857
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:18.851 --> 00:19:22.700
That was the moment
where I lost my innocence

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:30.336
and realized that power was
something that I wanted,

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:33.312
something that I wanted.

00:19:33.312 --> 00:19:35.856
And the rest is kind of history.

00:19:35.856 --> 00:19:38.272
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: So let's
talk a little bit about music

00:19:38.272 --> 00:19:40.448
and its relation to the story.

00:19:40.448 --> 00:19:43.292
So as people have seen if
they've picked up the book,

00:19:43.292 --> 00:19:44.750
Joan Jett did the
foreword for you.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.147
There's a thread of music
throughout the entire book.

00:19:48.147 --> 00:19:50.730
Do you want to talk a little bit
about how music played a role

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.000
in you becoming involved?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.820
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: So
right after that happened,

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.572
that was 8th grade
right before the summer

00:19:55.572 --> 00:20:00.890
that I got recruited for
America's first white power

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:06.520
skinhead group so interestingly
enough, in the '60s-- skinheads

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.570
were born in the
'60s, and most people

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.954
associate being a skinhead with
being a neo-Nazi or a racist.

00:20:11.954 --> 00:20:13.770
In fact, that's not true.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.130
Racists and
nationalists co-opted

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.630
the skinhead subculture
And took it as their own.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.510
So in the mid-80s,
'85, an individual

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:31.325
named Clark Martell took
this racist skinhead scene

00:20:31.325 --> 00:20:34.862
from England and started the
first American white power

00:20:34.862 --> 00:20:36.188
skinhead gang.

00:20:36.188 --> 00:20:39.688
It just so happens that he
lived right across the alley

00:20:39.688 --> 00:20:43.600
from where my friend
at the time lived.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.100
And I remember the
first time I met

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.610
Clark Martell, I
was 14 years-old,

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.510
I was in an alley at night
with one of the few friends

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.000
that I had, smoking a
joint behind a garage.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.665
And all of a sudden, we'd see
this car, this '69 Firebird,

00:20:58.665 --> 00:21:00.396
just roaring down
this long alley.

00:21:00.396 --> 00:21:03.540
It was like a scene out of a
film, and I'll never forget it.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.020
And the car is spitting
up gravel and dust,

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.660
and it stops, screeching
like six inches

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.155
from where we were standing.

00:21:11.155 --> 00:21:14.063
And I recognize the
car because it belonged

00:21:14.063 --> 00:21:15.646
to the guy who lived
across the alley,

00:21:15.646 --> 00:21:17.642
but I didn't
recognize the guy who

00:21:17.642 --> 00:21:19.650
came out of the passenger side.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:23.145
And as soon as the car stopped,
he made a beeline towards me.

00:21:23.145 --> 00:21:25.880
And he came up to me took
the joint out of my mouth

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.420
and smacked me in the head hard.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.114
And he said-- and I'll
never forget it-- don't you

00:21:31.114 --> 00:21:33.155
know that that's what the
Communists and the Jews

00:21:33.155 --> 00:21:36.020
want you to do to
keep you docile?

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.732
I was 14.

00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:39.190
I didn't know what
a communist was.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.420
I don't think I'd ever met
a Jewish person before,

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.470
and I certainly didn't know
what the word docile meant.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.080
But I was struck
by his presence.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.340
I was enamored by the
power that he had.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:51.930
He was older.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.090
He was 24 and I was 14.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.150
But one thing I
recall was the music

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.630
that was playing
when the car stopped.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.820
And I had been into punk
rock and the skater music

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.390
for a while.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.550
And I recognized that it
was similar to punk rock,

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.211
but it was different.

00:22:08.211 --> 00:22:10.119
And I actually
didn't remember this

00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:12.856
until I did an interview
with someone last week.

00:22:12.856 --> 00:22:14.980
When they asked me if there
was any other extremist

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.280
that had a soundtrack.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.055
And I thought for a moment,
and I said I really don't know.

00:22:20.055 --> 00:22:22.430
I think that skinheads might
be one of the only extremist

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.980
groups that actually have
music as a soundtrack.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.280
They use music as
a recruiting tool.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.210
And from the time
I was 14 years-old

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:36.050
until the time I was 25, music
played a really central role

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.440
in my part in the movement.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.582
I was drawn in initially by
the music and by the fashion.

00:22:41.582 --> 00:22:42.790
I didn't understand politics.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.125
I wasn't raised to be racist.

00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:46.780
Matter of fact, my
parents were often,

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.510
as immigrants, victims
of prejudice and racism.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.730
But music drew me in.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.520
It influenced me.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.780
The lyrics that they
used in the songs

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.170
gave me the answers
to the problems that I

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.520
thought I had at the time.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.670
I was lonely.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.160
I was this disenfranchised
kid who really wanted

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.188
to do something that mattered.

00:23:09.188 --> 00:23:12.646
I wanted to belong to something
because I was pretty lonely.

00:23:12.646 --> 00:23:14.640
And music was the
tool that brought me

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.010
in to this subculture.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.430
And in fact, it's probably the
most powerful propaganda tool

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:25.610
that racists in our
country, and even abroad,

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:29.322
have to recruit young people.

00:23:29.322 --> 00:23:32.660
So it's a pretty powerful
tool that's used.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.860
As far as Joan
Jett goes, in '96,

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.371
after I'd left
the movement, when

00:23:37.371 --> 00:23:38.870
I was going through
that depression,

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.400
I started a punk band because
it was really the only thing

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.337
that I knew how to do.

00:23:43.337 --> 00:23:43.920
I loved music.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.534
I knew how to play
music, and I wanted

00:23:45.534 --> 00:23:47.700
to do something that was
completely opposite of what

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.210
I had spent seven years doing.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.000
And one of our first shows
happened by accident.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.840
We were asked to open
a show for Joan Jett.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.860
And of course, we said yes.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.080
And during our soundcheck,
after our soundcheck,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.170
Joan had noticed me backstage,
and I was depressed.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.250
I was probably drunk.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.493
And she came up to me
and put her arm around me

00:24:09.493 --> 00:24:11.240
and said, hey.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.238
Are you OK?

00:24:12.238 --> 00:24:13.193
And I didnt know her.

00:24:13.193 --> 00:24:14.234
I'd never met her before.

00:24:14.234 --> 00:24:17.230
I was slightly starstruck by it.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.930
And I started to
tell her my story.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.138
I didn't mention that I was
involved in the movement,

00:24:21.138 --> 00:24:24.839
but I had mentioned that I was
going through some tough times.

00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:26.630
And she put her arm
around me, and she said

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:27.830
you guys were really great.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.371
You guys should come
on tour with us.

00:24:29.371 --> 00:24:31.189
And she didn't have to do that.

00:24:31.189 --> 00:24:31.980
She didn't know me.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.604
She didn't know
anything about my band.

00:24:33.604 --> 00:24:37.370
She didn't know if we were
gonna sell tickets that night.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.770
And it was one of
the first moments

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.898
after this depression
of not talking

00:24:41.898 --> 00:24:43.750
about what I'd been
through that allowed

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.668
me to realize that there
were people out there that

00:24:46.668 --> 00:24:49.110
cared about me.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.510
So years later, we'd
done some touring.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.610
She had managed us
for a little while.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.304
Years later, when I
decided to finish the book,

00:24:57.304 --> 00:24:59.256
I approached Joan and
I told her the story.

00:24:59.256 --> 00:25:00.714
And I told her my
whole background.

00:25:00.714 --> 00:25:02.105
And she was shocked.

00:25:02.105 --> 00:25:02.674
She didn't know
anything about it,

00:25:02.674 --> 00:25:04.215
but she agreed to
write the foreword,

00:25:04.215 --> 00:25:06.342
and I think it's a
beautiful foreword.

00:25:06.342 --> 00:25:09.276
I'm really glad that she did it.

00:25:09.276 --> 00:25:12.210
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: So you
talk about the movement.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:15.633
You say the movement--
most people don't really

00:25:15.633 --> 00:25:18.567
know much about the skinhead
culture and the movement.

00:25:18.567 --> 00:25:21.501
I've learned a ton
from you, obviously,

00:25:21.501 --> 00:25:23.960
just going through
this process with you.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.950
But we don't hear a lot
about these domestic groups.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.460
We hear a lot about ISIS.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.520
We hear about ISIL.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.377
We hear a lot about
what I would consider

00:25:33.377 --> 00:25:35.373
international
non-domestic things.

00:25:35.373 --> 00:25:37.831
We don't hear a lot about that,
and I think a lot of people

00:25:37.831 --> 00:25:39.590
are surprised to hear
some of the facts

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.840
about some of the current
organizations in the United

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.340
States.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.280
If you could talk a
little about that.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.320
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: In
the mid-80s til the mid-90s,

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.903
you could walk down
the streets of Chicago

00:25:52.903 --> 00:25:55.410
and chances are pretty good you
would come across a skinhead

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.560
or somebody that looked like
a skinhead-- shaved head,

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.730
tattoos, boots.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.315
Nowadays, you don't
see that as much.

00:26:04.315 --> 00:26:05.690
Because one of
the things that we

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.300
taught when I was part
of the organization

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.050
was a concept called
leaderless resistance

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:14.630
and mainstreaming, which
taught people who were attached

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.310
to these groups to blend in,

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.880
So while you may
not see skinheads

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.575
throwing chairs on the
Geraldo Show or the Oprah Show

00:26:23.575 --> 00:26:27.010
or whatever anymore,
they absolutely exist.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.390
As a matter of fact,
the FBI just this year

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.160
released a report that
listed their top perceived

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.450
homegrown terrorist threats.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:40.970
And of the 12 that were listed,
ISIS was not number one.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.220
You would think because we
talk about it all the time.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.095
They were number two.

00:26:44.095 --> 00:26:47.920
Number one was a
group of white racists

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.660
called Sovereign Citizens.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.760
Number three was
neo-Nazi skinheads.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.500
Number four was Ku Klux Klan.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.412
Number five was
Christian Identity.

00:26:56.412 --> 00:26:59.310
What I'm trying to say is
all these groups put together

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.520
are what I was, just segmented.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.440
So while we hear
a lot in the media

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:12.330
about middle class girls
going to Syria to join ISIS,

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.665
and that happens, I would
caution that there is probably

00:27:16.665 --> 00:27:21.980
a bigger threat in this country
from far right extremists.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:26.720
Though you may not see them,
I assure you they're there.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.940
We see these things when a lone
wolf like Wade Michael Page

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.690
walks into a Sikh temple in Oak
Creek, Wisconsin and murderers,

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.005
tragically, seven
innocent people.

00:27:37.005 --> 00:27:40.910
We hear it when
Randal Lee Krager

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:45.133
goes to a synagogue
parking lot in Missouri

00:27:45.133 --> 00:27:49.206
and shoots who he thinks
are four Jewish people.

00:27:49.206 --> 00:27:50.572
It happens all the time.

00:27:50.572 --> 00:27:52.030
It doesn't happen
on a large scale.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.315
It happens on an
individualized scale

00:27:54.315 --> 00:27:59.819
and on a lone wolf basis, which
I think is much more dangerous.

00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:01.735
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Why
doesn't the media seem

00:28:01.735 --> 00:28:05.724
to put that angle out there?

00:28:05.724 --> 00:28:07.197
I was shocked to
hear through you

00:28:07.197 --> 00:28:10.640
that the Oklahoma
bombings were actually

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.347
related to the movement.

00:28:12.347 --> 00:28:13.472
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Yeah.

00:28:13.472 --> 00:28:14.930
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
It doesn't seem

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.700
like that was a
story at the time,

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.765
that that was a piece
of it, that it was just

00:28:19.765 --> 00:28:21.290
a lone wolf and a
horrific bombing.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.110
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Yeah, Timothy McVeigh

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.780
was found with a book called
"The Turner Diaries," which

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.340
was a book written-- a
fictional book that was written

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.880
about white extremists
blowing up a federal building

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.963
and causing widespread
chaos and murder.

00:28:36.963 --> 00:28:40.545
And Timothy McVeigh was found
with copies of the book.

00:28:40.545 --> 00:28:43.870
There was a copy of
the book in the van.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.360
Why you don't hear about them?

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.685
I'm not really sure.

00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:51.350
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Is
it lack of knowledge?

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.863
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
No, I don't

00:28:51.863 --> 00:28:53.071
think it's lack of knowledge.

00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:54.690
I mean, media tends
to go with stories

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.465
that are a little bit more
exciting, and not exciting

00:28:58.465 --> 00:29:00.540
in a positive way.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:06.390
But the media focuses on
what's hot at the moment.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.530
But lone wolf activities
happen all the time.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.594
Every year, there's
dozens and dozens

00:29:11.594 --> 00:29:15.260
of these tragedies that happen.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:20.216
They don't point the finger
at them and I don't know why.

00:29:20.216 --> 00:29:22.591
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: You've
done quite a bit of consulting

00:29:22.591 --> 00:29:26.487
with different law
enforcement organizations,

00:29:26.487 --> 00:29:28.440
with the Anti-Defamation League.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:34.110
Talk about what they look for
from you, from your experience.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.700
What kind of things are they
trying to understand and gain

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.637
from you?

00:29:37.637 --> 00:29:39.720
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: So
like the video mentioned,

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.910
in 2010, I co-founded
an organization called

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:48.980
Life After Hate, which was set
up specifically to-- initially

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:52.380
it was set up for my partner
and I, when we found ourselves

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.610
after years of not knowing
what each other was doing,

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.147
he had left the movement
and had kids the same age.

00:29:58.147 --> 00:30:00.230
I had left the movement
and had kids the same age.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.354
There was nowhere for us
to talk about our stories.

00:30:02.354 --> 00:30:06.452
So we launched lifeafterhate.org
as a literary magazine,

00:30:06.452 --> 00:30:09.600
an online magazine just
to talk about our stories.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.680
Very quickly, we were
overwhelmed with people

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.310
reaching out from all over the
world who had similar stories.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:18.100
Up until that time, there had
been no organization support

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.972
group for people
who left hate groups

00:30:19.972 --> 00:30:24.440
or who wanted to leave
hate groups to get help.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.630
And we quickly found out
that, through Life After Hate,

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.550
our unique perspective
was something

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.466
that law enforcement, and
academia, and community

00:30:32.466 --> 00:30:33.440
organizations lacked.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.610
They understood the problem.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.080
They understood that
there was a problem,

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.500
but not having spent
time in those groups,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.850
they didn't really
have a solution

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.080
to fix it from the inside out.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.730
So when Life After Hate
became more of a consulting

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.340
organization, we started to
work with law enforcement

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.280
and with higher education
to help them understand

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.280
the mindset of how people are
recruited into these groups,

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.787
and likewise, what it
takes to deradicalize

00:31:01.787 --> 00:31:05.370
people who are coming out
of these organizations.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:10.680
Because, like myself, I
wasn't raised to be a racist.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.930
It wasn't who I initially was.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.150
I went through a
seven year period

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:16.625
where I was indoctrinated
and was passionate about what

00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:17.510
I believed in.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.070
But it wasn't my true self.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.190
So like me, there are thousands
of other people out there

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.870
who went through that
and have never found out

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.620
how to integrate with
society in a positive way

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.270
after they've left these groups,
whether it's because they're

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.955
stigmatized or too scared to
talk about their experiences,

00:31:33.955 --> 00:31:35.871
or whether they've gone
to prison or whatever.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.200
It was our goal to really
help them understand

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.012
what it takes for people to
get introduced to these groups.

00:31:46.012 --> 00:31:47.970
It's a common problem,
and we see it with ISIS.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.630
We see it with other
extremist groups.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.504
We see it with gangs.

00:31:50.504 --> 00:31:53.330
There really isn't that much of
a difference between why people

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:58.270
join an inner-city street gang
and why they become a neo-Nazi

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:58.770
skinhead.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.769
It's look for attention.

00:31:59.769 --> 00:32:01.460
It's looking for
something to belong in.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.240
It's trying to find an
excuse for the problems

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.810
that you're experiencing
in your life.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.425
We never took responsibility
for our problems.

00:32:09.425 --> 00:32:11.334
It was always because
of somebody else.

00:32:11.334 --> 00:32:12.917
Black people would
move in, and that's

00:32:12.917 --> 00:32:14.254
why there was more crime.

00:32:14.254 --> 00:32:15.600
Or the Jews own the media.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.016
That's why they
talk bad about us.

00:32:17.016 --> 00:32:19.292
We never accepted the
responsibility ourselves

00:32:19.292 --> 00:32:21.276
that our lives were
pretty shitty because we

00:32:21.276 --> 00:32:23.260
made them pretty shitty.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.610
So we really want to
help organizations

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.430
understand the mindset.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.069
Because we think that that
could help solve the problem.

00:32:30.069 --> 00:32:31.610
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
One of the things

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:35.730
I was the most fascinated
by was to hear [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:39.610
this magic age of 14,
13, 14, that, I think,

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.120
a lot of you who came together
for a conference in Dublin

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.490
against discovered when
you were all telling

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.810
your story that there was a
common thread about a time

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:50.210
in your life that you
actually became indoctrinated

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.090
and part of the movement.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.090
Can you talk about that?

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:53.860
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Yeah, that's

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.300
actually an interesting story.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.530
And I ow a lot of the work that
Life After Hate does to Google.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:04.010
Because in 2011,
Google Ideas sponsored

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.660
in Dublin, Ireland, a summit
against violent extremism.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.260
It was the first
one of its kind,

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.940
and they invited about 150
former members of extremist

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.080
groups-- and that was everything
from far right extremism,

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.530
to former gang members,
to former IRA members,

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:25.140
to former Boko Haram, to you
name it-- but also invited

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:30.346
victims and survivors of
violence caused by extremists.

00:33:30.346 --> 00:33:32.220
And they put us all
in the same room.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.955
And it was Google Ideas and the
Council on Foreign Relations

00:33:34.955 --> 00:33:36.880
and the Tribeca
Film Festival who

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.400
sponsored this event in Dublin.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.460
And what we realized after
talking to each other,

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.930
this mind-bending experience
of being put in a room

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.560
and discussing what
we'd all been through,

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.680
that there's a pretty
common thread on why people

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.590
join these groups.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:57.660
A lot of times it's young kids
around the ages of 12,13,14,

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.790
who are misguided and looking
for something to belong to,

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:05.100
moreso looking to do
something that matters.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.387
I could have been intercepted
by ballerinas or whoever.

00:34:09.387 --> 00:34:10.845
And I may have gone
down that path.

00:34:10.845 --> 00:34:13.940
It just happens that a
charismatic individual

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.395
saw in me that I was
ambitious and looking

00:34:16.395 --> 00:34:17.552
for something to belong to.

00:34:17.552 --> 00:34:23.053
And it was a product of
environment and circumstance.

00:34:23.053 --> 00:34:25.060
But I mean there's a
really common thread

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.480
on why young people
join extremist groups.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.400
It's no different from
why they join gangs.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.354
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
Which is what?

00:34:33.354 --> 00:34:35.770
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: I think
you're looking for something

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:36.949
to belong to.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:41.870
For me, specifically, I
was a pretty ambitious kid.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:46.080
And when I saw this opportunity
to join a startup, which

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.462
is what the skinhead
movement was at the time,

00:34:49.462 --> 00:34:50.909
I jumped at the opportunity.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:53.936
There were these older guys who
were paying attention to me.

00:34:53.936 --> 00:34:56.810
I was given tasks that mattered.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:00.840
I would go to photocopy flyers,
and I would go put flyers

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.180
on their windshields.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.140
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
You were respected.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:03.690
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
I was respected

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.100
and I was rewarded
for my hard work

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.515
when everybody else
around me, like my family,

00:35:08.515 --> 00:35:12.910
was too busy to notice that
I needed that attention.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.334
So they paid attention to
me when I really needed it.

00:35:15.334 --> 00:35:17.750
And not to say that there was
any lack of love or anything

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:18.850
in my life.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.780
Because I was always
surrounded by love.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.262
But I wasn't given
the attention that I

00:35:24.262 --> 00:35:28.050
was looking for, which was to
do something that mattered.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.425
So when they saw
that in me, they

00:35:29.425 --> 00:35:32.490
scooped me up pretty quickly.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:35.156
And it took me awhile to get
used to the politics of it.

00:35:35.156 --> 00:35:37.370
At first, it wasn't
about the politics.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.830
It was about the fashion and
being a part of this group.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:44.258
But I quickly
became indoctrinated

00:35:44.258 --> 00:35:47.186
into the politics, and I
was passionate about it.

00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:48.686
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
We're definitely

00:35:48.686 --> 00:35:50.670
going to have time
for a few questions.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:51.700
So think about what
you might want to ask.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.408
The last question I'll
have for Christian

00:35:53.408 --> 00:35:58.140
is a lot going on-- Baltimore,
pretty timely challenges

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.890
for the country right now.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:05.210
What are your thoughts on things
like Ferguson and Baltimore.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:07.870
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Well, I think it's tragic.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:11.751
I mean, we see it over and over
again in places like Ferguson,

00:36:11.751 --> 00:36:15.599
and New York, and Baltimore.

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:18.485
And I think that change has
to come from the community.

00:36:18.485 --> 00:36:25.630
I think that community
leaders and faith leaders,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:29.135
the power's in their
hands to fix the situation

00:36:29.135 --> 00:36:31.050
in their communities.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.822
I also think that there's a
problem with law enforcement.

00:36:33.822 --> 00:36:38.080
I think that while
their job is to protect,

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.080
it is not so much
about serving anymore.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.990
Not to say that they
don't have a tough job,

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:46.614
I think that law
enforcement is not

00:36:46.614 --> 00:36:47.726
doing a good enough job
to understand what's

00:36:47.726 --> 00:36:48.934
happening in the community.

00:36:48.934 --> 00:36:50.210
I think the community's
not doing enough

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.970
to understand what's happening
at the law enforcement level.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.540
But i think what
it boils down to is

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.530
that there's a
lack of opportunity

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.780
in a lot of these neighborhoods.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:06.136
And with desperation, sometimes,
comes civil disobedience.

00:37:06.136 --> 00:37:08.270
And for somebody who
doesn't have an option

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:14.330
to be heard, sometimes that
violence speaks the loudest.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:18.302
Not to say that it's right, and
I certainly don't support it,

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:19.984
but I understand it.

00:37:19.984 --> 00:37:22.480
And I think we have
a lot of work to do.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.970
For me, one thing that
changed me was empathy.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:29.229
I owned a record store in '95
when got out of the movement.

00:37:29.229 --> 00:37:31.187
I had started the record
store because I wanted

00:37:31.187 --> 00:37:32.558
to sell white power music.

00:37:32.558 --> 00:37:34.843
I was doing it out
of my backpack.

00:37:34.843 --> 00:37:38.074
And between getting laid
off from a construction job,

00:37:38.074 --> 00:37:40.800
I wanted to be an
entrepreneur, like my parents.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.571
So I went into the
business wanting

00:37:43.571 --> 00:37:45.071
to be fair to
everybody who came in.

00:37:45.071 --> 00:37:46.737
I wasn't just selling
white power music.

00:37:46.737 --> 00:37:48.990
I was selling ska, and
rockabilly, and punk.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.611
And I told myself I was
going to bite my tongue

00:37:51.611 --> 00:37:53.402
and serve everybody
fairly because I wanted

00:37:53.402 --> 00:37:56.301
to be a good businessman while
I was still selling white power

00:37:56.301 --> 00:37:59.490
music from behind the counter.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.600
One thing that
happened to me was

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.230
that people who I had
secluded myself from,

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:10.390
minorities and people
of other religions,

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.376
they started to
come into the store,

00:38:12.376 --> 00:38:14.204
and they started to poke at me.

00:38:14.204 --> 00:38:15.620
The knew I was
selling this music,

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.436
and they started to
ask questions about it.

00:38:18.436 --> 00:38:20.840
And because we were
bonding over music,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.920
I started to become
friends with these people

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.267
for the first time.

00:38:25.267 --> 00:38:27.475
And I started to understand
through our conversations

00:38:27.475 --> 00:38:29.609
was that the one thing
that we had in common

00:38:29.609 --> 00:38:33.710
was that I felt the same pain
as the Jewish person did, that I

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:36.910
loved my wife and
my kids the same way

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:40.230
that the same sex
couple loved each other.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:43.300
And I couldn't justify what
I was believing anymore.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:47.544
I couldn't reconcile my hate
with this new-found love

00:38:47.544 --> 00:38:49.210
and empathy that I
was starting to feel.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:53.740
It wasn't until I had
started to humanize people

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.720
with empathy that it
started to break my shell.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.799
So I think that empathy is
something that's lacking.

00:39:01.799 --> 00:39:03.590
We were just in New
York this past weekend.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.470
And we went to the 9/11
Memorial, which is incredible.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.270
And it dawned on me that
the last time out country

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.095
was really united, and
that all races got along

00:39:13.095 --> 00:39:15.560
with each other,
and all religions--

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.712
it didn't matter what religion
you were on September 11th.

00:39:18.712 --> 00:39:21.614
And it's a real
tragedy to me to think

00:39:21.614 --> 00:39:23.530
that the only time that
we can love each other

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.750
is when something
tragic happens.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.370
And we had empathy
for each other.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:31.536
And we put ourselves
in each other's shoes.

00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:33.661
And we felt each other's
pain, and we came together

00:39:33.661 --> 00:39:34.464
as a country.

00:39:34.464 --> 00:39:38.368
And I think that that
empathy, if we can find a way

00:39:38.368 --> 00:39:40.076
to get that back
in our daily lives,

00:39:40.076 --> 00:39:42.130
without the tragedy
happening, we

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.190
can finally begin to
understand and not

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.570
be afraid of people that
are different than us,

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:51.394
and find a way to come together,
and hopefully make life better

00:39:51.394 --> 00:39:53.784
for everybody.

00:39:53.784 --> 00:39:55.696
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
I'm all [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:55.696 --> 00:39:58.995
Does anyone have any questions?

00:39:58.995 --> 00:39:59.870
Please go to the mic.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.245
We're doing some
recording today.

00:40:03.425 --> 00:40:03.925
Thank you.

00:40:03.925 --> 00:40:05.925
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: And
all the hands go down.

00:40:08.705 --> 00:40:09.477
AUDIENCE: So how--

00:40:09.477 --> 00:40:10.685
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Is it on?

00:40:10.685 --> 00:40:11.185
It's not on.

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:18.110
AUDIENCE: I don't know
how to turn it on.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:21.080
That button right there?

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.610
That button right there.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:29.060
So how easy was it for
you to leave the movement?

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.150
It doesn't feel like it's
a membership you just

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.560
stop paying on, right?

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.950
It couldn't have been just one
day I'm out and I walk away.

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.745
Can you talk a little bit
about what that experience was?

00:40:42.745 --> 00:40:44.120
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Absolutely.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.644
And it's something
that I've shared

00:40:45.644 --> 00:40:47.620
with other people who've left.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.620
It's not an easy
process to leave.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.120
One thing, throughout my
seven years of being involved,

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.656
I always had these moments
of clarity, I call them.

00:40:57.656 --> 00:40:59.648
And they always happened
at really bad times

00:40:59.648 --> 00:41:01.640
when I was involved in a fight.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.130
And I would see somebody's
eyes open up the moment

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.085
before they passed out.

00:41:06.085 --> 00:41:08.560
And it connected me to
them for just a moment.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.780
And then I would squash it away.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.760
But for seven years, I always
had these moments of clarity.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.734
And I credit my life before
that, my parents and my family

00:41:16.734 --> 00:41:18.622
not raising me that way.

00:41:18.622 --> 00:41:22.170
But it was a really
hard process to leave.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.200
And here's why.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.640
So for seven years, I'd built
my whole social structure

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.660
within this movement.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.252
All my friends were people
who were in the movement.

00:41:31.252 --> 00:41:32.710
I didn't associate
with anybody who

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.160
wasn't a part of the movement.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.305
So when I decided to leave, I
pulled the white power music

00:41:37.305 --> 00:41:38.180
from my record store.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.160
And because it was 75% of my
sales, the business tanked.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.780
So I lost my job and
I closed the store.

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.100
My wife at the time
and my children,

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.890
who were just three and one,
left me because I was a part

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.470
of the movement
and they weren't.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.595
I had always kind of been
that buffer between them.

00:41:53.595 --> 00:41:56.310
I had alienated myself from
my parents and my family,

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.580
so I didn't really have
a relationship with them.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.610
And I lost my whole
social structure.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:02.935
Every friend that I
had during every one

00:42:02.935 --> 00:42:06.220
of my formative
years, from 14 to 22,

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.320
was a part of this movement.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.190
So I think it was
hard because I was

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:14.420
faced with losing everything.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.184
It wasn't one thing
that got me out.

00:42:17.184 --> 00:42:18.275
It was series of events.

00:42:18.275 --> 00:42:22.220
It was my kids being
born, and their innocence,

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.521
and me not being able
reconcile my life with the love

00:42:24.521 --> 00:42:25.354
that I had for them.

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:32.790
But it took me awhile to
pull the trigger and leave.

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:35.752
And closing the store,
getting divorced,

00:42:35.752 --> 00:42:38.850
retreating into my
depression all helped me.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.860
I was a leader of this group,
but I was selfish leader,

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.449
meaning that I didn't really
have an heir-apparent that I

00:42:44.449 --> 00:42:45.980
had been grooming.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.448
So when I left, when I
decided I'm out, I'm done,

00:42:49.448 --> 00:42:52.352
the group kind of
imploded, luckily for me.

00:42:52.352 --> 00:42:54.397
Because had it not
imploded, I don't know

00:42:54.397 --> 00:42:57.100
that I'd be here right now.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:02.734
So it's a tough process, but
I was surrounded by love,

00:43:02.734 --> 00:43:03.900
even after, from my parents.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.319
That helped me out.

00:43:05.319 --> 00:43:07.684
That was major.

00:43:07.684 --> 00:43:09.207
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for being here.

00:43:09.207 --> 00:43:10.540
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Thank you.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.880
AUDIENCE: So we can you
talk a little bit about what

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.550
this movement did to your
relationship with your family

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:20.180
as you went through it,
and then how it has changed

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.825
or how you think about
it with your relationship

00:43:22.825 --> 00:43:24.476
now with your kids and Britton?

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.090
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: My
relationship with my parents

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:33.120
was really strained, obviously,
for those seven years.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.348
Because they spent every moment
trying to get me out, bail me

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:39.555
out of jail, talk
me out of whatever

00:43:39.555 --> 00:43:41.430
I was going to do that
day that maybe was not

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.390
going to be good for me.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:48.480
So it put a lot of
pressure on them.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.943
But it also helped me have
a really great relationship

00:43:51.943 --> 00:43:53.148
with them now.

00:43:53.148 --> 00:43:57.490
They're still annoying
parents but in a good way.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:01.210
So I was able to rebuild
that relationship with them.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:02.700
My kids saved my life.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.412
If it hadn't been for my kids
being born when they did,

00:44:06.412 --> 00:44:09.710
when I was 19 to 21 I don't
know that I would have changed.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.926
Or it may have
taken a lot longer.

00:44:12.926 --> 00:44:15.190
And as matter of fact, my
kids were the first people

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:20.156
to read my book when I finished
my first draft seven years ago.

00:44:20.156 --> 00:44:22.560
And it was important for
me to share it with them.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.880
I had talked to them about
what I'd been through,

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.420
but it was important for me
to get their feedback on it

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.261
because I wanted them
to see who I had been

00:44:30.261 --> 00:44:33.950
and how I'd changed in
a more positive way.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:38.390
I'm also really lucky,
knock on fake wood,

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:44.072
that my kids are nowhere
near as bad as I was.

00:44:44.072 --> 00:44:46.320
They're really good kids.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.630
When I'd met Britton, we'd
both been working for IBM

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.210
at the time.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:52.980
I think it was 2001?

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.480
Maybe?

00:44:55.835 --> 00:44:57.210
And she'd been
working in Dallas.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.000
I was here in Chicago,
and I was part

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.079
of a team that was feeding
sales opportunities

00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:04.120
to the inside sales team,
and Britton was working

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.520
for inside sales at IBM.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.480
And we'd started
dating long distance.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.723
And the first thing
that she did--

00:45:12.723 --> 00:45:14.347
and I don't want to
say she googled it,

00:45:14.347 --> 00:45:16.430
because I don't even think
that Google was around.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:17.440
She Altavistaed it.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.274
She found me online.

00:45:18.274 --> 00:45:19.856
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
Google was around.

00:45:19.856 --> 00:45:21.660
I'm pretty sure it was Google.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.710
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Were you using Google?

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:23.710
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Yeah.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:24.690
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
She googled my name

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:26.290
and found something
that I'd written

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.170
that had shown up online.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:31.370
And before we started
getting serious,

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:32.760
she confronted me with it.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.928
And I'm glad she did
because that was really

00:45:34.928 --> 00:45:36.792
one of the first
opportunities that I

00:45:36.792 --> 00:45:39.870
had to talk publicly to
another person about what

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.670
I'd been through.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.124
And it started this
ball rolling of me

00:45:44.124 --> 00:45:45.597
talking more publicly about it.

00:45:47.394 --> 00:45:48.810
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
I didn't think

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.830
it was as serious as it was.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:53.180
When I found it, it
was just a little piece

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.873
on a bulletin board.

00:45:55.873 --> 00:45:58.754
And it sounded kind of militant,
but I was just like, oh,

00:45:58.754 --> 00:45:59.254
whatever.

00:45:59.254 --> 00:46:01.452
I was so white bread.

00:46:01.452 --> 00:46:03.118
And so I just instant
messaged him like,

00:46:03.118 --> 00:46:04.909
hey, are you as militant
as you used to be?

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.230
And just very flippant.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:12.750
And he said, why?

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:15.450
And I said, oh, I just
saw this thing online.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:17.800
And he's like, what?

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.490
And wanted me to
send him the link.

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.770
I think Christian was
incredibly fortunate

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.110
that he was involved
in the movement

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.380
before the digital age.

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:33.350
Because there really isn't
a digital record of what

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.820
was going on at that time.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.695
Today would be insane.

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:40.070
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: It's a
lot less forgiving, I think,

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:40.470
with that record.

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:42.000
So the thing that
she had found online

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.005
was something I'd written years
before that had been archived

00:46:44.005 --> 00:46:45.380
and somebody had put it online.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.786
And I had been out of the
movement for seven years

00:46:48.786 --> 00:46:51.287
already at that point
when she found it.

00:46:51.287 --> 00:46:52.870
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
And I grilled him.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:54.578
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
But she grilled me.

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:57.870
And I'm glad she did, because it
started the ball rolling on me

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.670
talking about it publicly.

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:03.574
And then we met and here we are.

00:47:03.574 --> 00:47:05.026
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Yes.

00:47:05.026 --> 00:47:09.527
I got a husband and a job
out of the whole deal.

00:47:09.527 --> 00:47:11.610
AUDIENCE: Hi, I also want
to say thanks for coming

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.145
and thanks for making
your story public.

00:47:13.145 --> 00:47:15.228
I think it's really important
to get it out there.

00:47:15.228 --> 00:47:15.930
I was wondering.

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:18.844
I forgot what the name of the
leader, the one who pulled up

00:47:18.844 --> 00:47:20.885
in the car in the alley,
what his name was, but i

00:47:20.885 --> 00:47:22.570
was wondering what
his trajectory was.

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.748
And post-movement, did you ever
cross paths with him again?

00:47:25.748 --> 00:47:26.960
What happened to him?

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.160
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
So what allowed

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.880
me to step into a leadership
role when I was 16 years ago

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.650
was that this
individual had gone

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:39.271
to prison for some violence that
he had committed in Chicago.

00:47:42.428 --> 00:47:45.659
And he and a bunch of the
skinheads, they were all older,

00:47:45.659 --> 00:47:47.034
and had gotten
into some trouble,

00:47:47.034 --> 00:47:47.992
and had gone to prison.

00:47:47.992 --> 00:47:51.480
And I was suddenly left
with this void where

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.430
I was one of the only people
left, me and the younger kids

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:55.730
who I had recruited.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:59.450
So they had started to
look at me as the leader.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:04.430
Clark had gone to
prison for seven years,

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:06.870
had some mental issues.

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:09.040
He and I had been
writing to each other,

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.728
and I recognized
pretty quickly that he

00:48:10.728 --> 00:48:12.560
had some mental problems.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.235
He's a brilliant guy, kind of
along the lines of a Charles

00:48:16.235 --> 00:48:19.800
Manson-- very
charismatic, super smart

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.160
but in a very twisted way.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:27.762
And I saw him one more time
in 1996 or '97 after he'd

00:48:27.762 --> 00:48:28.990
gotten out of prison.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.085
He had shown up
at one of the punk

00:48:31.085 --> 00:48:33.168
rock shows that I had with
this non-political band

00:48:33.168 --> 00:48:34.906
that I was playing in.

00:48:34.906 --> 00:48:37.430
And I haven't seen him since.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:38.850
I don't know where he is.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:39.600
I've heard rumors.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.240
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
Not for lack of tyring.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:41.980
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Yeah, I've tried.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.940
I mean, researching,
fact checking just

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.334
for myself and my book.

00:48:46.334 --> 00:48:47.250
I can't find anything.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:51.295
I mean, part of it is because
he existed before the internet.

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:52.420
But I can't-- I don't know.

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.461
I think he's still alive.

00:48:53.461 --> 00:48:55.070
I think he's still in Chicago.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:59.067
I hope he's not damaging
anybody anymore.

00:48:59.067 --> 00:49:02.049
I suspect he is,
but I don't know.

00:49:02.049 --> 00:49:03.043
Yes?

00:49:03.043 --> 00:49:06.490
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have
two questions, actually.

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.910
Number one, I'm just
curious if you're

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.360
familiar with the film
"American History X"

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.880
and if you had any perspective
on how realistic that was.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.620
Obviously, it was
Hollywood, but I just

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.150
would love to get your
perspective on it.

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:22.979
Number two, just a
personal question,

00:49:22.979 --> 00:49:25.270
how would I recognize one of
these people on the street

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.353
if they're not a skinhead?

00:49:26.353 --> 00:49:27.230
Just curious.

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.105
Also what neighborhoods
they may hang out in.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.890
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: I'll
start with your second question.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:37.040
I don't know how you
will recognize them

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.130
because they do a really
good job of blending in.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.700
A lot of folks went to
more mainstream, far

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.202
right organizations
like the Tea Party.

00:49:45.202 --> 00:49:46.618
Not that all tea
partiers are bad,

00:49:46.618 --> 00:49:47.980
if there's anybody in the room.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.820
But it's hard.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.195
It's really hard
spot them, which

00:49:53.195 --> 00:49:55.153
is why we do a lot of
work with law enforcement

00:49:55.153 --> 00:49:57.518
to help them understand the
mindset and the buzzwords

00:49:57.518 --> 00:50:00.410
that they use.

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:05.820
I think it's a lot less active
in Chicago than it used to be,

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.575
but I don't know that for sure.

00:50:08.575 --> 00:50:10.200
Your first question,
what was the film?

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.160
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
"American History X."

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.910
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
"American History X,

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:16.522
so "American History X" was
based on several people.

00:50:16.522 --> 00:50:17.980
It's a composite
of several people.

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.460
I tend to believe
that it's partly

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.920
based on me and some
folks that I know.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.274
Though I can't confirm that,
when you read the book,

00:50:29.274 --> 00:50:31.315
you'll find that there
are a lot of similarities.

00:50:33.691 --> 00:50:35.774
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
[INAUDIBLE] in Life After Hate

00:50:35.774 --> 00:50:38.700
with you is another person.

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.888
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Yeah,
some people that I know,

00:50:40.888 --> 00:50:42.262
it could have been
based on them.

00:50:42.262 --> 00:50:44.510
I don't know.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.712
As to how realistic it is,
it was pretty realistic.

00:50:47.712 --> 00:50:50.580
I'd have to say that, for
a Hollywood production,

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.500
it was pretty accurate.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.820
There's a lot of violence.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.150
Music plays a central part
like it did in the movie.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:00.233
There's always that
charismatic older person

00:51:00.233 --> 00:51:04.560
who is recruiting and
holding these meetings.

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:07.206
They're messed up people
that drink a lot, and do

00:51:07.206 --> 00:51:09.477
a lot of drugs, and cause a
lot of violence, sometimes

00:51:09.477 --> 00:51:10.060
to each other.

00:51:15.774 --> 00:51:17.690
AUDIENCE: Sorry, can I
ask one other question?

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.020
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Absolutely.

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.700
AUDIENCE: Could you
tell us, Christian,

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:23.660
what is a day in a
life of a skinhead.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.530
What does it look like?

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:26.892
What are they thinking?

00:51:26.892 --> 00:51:27.725
What are they doing?

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:35.020
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
For me, you wake up,

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:39.930
you're probably unemployed or
working a pretty menial job.

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:45.840
There is a working class
ethic, although they rarely

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.960
stick to it.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.680
They kind of pride themselves
on this middle class,

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.088
working class ethic.

00:51:52.088 --> 00:51:55.440
But they drink a lot.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.834
They do drugs, even
though they proclaim

00:51:59.834 --> 00:52:01.500
that they don't because
they're supposed

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:05.393
to be these supreme beings.

00:52:05.393 --> 00:52:06.970
But it's a lot of violence.

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.659
I mean, you're constantly
fighting with somebody

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:10.575
or watching your back.

00:52:10.575 --> 00:52:13.807
Because all you do is you're
trying to recruit people.

00:52:13.807 --> 00:52:14.890
You're preaching violence.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:16.180
And they spin it.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.890
So one thing that skinheads
are really good at,

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:21.480
or just racists in
general, is they

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.070
say it's about white pride.

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:24.445
We're just proud of who we are.

00:52:24.445 --> 00:52:26.380
And when people
attack who we are,

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:27.672
that's when we get violent.

00:52:27.672 --> 00:52:29.560
Well, it's bullshit.

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.310
Because behind the
scenes and internally,

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:32.710
it really is about supremacy.

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:33.695
It is about power.

00:52:33.695 --> 00:52:39.320
It really is about
marginalizing and alienating

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.240
other people that
aren't like you.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.390
So while they have
this outward marketing

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:47.655
face where it's all European
heritage, and pride, and--

00:52:47.655 --> 00:52:48.780
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Purity.

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:50.250
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: It's not.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:55.506
It really is about violence,
about hate, and prejudice.

00:52:55.506 --> 00:52:58.290
And it's a pretty bad lifestyle.

00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:00.750
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: What I
found the most interesting

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:05.300
is that it was just a lot of
marketing genius at the time.

00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:08.033
There was just tons
and tons of promotion.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:16.176
AUDIENCE: I just also
wanted to say thank you

00:53:16.176 --> 00:53:17.802
for bringing out the story.

00:53:17.802 --> 00:53:20.350
I think it's important
for other kids who might

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:21.520
consider this as an option.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.978
They know there's
a story out there

00:53:22.978 --> 00:53:25.311
that's a counter-story, a
counter-narrative to what they

00:53:25.311 --> 00:53:26.920
hear.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.933
I mean, it makes my
heart race hearing all

00:53:29.933 --> 00:53:32.460
of this-- just confrontations.

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:36.352
And when this topic comes
up, its just so dangerous.

00:53:36.352 --> 00:53:37.727
And you're always
thinking you've

00:53:37.727 --> 00:53:39.356
got to watch your back
or somebody's going

00:53:39.356 --> 00:53:40.272
to confront something.

00:53:40.272 --> 00:53:42.675
Even here sitting here talking
with someone as friendly

00:53:42.675 --> 00:53:44.200
as you.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.727
So I can only
imagine how much it

00:53:45.727 --> 00:53:48.940
is for you to have to face
all this and this history.

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.770
So thank you very
much for sharing that.

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:53.500
I guess my question makes sense.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:57.026
Something that you said
about taking responsibility

00:53:57.026 --> 00:54:01.820
or scapegoating, even
just last week there's

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:05.946
somebody or some group posting
signs along the Lake Shore bike

00:54:05.946 --> 00:54:08.340
trail with caricatures
of homeless people

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.585
and usual with
blackface kind of stuff.

00:54:11.585 --> 00:54:13.879
Etcetera, right?

00:54:13.879 --> 00:54:15.420
But the message
they're sending isn't

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.120
too different than from
what we tend to hear just

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:22.170
in normal mainstream talk-- just
stereotypes where we scapegoat.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.391
Homeless people don't
want to get a job,

00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:28.320
or women don't want to do
something smart and scientific,

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.196
or whatever?

00:54:29.196 --> 00:54:31.390
Jews are controlling the
media and everything else

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:33.900
like you said.

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.430
Or Latinos are just gangbangers.

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.380
So I just wonder how
much the stereotypes that

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:42.750
permeate in mainstream
society envelope or provide

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:47.363
cover for what you said the
skinheads do, which is blend in

00:54:47.363 --> 00:54:49.210
and operate that way.

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:51.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, any
time that would happen,

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:55.144
that was a spark where
we threw gasoline on it.

00:54:55.144 --> 00:54:56.310
And that's how we recruited.

00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:59.574
So anytime we would hear
somebody say something pretty

00:54:59.574 --> 00:55:01.740
normal, like what you're
talking about-- not normal,

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:05.705
but that's pervasive in society
today-- we would cozy up

00:55:05.705 --> 00:55:06.705
to them and say, ah-hah.

00:55:06.705 --> 00:55:07.980
Yes, you're right.

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:10.420
And start to put the
gasoline on that fire

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.505
and eventually recruit
them in over time.

00:55:13.505 --> 00:55:16.280
And unfortunately,
those stereotypes

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:21.154
are flourishing in the
movement and in society.

00:55:21.154 --> 00:55:24.410
And as we all know, most
times it's not true.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:29.140
So we got to be very,
very good at using

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.055
those stereotypes
to recruit people

00:55:31.055 --> 00:55:32.096
and pull them in further.

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:37.183
And all we can do
is be ourselves

00:55:37.183 --> 00:55:39.057
and prove that those
stereotypes don't exist.

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:45.284
AUDIENCE: Hi, is this on?

00:55:45.284 --> 00:55:47.690
I always want to say
thank you for coming.

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:51.140
It's such an engrossing story.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:56.990
I'm from New York, and I've seen
a lot of local politics going

00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.975
very right wing.

00:55:57.975 --> 00:55:59.520
And it's very frightening.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.080
And they ride on a ticket
of nationalism, immigration,

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:07.960
jobs-- that kind of thing.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:13.138
So do you see that
populist movement, A,

00:56:13.138 --> 00:56:14.096
growing-- I don't know.

00:56:14.096 --> 00:56:16.269
I'm not too familiar
with American politics--

00:56:16.269 --> 00:56:20.181
on a local level,
but also do you see

00:56:20.181 --> 00:56:23.239
the membership of these
skinhead gangs growing?

00:56:23.239 --> 00:56:24.530
Or is this declining right now?

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:25.739
What do you think?

00:56:25.739 --> 00:56:27.280
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Well, I can you

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:31.863
tell that when President
Obama was elected that law

00:56:31.863 --> 00:56:33.321
enforcement and
groups like the ADL

00:56:33.321 --> 00:56:36.092
and the Southern Poverty Law
Center saw massive spikes

00:56:36.092 --> 00:56:37.300
in enrollment in hate groups.

00:56:41.159 --> 00:56:42.450
I do think it's happening here.

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:47.020
I think that our politics are
such that it's always divided.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:50.480
There's always two opposing
sides to everything

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.420
and never a whole lot of
meeting in the middle.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.120
And I have experienced
what you're

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.510
talking about in
Europe where they

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:00.910
play on nationalist tendencies.

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:04.446
And it works, unfortunately.

00:57:04.446 --> 00:57:06.070
And I think it's
starting to work here.

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:10.530
I think we're seeing
a lot of homegrown,

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.690
far right nationalist
movements, Sovereign Citizen

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:20.886
groups, militia groups,
extreme constitutionalists.

00:57:20.886 --> 00:57:24.830
They're doing some of the
same things in this country.

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:27.295
And the environment
is ripe for that now.

00:57:27.295 --> 00:57:29.267
At least it has been
over the last decade

00:57:29.267 --> 00:57:32.321
where unemployment
maybe has been higher.

00:57:32.321 --> 00:57:35.325
And certainly when
there's an instance

00:57:35.325 --> 00:57:38.300
of any kind of
foreign terrorism,

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:39.980
you can bet that
far right groups

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:42.020
are going to jump
on that and use

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.756
that to incite other people.

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:51.590
AUDIENCE: Here in our country,
I feel like a lot of our laws

00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:53.500
protect white
supremacy in regards

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.820
to assembly and
free speech, whereas

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.265
in our European
counterparts, a lot of that

00:57:59.265 --> 00:58:04.670
is actually illegal to assemble
or to have hate speech.

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:08.710
What are your thoughts on how
our country protects, loosely,

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:10.040
the ability to do that?

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.920
And do you think laws
should be changed?

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:19.830
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: I
believe in free speech.

00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:25.300
And I think while our country
may protect hate speech

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.490
and assembly by hate
groups, in theory,

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:30.717
it also protects
everybody else and allows

00:58:30.717 --> 00:58:32.640
them to have those freedoms.

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.080
I know in countries
like Germany,

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:39.165
the use of the swastika or
even saluting is illegal.

00:58:39.165 --> 00:58:40.534
You can go to jail for that.

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:47.658
I don't know that the government
or law enforcement making

00:58:47.658 --> 00:58:49.610
rules for us not to
say things or do things

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:51.074
is the right answer.

00:58:51.074 --> 00:58:53.838
I think we as people just need
to do a better job of treating

00:58:53.838 --> 00:58:55.870
other people with respect
and as human beings

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:58.680
to eliminate that
problem and still keep

00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:01.380
the freedoms that we have.

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.370
That's a tough question.

00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:05.250
Would I love to silence them?

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.310
Absolutely.

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:09.070
Do I think it's the
right thing to do?

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:12.006
I'm not so sure.

00:59:12.006 --> 00:59:13.255
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: All right.

00:59:13.255 --> 00:59:14.647
Lynne's the last question.

00:59:14.647 --> 00:59:15.230
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:16.077
Hi, Christian.

00:59:16.077 --> 00:59:17.118
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Hi.

00:59:17.118 --> 00:59:19.707
AUDIENCE: I find it
fascinating that I

00:59:19.707 --> 00:59:23.110
know that your boys are in their
early teens if not early 20s,

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:25.440
and seven years ago would
put them right at that ripe

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.710
age of influence.

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:31.535
And I don't know if that
was by choice that you

00:59:31.535 --> 00:59:34.570
put this narrative
in their hands,

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.995
but I'm wondering what
kind of active dialogue

00:59:36.995 --> 00:59:40.080
that you have with them?

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:43.100
And I'm sure there are parents
and folks in this room who

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:44.805
speak on a regular
basis about beliefs,

00:59:44.805 --> 00:59:48.370
and I think active
dialogue is so important.

00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:50.400
So I want to know what
you think and what

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.066
you have and your behaviors with
them and the people around you.

00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:59.010
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
It was a decision

00:59:59.010 --> 01:00:01.720
to start writing the book at
that because of their age.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.031
It also kind of wasn't.

01:00:04.031 --> 01:00:06.280
But I think an active dialogue,
exactly what you said,

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.415
is important.

01:00:07.415 --> 01:00:09.060
Just talk to your--
more Importantly

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.700
than talking your kids,
listen to your kids.

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:17.490
Because while I'm not that
far in age from my kids--

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:20.434
I'm 41 and my kids
are 22 and 20,

01:00:20.434 --> 01:00:22.850
and I'd like to think that I
still remember what it's like

01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:24.711
to be that age, I don't.

01:00:24.711 --> 01:00:26.612
I don't remember.

01:00:26.612 --> 01:00:27.820
And they're going through it.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.419
So listen to them.

01:00:29.419 --> 01:00:30.710
Because they'll tell you clues.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.570
If there's something
lacking in their life,

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:33.695
they'll give you the clues.

01:00:33.695 --> 01:00:36.970
If there's something going
wrong, if you're looking,

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:38.960
you can spot it.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.530
So when the kids
were old enough,

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:42.853
I told then about my past.

01:00:42.853 --> 01:00:45.060
I told them what
I'd gone through.

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.710
But I didn't dwell
on that too much

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:52.515
as I did on focusing on the
counter-narrative of treat

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:56.315
people with respect if
you want respect back.

01:00:56.315 --> 01:01:00.672
Treat people fairly if you
want to live a fair life.

01:01:00.672 --> 01:01:02.380
And no matter what
you're going through,

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.040
somebody else is always
going through something worse

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:04.830
than you.

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:09.380
So just be kind and put
yourself in people's shoes

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.515
before and after you do
anything to understand what

01:01:12.515 --> 01:01:15.019
it might make them feel like.

01:01:15.019 --> 01:01:17.310
So that was always a constant
conversation that we had.

01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:18.787
And they're teenagers,
so of course

01:01:18.787 --> 01:01:22.372
they goof up and do things
that they're not supposed to.

01:01:22.372 --> 01:01:27.550
But luckily, between Britton
and me and their mom,

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:31.236
I think we've done an OK job.

01:01:31.236 --> 01:01:33.200
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
Nobody was in jail.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.673
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Not
like I was [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:34.673 --> 01:01:35.164
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Right.

01:01:35.164 --> 01:01:35.655
This is good.

01:01:35.655 --> 01:01:37.363
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
And for the record,

01:01:37.363 --> 01:01:39.760
I only went to prison just
overnight, local jail.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.699
Fights, [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:40.699 --> 01:01:42.740
BRITTON PICCIOLINI: Thanks,
everyone, for coming.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.910
So "Romantic Violence" is
actually out officially today.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:48.780
So hopefully all
of youi got a copy.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.318
Please recommend it
to anyone that you

01:01:51.318 --> 01:01:53.390
think might be
interested in the story.

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:56.722

Picciolini for joining us.

01:01:56.722 --> 01:01:59.102
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:04.720
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Thank you for joining too.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.282
If anybody didn't get a copy,
I brought a copy from home.

01:02:07.282 --> 01:02:09.657

01:02:09.657 --> 01:02:10.406
to take this copy.

01:02:10.406 --> 01:02:11.280

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.040
I appreciate it.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:12.460
BRITTON PICCIOLINI:
Thanks, everyone.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.010
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Thank you.
