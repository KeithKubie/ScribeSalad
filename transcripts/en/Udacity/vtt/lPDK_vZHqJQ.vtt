00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.691
This is the correct equation. If you got it, excellent work. If I don't drive

00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:09.744
the car anywhere or drive it for zero hours, I still have to pay $5. That's my

00:00:09.744 --> 00:00:14.387
registration fee. For driving it one hour, I pay ten more dollars. So I have to

00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:19.767
add ten to five, to get 15. Two hours would $25 and three hours would cost $35,

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:25.056
and so on. So when x is zero, we get a y value of 5. That makes sense for this

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:30.479
equation. When x is 1, we get a y value of 15. That also makes sense. This 5 is

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:36.103
the fixed or constant part of renting the car. Anyone would have to pay this.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:41.527
The variable part of renting the car is the 10 times x, since you spend $10 for

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:46.880
each hour that you drive the car. We know the cost of the car depends on the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.293
number of hours, x.
