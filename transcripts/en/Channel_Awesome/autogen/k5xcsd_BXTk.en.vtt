like read and Stimpy or something where

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120

you know you could go over the top like
 

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.160
you know you could go over the top like
that but I that's probably my only

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:02.170
that but I that's probably my only
 

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.870

00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199
the most part it looked you know I think
 

00:14:08.199 --> 00:14:09.630
the most part it looked you know I think
honestly I think it could have used an

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:09.640
honestly I think it could have used an
 

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.590
honestly I think it could have used an
even bigger budget um I honestly for

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600
even bigger budget um I honestly for
 

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.840
even bigger budget um I honestly for
what we got I thought looked really good

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:15.850
what we got I thought looked really good
 

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.400
what we got I thought looked really good
like those city doesn't let everything

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.470
it looked good I mean maybe this is
because we're looking at this now with

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480
because we're looking at this now with
 

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.750
because we're looking at this now with
hindsight being 20/20 and we've got all

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:24.760
hindsight being 20/20 and we've got all
 

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.319
hindsight being 20/20 and we've got all
the films out now um but I bet some of

the films out now um but I bet some of
 

00:14:28.329 --> 00:14:30.000
the films out now um but I bet some of
the animators I just feel like it's like

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.010
the animators I just feel like it's like
 

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.710
the animators I just feel like it's like
if that's what they could do with what

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720
if that's what they could do with what
 

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.870
if that's what they could do with what
they were given I'm like add 20 more

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880
they were given I'm like add 20 more
 

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.310

minutes of animation cut the live-action

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320
minutes of animation cut the live-action
 

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.079
minutes of animation cut the live-action
stuff and give them a bigger budget I

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:37.089

looking yeah like I I just I think it's

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600
looking yeah like I I just I think it's
 

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.420
looking yeah like I I just I think it's
pretty good-looking honestly if there

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:42.430
pretty good-looking honestly if there
 

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.980
pretty good-looking honestly if there
was a movie that I would like to see

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:43.990
was a movie that I would like to see
 

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.040

if you do like a either 2d or I could
 

00:14:50.199 --> 00:14:51.540
if you do like a either 2d or I could
see this easily as a CGI film

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:51.550
see this easily as a CGI film
 

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.970
see this easily as a CGI film
considering all like yeah the parts of

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:53.980
