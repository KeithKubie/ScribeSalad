00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.200
Writing completely revolutionized humanity
in almost every way.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:17.610
We can tweet, write scripts, and … well
that's really it, right?

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.359
Language makes it so everything we do, works,
right?

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.590
Without language, I couldn't talk to you or
tell you to watch out for that predator!

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.369
To put it simply, language allows me to express
what's in here [head] out here.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.550
And that's hugely powerful, it's life-changing.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.100
It's WORLD changing.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.500
According to modern archeology, there may
have been proto-language as far back as homo

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.649
erectus and homo habilis more than a million
years ago, but our first true verbal language

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.510
probably developed between 30,000 and 100,000
years ago.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.129
So if verbal language lets me tell someone
next to me what's inside my head, writing

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.740
lets me tell someone 500 miles away, or 500
years from now.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.260
Writing was a major world-changing invention.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.010
First with symbols, cave paintings and pictograms,
a new study from a Canadian researcher believes

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.190
this proto-written language may be 40,000
years old.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.550
The researcher looked at cave symbols across
Southern Europe and found symbols repeated,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.500
indicating to her there was likely some kind
of writing system in use.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.660
There were even memes, where some symbols
rose and fell in popularity, indicating an

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.170
overarching interest and culture.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.990
But what they meant is a mystery, because
there's no context.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.560
Most archaeologists believe the first true
writing was cuneiform.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.500
It was developed in ancient Sumer around 3000
BCE, as an evolution of tiny pictograms, it

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.920
eventually had enough contextual information
to closely mimic what people were actually

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.700
saying!

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.910
It was created by pressing a blunt reed into
a piece of clay allowing it to be preserved

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.610
for later perusal.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.790
Modern humans with their reading, writing,
and… well pretty much that's what they had

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.110
at the time -- were able to spread throughout
Europe and Africa.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.920
But language does more than facilitate expression,
storytelling and coordination…

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.910
When you write, your brain has to navigate
those fine motor movements; recall letters,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.340
words, shapes, and rules; not to mention simply
seeing what's on the paper, reading and comprehending

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.900
what you've written -- AND predicting what
you're going to write next.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.190
Functional MRI scans done on the brains of
writers during a study from the University

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.400
of Greifswald found brain activity similar
to that of a professional sports star.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.460
Using a custom-built writing desk, the researchers
allowed people to write creatively while assessing

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.790
their brain's blood flow, and found visual
and speech centers lit up during brainstorming,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.240
the hippocampus activated during factual recollection,
and the prefrontal cortex was active, possibly

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.150
to keep the storylines, characters and details
straight while committing it to paper.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.460
Our brains light up all OVER during the act
of writing; and over time, with practice,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.680
parts of the brain learn to automate some
of those processes.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.550
We don't have to practice making an A after
a while we just know how to do it automatically.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.690
Our BRAINS have been altered, for the better
-- one could argue -- by writing!

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.220
Communicating with each other completely changed
human history, allowing us to expand across

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.480
the globe and share our best ideas.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.210
According to Gallup polling, we read more
now than in the last 70 years (thanks internet!)!

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.430
And as emojis and gifs invade our written
communication, writing is still evolving…

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.672
A study in Emotional Neuroscience found our
brains process emoji's tiny little faces as

00:03:31.672 --> 00:03:32.672
actual faces.

00:03:32.672 --> 00:03:35.620
So, is the future of writing the past of writing?

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.820
Are we going back to pictograms?

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.930
Do you hand-write ANYTHING anymore?

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:53.209
I try to, but it's really tough for my pen
and paper to keep up with my brain…
