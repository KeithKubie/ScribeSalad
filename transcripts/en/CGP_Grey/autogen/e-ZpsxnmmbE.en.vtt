00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 "The mobile phone is a kind of extension of my body." 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.400
 Mobile phones know yourself better than yourself, in fact, they are exaggerated. 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.020
 a fact 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.880
 Do you remember that you have been to the sidelines every day? 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.120
 Do you remember that you had a single letter on February 29th with a score of 10:47 and Friend? 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.640
 Hey! If you are serious, you will remember that you have a generous holiday. 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.600
 Black and white writing, low human history, has been in the ancient Egyptian era 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.560
 Deaf people will Feel to hieroglyphics 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.100
 Your phone can count down millions of sheets of paper. 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.160
 To a certain extent, the same amount of generosity will become the same level of generosity. 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.620
 Since you bought the raft, there is a moment when you only hold your hand to the channel. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.860
 A great opportunity to blame you for your life. 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.240
 Hey, you pick: You want to read people, and let the people call you? 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.460
 If you are deeper, you should pick the former. 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.160
 Contrast back to your brain and the buried mobile phone to remember your brain, actually remembering it, and there is a mistake 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180
 It’s easy to remember that you have a lot of money on your phone. 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.500
 Because there are too many realities, you simply remember to dry 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.460
 When people are stunned, you think it’s safe. 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.300
 Actual facts 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.760
 When the mobile phone has become my body extension, I know that something is happening. 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.580
 Your brain will eventually become mandatory, just like a family phone. 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.820
 Do you want to escape? You will become... 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.340
 If I protect the most intimate electronic equipment (legal sample) 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.560
 My generous future will become a good horror 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.400
 Because the law is like a brick wall, the law will be overlaid on the previous law. 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.360
 So sometimes you will hear lawyers quote 300 years ago 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.380
 And because of the system of the shackles, 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.420
 So it’s awkward to start building bricks in a new place. 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.160
 Because of the bricks, the 唔 is the invincible brick wall 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.440
 Refuting "the regulation is only a case, it is time to use curry" as much as refuting the legal department. 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.760
 It’s like a chess game that tells you about it. "Because I want to take your army afterwards." 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.460
 All of them are talking about 唔通咖, all are 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.500
 300 years ago, someone wrote about the house business 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.000
 However, when the squadron is on the half of the population, the paper is the same as the luxury of the book. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
 After that, you can apply millions of intangible files to your mobile phone. 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.620
 Record every detail of your life 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.720
 Maybe you feel good. Or okay. But the points are good. "After the fight, the law will overwrite the previous legislation." 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.900
 One is to solve the problem, to pay attention to the legal precedent 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.740
 With the burial point, the landslide is misunderstood. 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.440
 Thinking about today’s generous law, that is, thinking about the future of the law and burying your mobile phone 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.500
 Inevitably thinking about your future
