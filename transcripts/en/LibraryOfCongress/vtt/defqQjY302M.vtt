00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.853
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.720
&gt;&gt; For those of you who are
here because you've been moved

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.386
by Jonathan Safran
Foer, the novelist.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.720
His first novel, <i>Everything
is an Illuminated</i>,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.520
came out in 2002 when
he was just 25.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.453
That was followed --

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.600
[ Applause ]

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.546
-- that was followed
three years later

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.113
by <i>Extremely Loud
and Incredibly Close,</i>

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.580
[ Applause ]

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.576
two remarkable works of
fiction before the age of 30.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.060
Marie Arana summed
up his achievement

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.433
in the <i>Washington Post</i> this way:
"Rarely does a writer as young

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.340
as Jonathan Foer display
such virtuosity and wisdom.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.570
His prose is clever,
challenging, willfully constructed

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.160
to make you read it again and again.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.043
And reading it," she added,
"you feel altered, chastened,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.790
seared in the fire
of something new."

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.570


00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.976
Jonathan is a D.C. native,
educated at Georgetown Day

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.126
and then Princeton, where the author
Joyce Carol Oates took an interest

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.480
in his work.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.346
That first novel, <i>Everything
is Illuminated</i>,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.610
was completed at Princeton but
then languished in a drawer

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.016
for a couple years,
rejected by five agents.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.090
When Jonathan finally pulled
it out and tried again,

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.026
the same manuscript thrilled
several publishers and went

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.726
on to earn ecstatic reviews.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.030
Now the world knows when Jonathan
Safran Foer strings some words

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.163
together, you'll want to read them.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.950
Please join me in welcoming
Jonathan Safran Foer.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.026
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Safran Foer: Hello.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960
Hello. Wow.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.626
So our time together
is very, very brief.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.063
We only have about 25 minutes or
so, so I want to make good use of it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.530
because I'm very excited to be here.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.526
I did grow up in Washington,
D.C. I was born here.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.133
I left only for my adult life, and,
then, only for reasons that are hard

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.336
to describe, but I'm
always happy to come back.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.890
I was anticipating a
very hot and humid day

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.623
and was really disappointed
by what I got,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.910
[ Laughter ]

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.710
which is only a hot day,
this is not a humid day.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.910
I remember humidity,
and this is not it.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.526
So I wrote two novels, and
then I wrote this very,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.213
very different book.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.680
And I think that when
people approach it --

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.080
and I've seen this happen
in bookstores before --

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.976
I've seen someone pull it off
the shelf, look at the title,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.393
and put it back on the shelf;
or take it from the self

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.543
and read the description and
put it back on the shelf.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.736
And, you know, that's
-- it's a shame not --

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.243
not only because I would like
for people to read my book,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.863
but because it speaks to a
discomfort we have with this subject

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.186
and ideas that we bring to
any conversation about it,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.286
which basically boiled down to
that this is divisive issue,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.543
or that it's an issue that will
inevitably lead to an argument,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.356
or to some people feeling
one thing strongly

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.256
and some people feeling something
quite different strongly,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.990
and those differences not
-- not being reconcilable.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.163
And what I found when I did
the research for this book

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.330
and when I wrote it and in the
year since it was published

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.793
and I've traveled across
the country --

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.586
not only to major cities on the
East Coast and on the West Coast,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.453
but to areas all over the
country -- to farming communities,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.146
to inner city public schools, to
quite a diverse group of readers --

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.340
I found that nobody disagrees.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.270
If I were to pose the question, "Is
it right or wrong to eat animals,"

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.836
I think most people in this room,
if this room reflected America,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.086
about 96 percent of the room would
say, "Yes, it's perfectly right."

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.173
But that's actually not the
important question to ask.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.963
The important question, which I
focus this book on, is it right

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.986
or wrong to raise animals in the
ways that we're raising them?

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.203
To have a farm system
like the one that we do

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.090
where animals are treated, as a
rule, in ways that would be illegal

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.473
if they were cats or dogs?

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.950
Is it right or wrong to have a farm
system that's the number one cause

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.890
of global warming, and not
just by a little, but by a lot?

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.146
It's responsible for more greenhouse
gas emissions than everything else

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.593
in the world put together.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.283
Is it right or wrong to have
a farm system that according

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.770
to the United Nations --

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.303
not according to the PETA
or the Humane Society,

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.636
but according to the
United Nations --

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.570
is one of the top two
or three causes

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.903
of every significant
environmental problem

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.503
on the planet locally and globally?

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.910
Is it right or wrong to have a farm
system that is making us less able

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.123
to use antibiotics when we fall
ill or when our children fall ill?

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.216
And the list goes on and on.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.416
And I've found that when
I ask that question --

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.400
the relevant question --
people are in agreement.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.966
It's very hard to find an
American who is indifferent

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.986
to the treatment of animals.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.520
Ninety-six percent
of Americans think

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.350
that there should be laws
protecting animals from cruelty.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.800
If you can think of
anything else that 96 percent

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.846
of Americans agree on,
I would love to hear it.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.213
And whether or not you believe
in global warming, whether

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.806
or not you think our environment is
in any peril, you certainly believe

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.256
that the quality of the air that
we breathe matters, and the quality

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.543
of the water that we drink matters.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.323
And so we're in this odd
position where we have a subject

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.096
which is clearly and definitively
our most important relationship

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.996
to the environment and our most
important to the animal world,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.720
and yet we haven't found a
good way to talk about it

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.406
that reflects these very American
values, these very human concerns.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.060
And so I tried with this book not
to simply present an argument,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.470
not to present journalism,
not to present philosophy

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.180
but to present a story that would
hopefully engage people who care,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.350
which is to say everybody, in
a way that allows them to care,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.780
that doesn't make them fear
hypocrisy or fear of wagging finger,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.776
but instead says, "Hey, there's this
enormous territory in front of us,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.793
an enormous number of choices,
and we can make choices

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.733
that better reflect our values."

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.666
The choice is not between
vegetarianism and being a carnivore.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.850
The choice might be between
eating meat 21 meals a week

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.540
and eating it 20 meals a week.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.310
If all Americans reduced their meat
consumption by one meal a week,

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.480
it would be the --
environmentally the equivalent

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.316
of taking five million
cars off the road.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.856
It's a very powerful statistic.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.413
And when someone says to me, you
know, I'm compelled by this story

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.240
that you're telling but I can't,
myself, become a vegetarian,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.730
I just love meat too much; or
it's too important to my family

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.523
or my culture or my religion,
I understand and respect

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.390
that person perfectly well.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.720
It took me 20 years to
become a vegetarian.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.970
But when someone says I can't
remove one serving of meat a week,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.770
that starts to sound
pathological, just weird.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.730
[ Laughter ]

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.530
So I think that's the place
to start, and that's the place

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.246
that my book starts, the idea that
we need to eat less of this stuff

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.106
because it's killing our planet,
it's doing horrific things

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.240
to animals, and it's also injuring
our own bodies in ways that we know

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.310
about and in many ways that
we don't yet know about.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.690
We've really made science
experiments

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.290
out of ourselves and our kids.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.163
And one only need read the <i>New
York Times</i> or <i>Washington Post</i>

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.946
or <i>U.S. Today</i> or whatever you
read, to find more and more reasons

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.303
to be concerned about this subject.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.623
So what I thought I would do is read
the first, little tiny bit book,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.376
a couple of pages, and then -- to
give you a sense of what I mean

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.056
when I say that it's a story --

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.990
and then we'll open this
up the remaining time

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.190
to what I wish we had much more
time for, which is conversation.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.316
"When I was young, I would
often spend the weekend

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.663
at my grandmother's house.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.113
On the way in, Friday night, she
would lift me from the ground in one

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.146
of her fire-smothering hugs.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.960
And on the way out,
Sunday afternoon,

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.096
I was again taken into the air.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.420
It wasn't until years later that
I realized she was weighing me.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.580
[ Laughter ]

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.246
My grandmother survived
the war barefoot,

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:57.556
scavenging other people's
inedibles --

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.146
rotting potatoes, discarded
scraps of meat, skins and the bits

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.166
that clung to bones and pits --

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.873
and so she never cared if I
colored outside the lines,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.853
as long as I cut coupons
along the dashes.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.463
In hotel buffets, while the
rest of us erected Golden Calves

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.526
of breakfast, she would make
sandwich upon sandwich to swaddle

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.453
in napkins and stash
in her bag for lunch.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.686
It was my grandmother who taught me
that one tea bag makes as many cups

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:24.440
of tea as you're serving [Laughter ]

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.306
-- you just had to be very, very
patient and not mind iced tea --

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.640
and that every part of
the apple is edible.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.040
Money was not the point.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.613
Many of those coupons I clipped were
for foods that she would never buy.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.866
And health wasn't the point.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.066
She would beg me to drink Coke.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.543
My grandmother never set a place
for herself at family dinners.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.810
Even when there was
nothing more to be done --

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.483
no soup bowls to be topped
off, no pots to be stirred,

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.183
or ovens checked -- she
stayed in the kitchen

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.530
like a vigilant guard,
or prisoner in a tower.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.233
As far as I could tell,
the sustenance that she got

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.760
from the food she made
didn't require her to eat it.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.866
In the forests of Europe,
she ate to stay alive

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.083
until the next opportunity
to eat to stay alive.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.823
In America, 50 years later,
we ate what pleased us.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.183
Our cupboards were filled
with food bought on whims --

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.303
overpriced foodie food,
food that we didn't need --

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.436
and when the expiration date
passed, we threw it away

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.656
without smelling it;
eating was carefree.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.900
My grandmother made that
life possible for us,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.200
but she was herself unable
to shake the desperation.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.073
Food for her was not food.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:32.650
It was terror, dignity, gratitude,
vengeance, joyfulness, humiliation,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.230
religion, history,
and, of course, love,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.226
as if the fruits she always
offered us were picked

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.026
from the destroyed
branches of our family tree.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.210
About half an hour after my son was
born, I went into the waiting room

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:48.313
to tell the gathered
family the good news.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.613
You said "he," so it's a boy.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.746
What's his name?

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.213
What does he look like?

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.946
Tell us everything.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.880
I answered their questions
as quickly as I could,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.946
then went to a corner and
turned on my cell phone.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.080
"Grandma," I said, "we have a baby."

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:04.880
Her only phone is in the kitchen.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.946
She picked up after the first ring
which meant she'd been sitting

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:08.946
at the table waiting for the call.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.480
It was just after midnight.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.330
Had she be clipping coupons or
preparing her chicken and carrots

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.763
to freeze for someone else
to eat at some future meal?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.253
I'd never once seen or heard
her cry, but tears pushed

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.193
through her voice as she asked,
"How much does it weigh?"

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.580
[ Laughter ]

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.330
A few days after we came home
from the hospital, I sent a letter

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.563
to a friend including
a photo of my son

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.696
and some first impressions
of fatherhood.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.150
He responded simply,
"Everything is possible again."

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.600
It was the perfect thing to write

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:41.800
because that was exactly
how it felt.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.763
We could retell our stories and make
them better, more representative

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:46.646
or aspirational, or we could
choose to tell different stories.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:50.730
The world itself had
another chance."

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.856
And I'm going to finish the
reading part with a one-page story

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.880
that my grandmother
told me, and this --

00:10:59.280 --> 00:10:59.746
I took dictation, these
are her words.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.923
It's a shame that I'm not an
actor because if I were able

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:03.630
to capture her accent, I think
you would understand the story

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.176
that much better, but it doesn't
take a great leap of empathy.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.860
So as I said, this is my
grandmother: "We weren't rich,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.326
but we always had enough.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.133
Thursdays we baked bread and rolls
and they lasted the whole week.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.053
Friday we had pancakes.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.253
On Shabbat we always had a
chicken and soup with noodles.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.620
You would go to the butcher
and ask for a little more fat;

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:26.376
the fattiest piece
was the best piece.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.796
It wasn't like now.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.263
We didn't have refrigerators,
but we had milk and cheese.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.810
We didn't have every kind of
vegetable, but we had enough.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:35.963
The things that you have
here and take for granted.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.670
But we were happy.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.816
We didn't know any better, and we
took what we had for granted, too.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:43.923
Then it all changed.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.816
During the war, it was hell
on earth, and I had nothing.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.830
I left my family, you know.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.430
I was always running, day and night,

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.163
because the Germans were
always right behind me.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.696
If you stopped, you died.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.163
And there was never enough food.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.496
I became sicker and sicker from not
eating, and I'm not just talking

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.303
about being skin and bones;
I had sores all over my body,

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.890
and it became difficult
even to move.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.886
I wasn't too good to
eat from a garbage can.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:07.466
I ate the parts that
others wouldn't eat.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.330
I took whatever I could
find, and I ate things

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.386
that I wouldn't tell you about.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.846
Even at the worst times,
there were good people, too.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.550
Someone taught me to tie the ends
of my pants so I could fill the legs

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:18.876
with any potatoes I
was able to steal.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.593
I walked miles and miles like
that because you never knew

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.560
when you would be lucky again.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.246
The worst it got was near the end.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.646
A lot of people died right
at the end, and I didn't know

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.046
if I could make it another day.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.676
A farmer, a Russian, God bless
him, he saw my condition,

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.416
and he went into his house and came
out with a piece of meat for me.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.553
"He saved your life," I said.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.753
"Oh, I didn't eat it," she said.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.293
"You didn't eat it?"

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
"It was pork.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.360
I wouldn't eat pork."

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.960
[ Laughter ]

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.093
"Why," I asked, although,
of course, I knew why.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.360
And she said, "What
do you mean why?"

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.160
And I said, "What?

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.693
Because it wasn't kosher?"

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.693
And she said, "Of course."

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.893
And I said, "But not
even to save your life?"

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.063
And she said, "If nothing
matters, there's nothing to save."

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.250
And that was really the
guiding principle of this book,

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.260
and I don't take the principle
to be one should be kosher.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.066
I take the moral of this story to be
that we have to act on our values,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.436
or at least there are certain
values that we have to act on

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.323
or we run the risk of -- of
losing something about ourselves

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:26.576
that is very much worth saving.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.836
We run the risk of actually
not being ourselves anymore.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.193
And so I spent about three years
learning about animal agriculture

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.590
in the United States, not
the philosophical question

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.933
of is it right or wrong to eat
meat; not, would it have been right

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:39.886
to eat meat 50 years ago, you know,
on the kinds of farms that were all

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.206
across America, but in 2010,
when 99 percent of the meat

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.506
that we eat comes from factory
farms, where animals are raised

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.546
in very great concentrations,
usually in very little space,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.426
almost always in windowless sheds,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.700
the environmental destruction
is built into the business plan

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.526
or it certainly seems to be,

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.626
it's the most environmental
destructive thing we do as humans,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.863
and the animal cruelty is part
of the system, and that --

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:08.413
what I wanted to figure
out, is taking into account

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.290
that meat smells good
and tastes good --

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.933
I am that kind of vegetarian who
believes that meat tastes good

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.483
and smells good -- and
taking into account the fact

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:19.253
that meat can serve very
important cultural functions;

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.543
that it can bring us closer
to our families sometimes;

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.376
that it can make certain rituals
feel more whole; taking all of that

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.013
into account, what
is the value of meat

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.046
because it is not infinitely
valuable.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.323
There are certain things that matter
more to me, and I think matter more

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.723
to all of us, and one of
those things is my ability

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.750
to tell my child stories
unflinchingly without glossing over,

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:44.303
without lying to him, especially
stories that are as primary

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.730
as where our food comes from,
stories that, knowingly or not,

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.746
we tell many times a day.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.676
So I think that's an entrance
into what this book is.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.526
And with the remaining time, I'd
be happy to try to answer any

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:02.556
of your questions about this or
about my other books or anything.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.510
[ Applause ]

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.010
[ Inaudible ]

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.690
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Safran Foer: So she
was asking about my second book,

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.156
<i>Extremely Loud and Incredibly
Close</i>, and if it was going

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.223
to be turned into a movie.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.400
And then she said some nice things
about the book which I can't repeat

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.046
because it'll sound like I'm
saying them about my own book.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.380
[ Laughter ]

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.246
Somebody's working on it, and
theoretically it will be made

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.246
into a movie, but a lot of
things will theoretically happen

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.046
and never seem to happen.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.113
I would say if we were
to compare the odds

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.536
of Iran getting a nuclear
bomb and my film being made --

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:05.023
my book being made into a film,
I would say they're about even.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.800
[ Laughter ]

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.333
Which would you prefer?

[ Laughter ]

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.400
Even if you hated my
book, it's still --

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.800
[ Laughter ]

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.066
&gt;&gt; Well, it's interesting
that you bring that book

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.133
up because it's obviously a very
difficult subject to write about,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.116
especially for people who lived
in New York, experienced that,

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.216
and to write about it from
the perspective of a child --

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.103
as a child -- is, you know, a
brave choice, put it that way.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.916
The narrative structure of the book
itself is interesting, though, too.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.563
It in terms also in the way
that you incorporated, you know,

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.456
a flip book in it and
the other parts of it.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.373
I guess as someone who is very
much growing up in the nuclear age,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.130
how do you see the
book itself evolving?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.096
You know, as you move
back to fiction,

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.176
do you expect to use more images
to create websites or videos,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.026
to write something that you
know will be read in more

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.980
than just the printed page?

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:57.780
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Safran
Foer: Well, you know,

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.246
you said that it was an unusual
or risky choice to begin with,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:01.413
to have a child as the
narrator of that book.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.040
The book has September 11
as a backdrop, and this --

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.853
the young boy lost his
father on that day.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.146
And Ron Charles, who I
think is probably not

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.626
in the audience right now but who's
a really wonderful book reviewer

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.640
for the <i>Washington Post,</i> wrote in
his review of my book that that day,

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:21.483
and by extension the book,
made children of all of us.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:25.710
I happen to remember that
line, and I remember very,

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.403
very few lines of reviews.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.043
And I think that he was
right, that there was a way

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.856
in which it reawakened a
kind of vulnerability in us,

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.486
also a sense of wonder or
astonishment, a sense of being small

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.843
in the face of things
that are very big, and,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.173
of course, a child's anxiety.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:47.506
It's interesting because the topic

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:49.906
of eating animals does
the exact reverse.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:51.283
It makes adults of all of us in
the sense that we are very willing

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.800
to accept things that we know in our
hearts just aren't right in a way --

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.860
in ways that kids don't do.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.253
If anyone's had the experience
of trying to explain to a kid

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.413
where meat comes from, you
know, it often involves a kind

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.853
of a pleasant version
of an unpleasant story,

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.213
and even then I think they're
good at sniffing out what's wrong

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:13.956
with the story that's
being told to them.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.960
Now, as for the form
of the book, you know,

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.576
I don't think that books
need images at all.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:21.410
My favorite books don't have images.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.406
That book is filled with images and
it has a very maximal style in part

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:26.580
because I wanted the form
to reflect the content.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:29.380
You know, Oscar, the hero,
has this very flamboyant,

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.713
maximal imagination.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.633
He refers to his imagination
as being like beavers.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.553
He says, "You know, beavers chop
down trees not only to build dams

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.593
but because if they weren't
constantly filing their teeth

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:43.780
down on trees, their
teeth would grow

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.113
into their own skulls
and they would die."

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.113
And he said, "My imagination
is like that.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.816
Like it has to be active otherwise
I'd be left to contemplate,

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.743
you know, this tragic
reality of my life."

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.666
And I wanted the book
to have that same kind

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.333
of manic quality or
hysterical quality.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.423
And that was why I did it.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.133
The fiction I'm working on now
doesn't include any kind of images.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.400
As we move forward and books
are going to be read on screens,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.506
which seems inevitable, for better
or for worse, it would be hard

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.896
for literature to resist the
temptation to become more visual.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.813
You know, the newspapers
have, you could say,

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:20.246
fallen prey to that temptation.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.936
If you look at the <i>New York Times
Online</i>, there's embedded video,

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.490
there's embedded sound, and
we expect that of a newspaper.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.010
The question is, will readers
expect the same thing of novels

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.723
when they're on that vehicle.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.523
It's like, you know, if you
were -- it's imagine being --

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.050
pushing a wheelbarrow
on the Autobahn

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:40.506
and all the cars beeping
behind you, saying, like,

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.993
speed up or get off the road.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.060
I think that writers are going

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.093
to feel those honking horns behind
them, and the challenge will be

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.353
to remember what's good about
books, which is that they're slow

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.966
and that they're inefficient and
that they're a single task endeavor

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.113
and that they're inefficient
and they're not going anywhere.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.673
You know, so much of life,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.940
there's this increased
emphasis on efficiency.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.003
Can we do three things
instead of two at a time?

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:06.076
Can I make it somewhat quicker?

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.076
Can my food come to me quicker?

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.343
Can I get my job done more quickly?

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:12.410
Can I spend less time
with my family?

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:14.076
You know, this is where we are.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.276
And books are the antidote
to that, but it's going

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:18.410
to be increasingly
difficult to stand

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.076
against all of this efficiency.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.610
So readers will have a part to play,
writers will have a part to play,

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.410
publishers will have a part to play.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.406
And, you know, another reason
I'm grateful to be here today is

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.583
because festivals like this are one
of the great, like, the saving grace

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.913
of literature, you know, reminding
us that we're a huge community,

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.010
that we're a diverse community, and
that this is at least a good a way

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.333
to spend time as updating
your Facebook page.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.330
Can I --

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.196

a stroke victim or something.

[ Laughter ]

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.596
&gt;&gt; I'm a middle school teacher,
and in April I did <i>Eating Animals</i>

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.290
as a discussion group with eighth
graders, and it was fantastic.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.043
They got the book, they
loved the book, it --

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.526
my discussion group could
have gone on all afternoon.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.466
But in the 30 days between
when I announced the title

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.186
and the actual discussion, I was
paranoid that some parent was going

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.460
to call and say, "You've
read the book, right?

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.700
You know that there's stuff

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.166
in here that's not
appropriate for a 13-year-old."

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:30.500
And I wasn't sure if
I could argue that.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.143
There definitely are maybe
words or, you know --

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.746
and I'm wondering if you're
considering going the Pollen route

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.236
or Schlosser route and making a
young readers' version of this book?

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.030
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Safran Foer: I
haven't given it a lot of thought.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.963
I'm glad that your eighth
graders were so invigorated by it,

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.466
and I'm actually not surprised
because high school students

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.260
and college students engage

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:50.796
with this subject very
differently than older people do.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.276
Eighteen percent of American
college students describe themselves

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:57.570
as vegetarian.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.140
There are more vegetarians
on American college campuses

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.050
than there are Catholics,
and I'm not --

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.750
[ Laughter ]

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.416
I'm not talking about in
Berkeley or in New York City --

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.616
in the entire United States.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.773
This is something that
everybody cares about.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.470
You know, free-range and cage-free
eggs are the fastest growing sector

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:14.076
of the food industry in America --

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:16.230
not in Washington,
D.C., in all of America.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.570
And it's a food that doesn't taste
better and isn't better for you,

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:21.236
but people are buying in droves

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:23.963
because of these values
that we all share.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.580
I mean, I was in a wonderful
position writing this book

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.763
because I never felt like I had
to persuade anyone of anything.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.470
I never felt like I had to
change anyone's mind or values,

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.690
only present information that is --
I mean, people sometimes cast this

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.263
as a moral argument, if --

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.453
if what we mean by morality is that
we shouldn't put pregnant animals

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:43.926
in cages so small they
can't turn around,

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.326
then we've really lowered
the bar for morality.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.790
So --

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000


00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:52.290
[ Applause ]

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:54.556
-- so I take every
opportunity I can to talk

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.150
to high school and college students.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.236
And I would say if there are
parents who are concerned about some

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.283
of the material in the book, I don't
blame them and you should just take

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.056
that material out and share
the rest of the book with them.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.333
There are parts that are very
difficult to read, either because --

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.913
not because of my imagination
but because of the imagination

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.273
of the factory farm industry.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.213
It's why I wrote this book as
nonfiction rather than a novel

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.066
because I wanted everyone

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.333
to know whose imagination
was -- was at play.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:24.240
&gt;&gt; Hi, thank you, for being here.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.306
I guess it feels so overwhelming
sometimes, like, food in general

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.746
in this country, we have Senate
bill maybe next week that Cargill

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:35.466
and ConAgra support that's
about food safety, and, like,

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.993
I see those companies as the
root of the problem kind of.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:42.946
And that's the best
legislation we have on the table.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.266
I was wondering since you're in D.C.
and the Capitol's right behind us,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
if you've given any thought to the
government's role in the problem --

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.283
well, obviously the problem,
but also the solution,

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.850
or whether you think it's
just an individual kind

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.783
of choices that will rise up?

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.316
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Safran Foer: Well,
we don't need the choice.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.486
I mean, there's a lot of emphasis
in our country put on choice

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.943
as if it's always a good thing,
as if it put us in closer touch

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:09.283
with our constitution or something.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.616
We don't need the choice.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.750
We don't demand the choice to
have children's toys painted

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:15.586
with lead paint; we
expect our government

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.046
to protect us from that choice.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.060
And we don't need the choice to
have Chilean sea bass available.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:22.590
We don't need the choice to have
salmonella-infected chicken.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:30.076
You know, there is a three-quarters
of a billion egg recall recently

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.033
that most people are probably
aware of, and that's scary.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:33.633
Eight percent of all
the chicken in all

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.933
of our supermarkets is
infected with salmonella.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.200
Between 40 and 70 is
infected with E. Coli.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.003
We're told to cook food at
extremely high temperatures

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.383
until there's absolutely no doubt
that anything that was wicked

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.330
in it has been cooked through.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.683
We're told to scrub down
our counters with soap,

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.543
some people even say with bleach,
to wash our hands vigorously.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:56.276
We should not be in this position.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.543
Our parents and grandparents
weren't in this position.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.410
The government should be
protecting our food safety.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.213
We shouldn't have available
food that requires us to cook it

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.570
at incredibly high temperatures and
wash down all surfaces afterwards.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:13.563
So unfortunately the
U.S.D.A. wears two hats.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:16.656
One is to endorse American farming
and support American industry,

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:19.616
and the other is to
protect consumers.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.180
In a country in which 99 percent of
our food comes from factory farms,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.566
where health risks are built
into the business model,

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:27.960
environmental destruction's
built into the business model,

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.720
they're incompatible positions,
so we need something else,

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.520
we need someone who's protecting us.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.830
And maybe it was nice to think
that when the new government came

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:39.010
into office, new things
would happen,

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.543
but nothing new has happened.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.666
&gt;&gt; Hi, Jonathan.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:46.733
I'm a fellow vegan, so thanks --

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.400
thank you for all you're
doing for animals.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.666
I appreciate it.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.933
And I was wondering how
much backlash you've gotten

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.066
from the meat industry
from this book?

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.200
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Safran
Foer: Well, in a way,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.066
this is the most interesting fact
about the publication of the book.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.933
She asked how much backlash there
has been from the meat industry.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.983
Not only has there been no backlash,
there's been no response at all.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.150
So my book has 80 pages of endnotes.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.126
Each page has, I don't
know, 20 endnotes.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:11.896
So we're talking about a
lot of facts in the book.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:14.773
Not a single fact has
been called into question.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.113
And it's not the case that the
book just disappeared, you know,

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.616
it was like a best seller, I
got to talk about it on TV.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:20.980
It's not that they just
were willing for it

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:23.800
to be ignored and it was ignored.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.266
It did -- it did enter
the consciousness,

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.126
if only in a limited way,
for some amount of time.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.300
But, you know, if I
wrote a book about you,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.816
and I said -- what's your name?

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:38.750
&gt;&gt; Heather.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.950
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Safran Foer: Heather.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:42.150
If I said, "Heather is a bad person.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.550
We should all spend
less time with Heather.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.150
Heather is destructive
in these ways.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.483
She's cruel in these ways.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.550
We should withdraw our
friendship and support of Heather,"

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.883
you would say, "Hey, wait a
minute, that's not right, you know,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.083
you're not telling the whole story.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.283
Some of what you said
is simply untrue.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.416
Some of what you said could
be looked at in another way.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.216
Let me make the argument
for Heather."

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.816
No one has stood up and made the
argument for factory farming.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.283
I'm not talking about eating meat,
I'm talking about factory farming.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.556
Every reading I go to, I say,
if somebody wants to stand up

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.636
and make the defense of factory
farming, I would love to hear it now

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:12.960
because I looked for three and a
half years and I couldn't find it,

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.100
even among factory farmers, and
I did speak to a number of them.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.063
I'm not talking about a
defense that it tastes good

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:20.110
or that it can sometimes seem
cheap, but a really cogent defense

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.416
that would stand the test

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.776
of a reasonable conversation,
and I haven't found it.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.536
And it's actually disappointed me
that there has been no backlash

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.743
because I would love to engage
them in this conversation.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.730
The reason there's been no backlash
is the most telling fact of all

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.676
in a book that's filled with facts,
which is the meat industry knows

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:42.626
that if the conversation is
expanded, if people think

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.646
about this, they're going to
be discouraged from eating it.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.890
It is not the case that knowledge
leads you to want to eat more of it.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:53.536
You know, anyone who
follows the newspaper, right,

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:58.190
knows that there has not been
an article in <i>New York Times</i>

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.013
or <i>Washington Post</i>
in the last three years

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.726
that says this industry is less
environmentally destructive

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.566
than we thought; there's
not been an article

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.063
that says it is treating animals
less badly than we've thought;

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.536
and there's not been an article

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.403
that says this food is
safer than we thought.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.893
All news, all information, all
conversation, all thought points

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.026
in the same direction, which is
this is more destructive, unhealthy,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.800
and cruel than we had thought.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.513
And so if I were them, I would
be taking exactly the same tact,

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.326
which is, let's just hope people
are so ignorant or so willing

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.180
to forget what they know that
they'll put aside the values

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.513
that they have in the
interest of what?

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.676
Not in the interest of
the Thanksgiving turkey,

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.410
that's not what we're talking
about, or the Christmas ham.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:36.866
We're talking about a McDonald's
hamburger, Chicken McNuggets.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.953
That's what's at stake.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.760
That's what is responsible for
this industry that we have.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.346
And that's what we have to
withdraw our support from.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880

[ Applause ]

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.360
-- it's time for one more questions.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.703
Sorry to the others.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.296
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm sorry to go a bit off
subject, but I just want to talk

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.273
about <i>Everything's Illuminated</i>
because I think that's one

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.780
of the best pieces of literature
that I've read in quite some time,

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:03.580
and I was personally moved by it.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.846
And I have a question.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.113
What made you personally want
to actually write about it,

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.113
and what do you think that we
can learn from such a story

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.113
as that as you've written?

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.780
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Safran Foer:
So she asked two questions:

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.846
What made me want to write
<i>Everything is Illuminated</i>?

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.046
And what do I think
we can learn from it?

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.246
I don't think we can
learn anything from it.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.580
I don't think novels are written
to be learned from in that way.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.113
I think the kind of
education that happens

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.813
in a novel is very unpredictable
and very subtle and has to do not

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:28.743
with what kind of politics
we should have,

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:34.083
but who we might be more
similar to than we'd thought.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.583
You know, my first experience

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:41.183
as a published author was I did a
radio show and it was call-in show,

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.920
and someone -- someone -- the
first caller, in fact, said,

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:45.793
"I want to thank you
for writing this book

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.260
because you told my family story.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.446
And I'd never seen it or
heard it in that way."

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.090
And so in my mind, I'm imagining
the caller on the other end,

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:56.006
and I thought, oh, it's a
20-something Jewish guy,

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.240
glasses, brown hair, [inaudible].

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.973
And he said, "As a 65-year-old
black man living in Trenton,"

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.030
[ Laughter ]

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.086
and my reaction is basically
like yours, I kind of chuckled

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.323
and I was surprised, and I've
thought a lot about that since then,

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.436
and shame on me for being surprised,
and shame on us for laughing

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.020
because it suggests that the
things we feel most deeply

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.466
or our family stories
are somehow told

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:25.183
through the circumstances
of our lives.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:26.800
Like the fact that I was 25 and
he was 65 should matter in terms

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.046
of what we felt most deeply or what
our family stories boil down to,

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:35.696
or that he was a black person
and I was white person,

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:37.810
or that I was Jewish and he was not.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:39.816
You know, literature is
the antidote to that idea,

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:42.670
the idea that we are
closer to people

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.323
or we will better understand
people who lives --

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.283
who live lives that are ours.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.266
And there aren't very many antidotes
in the world left to that which is

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:51.460
such -- makes it such a shame
that the arts aren't a bigger part

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.346
of how we relate to the people that
most desperately need to relate to.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.153
You know, if you think about our
military presence in the Middle East

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.380
or our militaristic
presence, we have --

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.900
how many people in this room have
read a work in Arabic in translation

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.520
in the last year or five
years, I mean, very few.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.383
And if that is the way that we
communicate our humanity best --

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.606
and I do believe it is -- then
we're in deep trouble if that kind

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:19.953
of conversation isn't taking place.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.240
