I was just at an international

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609
I was just at an international
 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.309
I was just at an international
conference where you know we learned

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319
conference where you know we learned
 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.870
conference where you know we learned
about the occupation and why it's

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880
about the occupation and why it's
 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.789
about the occupation and why it's
illegal under international law and so

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799
illegal under international law and so
 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.650
illegal under international law and so
you know I think that the aim of these

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660
you know I think that the aim of these
 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.970
you know I think that the aim of these
charter schools is to create a

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980
charter schools is to create a
 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.069
charter schools is to create a
generation of Hawaiian youth that will

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079
generation of Hawaiian youth that will
 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.990
generation of Hawaiian youth that will
then sort of lead this push for

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000
then sort of lead this push for
 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.470
then sort of lead this push for
sovereignty to not forget the Hawaiian

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480
sovereignty to not forget the Hawaiian
 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.659
sovereignty to not forget the Hawaiian

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230
and reclaim their land and it's also
 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.569
and reclaim their land and it's also
important to remember that they're free

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579
