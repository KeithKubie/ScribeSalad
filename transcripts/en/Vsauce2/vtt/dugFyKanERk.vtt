00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.750
The lightest material ever created.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.860
And this robotic bear pillow is designed to
tickle your face to stop you from snoring.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.670
VSauce, Kevin here.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.890
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.789
Invoked Computing is a concept that removes
the physical computers from our homes and

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.620
offices and, instead, allows for basically
anything to become computerized.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.660
Like using this pizza box as a sort of laptop,
or this banana as a phone.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.910
It works by using a camera projector and parametric
speaker, and the goal is to create an audio/video

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.640
augmented reality system.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.120
The EXOdesk is a 40-inch transparent touchscreen
that transforms your boring computer desk

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.060
into a giant interactive screen.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.010
You can quickly navigate widgets, or just
make your desk a virtual piano, and it will

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.140
be available for purchase sometime next year.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.190
To skip touching all-together, there's Eye
Asteroids: The world's first eye-controlled

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.250
arcade game.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.450
It uses eye-tracking technology, and claims
the experience feels like the game is reading

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.280
your mind.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.030
Uhhh....

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.470
DARPA's FastRunner is a Robo-Ostrich capable
of running 27 MPH.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.110
It contains a single motor per leg, and they
say the technology is adaptable to work on

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.320
four-legged bots, or even humanoids.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.290
If you hate physically cleaning up your room,
the Robo Maid uses Kinect Motion Technology

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.990
and a robot to pick up objects remotely.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.350
And it could be used to aid the elderly.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.580
Wait...what?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.630
He may not be a robot but Roger Craig recently
cracked Jeopardy by developing a web application

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.630
to compile past questions from the show and
test his own topic-strengths and weaknesses.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.560
Oh, and it worked - he won almost $200,000.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.860
The BBC filmed an underwater icicle of death
in the antarctic.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.590
The cold, sinking brine is denser than the
sea water, and freezes as it contacts warmer

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.790
water below the surface, eventually reaching
the seafloor and freezing any creatures in

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.790
its path.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.090
Ok, here's what blowing up walls with a water-cooler
bottle looks like.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.579
Or just sending one through the side of a
van...

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:23.139
Finally, here's an epic video from Rollerman...

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.620
I'm gonna leave you with a perfect bubble.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.639
There are 4 clues hidden in the description
of this video.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.659
The first person to answer all 4 correctly
will be our Genius of the Week.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.769
So, good luck, and, as always, thanks for
watching.
