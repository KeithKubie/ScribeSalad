00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.880
Fact, there are a lot of apps in the Play store.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.270
&gt;&gt; I know and most of them are probably made by really awesome developers.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.680
&gt;&gt; But it's not enough anymore just to be an awesome developer.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.910
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, a lot of these apps get really low ratings. And

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.730
low ratings are almost always a sign of bad user experience design.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.380
&gt;&gt; With that in mind.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.390
&gt;&gt; Welcome to UX Design For Mobile Developers.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.000
&gt;&gt; This class will teach you, developers how to design amazing apps

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.830
that get five stars.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.070
&gt;&gt; My name is Nazmul.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.500
&gt;&gt; I am a Developer Advocate at Google and I specialize in Android and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.900
User Experience Design. Hi and I'm Izabel,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.560
I'm an Android Interaction Designer and Prototyper.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.240
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.150
&gt;&gt; So Izabel, why are we teaching this class? Well,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.850
currently today the world of design and development are largely siloed.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.950
And this is crazy because we all have the same

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.430
goal which is to make amazing applications that our users love.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.640
And the goal of this course is to help bring these

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.960
two worlds together and help you become a design minded developer.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.440
&gt;&gt; So you know, to make amazing apps you

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.840
really have to know a little bit of both.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.390
&gt;&gt; As a developer you have to think a little bit like a designer.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.430
&gt;&gt; I actually consider myself to be a design minded developer.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.900
&gt;&gt; So if I were to place myself on a scale of design and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.990
development skills, I would say I'm a ten on develop and maybe like a seven

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.820
on design.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.070
&gt;&gt; So Izabel, where do you see yourself on this

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.710
scale? For designer, I would put myself at a ten.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.740
&gt;&gt; Cool. And for development, since I'm a prototyper

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.610
I would put myself at a bout a four.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.160
&gt;&gt; Oh nice.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.590
&gt;&gt; So, where do you see yourself on this scale?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.860
&gt;&gt; I want you to really think about this because at the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.210
end of this class we will ask you to take this quiz again.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.210
&gt;&gt; And hopefully you'll have moved way higher on the design scale.
