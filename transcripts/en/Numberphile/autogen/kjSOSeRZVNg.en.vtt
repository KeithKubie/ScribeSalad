one that I like a legal move is let's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
one that I like a legal move is let's
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.260
one that I like a legal move is let's
just take one piece here a legal move is

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
just take one piece here a legal move is
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.750
just take one piece here a legal move is
buy an Amazon if you choose to move this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
buy an Amazon if you choose to move this
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.990

Amazon you can go as far as it wants in

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
Amazon you can go as far as it wants in
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.889

horizontal or vertical like a chess
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.510

queen now after it moves it must shoot

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
queen now after it moves it must shoot
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.149

an arrow and the arrow also goes like a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
an arrow and the arrow also goes like a
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.450
an arrow and the arrow also goes like a
chess queen the same Amazon that moved

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
chess queen the same Amazon that moved
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.850
chess queen the same Amazon that moved
must also shoot so maybe it shoots like

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
must also shoot so maybe it shoots like
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.820
must also shoot so maybe it shoots like
that okay now the square in which it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
that okay now the square in which it
 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.039
that okay now the square in which it
lands this is like a flaming arrow it is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
lands this is like a flaming arrow it is
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.899
lands this is like a flaming arrow it is
burned off the board and that square

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
burned off the board and that square
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.480
burned off the board and that square
cannot be occupied nor can any other

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
cannot be occupied nor can any other
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.440
cannot be occupied nor can any other
Amazon jump over it or capture it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
Amazon jump over it or capture it
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870
Amazon jump over it or capture it
there's no capturing all the Amazons are

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880
there's no capturing all the Amazons are
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.200

immortal they run about shooting flaming

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
immortal they run about shooting flaming
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270
immortal they run about shooting flaming
arrows and eventually the board gets

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
arrows and eventually the board gets
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.969
arrows and eventually the board gets
blocked up with flaming arrows and

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979
blocked up with flaming arrows and
 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.980
blocked up with flaming arrows and
somebody can't move and when that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
somebody can't move and when that
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.420
somebody can't move and when that
happens because they're unable to move

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
happens because they're unable to move
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640
happens because they're unable to move
and the game's over and the player

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
and the game's over and the player
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.800
and the game's over and the player
unable to move is the player who loses

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
unable to move is the player who loses
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.429
unable to move is the player who loses
Oh

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
Oh
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830
Oh
the player who did the last legal move

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
the player who did the last legal move
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.490
the player who did the last legal move
is the winner

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
is the winner
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.609
is the winner
that's right okay yes

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
that's right okay yes
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.090
that's right okay yes
sounds fun okay well it is Brady's gonna

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
sounds fun okay well it is Brady's gonna
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770
sounds fun okay well it is Brady's gonna
play black and I'm gonna play white and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
play black and I'm gonna play white and
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810
play black and I'm gonna play white and
we're gonna play again well let's say

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
we're gonna play again well let's say
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.499
we're gonna play again well let's say
you can go first

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
you can go first
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.090
you can go first
it is believed there is an advantage to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
it is believed there is an advantage to
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.340
it is believed there is an advantage to
going first but no one really knows I'm

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
going first but no one really knows I'm
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.050
going first but no one really knows I'm
gonna go so okay there and then so I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
gonna go so okay there and then so I
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.900
gonna go so okay there and then so I
could shoot my arrow for example - there

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
could shoot my arrow for example - there
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.500
could shoot my arrow for example - there
sure

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:22.349
that's okay all right here and there I'm

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359
that's okay all right here and there I'm
 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:32.250
that's okay all right here and there I'm
gonna go to yeah shoot my alright okay

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
gonna go to yeah shoot my alright okay
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.920
gonna go to yeah shoot my alright okay

so here I'm feeling that black player

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989
so here I'm feeling that black player
 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.750
so here I'm feeling that black player
getting a bit pinned in there so for

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760
getting a bit pinned in there so for
 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.220
getting a bit pinned in there so for
example I'm Maru I might move to here

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230
example I'm Maru I might move to here
 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.659
example I'm Maru I might move to here
and then try and start penning in you're

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669
and then try and start penning in you're
 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.539
and then try and start penning in you're
white you're white hammers on there yep

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549
white you're white hammers on there yep
 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.569
white you're white hammers on there yep
that's highly plausible so I'll go here

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579
that's highly plausible so I'll go here
 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:01.879
that's highly plausible so I'll go here
and shoot there okay okay here and shoot

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889
and shoot there okay okay here and shoot
 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.259
and shoot there okay okay here and shoot
to that okay

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269
to that okay
 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.520
to that okay
was that a good or a bad knife hard for

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530
was that a good or a bad knife hard for
 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.619
was that a good or a bad knife hard for
me at all I think I better let's go here

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629
me at all I think I better let's go here
 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.300
me at all I think I better let's go here
and shoot here okay my black player is

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310
and shoot here okay my black player is
 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.589
and shoot here okay my black player is
getting quite pinned in there isn't he

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599
getting quite pinned in there isn't he
 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.899
getting quite pinned in there isn't he
yeah I feel like I need to get that guy

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909
yeah I feel like I need to get that guy
 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.819
yeah I feel like I need to get that guy
out of trouble because if because I

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829
out of trouble because if because I
 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.140
out of trouble because if because I
could get boxed in here quite easily

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150
could get boxed in here quite easily
 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.809
could get boxed in here quite easily
couldn't I true so I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819
couldn't I true so I'm gonna I'm gonna
 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.170
couldn't I true so I'm gonna I'm gonna
come down to here and then I have my

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180
come down to here and then I have my
 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.879
come down to here and then I have my
arrow yeah well that works to some

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889
arrow yeah well that works to some
 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.270
arrow yeah well that works to some
extent are you feeling good about your

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280
extent are you feeling good about your
 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:53.789
extent are you feeling good about your
situation yeah yeah yeah so now the

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799
situation yeah yeah yeah so now the
 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.740
situation yeah yeah yeah so now the
board is split into two games there's

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750
board is split into two games there's
 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.170
board is split into two games there's
one over here and which I'm Way ahead

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180
one over here and which I'm Way ahead
 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.949
one over here and which I'm Way ahead
cuz I have a lot of space and you have

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959
cuz I have a lot of space and you have
 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.860
cuz I have a lot of space and you have
only one and there's another game over

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
only one and there's another game over
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.170
only one and there's another game over
here this divides the board into two

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
here this divides the board into two
 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.619
here this divides the board into two
pieces

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629
pieces
 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.470
pieces
is this commenting in in in games for

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480
is this commenting in in in games for
 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.390
is this commenting in in in games for
games to get split into sub games like

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
games to get split into sub games like
 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.509
games to get split into sub games like
this certainly in the kind of character

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519
this certainly in the kind of character
 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.590
this certainly in the kind of character
games that we study yes because that's a

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600
games that we study yes because that's a
 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.009
games that we study yes because that's a
big part of how we manage to do an

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019
big part of how we manage to do an
 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.990
big part of how we manage to do an
analysis because in the mathematics we

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000
analysis because in the mathematics we
 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.450
analysis because in the mathematics we
can do an analysis this side of the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460
can do an analysis this side of the
 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.550
can do an analysis this side of the
board the result is not gonna be too

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560
board the result is not gonna be too
 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.080
board the result is not gonna be too
complicated because this is fairly

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090
complicated because this is fairly
 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.570
complicated because this is fairly
simple this over here is still fairly

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580
simple this over here is still fairly
 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.879
simple this over here is still fairly
complicated but we can do an analysis

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889
complicated but we can do an analysis
 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.590
complicated but we can do an analysis
over here we do another analysis over

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600
over here we do another analysis over
 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.900
over here we do another analysis over
here and then we have ways of adding

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910
here and then we have ways of adding
 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.850
here and then we have ways of adding
these two analyses together to get an

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860
these two analyses together to get an
 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.620
these two analyses together to get an
analysis of the whole game is there a

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630
analysis of the whole game is there a
 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.890
analysis of the whole game is there a
name for this this this tecnique divide

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900
name for this this this tecnique divide
 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.659
name for this this this tecnique divide
and conquer it feels like I'm I'm pretty

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669
and conquer it feels like I'm I'm pretty
 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.610
and conquer it feels like I'm I'm pretty
dead over this side now like over here

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620
dead over this side now like over here
 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.969
dead over this side now like over here
there's a lot more at stake yeah there's

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979
there's a lot more at stake yeah there's
 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.010
there's a lot more at stake yeah there's
some squares back here you will probably

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020
some squares back here you will probably
 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.290
some squares back here you will probably
get and there's some squares down here

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300
get and there's some squares down here
 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.740
get and there's some squares down here
that more likely I will get there's some

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750
that more likely I will get there's some
 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.640
that more likely I will get there's some
of the middle that we'll be fighting

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650
of the middle that we'll be fighting
 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.920
of the middle that we'll be fighting
over so okay presumably these two will

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930
over so okay presumably these two will
 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.600
over so okay presumably these two will
be fighting for a while it's mine maybe

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
be fighting for a while it's mine maybe
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.839
be fighting for a while it's mine maybe
but the name isn't yes I mean okay yeah

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849
 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.589
yeah okay so I think I will just go here

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599
yeah okay so I think I will just go here
 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.830
yeah okay so I think I will just go here
and shoot here yes so now I have one two

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840
and shoot here yes so now I have one two
 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.870
and shoot here yes so now I have one two
three four five you have one two three

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880
three four five you have one two three
 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.830
three four five you have one two three
four five six seven okay unless I can

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840
four five six seven okay unless I can
 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.680
four five six seven okay unless I can
move again which I'm they come on here

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690
move again which I'm they come on here
 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.480
move again which I'm they come on here
argue with you okay but at the moment

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490
argue with you okay but at the moment
 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.219
argue with you okay but at the moment
you have two moves more than I do here

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229
you have two moves more than I do here
 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.510
you have two moves more than I do here
probably roughly not and over here I

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520
probably roughly not and over here I
 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.100
probably roughly not and over here I
have one two three four five six six or

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110
have one two three four five six six or
 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.389
have one two three four five six six or
seven moves ahead of you okay

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:43.399
seven moves ahead of you okay
 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:54.859
seven moves ahead of you okay
here fire here so no this is sort of

00:05:54.859 --> 00:05:54.869
here fire here so no this is sort of
 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:59.420
here fire here so no this is sort of
interesting like come in after you I you

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430
interesting like come in after you I you
 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.070
interesting like come in after you I you
may cut me off so I'm not sure what the

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080
may cut me off so I'm not sure what the
 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.189
may cut me off so I'm not sure what the
best plan is here I probably do that

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199
best plan is here I probably do that
 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:20.540
best plan is here I probably do that
anyway I'll come in and I'm gonna be

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550
anyway I'll come in and I'm gonna be
 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:30.369
anyway I'll come in and I'm gonna be
okay and still get three points extra

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:30.379
 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:33.290
but if you don't I'll back up and get

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300
but if you don't I'll back up and get
 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.129
but if you don't I'll back up and get
all these yeah okay okay here and fire

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139
all these yeah okay okay here and fire
 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.510
all these yeah okay okay here and fire
here so then I come here and shoot here

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520
here so then I come here and shoot here
 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.760
here so then I come here and shoot here
okay so I only have one possible move

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770
okay so I only have one possible move
 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.429
okay so I only have one possible move
which is to go here and fire here all

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:52.439
which is to go here and fire here all
 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.429
which is to go here and fire here all
right yeah yeah now I start using it my

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:55.439
right yeah yeah now I start using it my
 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:59.179
right yeah yeah now I start using it my
moves here and now I can't move I can't

00:06:59.179 --> 00:06:59.189

well black has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 moves white

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:08.410
well black has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 moves white
 

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.540
well black has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 moves white
has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 moves but white has

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:12.550

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.250
has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 moves but white has
another one so white is ahead by one

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:14.260
another one so white is ahead by one
 

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:14.700

white is one move ahead so he will win

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:17.410
white is one move ahead so he will win
 

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.040

now I after this for instance it's now 7

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.290

vs. 7 and the mover will lose because

vs. 7 and the mover will lose because
this adds up to zero so in general we

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:28.780
this adds up to zero so in general we
 

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.770
this adds up to zero so in general we
say game is worth zero when the mover

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:31.780
say game is worth zero when the mover
 

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.260
say game is worth zero when the mover
cannot win so zero game is 1 which is

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.270
cannot win so zero game is 1 which is
 

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.450
cannot win so zero game is 1 which is
well a win for the second player the

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:36.460
