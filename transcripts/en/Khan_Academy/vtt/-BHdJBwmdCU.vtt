SALMAN KHAN: Now that
students can get access

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.709
to the information delivery part
of learning-- the lectures--

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:09.250
at their own time
and their own pace,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.125
and we also have an
interactive portion where

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:13.310
they can do problems,
a lot of teachers

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.560
are saying, well, why should
I use the scarce class

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.590
time for this kind of passive,
I lecture, people listen, take

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.290
notes?

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.210
Instead, we could use that
for actual interactivity.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.600
And it's different
for every teacher.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.180
It's different for
every classroom.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.900
But we've seen classrooms now
where when they come to class,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.250
they're doing problem solving.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.310
And they have the teacher
there to help them out,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.040
to tutor them.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.290
And they have their peers too.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.915
And the classes a
lot of us grew up in,

00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:38.164
if you wanted to help your
peer, you'd get in trouble.

00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:39.619
You know, shh, be quiet, listen.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:40.660
But now it's like no, no.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.140
This is what it's all about--
getting help from your peers,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.070
doing problem solving,
doing open-ended projects,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.340
interacting with your teacher.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.350
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: What do you
think your average-- maybe

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.558
that's not the way to put it.

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:51.720
How do you think a lot
of classes are failing?

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.510
I mean, what's wrong with
the American education

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.590
system in a typical
classroom, where it really

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.840
isn't serving a student today?

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.298
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah,
and then this is

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:01.780
something I go into a lot
of detail on in the book.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.117
All of the paranoia
about our school system,

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.700
we come look at the
national rankings,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.199
we're like, oh,
we're behind Estonia

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:08.300
in factoring polynomials.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.383
It's the end of the world.

00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:10.870
America's going to
lose everything.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.380
And one thing--

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.770
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: We're kind
of low on science and math.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.800
SALMAN KHAN: Low on
science and math.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.980
And we shouldn't get
complacent about that.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.507
But one thing I point out is if
you look at the last 50 years,

00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:21.340
and you look at the
innovation in the world,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.048
it's only been that
getting more and more

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:24.134
concentrated in the US.

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:26.050
If you look at the most
innovative companies--

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.799
the Facebooks, the
Googles, the Twitters--

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.815
they're all coming from America.

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:32.190
And part of is because we're
the most creative countries.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.850
It's innovative.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.640
Failure isn't stigmatized.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.059
And so instead of this model
of education that we have,

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:39.850
where all the students
are batched together

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.710
and there are passive lecturers,
and they're pushed forward?

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.330
This is a model inherited
from Prussia, a country that

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.410
does not exist
anymore, 200 years ago.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.260
And so what I point
out instead of trying

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.926
to compare our Prussian model to
the Prussian model in Singapore

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:55.060
and the Prussian model
in Finland, all of which

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.190
are passive models, we should
make our model more American.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.440
Make it interactive when
people come to the classroom.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.910
Give room for creativity.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.790
If you get a C or a D,
it's not about failure.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.676
It's about, well,
make it better then.

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:09.090
MALE SPEAKER: I find this
fascinating in the context

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.570
of something else, which is like
the idea of stereotyped threat.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.410
And this is this idea that
sometimes in classrooms,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.190
some kids feel like there's a
threat response that they will

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.170
be stereotyped if
they ask questions

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.940
when they don't
understand something.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.560
So the idea that
you could go back

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.150
and-- you don't understand that
you could listen to it again

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.400
on your own and then
seek help at another time

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.660
or in your own pace.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.860
So girls sometimes
feel this threat

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.566
when they're in math classes.

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:39.940
They found that
African Americans

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.077
feel this threat a lot of
times in classes in general,

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:44.910
that they feel like
they're asking questions

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.140
that they shouldn't be asking.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.780
And therefore, they don't do it.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.824
And this seems like it gets
around that whole concept.

00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:53.740
Am I right about that?

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.573
SALMAN KHAN: No, no.

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:56.323
You're hitting, I
think, the core problem.

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:58.697
When people say, oh, but in
lecture, I can ask questions.

00:02:58.697 --> 00:02:59.430
I was like, no.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.874
Three people have the
guts to ask a question.

00:03:01.874 --> 00:03:04.040
And if you're in an algebra
class and you forgot how

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.030
to multiply decimals,
or you forgot--

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.810
you don't even know your, maybe
you don't-- and we've see this

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.270
is in some algebra classes.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.690
There's no way you're going to
raise your hand and say, wait,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.890
I forgot my fourth grade math.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.122
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:03:12.122 --> 00:03:13.872
You've taught more
classes on Khan Academy

00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:17.080
than Harvard University has
offered since its founding.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.420
What is your vision for
future of education globally?

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.700
SALMAN KHAN: We want
to keep growing, get

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.200
to hundreds of
millions of students.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.340
We've translated our
content into 12 languages.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.130
It's being used
around the world.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.037
We want to become
more interactive.

00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:31.870
And we hope that the
conversation isn't just

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.740
about-- a lot of the,
within this Prussian model,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.270
how do we tweak the system?

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.364
But it's about time.

00:03:37.364 --> 00:03:39.030
It's been 200 years,
and we can actually

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.410
fundamentally rethink the model.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.350
So it's not this passive system.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.050
It's much more.
