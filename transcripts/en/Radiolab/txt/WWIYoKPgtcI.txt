Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich. And today on our program we're looking at brains and bodies and how sometimes brains and bodies can get wildly out of sync. And let me offer one more flavor on this theme, which has to do with something that neuropsychologist Paul Brocks calls body Schema Body Schema

Speaker 2:          00:19          is the brains sort of working model of the body

Speaker 1:          00:24          in order for the brain to keep track of where you are, where everything is, it creates an inner representation of you. Hmm. This is what he thinks. A model very much in the virtual reality sense of where it thinks you are in space and where it thinks you are.

Speaker 2:          00:40          The point is that we, although we think there's a very solid distinction between where our bodies and in the world begins, in fact, the brain has to work quite hard to produce this kind of consistency of experience. And clearly it can go wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:56          This brings us to pilots. Okay. My name is Dan Folger from I spent 32 years in the Air Force, 25 that an active flying and uh, this incidents occurred in July of 1952 at Luke air force base in Arizona.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Our story begins on a normal training day. It was really hot

Speaker 3:          01:18          in the cockpit, flying down at low level, below 3000 PDFs, over a hundred degrees.

Speaker 1:          01:22          And Colonel Dan full, Jim was on his fifth run, flying in formation, doing a trading maneuver. He'd done it a million times before, but this time something happened. He pulled the plane up hard and rolled out. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:35          The next thing I knew I was,

Speaker 4:          01:39          eh,

Speaker 3:          01:41          you seem to be sitting up on the back of the airplane looking down into the cockpit.

Speaker 5:          01:46          Suddenly he was outside the plane.

Speaker 3:          01:51          I could see what was going on. I could see the ground, I could see it with another airplane. And um,

Speaker 5:          01:58          and when he looked in the cockpit where he was supposed to be, he could see

Speaker 3:          02:04          pilot. I was watching myself not knowing it was me. What's going on here?

Speaker 4:          02:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:11          I'm just going to watch this for a little while.

Speaker 5:          02:13          So he just sat there on the wing of his own plane watching himself

Speaker 3:          02:19          fly the plane and just all of a sudden the curtain snaps nurse. No, it's not a dream. I'm actually, that's me in the cockpit and I'm flying the airplane again. But we began to, to realize it, Luke, that uh, in the eight weeks of training period I was there, we lost nine pallets. They died. Yeah. Wow. And most of them for running into the ground or running into each other in the air or an s or thing. And that's an awful lot of pilot solutions just in training.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Okay. Fast forward. Many years, army engineers are studying this problem and they figured out some stuff about it, not, yeah. And along comes this guy, Jim Winter, Jim Winter, he is his name, the Federal Aviation Administration or medical research program. And he had a radical notion, if we're going to really understand this, I mean, really get to the bottom of this. We have to induce this experience on purpose. Make them go blank. Make them, yeah. Create the conditions that exist in a fighter jet on the ground in a controlled environment so they can study this [inaudible]. His idea was let's put pilots in a centrifuge, big a centrifuge and go to these things at the astronauts. You've got a 50 foot arm that spins around and round and around and on the end of that 50 foot arm does cockpit a cockpit pretend cockpit mocked up to be exactly like what a fighter aircraft might be like with all the controls. They screens the throttle. That's where the pilot sits and gets spun around real fast. I see. So when we put out a call for volunteers, I'm Tim says Deck Commander Says Tech. I met Dr Winter. He was one of the ones that got involved in his research, heroically volunteered to fly the centrifuge and to deliberately knock himself out. Scared pilots don't do scared.

Speaker 6:          04:14          [inaudible] 10 [inaudible] pleasure.

Speaker 7:          04:18          This is a recording from the experiment. The task was to chase this little airplane. So I'd sit there and you'd follow it. And first couple maneuvers would be, you know, three gs g forces as the is the, it's like a, it's like when you're on a roller coaster, five gs that force that pins you back in your seat, seven gs, except really on a roller coaster. You're only ever gonna experience about two gs and then nine gs.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Nothing like these guys. The high g forces herd

Speaker 6:          04:45          the skin on your face, sags, your eyelids sag so low that you can't see out from under him and you end up to tilt your head back to look out from under your own eyelids that are shaking down in front of your face. Meanwhile, yours,

Speaker 1:          04:56          you're tensing all your leg muscles in your abdominal muscles, in your arm muscles as hard.

Speaker 7:          05:00          You can learn to use your body to fight it. And what you do is you tend to every muscle from your toes to your calves,

Speaker 6:          05:06          push it out, push it all the way up, all the way up, okay. And uh, you take a breath, right?

Speaker 1:          05:12          And you start to say the word Hook and you hold it for three seconds and then you finish it off by finishing the k over the hook. So these pilots, they sound like they're wrestling or fighting or something.

Speaker 4:          05:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:31          They're grunting and groaning and

Speaker 4:          05:33          hook

Speaker 1:          05:35          making all these hook noises.

Speaker 4:          05:40          It's like that.

Speaker 1:          05:43          The most you have ever pulled was 12.4 gs. Just to give you a sense of what that might feel like for a pilot, like Tim says, doc who weighs about 200 pounds. Once he makes a 12.4 g turn, his body goes from 200 pounds, two to almost 2,500 pounds. That's like over the weight of a car because of the pressure pushing down on it. Yeah, exactly. More crucially says when re those g forces pull blood blood violently from the brain is pushed from the head down toward the feet and it pools and the abdomen and the lower extremities and when it pools down there, it can't get back up to the brain and that's when the problems start. Does this sound good? No. He, Dr Winter, he documented a particular sequence that happens when blood is pulled from the brain. The first thing you lose is vision. Usually the first thing to go are your eyes and you have what's called gray out or loss of peripheral vision and a, you start getting tunnel vision and then you go through blackout where you can see nothing. You lose your sight and then if you take the acceleration forces a little higher,

Speaker 4:          06:49          you're lose consciousness.

Speaker 7:          06:53          When I woke up, I remember just sitting there and I mean this little white space, I actually had no idea who I was, who am I, where I was, what I was doing, why am I doing it? I'm sitting in this little white ball and I'm looking around and what is this all about? I hear this beeping. There's just quite like BP and then at that moment

Speaker 1:          07:17          I realize

Speaker 7:          07:18          that I'm in a little room and that I'm supposed to do something in that one of the things I'm supposed to do is press that button. Should I press the button and at that moment I realized, holy Macron a pilot. I'm in an airplane and I'm not flying it and I grabbed the controls and then just a giant run.

Speaker 1:          07:39          I'm Tim Sefstadt, Callie macro. I'm Tim Sestak. I'm Tim Jack. I'm a pilot. I'm flying in. The centrifuge all came back to me at once and I was okay.

Speaker 6:          07:49          Okay. Commando says tech. Dr. Bennett, how are you feeling again? I'm like, I can't go home time.

Speaker 1:          07:56          Over the course of 15 years, when are you tested? About 500 pilots in the center view. She recorded their experiences, measured everything he could think of, and he found a few things. First that the average blackout lasted somewhere between 12 and 24 seconds. One second. Yeah, and wild blacked out. This is the interesting thing. Pilots experienced these strange little visions. Ephesians, I'll give you an example of the a individual that that lost consciousness had convulsive movements where he was moving his arms forward and back for about two or three seconds. When he came to, we ask him what had happened. He said, uh, yeah, it was a nice warm day and I was out at the lake fishing.

Speaker 1:          08:42          All of a sudden I could feel like a, I had a about a five pound bass on my line and he was talking and each time he tugged, I haven't pulled back and then all of a sudden I was back in the centrifuge. I Dunno what happened. These little dream lifts wintery thinks this is the brain confused. It's cut off. Meaning think it from the brain's perspective. It's lost the body and yet the body is convulsing. Trying to get blood back up to the brain. Brain has no idea why it's convulsing. It just sees arms flailing about and thinks, well, my arms are jerking back and forth. I must be best fishing. The things that are happening around you frequently get incorporated into those short dreamless. Here's one of his own. It turns out he has tested himself in the centrifuge many times. A little dream that I had.

Speaker 1:          09:26          I was going down the aisle of a grocery store floating, if you will. I don't know that I was on a magic carpet, but I sure wasn't having to walk and I was just really motivated to try to pick up some ice cream. As I was going down the aisle and I was moving down through the, and I could see the freezer. I knew the ice cream was over there. Yeah. And I just could not move my hand over to get it. The next thing I realized was I was trying to turn off the buzzer in the centrifuge with my hand and I could hear it. I could not move it. And then just momentarily I got the ability to have motor control return and I can turn it off.

Speaker 6:          10:13          Yeah. I don't know where I am. Y'All don't know where the hell I am. I thought I was at the grocery store, by the way. The other thing is I couldn't control my arm to get the get the found off either. It's interesting

Speaker 1:          10:29          this recording, you're listening to this from a day when Dr wintery blacked out five times in a row.

Speaker 6:          10:34          I don't remember anything on that one. Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:36          And after that fifth run, which you're about to hear, something weird happened.

Speaker 6:          10:40          Let you take a break. Just a few seconds. Can't you Brad? I don't know about that one. I don't remember starting one last ride coming up. God, I don't know if you can take one more. I'm hesitating because I'm not ready yet. Okay. I'm hesitating because I'm not quite ready yet. Okay. Just let me know whenever you get ready, Ron, relax. Let your blood flow through your brain may be like, okay, I'm ready for that one idea. Okay. Bob Checklist. That istation data station is ready. Operator. Operator is ready. Medical medical is ready. Finally, have you played sort of a final ready? Haven't been activated. Are you ready? Yeah. Yeah, I'm going up this time. Right? I remember going up on that point. Yes. Ron. Greg

Speaker 4:          12:03          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          12:06          the [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          12:14          Yeah, I think that was enough. At the end of that last run, doctor winter, he got off the centrifuge woozy and stumbled down the hall. I was really confused when a, when I got off the centrifusion I was walking down the hall back to my laboratory and all of a sudden I began to realize that uh, I was above and behind myself and I could see somebody who was myself walking down the hall and I said, Oh man, that's unusual. Pilots are generally not new age kind of guys,

Speaker 5:          12:49          but at least 40 of them in wintery study did report what he just described having an out of body experience. We're just still an even smaller sub sub group reported seeing the classic tunnel with white light type thing. All doctor wintery can say is that that last sub sub group, they were the ones who were out the longest. They had the most intense blackouts. He's not ready to draw any conclusions but he does suspect that the dream lists divisions of seeing yourself from above even the tunnel and white lights, it's all part of the same situation. The brain is just confused at having lost the body
