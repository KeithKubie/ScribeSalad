00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.510
- [Instructor] You have a government

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.700
and you also have the
people that are governed,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.260
and in previous videos,
we talked about this idea

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.880
of linkage institutions,
which are institutions

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.910
that connect the government to the people

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.500
and the people to the government

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.490
so people know what's
going on in the government

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.510
and so that the government
knows the preferences

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.570
of the people.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.670
And examples of linkage institutions,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.470
let me just draw an arrow here,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.220
examples of

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.700
linkage institutions

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.450
might be elections where
the people are able

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.210
to communicate their preferences,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.840
parties where that could
obviously influence elections,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.610
but also influence policies.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.080
You have various interest groups,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.523
but what we're gonna focus on
in this video is the media.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.420
Now, there's one pure view of the media

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.910
and sometimes it's
called the fourth estate

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.000
where it has a central role in government,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.070
where the goal is to hold
the government accountable,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.010
to inform the people, to
have this pure objective view

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.300
of what is going on with the government

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.930
and bring it to the people

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.910
and then help the people hold
the government accountable,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.500
and also help the
government know objectively

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.940
what the people are thinking.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.740
And that is an idea that many
in the media may strive for,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.270
but you have to think about,
what are the incentives?

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.400
What makes the media relevant
and how do they exist?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.850
Most media outlets are
for-profit organizations

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.950
and so, let me make a few of these.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.220
Let's say that we have
this one right over here.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.600
I'll call this media outlet one.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.090
Let me do this one right over here,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.823
let's call this media outlet two.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.490
As for-profit organizations,
they need to get revenue

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.530
so they can get their profit somehow,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.220
and for most of them, it
comes through ad revenue.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.960
So, those ad dollars that
are shown during the news

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.540
or during a TV show.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.530
And so, you might guess that,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.330
hey, if I need to get ad revenue,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
advertisers aren't going to
wanna show ads on a station

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.040
that's not getting any viewership,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.873
so they're going to say,

00:02:00.873 --> 00:02:03.510
hey, how do we get maximum viewership?

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.300
One argument might be, hey, we
wanna be the most objective,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.910
high-quality news source,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.270
and that is a strategy
that could be approached,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.070
or they could say, hey,
maybe I could cater

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.920
to certain belief systems,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.040
to, maybe, left-leaning
folks or right-leaning folks.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.430
If you were to say that
this is the distribution

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.020
of people in our
population right over here

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.020
where people on this side lean left

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.290
and then people on the
right side right over here

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.040
lean to the right, and
these are people in between,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.910
there absolutely is a strategy

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.410
where maybe if you are
this media outlet, you say,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.980
hey, I wanna be centrist.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.050
Maybe give equal time,
equal views to either side

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.030
and maybe I get that viewership.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.610
But you could also have a strategy,

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.380
well, what if I wanna
capture all of these folks?

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.150
Well, what they might
wanna hear is something

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.870
that's more critical of the right,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.700
that reinforces their left beliefs

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.370
and so I could cater to that.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.050
Similarly, you might have
something on the right saying,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.510
I could capture all of this audience here

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.610
by helping, to some degree, telling them

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.830
what they want to hear,
and maybe in some level,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.960
reinforcing their beliefs.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.940
But by doing that, I get a large audience

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.160
and I'm able to sell a lot of ads.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.470
It's an interesting
debate whether it is good

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.240
or bad that you have these media outlets

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.690
that might cater to certain ideologies,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.490
but even if they are,
they're still performing

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.500
the role on some level
as a linkage institution.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.520
Because these folks are trying to cater

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.210
and understand what
their viewership wants,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.330
that is a signal to the government that,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.740
okay, at least the demographic

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.600
that watches media station one,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.350
this is the kind of stuff
they're thinking about.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.890
And the demographic that
watches media station two,

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.750
these are the things that
they are thinking about.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.760
So, it does communicate,
in some way, to government,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.660
but you could imagine, almost
every media outlet is trying

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.770
to market that they are
that ideal objective.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.520
And here's an example of that

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.790
where a media outlet is
actually reporting on

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.300
how non-objective other media
outlets are in their opinion

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.240
or perhaps in the
opinion of their viewers.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.060
- Tonight, a fair and balanced examination

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.000
of the mainstream media's bias

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.110
with three glaring new examples.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.890
First up, Donald Trump is firing

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.810
back at the Washington Post after learning

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.820
the paper's devoted an army of 20 staffers

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.603
to dig up dirt on every
nook and cranny of his life.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.560
- [Instructor] Now, another
dimension to appreciate

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.190
how the media, as a linkage institution,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.500
might influence government,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.110
or frankly, might influence
other linkage institutions

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.270
like elections, is how
they report on things.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.440
Remember, they're trying to get viewership

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.020
because the viewership is
what makes the advertisers

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.210
wanna advertise on their media outlets,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.410
and so, to get viewership, one strategy is

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.810
to make things really exciting.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.930
Make it look like a sports competition,

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.930
make it look like a horse race.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.810
And you see this,
especially during elections,

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.840
that oftentimes the focus may
not even be on the substance,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.560
it's really on who's
leading at a given time.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.430
That can sometimes influence the election

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.750
and give that person
extra momentum regardless

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.460
of what their actual positions are.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.860
And here is an example of that.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.660
- Hillary Clinton is extending her lead

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.800
over Donald Trump in
several national polls.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.030
CNN is releasing a
brand new poll of polls,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.680
which is an average of the six

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.000
last surveys and it shows Donald Trump

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.280
trailing Hillary Clinton by 10 points,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.483
so how does he close that gap?

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.680
- [News Anchor] Donald Trump's reached

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.760
new heights in the latest Fox News poll.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.010
With 39% of Republicans nationwide,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.590
he's more than doubling Ted Cruz at 18.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.860
Marco Rubio and Ben
Carson are virtually tied

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.010
for third within the
poll's margin of error.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.760
- [Instructor] So, the media,
definitely a very important

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.400
linkage institution in our society,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.680
but it's really interesting

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.000
to think about the
various incentives for it

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.120
and how that might influence its actions

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.280
as a linkage institution

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.740
and how its motivations might even affect

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.133
other linkage institutions like elections.
