00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.304
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:08.100
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.700
I'm delighted that you're here.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.500
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.100
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.830
and I am very delighted
that you could join us

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.790
for today's conference on
the Politics and the Policies

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.880
of Health Care in
the United States.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.760
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.430
Radcliffe is charged
with a dual mission,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.030
to foster and to share
transformative ideas

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.580
across academic disciplines.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.040
We do this by convening
and supporting

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.520
scholars, scientists,
artists, and professionals

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.740
from around the world
who work together

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.170
on the forefront
of their fields.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.330
And we share their work with
a broad and interested public

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.360
through a full
calendar of events,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.300
including lectures,
performances, conferences,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.240
and exhibitions.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.420
We at Radcliffe are
especially proud of events

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.560
like this one, which cut
across traditional disciplines

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.970
to wrestle with complex
issues of public importance.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.840
To understand the dynamics and
challenges of the US health

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.380
system, we have to
understand the interplay

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.130
of history, politics, economics,
science, and medicine.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.130
Today's distinguished
panelists bring a wide range

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.670
of expertise in these areas,
and I am grateful to them

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.090
for taking the time to be
with us this afternoon.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.990
Our discussion feels
especially important in light

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.960
of the health impact
of natural disasters

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.880
like hurricane
Harvey and hurricane

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.870
Irma, which left hundreds
if not thousands in need

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.290
of urgent medical attention
and could lead to longer

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.770
term public health challenges.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.350
Today's conference also
marks the beginning

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.720
of Radcliffe's two
year initiative

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.220
on citizenship, which is
motivated in part by our desire

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.480
to contextualize the upcoming
100th anniversary of American

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.180
Women's Suffrage in 2020.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.250
This discussion
today is the first

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.310
of many we are planning
over the next two years

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.140
to delve into different aspects
of what citizenship entails,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.370
how it is defined,
and who can claim it.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.030
As today's title suggests,
here in the United States,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.660
citizenship can be
especially complicated,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.160
with benefits and obligations
that vary from one state

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.210
to another.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.030
It really does depend
on what state you're in.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.970
Since the nation's
independence Americans

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.350
have struggled to find and
have often fiercely disagreed

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.040
over the appropriate balance
between federal, state,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.800
and local government.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.340
This tension has broad
implications for policy

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.190
and it has proved
an important factor

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.300
in the intense current
debate over health care.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.270
For much of the 19th
century, United States

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.360
had a relatively weak
central government

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.840
and a more powerful state
and local government.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.870
Geography often
determine people's access

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.230
to public resources and the
extent to which government

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.790
protected individual rights.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.750
In other words, the
benefits of citizenship

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.840
very much depended on where in
the United States you lived.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.790
Beginning with the
progressive movement

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.000
at the turn of the 20th
century, the federal government

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.810
started to take on a
larger role in addressing

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.660
economic and social problems.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.290
Congress passed the Pure
Food and Drug Act in 1906,

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.920
and other new nationwide
standards quickly followed.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.250
The New Deal in the
1930s, the emergence

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.000
of the Cold War security
state after World War II,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.760
and the Great Society
programs of the 1960s,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.700
which for today's
purposes, notably

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.950
created Medicare and Medicaid.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.170
Each marked further expansion of
the federal government's role.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.570
Although states
maintained responsibility

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.200
for implementation of
many federal programs,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.550
uniformity across
state lines increased.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.290
Then, in the early 1970s,
President Richard Nixon's

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.790
"new federalism" began to
reverse the trend by increasing

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.430
state and local control.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.330
New federalism's block grants
gave states broad discretion

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.350
over social spending.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.210
This is particularly relevant
to our discussion today.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.380
For example, earlier this
year several top Republican

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.070
lawmakers, including speaker
of the House Paul Ryan

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.430
articulated a vision
for converting Medicaid

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.700
to a federal block
grant program.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.840
The shift beginning in the
1970s towards dismantling

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.500
federal authority in
favor of state discretion

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.950
did not belong to any
one political party

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.900
in the years since Nixon.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.180
Jimmy Carter did his part.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.480
Ronald Reagan ferociously
attacked federally funded

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.620
programs.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.020
And Bill Clinton's 1996 welfare
reform replaced the New Deal

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.240
era Aid to Families
with Dependent Children

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.130
Program with a Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.690
or the TANF block grants.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.300
The result, for
better or worse, has

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.690
been declining federal
control over the social safety

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.540
net for almost a half century.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.250
And in turn, dramatic variation
in benefits and eligibility

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.730
requirements from
state to state.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.410
These stark differences can be
seen in how each state chooses

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.930
to allocate TANF funds.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.670
South Dakota spends
61% on cash assistance.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.520
Texas spends 7%.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.940
And each state sets
its own lifetime limit

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.620
on TANF benefits.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.040
Here in Massachusetts,
the cap is five years.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.830
In Arizona it is 12 months.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.530
The Affordable
Care Act, which we

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.500
refer to as the
ACA, or Obamacare,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.710
is very much a part
of this history.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.910
When the ACA passed in
2010, it dramatically

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.250
expanded the federal
government's role

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.410
in regulating both
the health insurance

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.120
industry and individual
choices about health coverage.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.520
At the same time,
the ACA's design,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.850
and much of the debate
before and after its launch,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.910
has clearly reflected
deep disagreements

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.990
over the extent of state
versus federal authority, which

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.240
has been a part of
American politics

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.940
since the nation's
establishment.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.650
With all of this
history in mind,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.300
and I am an historian
so I can't think

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.430
about the problem
any other way, I

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.920
look forward to learning
more with you today

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.580
about the debates that are
still swirling around Obamacare

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.200
and the future prospects for
health care in the United

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.510
States.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.690
So to get our afternoon started,
I would now like to hand things

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.540
over to Professor Dan Carpenter.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.840
Dan is the Faculty Director
of the Social Sciences Program

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.600
at the Radcliffe Institute,
the Allie S. Freed Professor

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.330
of Government in the faculty
of Arts and Sciences,

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.420
and the co-organizer with
Professor Janet RichEdwards

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.340
of today's symposium.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.950
Please join me in welcoming
Dan to the podium.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.260
- Thank you Liz, and
welcome everybody

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.020
to the Radcliffe Institute.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.370
It seems just a short
while ago, but so long ago

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.370
that the United States entered
a heated, what at the time

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:01.040
seemed interminable, battle over
what is now known as Obamacare.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.590
Obamacare, the ACA,
seems like a settled

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.989
fact in some discussions,
but it is not.

00:08:06.989 --> 00:08:08.780
And in case you forgot,
here's a few things

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.800
that happened in 2009, 2010.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.990
There was a bill in the
House of Representatives

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.270
that passed that
chamber with what

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.990
was called a public option,
namely the ability of consumers

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.540
to choose a Medicare like
plan as part of their health

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.820
insurance plan menu.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.450
There was the refusal by Senator
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.550
to support that public option.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.770
Which, given his pivotal
status in the Senate

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.820
at the time as the Democratic
Party's 60th coalition voter,

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.970
killed that plan.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.559
There was the passage of a
different Affordable Care Act

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.900
by the US Senate.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.920
There was, as residents of
this state may remember,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.920
the unexpected electoral
victory of Senator Scott

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.960
Brown in January 2010.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.090
Which seemed, at
the time, according

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.570
to many prognosticators,
to kill the whole effort.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.900
There were the efforts
after that by speaker

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.350
Nancy Pelosi to resurrect
the bill that had previously

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.040
passed the Senate in the
House of Representatives,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.220
successfully through the
house, and on to President

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.190
Obama for his signature.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.790
There was the botched
rollout of the ACA website

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.070
by the US federal government.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.170
There were the massive
Republican gains

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.250
in the midterms of 2010.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.350
There was the first
Supreme Court case

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.830
on the ACA, NFIB
versus Sebelius,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.390
which upheld the
law by a thread,

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.600
and which gave states
the right to opt out

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.140
of Medicare expansion.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.170
And then there was a
second, not only the only,

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.680
but a second Supreme Court
case on the ACA, King

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.900
versus Burwell, which,
to put it simply,

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.530
upheld the law's subsidies.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.497
Any one of these hurdles,
and there were many others,

00:09:53.497 --> 00:09:54.580
could have tripped up the.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.560
ACA.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.430
And now we too
easily regard the ACA

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:04.110
as part of a status quo, albeit
admittedly an unsettled one.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.360
Today, the architecture
of the Affordable Care Act

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.870
has done some amazing things, as
we'll hear from our panelists.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.340
The percentage of
American adults

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.500
who lack health insurance
has fallen to historic lows.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.440
Today's symposium will show the
politics of health insurance

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.400
have everything to do with
the ACA's achievements

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.090
and limitations.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.540
Health insurance systems
depend as much, maybe m

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.400
upon political
institutions as they

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.630
do upon market characteristics
and system design.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.740
The ACA is today under
attack on two fronts.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.050
The first is probably
better known.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.540
The day after the
November 2016 election,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.600
I predicted to my students
in a bureaucratic politics

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.050
class at Harvard, that
the ACA would be repealed.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.390
The Republicans
simply had to do it,

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.850
I reasoned, as it had been
their mantra for eight years.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.570
And for now, I am wrong
in that prediction,

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.150
and I hope I remain so.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.300
Yet Repeal and Replace, with
its ever larger estimates

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.220
of those who will
lose health insurance,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.560
may still pass at some level.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.090
And of course, the
federal subsidies

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.639
undergirding
regional marketplaces

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:12.930
are in jeopardy as well from
the decisions of the Trump

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.790
administration.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.410
Today's first
panel will describe

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.080
some of the politics that
went into the ACA, which

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.140
both sustains and
undermines that law,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.370
but there remain often
largely invisible to us.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.200
The other attack on the
status quo, comes if you will,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.020
from the left.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.300
California's ongoing
legislative attempt

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.860
to create a single
payer system has

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.200
gone the furthest in terms
of legislative progress

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.300
toward that end.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.430
And we will hear about that
effort in today's second panel.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.790
And of course, this past
week Senator Bernie Sanders

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.120
of Vermont unveiled his
Medicare for all proposal.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.090
Just as important, an
unexpectedly large number

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.180
of Democrats, including senators
and presidential hopefuls

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.020
for the 2020 contest have
now signed on as co-sponsors

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.180
to Senator Sanders measure.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.010
So much so that some
are describing Medicare

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.380
for All, or another
version of single payer,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.260
as a new litmus test for
the upcoming democratic

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.180
presidential primaries.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.400
We shall see.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.710
There are, it is worth
noting, potential tensions

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.130
between California's plan
and the Sanders' plan.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.560
But clear momentum is
evident for some form

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.950
of universal government
sponsored health insurance.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.960
Today's second panel
will demonstrate

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.270
that alternative
models for health care

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.610
are incredibly
diverse and force us

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.360
to confront immense
tradeoffs and challenges.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.330
Single payer has
no single meaning

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.540
in exactly how it
is designed, which

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.550
means exactly how
it is politically

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:47.300
shaped means everything.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.640
Before turning the panel
over to Dr. Ben Sommers

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.020
I want to thank my co-organizer,
Dr. Janet Rich-Edwards.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.420
Janet is co-director
of the science program

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.130
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.860
She's an associate professor of
medicine at the Harvard Medical

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.800
School, director of
developmental epidemiology

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.920
for the Connors
Center at Women's--

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.600
excuse me, for women's
health and gender biology

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.460
at the Brigham and
Women's Hospital,

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.380
and an associate professor
in the Department

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.520
of Epidemiology at the Harvard
TC Chan School of Public Health

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.790
where she also co-directs
the reproductive perinatal

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.550
and pediatric
epidemiology track.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.710
I've come to know Janet
over the last five years,

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.600
and I learn something
new every time

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.030
we speak, not just
about health and science

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.800
but about professionalism.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.720
Janet, thank you.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.160
I want to thank Dean
Elizabeth Cohen and her staff

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.000
in the dean's office for the
support of this symposium.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.280
I want to thank Rebecca
Wassarman, Sean O'Donnell,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.780
Jennifer Birkett, Kristen
Osborne of Academic Ventures,

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.820
and Jessica Vicklund
and the fantastic events

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.790
team at Radcliffe for
the way they put this on.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.240
Our first panel, Functions and
Dysfunctions of the Affordable

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.510
Care Act, is moderated by
Dr. Benjamin Sommers who

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.590
is Associate Professor of
Health Policy and Economics

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.620
at the Harvard TH Chan
School of Public Health.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.564
Ben?

00:14:04.564 --> 00:14:07.868
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:11.172 --> 00:14:13.052
- Good afternoon.

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.760
I am going to do very
brief introductions

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.870
of my esteemed panel here.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.790
You have the full
bios in your program

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.980
and there's a lot to
read about each of them.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.410
But we're very lucky to be
joined by Andrew Campbell who's

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.390
a Professor of Political
Science at MIT,

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.760
Kate Walsh who's is the
President and CEO of Boston

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.524
Medical Center, and
Georges Benjamin who's

00:14:29.524 --> 00:14:31.690
the Executive Director of
the American Public Health

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:32.860
Association.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.840
And our panel
session topic today

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.594
is Functions and Dysfunctions
of the Affordable Care Act.

00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:39.010
Conveniently that's
basically what

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.660
I've spent the better
part of the last six years

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.212
studying, along
with my colleagues

00:14:42.212 --> 00:14:44.420
at the Harvard School of
Public Health and elsewhere.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.544
And so I thought to lay
the groundwork a little bit

00:14:46.544 --> 00:14:48.460
for the discussion
that will follow,

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.590
I'm going to describe
some of those key findings

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.800
in terms of what is working
and what isn't working.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.410
Dan already mentioned
that the single highest

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.030
item on the list
of what is working

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.196
is that the Affordable Care
Act has been the largest

00:15:00.196 --> 00:15:02.290
expansion of health
insurance in over 50 years

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.900
and has brought the rate of the
uninsured population in the US

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.399
to the lowest it's been since
the federal government started

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:08.394
tracking this number.

00:15:08.394 --> 00:15:10.810
Roughly 20 million Americans
have gained health insurance,

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.880
primarily through
three mechanisms.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.240
One is the expansion of Medicaid
to low income populations

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.730
who traditionally didn't
qualify for Medicaid.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.730
And that's only been adopted in
31 states plus Washington, DC

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.410
since the Supreme Court
made that an option.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.380
There's also the health
insurance marketplaces

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.541
that offer private insurance,
subsidized based on income,

00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:31.540
where people get tax
credits to help them afford

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.460
private insurance
if they don't get

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.000
health insurance through work.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.150
And then finally for young
adults up through age 26

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.430
they're able to stay on
their parents' plans, which

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.830
was not generally available
prior to the Affordable Care

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:42.850
Act.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.210
Now what has that
coverage meant for people?

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.650
In a series of studies
that have been conducted

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.570
using a variety of
data sources, we

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.180
can really get a picture of
what this health insurance

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.190
expansion means for people.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.160
First off when you look at
just broad national trends

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.920
and national surveys, you see
that as coverage has expanded,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.170
fewer Americans have said
they can't get the care they

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.922
need because of affordability.

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:05.380
They can afford
the care they need.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.654
They're more likely to have
a source of primary care.

00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:09.070
They're more likely
to have access

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.900
to medications that they need.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.450
If you look at prescription
claims that are filled,

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.610
we see increases,
particularly in states

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.500
that have expanded
Medicaid, in coverage

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.620
for drugs that are important
for chronic disease management,

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.010
things like diabetes and heart
disease and mental illness.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.340
We also see improvements
in how people feel.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.326
We actually, in
several studies, have

00:16:28.326 --> 00:16:30.700
found that the expansion of
coverage under the Affordable

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.800
Care Act has lead patients
to rate their health

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.156
as having improved.

00:16:34.156 --> 00:16:35.530
And again, the
strongest evidence

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.824
has been from the study
of Medicaid expansion.

00:16:37.824 --> 00:16:40.240
Now why has so much evidence
been produced on the Medicaid

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.230
expansion?

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.610
We have a natural experiment.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.280
Since it is up to each state, we
have 32 examples of expansions

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.867
and 19 nonexpansions.

00:16:47.867 --> 00:16:49.450
And those comparisons
have been really

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.460
valuable in letting
us understand

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.440
what's at stake with
these coverage gains

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.750
and what it means
for people's lives.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.630
Now what hasn't worked as
well-- and I could go on

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.020
much longer about how this
coverage means benefits

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.790
to people's lives.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.754
But in terms of thinking about
the dysfunctions of the ACA,

00:17:05.754 --> 00:17:07.670
there are a couple of
points I'd like to make.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.450
The first is what many of
you have probably heard about

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.780
in the lay media, which is the
notion that the marketplaces

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.819
are not stable and that
they are collapsing--

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.819
as our president often says--

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.609
has a kernel of truth
to it and mostly a lot

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.849
of rhetorical exaggeration.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:26.140
So what we know is that the
marketplaces have generally

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.390
been stable in most
parts of the country.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.100
But there are areas
in the country

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.160
where there are only one or
two insurers participating.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.350
That has implications in
terms of higher premiums,

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.600
and it also means that people
have fewer choices when

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.650
they're shopping.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.240
That doesn't mean that they
don't have any coverage

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.020
options at all.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.450
And to date, even though there
have been some near misses,

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.060
every county has ultimately
been able to offer insurance

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.580
to people on the marketplaces.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.560
Now the coverage gained
through the marketplace

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.502
differs quite a bit
from the coverage people

00:17:52.502 --> 00:17:54.460
get through Medicaid, in
particular in the form

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.930
of higher cost sharing.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.889
The marketplace plans
typically feature deductibles

00:17:58.889 --> 00:18:00.430
that can be several
thousand dollars,

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.800
and the most commonly
chosen type of plan

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.160
is only, by law, supposed
to cover 70% of costs,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.380
meaning people pay
30% out-of-pocket.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.750
Lower income people do
get some subsidies to help

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.289
that become more affordable.

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:14.080
But clearly this still
leaves some barriers

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.160
in affordability
for many people.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.070
And so how do you
square these two pieces

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.070
of what I just told you?

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.611
Well, the first is
talking about what

00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:24.160
has the ACA done compared to
the status quo prior to the law?

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.690
The second is that
there are still

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.540
significant areas of concern
and significant barriers

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.850
for some people under
the Affordable Care Act.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.374
Now even more
notable than the fact

00:18:32.374 --> 00:18:33.790
that some people
who have coverage

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.100
that isn't quite
affordable is we also

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.964
have 3 to 4 million low
income adults in the 19 states

00:18:38.964 --> 00:18:40.630
that have chosen not
to expand Medicaid,

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.340
and they simply have
no affordable option

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.850
for health insurance.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.940
And if you think about
state-by-state variation,

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.481
it's illustrative
to know that if you

00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:51.220
are a single parent in Texas,
your income has to actually

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.060
be under $6,000 a year,
as an approximate,

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.170
to qualify for Medicaid.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.570
If you're earning $7,000 or
$8,000 as a single parent

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.120
you are too rich, in
many cases, for coverage.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.850
If you have no
children in your home,

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.450
it does not matter
how poor you are.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.450
Unless you have a disability,
you won't qualify for Medicaid.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.580
Now beyond the choices
of Medicaid expansion,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.540
the broadest dysfunction
that some people

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.430
view in the Affordable
Care Act is simply

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.500
that even if it had
been fully implemented

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.400
without any challenges in the
courts and any state level

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.280
opposition, there still would
have been an estimated 20 to 25

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.571
million people without health
insurance when it was all

00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:25.230
said and done.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.250
The ACA was never intended
as a universal coverage bill.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.980
You might argue that that was
not a dysfunction of the ACA

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.840
but a dysfunction of
the political system

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.000
or the realities of what
the political system was

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.890
able to produce given,
as Dan described,

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.732
how many near-death experiences
even this law went through.

00:19:39.732 --> 00:19:41.690
But that's where I think
the debate has shifted

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.450
on the left in recent
months, which is not simply

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.540
trying to improve the ACA but
looking at the 20 to 30 million

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.580
who don't really have
any prospect for coverage

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.690
even with a more
stable marketplace

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.512
and even if we can coax more
states into expanding Medicaid.

00:19:54.512 --> 00:19:56.720
So I look forward to discussing
these in more detail.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.830
And now I'm going
to turn it over

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.900
to the first of our
panelists, Dr. Campbell.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.732
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.304
- Well good afternoon everyone.

00:20:08.304 --> 00:20:09.720
I'm delighted to
be on this panel.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.095
And many thanks
to the organizers

00:20:11.095 --> 00:20:13.520
for inviting me and thanks
to the Radcliffe leadership

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.590
and all the many people
it takes to put together

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.930
an event like this.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.150
As the political
scientist on the panel,

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.270
I wish to focus on the theme of
citizenship, part of the larger

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.070
initiative that
Radcliffe is undertaking

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.590
for the next couple of
years, and in particular

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:31.100
how public policies,
including the ACA,

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.120
shape citizenship for Americans
and their ability, desire,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.980
and likelihood that
they'll participate

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.040
in American governance,
because participation

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.070
is one of our fundamental duties
as citizens in a democracy.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.060
So I'll talk today about the
political effects of the ACA

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.979
and the threats to the ACA.

00:20:48.979 --> 00:20:51.020
And in doing so, we're
going to take a brief walk

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.200
through some political science,
brief only, and then talk

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.870
about the implications
of the ACA.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.780
And in doing so I'm going
to use the lens of policy

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.000
feedbacks, which
is a perspective

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.880
within political science
that sees public policies

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.560
not just as the outcomes
of political processes

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.450
but also as inputs.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.540
That is that existing
public policies

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.510
change the political environment
through their effects

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.080
on budgets, through their
effects on ideas about what

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.830
good policy is, what
appears to work or not work,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.050
through their effects
on interest groups--

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.020
some interest groups are
elevated by public policies

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.410
or by a particular policy
while others are sidelined--

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.240
and what I'll focus
on today which

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.690
are policies' effects
on ordinary citizens,

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.550
because policies affect
people's views about government

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.480
and how effective it is and what
role it should play in society,

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.340
and because policies
affect individuals

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.440
likelihood of participation
and their likelihood

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.440
of participating in the face of
threat as we saw this summer.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.640
So what drives
political participation?

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.690
Well people are more likely
to vote, contact elected

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.170
officials, work on
campaigns, protest,

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.290
go to town hall meetings,
make contributions

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.340
when they want to, when
they're interested in doing so,

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.250
and when someone has
asked them to do so.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.470
That is, do they have
enough resources to get over

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.740
the many humps and
hurdles in our society

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.780
to political participation?

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.960
Are they engaged enough in
politics to make that effort?

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.880
And are they mobilized
to participate?

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.520
And public policies can shape
all three of these factors--

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.640
resources, engagement,
and mobilization.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.300
But whether policies have
these participatory effects

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.060
and whether those effects
are positive or negative

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.320
depends on several factors.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.830
The level of
resources they convey,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.220
are they significant to get
people over those hurdles

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.660
to participation?

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.100
Do they provide enough
financial security

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.040
so that people can
engage in politics, which

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.460
is really a luxury activity?

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.580
The visibility of
government effort--

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.950
can you even tell that you're
in a government program?

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.210
Some programs are more
submerged or hidden than others.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.100
There's also the
issue of the messages

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.100
that policy designs
send to citizens.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.020
Are recipients of
public policies or those

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.730
on the receiving
end, are they treated

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.720
respectfully and fairly, or
are they stigmatized or subject

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.420
to gatekeeping and to scrutiny?

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.180
And are there any entities
or information channels

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.330
that are mobilizing people
around a policy area?

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.550
Or perhaps in some
cases could a policy

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.760
be so important to people's
well-being they can, in a way,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.190
self-mobilize?

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.520
So let's consider the
politics of health reform,

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.320
the Affordable
Care Act, in light

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.360
of these policy feedbacks.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.340
We saw this repeal
and replace effort,

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.950
in particular the Republican's
American Health Care

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.520
Act of 2017, this
summer was defeated.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.940
We saw a groundswell of
political participation,

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.570
of grassroots activity, which
exerted considerable pressure

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.670
and played a major
role in pushing back

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.590
against this repeal effort.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:08.290
So what elements
of the ACA may have

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.690
helped spur this
participation, and what

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.420
are the prospects
for ACA's survival?

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.610
Because as Dan noted,
it's an open question.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.700
So it's not at all
clear from the outset

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.550
the ACA would have enhanced
political participation

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.600
among the population.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.090
First of all, as
you know, the ACA

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:30.790
was not all that popular
until the repeal effort.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.887
It was hovering under
a 50% approval rating.

00:24:33.887 --> 00:24:35.470
It was not at all
clear that Americans

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.240
would rise to defend it.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.190
Supporters of the
law had always hoped

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.200
that as people
experienced the benefits,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.510
they would become
more supportive.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.840
But many beneficiaries felt
that health insurance was still

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.780
too expensive, even
after the reform.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.990
Those people who had
employer-based insurance

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.200
had a tendency to attribute
problems or premium increases

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.470
in their insurance to the
ACA, with varying degrees

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.520
of justification.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.790
So there are some design
elements of the ACA

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.760
that might enhance
participation.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.862
Many of the benefits in the
ACA went to the middle class,

00:25:09.862 --> 00:25:12.070
people who are more likely
to participate in politics

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.250
who traditionally have more
voice than, say, lower income

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.610
citizens.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.080
So for example, the subsidies
for those purchasing health

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.170
plans on the marketplaces,
those subsidies

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.780
went far into the
middle class, up to 400%

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.450
of the poverty level,
which is around $88,000

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.880
for a family of four.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.040
The dependent care
provision, the provision

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.740
that allows children to stay on
their parents' health insurance

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:39.220
until age 26, that too is a
big help to the middle class

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.780
and affluent, the
kinds of people who

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.050
are most likely to have the
employer-based insurance

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.690
to put their kids on.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.210
The ban on preexisting
condition exclusions--

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.610
well that's a boon to
people of all income levels.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.440
About a quarter of
Americans have some kind

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.880
of preexisting condition.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.340
And preexisting conditions
tend not to recognize

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.560
the boundaries of income.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.500
And other regulations, such as
the list of essential health

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.880
benefits, also helps everyone.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.045
So there are quite a few
provisions in the ACA

00:26:07.045 --> 00:26:08.920
that were benefiting
people who traditionally

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.950
have relatively more voice
in the political system,

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.080
middle class people,
upper income people,

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.060
more so than lower
income citizens.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.160
On the other hand, there
were aspects of the ACA

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.340
that might serve to undermine
political participation

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:30.746
or at least not boost it, either
because these provisions helped

00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:33.120
groups that traditionally
participate in politics at very

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.640
low rates or because
they were provisions that

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.680
were pretty hidden from view.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.680
So much of ACA's insurance
expansion, as you know,

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.960
operated through the
expansion of Medicaid.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.720
But of course, it's
been mentioned,

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.460
19 states decided not
to expand Medicaid.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.510
And so that didn't boost the
pool of potential defenders

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.880
in that there.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.340
Also, much of
Medicaid, including

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.910
those who are newly eligible,
many of the aspects of it

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.410
were pretty hidden.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:07.000
So some states, in an effort
in part to reduce stigma,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.060
call their Medicaid program
something other than Medicaid.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.330
Even here in Massachusetts,
it's MassHealth, right?

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.190
In Oregon, there's the
Oregon Health Plan.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.260
In Tennessee, there's TennCare.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.170
A number of states have
these alternative names.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:23.770
And studies show that in those
states with alternative names

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:26.500
to Medicaid, there is
in fact less stigma

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.270
associated with Medicaid.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:32.470
But also, people are less likely
to recognize their in Medicaid.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.750
They're in something else.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.060
Another element
of program design

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.300
is that most states these
days require most Medicaid

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.015
recipients to be in
a managed care plan

00:27:43.015 --> 00:27:46.150
in order to minimize costs,
you know, an HMO, PPO,

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.110
some kind of managed care.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.810
So sometimes you get
an insurance card

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.880
that still says Medicaid on it.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.470
But often you get
an insurance card

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.140
that has the managed
care plan's name.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.510
And there again,
studies show that people

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.330
with these insurance cards
that don't mention Medicaid

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.820
are less likely to know
that they're in Medicaid.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.710
And they also
participate in politics

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.300
at lower rates than
people in states

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.760
where Medicaid insurance
cards still say Medicaid.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.060
Another sort of
hidden aspect of ACA--

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.250
think about the
under 26 provision.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.380
Well, that helps the
middle class, as I noted.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.350
But young people themselves
tend to vote and participate

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.510
in politics at pretty low rates.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.850
And work by political scientist
Jacqueline [INAUDIBLE],,

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.820
who got here PhD from here
in the Government department,

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.300
shows that young people
who were newly covered,

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.670
newly got insurance
under this provision,

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.890
were no more likely to
participate in politics

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:41.020
afterwards than those who hadn't
been covered by this provision

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.230
or themselves earlier in life.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.300
So we had these sort
of two sets of factors,

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.990
some that might
enhance participation,

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.700
some that might
undermine participation

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.110
or at least not boost it.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.970
It's not clear at
all what the balance

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.180
would be regarding the ACA.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.680
So far what we've found--

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.790
well, some scientists
have compared counties,

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.680
comparing counties
at state borders

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.320
where one side of
the border, the state

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.060
expanded Medicaid,
and the other side,

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.710
the state did not
expand Medicaid.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.600
But otherwise, those residents,
the local economy, et cetera,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.000
is very, very similar.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.250
And they found a
mild positive effect,

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:21.270
that those people on the
Medicaid expansion side

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.720
were voting, doing voter turnout
at slightly higher rates.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.210
And the effects were largest
in the poorest counties.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.600
So that's a positive
effect of ACA.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.180
On the other hand, we also
know that ACA, as noted,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.670
often provided health insurance
to low participation groups

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.380
or in a hidden way.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.260
And there was a really
heartbreaking story by Sarah

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.340
Kliff, the wonderful health
expert reporter, on Vox,

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.300
talking about Kentucky and its
health care exchange, kynect,

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:52.290
K-Y-N-E-C-T. So Kentucky had
a very high uninsurance rate

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.580
before the ACA.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.120
It's the state that had the
biggest decline in uninsurance,

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.740
because of kynect and
vigorous outreach efforts.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.907
But those outreach efforts--

00:30:02.907 --> 00:30:04.865
you know, this is a state
where a lot of people

00:30:04.865 --> 00:30:06.390
are skeptical about government.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.480
And when some people considering
signing up for insurance

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:15.150
would approach navigators, they
would say, is this Obamacare?

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.660
And the navigators would
say, no, no, it's kynect.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.765
And then when the
law is threatened,

00:30:20.765 --> 00:30:22.140
the same people
would say, oh, we

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.940
don't have to worry
about Obamacare repeal

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.130
because we're in kynect.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.535
So there are downsides to hiding
the origin of these things.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:35.060
Then came the Republicans
repeal effort.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:40.750
And there's few forces with
as much mobilizing potential

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.470
as threat.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.570
Psychologists have told
us about the asymmetry

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.830
of gains and losses.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.320
It's very hard to take
something away from people.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.030
People value losses more
than equal sized gains.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:57.230
And with the threat of repeal,
the popularity of the ACA

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.280
finally rose.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.070
It broke 50% for the first time.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.200
People turned out at
town hall meetings,

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.960
called congressional officers,
in general raised hell

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.080
and helped push back
the repeal effort.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.620
And in threatening repeal,
Republicans essentially

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.160
succeeded in making
the invisible visible,

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.120
two things in particular.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.170
Much of the ACA works
through regulations.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.870
Think about the list of 10
essential health benefits.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.840
It's hard to appreciate that you
now have coverage for something

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.881
that you didn't know you
didn't have coverage for

00:31:28.881 --> 00:31:33.980
before until it's
going to be taken away.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.710
Medicaid-- Republicans
have wanted for decades

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.260
to end the Medicaid entitlement.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.120
Medicaid is jointly
funded by the states

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.249
and the federal government.

00:31:43.249 --> 00:31:45.290
The federal government
sends its matching dollars

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.080
to cover all the people
that states deem eligible.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.387
Republicans hate this.

00:31:50.387 --> 00:31:52.220
And I think it's because
in their proposals,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.110
they have a serious
misconception about who

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.300
is in Medicaid.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.420
And the repeal threat
brought to the fore

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.580
all these groups that
remind us there's

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.984
lots of people in
Medicaid who are not

00:32:03.984 --> 00:32:05.900
the people the Republicans
are thinking about.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.483
The republicans are
thinking that, oh,

00:32:07.483 --> 00:32:10.190
a lot of people in Medicaid
could, if they wanted to,

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.102
go out and get a job with
employer-provided insurance.

00:32:13.102 --> 00:32:14.810
Not so easy, because
some of those people

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:16.100
literally can't work.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.725
And there are many
parts of the country

00:32:17.725 --> 00:32:19.895
where it's hard to get a
job with health insurance.

00:32:19.895 --> 00:32:21.520
When the threat came
along this summer,

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.190
we heard from all these
other groups within Medicaid,

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.970
families with disabled elders,
former middle class people who

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:30.440
had run through
all their resources

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.230
and now need Medicaid to pay
their nursing home or home

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.140
health care, even
more potent, parents

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.290
of disabled children, physically
or cognitively disabled

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.200
children who are in Medicaid,
again, a lot of middle class

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.300
people who can't otherwise
afford their children's

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:48.720
incredibly expensive care,
families of people seeking

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.450
opioid addiction
treatment, again oftentimes

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.510
middle class families who faced
a tragedy for which Medicaid

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.829
is a crucially important pair.

00:32:56.829 --> 00:32:59.370
And all of these people would
be harmed by Republican efforts

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.770
to turn Medicaid
into a capped program

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.910
and strip out $800
billion in funding.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:06.870
And who were the protesters--

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.000
I'm happy to say-- at
Radcliffe Institute?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.250
As Theda Skocpol has
pointed out, in many cases,

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.510
it was women who organized and
rose up to fight the appeal,

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:19.260
because women are still
disproportionately health care

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.390
decision makers
in many families.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.940
They tend to be the
caretakers in families.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:29.080
And they're very aware of the
toll that repeal would impose.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.630
So I'll just close
with a few observations

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:34.060
about prospects for the future.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.220
The fight is far from over.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.270
And now what concerns me is that
the current attacks on the ACA

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:44.020
are not the visible repeal
attacks from Congress.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.930
They're the invisible
administrative attacks

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.930
from within the executive
branch, the defunding

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:53.710
of navigators, the cessation
of advertising for those who

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.230
might newly sign up this fall.

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.330
They're sowing doubt
and uncertainty

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:01.430
so insurers will pull
out of marketplaces.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.670
And my concern is
that the citizens who

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:08.830
mobilized against the visible
repeal efforts this summer

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:11.770
won't recognize or
know about or be

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.710
aware of these other
more insidious kinds

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:19.550
of administrative actions that
will be just as effective.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.684
So that's what I'm really
concerned about now,

00:34:21.684 --> 00:34:23.350
is the nature of the
current dismantling

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.210
being much more hidden
and not resulting

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:28.840
in action among the public.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.820
And then the very last
little normative comment

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.300
I can't resist since someone
brought up federalism.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.670
I have a lot of colleagues
who study social policy

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:37.750
in other countries.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.659
And they cannot believe that
in the United States you would

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:44.650
have an uninsurance rate of
4% in Massachusetts and--

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:48.889
well, now it's-- 18% in
Texas for the under 65 group.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:51.010
So think about all the
people in this room.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.469
A couple of hundred
people, right?

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:55.780
Only 4%, 4 out of
100 of you would

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.640
be without insurance
in Massachusetts.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.260
In Texas, it's one out of every
five people, you, and you,

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:02.860
and you.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.740
I mean, it's a lot of people.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.830
What could such variation
possibly achieve?

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.330
It raises a lot of questions
in our federal system, which is

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:14.930
very useful in many, many ways.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:18.400
But this kind of variation,
is it responsive?

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.840
Is it effective?

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.980
Is it moral?

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.710
So I will leave you
with those thoughts

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.920
and look forward to my
fellow panelists' comments.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.708
Thank you.

00:35:25.708 --> 00:35:28.696
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:34.174 --> 00:35:35.170
- Hi, everyone.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:35.670
Thank you.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.070
It's so interesting to hear
about what you do every day

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.840
through a different lens.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.964
I really enjoyed your talk.

00:35:39.964 --> 00:35:41.300
Thank you, Andrea.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.587
So I'd like to talk a
little bit about citizenship

00:35:43.587 --> 00:35:45.170
from the standpoint
of an institution,

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.990
or institutional citizenship,
and talk a little bit

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:53.150
about what I think of as sector
or health industry citizenship,

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.760
particularly as it relates
to the Medicaid program.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.320
We've talked a lot
about expansion.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.230
But just know that the biggest
part of the expansion--

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.810
I think some of the speakers
have highlighted this--

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.250
has been in the Medicaid
program across our country.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.970
So I'm going to focus on
that, and from the standpoint

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.260
of our organization, which
is Boston Medical Center.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.520
I will do a brief
introduction, I

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.440
promise, talk a little bit
about this sector obligation,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.880
tell you a little
bit about where

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.910
I'm hopeful about how health
care reform and Medicaid

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.592
reform in Massachusetts
can benefit

00:36:25.592 --> 00:36:27.800
not only our institution,
but the patients that we're

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.750
privileged to serve,
and why I think

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.820
we can be successful at this.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.350
So I promise a
brief infomercial.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:34.880
But we're in a very
historic place,

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.180
and I thought I'd chat a
little bit about our hospital.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.480
We were formed about 20 years
ago, a little longer than that,

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.942
by the merger of what was then
Boston City Hospital, which

00:36:43.942 --> 00:36:46.400
had had a long and distinguished
history-- it's been around

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.100
since before the Civil War.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.950
I like to say to people, from
President Lincoln to President

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.925
Trump, our organization's
had the same basic problem.

00:36:54.925 --> 00:37:00.210
And the Historians
like that joke, OK?

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:03.470
And we were formed by a
merger of what was then

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:06.050
Boston City, as I said, and
University Hospital, which

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:09.530
was the Boston University School
of Medicine's primary teaching

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.550
affiliate.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.880
It was spun off to form
a separate 501(c)(3),

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.150
like any other charitable
not-for-profit hospital you

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.070
might know of in
the Commonwealth.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.307
Sometimes people still think
of us as City Hospital.

00:37:21.307 --> 00:37:23.390
I'm here to tell you, Uber
drivers and cab drivers

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:24.710
think of us as City Hospital.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.870
But in fact, we're just
like everybody else.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.630
I think we are unique
in that we were created

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:30.980
through enabling legislation.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.810
And you can see at the
bottom of the slide

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.340
that it talks about BMC.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.400
It was to be the centerpiece
of the city's public health

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.180
network.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.554
And I'd like to
think that that's

00:37:39.554 --> 00:37:42.590
a very prescient and
important part of our mission,

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.140
because you'll see we're
evolving towards that as we

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.144
move forward.

00:37:46.144 --> 00:37:47.810
This is a picture of
our hospital today.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.930
You can see that we've kept
some of the older buildings

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.784
that were around in 1864
or shortly thereafter

00:37:53.784 --> 00:37:55.700
and built a new cancer
center-- is what you're

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.950
looking at in front of us.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:58.880
Our mission is clear.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.362
We provide exceptional
care without exception.

00:38:01.362 --> 00:38:03.070
We're very proud to
support that mission.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.944
I'll tell you a little
more about that later.

00:38:04.944 --> 00:38:07.100
And our vision is
"to make Boston

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.670
the healthiest urban population
in the world by the year 2030."

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.250
We've really shifted
our focus from dealing

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:16.490
with the episode of illness
to the health of the community

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.390
we serve.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:20.090
That is to me
institutional citizenship.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:21.420
I hope it works.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.180
I hope I'm around to
talk about in 2030,

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.700
probably won't be, at
least in this role.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.221
But that's kind of how
we're thinking about it.

00:38:28.221 --> 00:38:29.720
Just a little bit
about the numbers,

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.140
because this is a bold vision--

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.750
how do you think
we can get there?

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.200
We're a large hospital.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.450
We take care of lot of people.

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.790
We do over a million
ambulatory visits a year.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.970
We're kind of known for trauma,
and are the largest provider

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.380
of trauma in the region.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.810
We're very proud to be
associated with 14 community

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:48.020
health centers that are across
Boston in the neighborhoods

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.730
that we serve.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:52.060
We are the third
largest health system

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.050
in Massachusetts, which
always surprises me

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:57.680
when I say that, because we are
not the third richest health

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.412
center or health system
in Massachusetts.

00:39:00.412 --> 00:39:02.120
And one thing you
might not know about us

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.060
is that we own and operate a
Medicaid insurance plan that

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.530
brings peace of mind
and access to patients,

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:12.030
to our members in Massachusetts
and now New Hampshire.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.180
So we're on the
Obamacare exchanges.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:18.530
And we've been very active in
the Medicaid expansion space.

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.060
We disproportionately
serve low income patients

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.110
70% of our patients are
underserved or underrepresented

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.310
minorities.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.137
30% of our patients
don't speak English

00:39:27.137 --> 00:39:28.220
as their primary language.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.470
That number's on the increase.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:34.100
We do about 200,000
translator-assisted medical

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.140
encounters every year.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.180
And half of our patients
are eligible for Medicaid,

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.480
which means that they're at
the federal poverty limit.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.110
About 79% of our revenue
comes from government sources.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.240
So we kind of have
to get this right.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.257
Reform is kind of our work.

00:39:51.257 --> 00:39:53.090
You know, health care
is really complicated.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.210
And I could really
literally bore you to death

00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:02.240
up here all day with all of the
arcane nuances of how we get

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.530
paid and where the money goes.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.905
But one of the things I'm very
proud about Boston Medical

00:40:05.905 --> 00:40:08.750
Center is that we've really
come up with practical solutions

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.330
to really complicated problems.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.970
About 15 years ago, a
third of our patients

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.100
were screening positive
in the pediatric emergency

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.090
room for food insecurity.

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:18.590
Why?

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:19.970
Because we asked.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:20.970
What did we do about it?

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:21.678
We got them food.

00:40:21.678 --> 00:40:24.300
So we set up what we call
a therapeutic food pantry.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:29.120
Your doctor or nurse, if
you identify food insecurity

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.280
in your home, can write
you a prescription

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.240
for a three-day
emergency supply of food.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.450
It provides.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:36.290
It's for your household.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.780
You know, it addresses the
kind of episodic hunger

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:39.954
we see in this country.

00:40:39.954 --> 00:40:41.870
Your benefits run out
at the end of the month.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:44.119
Your uncle loses his job and
is sleeping on the couch.

00:40:44.119 --> 00:40:46.700
The food dollar
doesn't stretch as far.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.160
We started serving 500
families, moms, and kids.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:53.960
We now serve 7,000 people every
month a million pounds of food.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.020
And it's a prescription.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.603
It's in your electronic
health record.

00:40:56.603 --> 00:40:58.520
So when you come
to see the doctor,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.982
he or she knows that you've--

00:40:59.982 --> 00:41:01.940
you know, here's your
prescription for insulin.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.040
Here's your
prescription for food.

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:07.389
We know in the food pantry
about your dietary restrictions.

00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:08.930
And we also know
when you don't come,

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.450
which is particularly
important to frail, elders,

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.800
people who are too proud.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.100
And we've added to this a--

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.124
it reduces some of
the stigma around--

00:41:18.124 --> 00:41:19.790
you know, you have
to swallow your pride

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.150
to go to a food pantry.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.645
And we've made this a real
focus of the work we do.

00:41:24.645 --> 00:41:26.270
I'll talk a little
bit later about some

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:27.186
of our other programs.

00:41:27.186 --> 00:41:30.380
But one I love to talk about
is our Jump Rope Clinic.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.970
So a lot of kids in
our pediatric practices

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.350
are at risk for
childhood obesity.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:40.420
It's kind of
becoming an epidemic.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.470
And a lot of the moms
say, look, but I don't

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:43.720
want my kid going out to play.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.910
The neighborhood's not safe.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.076
So we give them a jump rope.

00:41:46.076 --> 00:41:46.910
It costs $0.79.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.746
And before they leave, we time
how many times you can jump.

00:41:49.746 --> 00:41:51.620
And then we call back
a couple of days later,

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.510
say, hey, how are you
doing with that jump rope?

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.390
I mean, it's not going
to solve the problem.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:58.340
But it's these kind
of practical solutions

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.070
that I think represent
institutional citizenship.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.750
I wish I could say
these were my ideas.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:03.249
They're not.

00:42:03.249 --> 00:42:04.730
I just get to talk about them.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.590
But I think that if
as organizations we

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.620
embrace our challenges
and our responsibilities,

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:16.226
I think we'll be
better citizens.

00:42:16.226 --> 00:42:17.990
Addictions is probably
the best example.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.660
BMC sadly cares for lots of
people who are struggling

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.320
with substance use disorders.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.840
We also are
celebrating recovery.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.690
We are challenging
ourselves not only

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.180
to expand the kind of
programs that we deliver,

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.580
but also to be a
better employer.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.320
Think about the
challenge when somebody

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.910
who has been in recovery
relapses, comes back to work,

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.872
and they're taking care
of patients for their job.

00:42:40.872 --> 00:42:42.580
What's-- Yeah, I'm
getting a lot of nods.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.130
I don't have to fill
in the blanks there.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:45.280
What's our responsibility?

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.020
Also, we're a health plan.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.640
What do we cover?

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.217
So it's great for
me to say, hey,

00:42:50.217 --> 00:42:52.050
we have all these
programs for our patients.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:55.750
But what are we doing
as an organization?

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:56.420
I'll skip that.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.470
But it basically proves that
addiction treatments are

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.260
good investments
and that they work

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.150
and that they save health
care dollars, which

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.880
could be available to actually
provide additional treatment.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.040
Because we know this
epidemic isn't going away.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:15.010
So this has kind of become
one of my favorite things

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.590
to talk about, which is
really why the health care

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.590
industry has to embrace
the Medicaid program.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.890
And I'll tell you, we don't
as hospital executives or even

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:26.830
health plan executives do
a very good job of that.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.620
And just to let
you know, Medicaid

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.260
is the most important
insurance plan,

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.300
I would submit, in
our country today.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.460
It covers more
than half the kids,

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.090
more than half the births, and
pays for 70% of long-term care

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:41.090
treatments.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.620
So we have got to get over
our ambivalence about this.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.990
And I often joke that
fee-for-service Medicaid

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:48.330
is no way to make a living.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:52.150
And I can get as frustrated
as any hospital executive

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:56.410
you'll meet about the challenges
of living within the Medicaid

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:57.550
payment envelope.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.080
But increasingly,
I think there's

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.380
so much opportunity for us to--

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.160
and we have such an
intergenerational

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.080
responsibility to--
get this program right,

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.750
that it's our obligation as
health leaders to save it.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.304
So that's my close.

00:44:10.304 --> 00:44:11.470
I'll close with that homily.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:14.732
But it's really--
and if you think

00:44:14.732 --> 00:44:16.690
about the challenges
around the Affordable Care

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.580
Act and the
challenges to access,

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.570
if we could get Medicaid
right, and we could afford it,

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.610
think about the
disparities in our country

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.820
that it would help erase.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.844
So if you think about trying
to get Medicaid right--

00:44:29.844 --> 00:44:31.760
I'm going to shift a
little bit to this state,

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.100
to the state of Massachusetts.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.280
But before I do that,
I'll highlight the fact

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.340
that many states are looking
at changes to their Medicaid

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:39.880
program.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.600
And several are adopting a
shift to accountable care

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.900
organizations.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:49.090
So what this does is it attempts
to, in the simplest of terms,

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:51.604
align the incentives between
the payers, the people who

00:44:51.604 --> 00:44:53.770
are paying for health care,
which is often the state

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.600
government, and the
providers, people

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.600
like the folks at our hospital,
and puts all of those dollars

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.300
at risk in one pot that the
health care system controls.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.300
It's going to be a very
interesting journey here

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.950
in Massachusetts.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.980
We're just starting
on that, where

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:14.050
we are converting to an
all-risk Medicaid ACO

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:15.470
in March of next year.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:18.100
So stay tuned.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.370
But the early returns from
other hospitals or, I'm sorry,

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:24.430
from other states, are
promising, in that there have

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.930
been some savings identified.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:30.050
So I'm looking forward to our
role in being part of that.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.890
So let me take a minute on how
our health system is preparing

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.640
for this change and why I
think I like our chances.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.611
As you've heard, there
are many, many people

00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:40.360
in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts-- one

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:44.230
in four people in this room,
if the statistics hold,

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.904
are-- covered by MassHealth.

00:45:45.904 --> 00:45:48.070
You stand in line at the
grocery store behind people

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.330
who are covered by MassHealth.

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.760
1.8 million people
in Massachusetts

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.180
are covered by MassHealth,
or the Medicaid program

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.721
as I've learned I
should call it now.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.760
And that's great because
it's great coverage.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.470
It's a wonderful insurance plan.

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.370
But it's 40% of
the state budget.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:07.150
If you look at state
spending, health is up.

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:09.800
Every other category, education,
public transportation,

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.500
public safety, is down.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.200
Medicaid can't eat the
Massachusetts state budget.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.750
And we are a well-off state
here in this Commonwealth.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:19.240
So we've got to figure
out collectively

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.420
how to reduce the spend in that
program, get people healthy,

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.110
keep them well, do it at a price
point the state can afford.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:29.890
So MassHealth his investing
in these accountable care

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:30.760
organizations.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.000
They are focusing on making sure
that we do this in a way that

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.460
improves patients' experience.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.350
This is not only a cost play.

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:41.330
We will be as successful
in this program if we meet

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:46.960
their quality metrics as if
we meet the cost threshold--

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.450
although obviously
we have to do both--

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:51.820
strengthening the relationship
between the primary care

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.850
doctor and the patient,
not in the gatekeeper way

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.680
of managed care in
the '80s and '90s,

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.137
but much more in
an integrated way.

00:47:00.137 --> 00:47:02.470
And I talk a little about
clinically integrated provider

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:04.090
networks on the next bullet.

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:07.570
And then finally, we
have to as an industry

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.860
learn that the body
does not stop here,

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:16.290
that integrating behavioral
health into physical health

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.210
will, I think, be the key
in unlocking our ability

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:22.360
to reduce suffering,
reduce costs,

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.480
and making
communities healthier.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.010
So why do I like our chances?

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:30.340
Because I really like the
place I work, I guess.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.920
I think the key is going
to be a rigorous focus

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.750
on the social
determinants of health.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.430
This is the talk of the day.

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.140
Everybody talks about it.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.640
We've been doing
this for decades.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.430
I'll give you one.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:42.440
I talked about the food pantry.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.900
We've put a small portion
of our balance sheet

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.960
to work on transitional
housing through a REIT that

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.720
will help us get transitional
and assisted housing

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.251
into the neighborhoods we serve.

00:47:52.251 --> 00:47:54.500
And I'll tell you one story
about financial stability,

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:55.690
because I'm so proud of it.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.370
Two of our a pediatric
residents realized

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:00.270
that many of the
families they served

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:02.720
were missing
opportunities provided

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.850
to them through the
Earned Income Tax Credit.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:06.620
And they said,
wouldn't it be great

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.660
if we could have
accountants help

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.490
our families do their
taxes while the kids are

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.380
being seen at the clinic?

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:20.360
And great idea-- they're not
giving the money to H&amp;R Block

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.931
or any of those other places.

00:48:21.931 --> 00:48:23.180
I didn't mean to pick on them.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.540
Well, they started the program
with the unfortunate hashtag,

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.840
"see the doc, get
cash," which is illegal.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.402
So after we took down
the Twitter handle

00:48:37.402 --> 00:48:39.860
and straightened things out
and resuscitated the compliance

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:44.870
people, that
program has returned

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.345
over the last two years
over a million dollars

00:48:47.345 --> 00:48:51.020
into the communities we serve,
including many BMC employees

00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.460
who were eligible for this.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:56.420
Two residents, two citizens,
had a really good idea.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.800
And they were able to do it.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.500
That just-- I mean, I have
chills talking to you about it

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.180
because that to
me is citizenship.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.870
And that's what's
going to save us.

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:07.580
So I'm very proud of this.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:11.540
We decided-- we've worked really
hard on our energy initiatives.

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.910
And we're going to be totally
carbon neutral by 2020, which

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:16.110
I got to knock wood on that.

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:19.580
But I think we're close, through
a long, complicated story which

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.380
I'll spare you.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.880
But one of the things we did
was-- you know, one of the ways

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.000
to cool buildings is to
put a garden on the top.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.559
And we were going to put just
kind of a pretty flower garden.

00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:29.850
But no one was going to see it.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:31.490
And somebody--
again, I think it was

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:32.990
the assistant of
the guy who runs

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:35.990
our facilities program--
said, what if we do a farm?

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:38.964
So we have a farm on the
roof of our power plant.

00:49:38.964 --> 00:49:40.880
Each of those little--
well, you can't see it,

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.910
but it's in-- milk crates is
going to produce 50-- it will,

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:46.280
has produced this
summer 15,000 pounds

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.490
of food for the patients
and families we serve.

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:51.150
It's unbelievable.

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:52.970
There's 100,000 bees
up there, so don't

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:54.440
visit if you have an allergy.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.790
But it's really just
a remarkable story.

00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:59.784
Somebody had an idea.

00:49:59.784 --> 00:50:00.950
We figured out how to do it.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:02.480
It's great.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.070
The farm's a great start.

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:07.100
But I think the real
challenge here--

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:10.340
and I think we will get
this right as citizens--

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.440
if we can really focus
on health equity.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.250
It's great to be
in Massachusetts.

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.520
We're in a state that has
built a little square box

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.510
for everybody.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:20.810
Pretty much everyone has access
to health care in the state.

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:23.270
I'm very proud to work
at an organization that

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:25.360
will build you another
box if you need it,

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.950
if this metaphor
works, to see the game.

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:30.770
But I think that our
challenges in health care

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:33.350
will be solved when
nobody needs a box.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.975
Thank you very
much for your time.

00:50:34.975 --> 00:50:37.885
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.315
- Well, thank you very much.

00:50:48.315 --> 00:50:49.990
I'm going to just
build on the fact

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:51.906
that some of the comments
you've heard earlier

00:50:51.906 --> 00:50:54.730
about what role of government
is, because I've always--

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:55.825
I often get asked that.

00:50:55.825 --> 00:50:57.700
Why does government want
to intervene at all?

00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:59.283
Why is this the
government's business?

00:50:59.283 --> 00:51:03.819
Why can't the private sector
take care of all of this stuff?

00:51:03.819 --> 00:51:05.860
And I have often said they
are really for reasons

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.318
that government intervenes,
obviously the safety and public

00:51:08.318 --> 00:51:12.730
welfare of its citizens, when
moral or ethical issues are

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.820
involved, obviously politics.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.610
You know, governments are
political institutions,

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:20.540
so politics plays a role.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.520
But also when you have a
market failure, you know,

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.500
that's why we
intervened in the banks.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.510
And I would make the
argument that the reason

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:35.410
we went to the
Affordable Care Act

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:38.000
was because we had failure
in all four of these areas.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.420
The government
needed to intervene.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:45.100
And that's why health
reform was essential.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.050
Also the point is that
we now know of course

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:49.255
that we don't get the best value
for our health care dollar.

00:51:49.255 --> 00:51:51.296
I expect everybody in this
room has at some point

00:51:51.296 --> 00:51:53.945
seen this particular graphic.

00:51:53.945 --> 00:51:55.570
But if you think
about it, it basically

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:58.210
means that we pay
almost twice as much

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:01.500
as the other industrialized
nations and we die sooner.

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:07.710
The Commonwealth Fund
just recently pointed out

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:10.770
four core reasons why we
have these differences

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:13.890
than other nations, the fact
that we're the only nation that

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.050
doesn't have universal
coverage of all our citizens

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.120
for health care, the
fact that we spend

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.800
a lot more of our
focus on the treatment

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:23.400
side than the prevention
side, that we spend

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:30.330
a lot more on things other
than our social determinants,

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:33.330
and the fact that we have one
of the most complex systems

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:36.660
in the world, both for
the delivery of care

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:40.820
as well as the
financing of that care.

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.280
I remember when I was
Secretary of Health in Maryland

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.912
the amount of time we spent
measuring the transferring

00:52:47.912 --> 00:52:50.120
from the left pocket to the
right pocket for Medicaid

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.060
and Medicare, just trying to
balance those and making sure

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.010
that we were doing it right.

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:58.680
We also as a nation
spend much less

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.220
on social services
versus health.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.340
And so if you just look at
our social services and health

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:09.720
budgets, there's an
enormous imbalance there.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:12.277
And people always ask, where
can the money come from?

00:53:12.277 --> 00:53:13.860
Well, obviously if
you do a lot better

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.318
on the health side
of the equation,

00:53:15.318 --> 00:53:19.260
you have a lot more money
for social services.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.810
Now, the ACA was designed
to properly address

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:23.070
these five things.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.500
Expand coverage.

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.659
Try to move this system
up towards prevention.

00:53:28.659 --> 00:53:31.200
To some degree, do some things
about the social determinants.

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.390
And I'm going to talk
a bit about that.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:35.400
Reform the delivery
and the payment system

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:39.450
to try to make it simpler, so
that we simply are not only

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:43.404
paying for volume, but we are
actually paying for quality,

00:53:43.404 --> 00:53:44.820
and ultimately,
to make it cheaper

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:50.360
for both the whole system as a
whole as well as individuals.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:53.550
Ultimately, the goal of course
is to improve health outcomes.

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:56.480
Now, clearly access to care
is very important, right?

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.750
We're in an
insurance-based system.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:02.300
You have to have a get
into the system card.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:05.120
We often hear from
people who believe

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.640
that the fact that we have
emergency departments--

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.426
that you have
universal health care

00:54:09.426 --> 00:54:10.550
with emergency departments.

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:13.670
My first half of my career was
practicing emergency medicine.

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.310
I can assure you that
emergency departments

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:18.530
don't give a universal
access to care at 3 o'clock

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.900
in the morning.

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:24.050
There has never been a
person that I referred

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:27.500
that the first question as part
of that referral discussion

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:31.382
wasn't what insurance does
that patient have, OK?

00:54:31.382 --> 00:54:33.590
The other thing about
emergency departments of course

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:36.320
is that while we can fix you and
make you better than you ever

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.460
were before--

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.840
we're really good at that--

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.050
emergency departments
don't take care

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:44.780
of the things that
actually really impact

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.790
our health or our
health care spending.

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:48.710
We don't manage a
little bit of high blood

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:52.592
pressure, a little bit
of high blood sugar.

00:54:52.592 --> 00:54:53.300
We don't do that.

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.890
A little bit of obesity,
that doesn't get

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:56.306
fixed in the
emergency department.

00:54:56.306 --> 00:54:59.521
That only gets fixed with
comprehensive primary health

00:54:59.521 --> 00:55:00.020
care.

00:55:03.886 --> 00:55:06.010
You know, the whole issue
of paying for performance

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:08.290
is very, very important.

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:10.190
And you know, that's
very much at threat now.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:12.790
There is a lot of regulations
being changed that actually

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:14.560
undermine that right now.

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.104
We need to address that.

00:55:16.104 --> 00:55:17.770
I would also argue
that of course health

00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:19.955
is much more than health care.

00:55:19.955 --> 00:55:22.330
That's the social determinants
that we always talk about.

00:55:24.827 --> 00:55:26.660
But I think the more
important manifestation

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:28.940
of that is your zip
code fundamentally

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.810
determines your access to
a whole range of things.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:37.280
Now, we see this, right?

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:42.970
In every town in our country,
there is a railroad track.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:45.170
And on one side of
the railroad track,

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:49.250
the population does better
than people on the other side

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.630
of the railroad track.

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:52.430
Or it's a Main Street.

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:54.200
Everybody has one of those.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.790
And that same dynamic applies.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:02.280
It's a fascinating phenomena.

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:06.840
But it dramatically
determines your health.

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:10.530
And there's all kinds of
reasons that we have systems

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:12.610
that we've designed this way.

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:14.250
But we really designed
our communities

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:18.660
in many ways for failure
for some crazy reasons.

00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:20.570
The ACA was actually designed--

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:22.280
and we hear a lot
about coverage.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.150
And so as Executive
Director of APHA,

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:27.720
I have to talk about population
health and prevention.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.600
So we're going to just talk
a fair amount about what

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.990
was in there that people just
don't talk a great deal about.

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:36.510
There was a lot of stuff
around clinical prevention,

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.660
the first dollar insurance
coverage, clinical preventive

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.940
services as essential
health benefit,

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.360
much emphasis on improved
disease management,

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.940
some real enhancements to
the primary care system,

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:51.510
to try to move our system
upstream, including

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:53.640
actually paying at least--

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.210
although it expired-- primary
care providers Medicare rates,

00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:00.980
to try get them engaged
more into the system,

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.230
and some things that ultimately
are in the legislation

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.850
but they weren't funded,
like a workforce board

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:10.110
to look at the rebalancing
of our workforce.

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:13.370
Things like that are
very, very important.

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:15.710
And there are some things
about community prevention,

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:18.410
the National Prevention
Council and Strategy.

00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:20.150
That was headed by
the Surgeon General.

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:23.420
That actually was enhancing
our nation's ability

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.840
to work across silos, not
just at the federal level,

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.250
but also that was trickling
down to the local level.

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:33.890
The Community Preventive Health
Task Force and their work

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:35.259
research was funded.

00:57:35.259 --> 00:57:36.800
So that task force
could do its work,

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:41.150
improve the evidence base for
community-based interventions.

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:44.030
The community health
needs assessments

00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:47.010
that hospitals are now
required to do-- in fact,

00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:49.850
enhanced enforcement
by the IRS was

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:53.104
essential to try to
make that happen.

00:57:53.104 --> 00:57:55.520
And there are a whole range
of health education activities

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.061
like menu labeling
and things that we

00:57:57.061 --> 00:58:01.255
can do to enhance patients'
engagement in their own health,

00:58:01.255 --> 00:58:03.380
and some things that were
fundamental around health

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:03.950
equity.

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:06.782
You know, you can't do
what you don't measure.

00:58:06.782 --> 00:58:08.990
You don't know what happened
if you don't measure it.

00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:11.300
So measuring health
equity, acquiring data

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:15.860
collection, targeted programs
on health equity like the REACH

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:19.064
program, were funded
out of this grant,

00:58:19.064 --> 00:58:20.480
even though those
programs existed

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.940
before there was an
enhancement on trying to get

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:25.740
those programs up and running.

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.230
The Public Health
and Prevention Fund,

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:30.880
which was supposed to be
ultimately a $2 billion

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.797
investment in public health
and prevention innovation--

00:58:34.797 --> 00:58:37.130
public health has obviously
been chronically underfunded

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:38.660
for many years.

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:41.510
Only 3% of our health
care dollar goes there.

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:47.810
But it's been under attack since
it first came out, crazy, stuff

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:50.390
crazy arguments as
to why we should not

00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:52.500
do this kind of
preventive health stuff.

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.550
The one that's
most obvious to me

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:57.680
is the argument
that we shouldn't

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:00.470
build safe places
for kids to play

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.900
and that that wasn't a good
use of health care dollars.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.800
It's the most
amazing thing to me.

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.160
The data is real
clear that children

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.550
in organized, structured
play do better physically,

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:12.770
have better mental health,
and get in trouble less.

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:16.400
It's just amazing.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.350
But they're still
trying to remove this.

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:21.170
Every bill gets passed,
they put in a measure

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:22.970
to try to get rid of
the prevention fund.

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:25.900
So it's still at political risk.

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:27.770
And the whole idea
of building systems

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:31.176
across sectors to
improve health--

00:59:31.176 --> 00:59:33.549
so I'm going to give you
my idea of how to do that.

00:59:33.549 --> 00:59:35.090
So this says, you
think about asthma,

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:37.607
a common clinical scenario.

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:39.440
Asthma is a common
environmentally sensitive

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.496
disease.

00:59:40.496 --> 00:59:41.870
Minorities are
disproportionately

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:42.890
impacted by this.

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:46.670
It is a significant barrier
to school attendance.

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.235
Dental is the other big barrier.

00:59:49.235 --> 00:59:51.110
And if you really want
to understand the root

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:54.830
causes of this, you can really
address both clinical aspects

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:58.280
and social determinants
and craft broad solutions,

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.430
if you really understand what's
happening in the community.

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:09.110
So put your epidemiology hats
on for a moment and your disease

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.360
detective hats,
and imagine a day

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.940
in which we have 10 kids who
all go into a hospital emergency

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.100
department on the same day.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.812
And these kids all go
to the same school.

01:00:22.812 --> 01:00:24.770
And they're out of school
because they're sick.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:27.260
And they're sick enough of
course to go to the hospital.

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.600
But no individual hospital
is going to pick this up,

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.930
because the numbers
are so small.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:37.880
Now, if this was measles or
some other infectious disease,

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.960
the health department
would be all over this,

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.210
because we have a system for
collecting that and doing

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:46.754
the surveillance and then doing
the disease management, case

01:00:46.754 --> 01:00:48.170
finding, et cetera,
to address it.

01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:49.940
But we don't do that
for chronic diseases.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.960
But this was an acute
chronic disease.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.510
So imagine that we did this
on this particular day.

01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:59.600
And you know, the health
department picked it up.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.190
The private
hospitals reported it

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:04.160
in through their
various data systems.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.230
The school knew that
they had 10 kids out

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:07.430
because they had 10
kids out of school,

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.750
and they knew they were
out because of asthma

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.640
because they had a
school health program

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.090
and the nurses there knew that
the kids were out for asthma.

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:18.290
And so we do the classic
epidemiological assessment

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:20.690
of this school.

01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:23.452
The public health
department is notified.

01:01:23.452 --> 01:01:24.660
They look at where they live.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.000
They look at their
insurance coverage.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.130
They go to their homes.

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:29.150
They do all the
kind of stuff we do.

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:34.640
We try to understand why
these kids may indeed

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.207
had acute asthma attacks
and that particular day.

01:01:38.207 --> 01:01:40.290
And of course, what they
find is that all the kids

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:41.880
ride the same school bus.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.290
The school bus has a broken
tailpipe, broken tailpipe,

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:46.860
noxious fumes.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:51.490
Asthma sensitive kids
all get asthma attacks

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:53.560
and end up in the hospital.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.989
So who's the hero of the day?

01:01:54.989 --> 01:01:57.280
Well, I would love to be able
to have the public health

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.212
system take credit for that.

01:01:59.212 --> 01:02:01.170
We should take a little
bit of credit for that.

01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:04.810
But the actual hero of the day
is the bus mechanic, right?

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.300
The bus mechanic goes up
and fixes all the tailpipes,

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.920
inspects all the
other bus tailpipes.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.170
And you find lots of them
broken because they have not

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.372
being properly maintained.

01:02:12.372 --> 01:02:14.830
And if you're really good, you
do all the other maintenance

01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:18.100
work that needed to
be found, et cetera.

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.560
But now you have
a system where you

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.219
had across sectors, the school
system, the private hospital,

01:02:24.219 --> 01:02:26.260
the public health, and
the transportation system,

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:30.010
all work together, ultimately
reducing emergency department

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:33.130
visits, saving dollars,
improving health,

01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:36.130
reducing school
absenteeism, theoretically

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:38.350
improving school performance.

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:40.060
And of course, the
transportation system

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.710
is much safer.

01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:46.820
The ACA is actually designed
to craft systems like that

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:55.300
by funding outcomes
over quantity

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:59.730
and trying to build a
comprehensive system to address

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:04.710
our health, looking at having
the hospitals and others look

01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.960
at what the needs of
the community are.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.770
We want to put systems in place
that look something like that,

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:13.600
to try to ultimately
improve community health,

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.620
and measure what we do and
hold ourselves accountable,

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.720
and not just hold the
health system accountable,

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.910
but hold everybody accountable
for the community's health.

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:25.940
And you've heard a lot
about the outcomes.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.960
And I'll just give you my
short list of those outcomes.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.500
And these numbers are before
the recent census numbers,

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.950
which show that the numbers
aer even lower than that today.

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:40.354
But you are seeing reductions
in morbidity and mortality,

01:03:40.354 --> 01:03:41.520
depending on where you live.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.050
You're seeing improvements
in 30-day readmission rates.

01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:49.130
You're seeing marked improvement
in preventive health services.

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:50.480
Costs are down all over.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.350
Yes, I understand that there
are costs up in some areas.

01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:58.942
I also chuckle when I
hear where they're at,

01:03:58.942 --> 01:04:01.400
because in most cases, these
are places where they have not

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.937
expanded Medicaid and not
paid any regulatory attention

01:04:05.937 --> 01:04:06.770
on the cost of care.

01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:08.520
And many of those
places only had one plan

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.250
to begin with before
the Affordable Care

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:12.990
Act was put in place.

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:15.980
And we're seeing improvements
in our community funding

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.560
and activities from
these various grant

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.530
programs that we've had,
which was spun out of activity

01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:23.360
from the Affordable Care Act.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.690
So where do we go from here?

01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:31.750
Again, taking the Commonwealth
Fund's four big buckets,

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:34.670
the fundamental goal of
course is achieving coverage

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:37.700
for everyone in our
country, again markedly

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.610
moving our system up
to do more prevention,

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:44.100
addressing more and more the
social supports in our country,

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.110
whether it's funding or
linking those systems

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:48.230
or redesigning
them in many ways.

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:50.250
And at the very least--

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.280
and we're to have a
discussion in the next panel

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.330
about alternative models--

01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:56.750
we've got to simplify the
system in service delivery.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:59.090
I mean, we spend more
money making sure

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:02.900
that we reconcile
accounts between buckets

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:07.645
of money each and every
day, which absolutely

01:05:07.645 --> 01:05:08.270
makes no sense.

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:12.600
And by the way, nobody else does
that in the rest of the world.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.130
And then politically, the
short term strategy of course

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:17.520
is we hope the ACA
is dead for now.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.800
I just read something
today about this new bill

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.680
they've put in place.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.310
They think they might be
able to get to 50 votes.

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:27.070
We'll do everything we can
to keep that from happening.

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:29.160
But at the end of the
day, after the end

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.300
of this month, and
the fiscal capacity

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:37.104
to move a bill through
reconciliation goes away,

01:05:37.104 --> 01:05:39.270
we're hoping that people
will roll up their sleeves,

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:41.810
buckle down, and come up with
some bipartisan solutions

01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.710
to first stabilize
the exchanges and then

01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:46.877
move on to improve coverage.

01:05:46.877 --> 01:05:48.960
And of course, I'm always
interested in protecting

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.360
the prevention fund.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.240
Fundamentally as a culture,
we need to create health

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.380
as a shared value.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.290
And that's the fundamental
problem we have.

01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:01.099
Health is not a shared
value until we get sick

01:06:01.099 --> 01:06:02.140
or a loved one gets sick.

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.613
Thank you.

01:06:03.613 --> 01:06:06.559
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:13.274 --> 01:06:14.690
- So we have a
little bit of time.

01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:17.220
We're going have a discussion up
here with members of the panel.

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:19.890
And I have a couple of questions
I want to pose to our panel.

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:23.960
And then we'll open it up for
questions from the audience.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.770
My first question/comment
comes from several

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:29.870
of the remarks made,
that all of you

01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:32.720
addressed Medicaid, which
is an area that I have spent

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.280
a lot of my time working on.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.350
And there is a clear
disconnect between the way

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:43.720
that policy elites and political
circles talk about Medicaid.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.864
You hear White House
spokesman say, this is broken,

01:06:45.864 --> 01:06:47.780
no one in the program
gets the care they need.

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.390
You hear senators who
basically routinely assume

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:52.450
that the program is broken.

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:53.134
And you hear--

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:55.550
I will say anytime I write
anything for a medical audience

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:58.509
that touches on Medicaid, I
get guaranteed angry e-mails

01:06:58.509 --> 01:07:00.050
the next day from
doctors who tell me

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:01.760
how terrible the program is.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.859
But when you talk to patients,
it's actually quite popular.

01:07:04.859 --> 01:07:06.650
And in some surveys,
it's even more popular

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:07.580
than private insurance.

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.288
But generally, it gets
very high ratings.

01:07:09.288 --> 01:07:12.030
And the studies are that the
overall care in the program

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:13.850
is quite good.

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:15.170
So how do we reconcile this?

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:18.650
And what does that imply for the
political mobilization related

01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:22.130
to Medicaid, that there is this
big disconnect between those

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:25.730
running the system and
those living in it?

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:27.070
- Can I just-- is this on?

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:27.930
Is this on?

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:28.550
I can't tell.

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:29.050
- Yeah.

01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:29.870
- Yes.

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:31.328
As a political
scientist, I'll just

01:07:31.328 --> 01:07:35.282
say that I think it's because
those lawmakers infrequently

01:07:35.282 --> 01:07:37.490
hear from the people who
are actually in the program.

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:39.140
And so they don't hear
the firsthand accounts of,

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:41.510
Medicare is actually quite
comprehensive insurance

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:43.100
in many places,
covers many things

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.820
that Medicare and private
health insurance don't cover.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.710
And access is pretty good.

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:51.500
Access does vary across states.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.230
The higher the reimbursements
are to providers in a state,

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:57.360
the easier it is for
citizens to gain access.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.740
But I think it's a matter
of just those folks who are

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.930
in Medicaid don't--

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:04.610
you know, they have
very little voice.

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:06.200
You just don't hear from them.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.230
And people assume that if
it's a government program,

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:12.242
it must be a bad program, which
is part of our sort of distrust

01:08:12.242 --> 01:08:13.700
of government in
the United States,

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.550
which is obviously a theme
that undergirds so much

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.625
of American politics.

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.000
- The only thing
I would add is--

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.833
you alluded to it in
your opening comments--

01:08:21.833 --> 01:08:22.430
it's payment.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:25.279
So if Medicaid's paying
$0.64 on the dollar,

01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:27.590
it gets up to about $0.75
on the dollar for us

01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:30.620
after supplemental
funds, the money stuff.

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.760
But I think the--

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.340
that's why kind of
I'm on this kick

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.250
off issuing this call to action
to save the program, because I

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.960
think the subtraction
experiment,

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.120
if you take away those
services and if kids--

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.040
if we have even more
disparities in health and birth

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.040
outcomes in this country,
if we don't care for--

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.920
the fastest growing population
group in this country

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.560
is-- people over the
age of 85, most of whom

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.170
are getting the services they
need through the Medicaid, not

01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:59.689
the Medicare program, because
Medicare will pay for you

01:08:59.689 --> 01:09:02.386
to have neurosurgery
but no one will

01:09:02.386 --> 01:09:04.010
help you go to the
grocery store-- that

01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:06.359
would be a Medicaid payment.

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:09.590
So I think the
challenge really is

01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:13.220
how we're seen as-- how we're
reimbursed for those services

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:14.890
compared to other programs.

01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:16.771
So I think it is an
intergenerational

01:09:16.771 --> 01:09:18.229
responsibility that
we've got here.

01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:20.600
And I think as health leaders
we have to embrace it,

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.667
that it's not going away.

01:09:21.667 --> 01:09:23.750
And we should really
understand the good it can do

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.374
and the [INAUDIBLE]
and the flexibility

01:09:25.374 --> 01:09:28.130
it provides us, if the
states would participate.

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.724
Massachusetts is
pretty good at that.

01:09:29.724 --> 01:09:31.140
- You know, at the
end of the day,

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.729
I always remind you, like any
other thing, as a physician,

01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:36.979
I respect my
colleagues and believe

01:09:36.979 --> 01:09:41.380
that they went to medical school
and do what they do in order

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.350
to take care of people.

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:45.140
But at the end of the
day, follow the money.

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.819
Medicaid just doesn't pay.

01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:51.108
It's just not the best
player in most cases.

01:09:51.108 --> 01:09:52.640
- It's the worst.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.299
- Well, it depends.

01:09:54.299 --> 01:09:56.090
In Maryland, which has
an all-payer system,

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:59.250
Medicaid pays exactly the
same as Blue Cross Blue

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:00.542
Shield for hospitals.

01:10:00.542 --> 01:10:02.000
It does not do that
for physicians.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.170
Although we're moving in
that direction, by the way.

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:08.030
But it is a poor payer.

01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.530
And the more
interesting thing to me

01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:11.280
is when a governor
tells me, well, doctors

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.820
won't participate in the
program, well it turns out

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:15.960
the solution is all in
the governor's hands.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.740
All the governor has to do
is raise provider rates.

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.920
And the way to do it
initially, and also

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.080
meet what I talked about
in moving to primary care,

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.450
is raise provider
rates from Medicaid

01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:30.350
to Medicare rates
for primary care.

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.740
And it's relatively
inexpensive to do that.

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.211
And that would, I would
argue, be the first step.

01:10:36.211 --> 01:10:37.710
So you've got to
pay providers more.

01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:39.140
The second thing, of
course, is the challenge

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.840
of taking care of patients
who have all these other life

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.230
challenges.

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:47.390
And yeah, some of
those patients, they

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.260
miss appointments.

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:51.110
They come in late.

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:52.700
I don't want to
stereotype anybody,

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:56.244
but that's the view of
some of these providers.

01:10:56.244 --> 01:10:58.160
They view them as
disruptive to their practice

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.410
in a variety of ways.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:03.620
But to me that means that if
you, like any other business,

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:09.014
have a large population of
clients, customers that require

01:11:09.014 --> 01:11:10.430
certain other
things, you may want

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:12.555
to think about restructuring
your practice in a way

01:11:12.555 --> 01:11:14.160
to manage them.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.560
And the state can also
help with that process,

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.810
as can the medical societies.

01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:22.160
- In terms of
federalism, I think

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.100
this is an area that is
particularly interesting

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:26.765
to look at from the
state perspective

01:11:26.765 --> 01:11:29.300
that Ms. Walsh was mentioning.

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.240
When we look at the current
dynamic between the states

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.030
and the federal
government, those

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:39.590
who are feeling that federalism
is a system maybe that is not

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:42.200
providing value to us in
terms of policy returns,

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.330
probably five years ago might
have felt the opposite, right?

01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:46.790
So what is the
value in federalism

01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:47.780
when you're in a
state that wants

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.279
to do something quite different
than the federal government?

01:11:50.279 --> 01:11:52.787
As we see now, living in
Massachusetts under Republican

01:11:52.787 --> 01:11:55.370
Party control in Washington is
quite different than five years

01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:59.690
ago, when most of
the state had voted

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.320
for the candidate in office.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.537
So I'm interested in your
thoughts on how federalism

01:12:03.537 --> 01:12:05.870
might in some ways actually
be the saving grace for some

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:08.244
of the programs we're talking
about in the current policy

01:12:08.244 --> 01:12:08.840
context.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.489
- Right.

01:12:09.489 --> 01:12:11.780
Federalism-- can't live with
it, can't live without it.

01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:17.580
So as I said, it's the promise
and peril of state variation,

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:18.080
right?

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:21.500
So on the one hand, the
wonderful thing about variation

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:25.160
is that when there are
differences in preferences

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.290
over the role and
scope of government,

01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:31.520
you can have different levels
of services in different states.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.530
And what's interesting
about federalism

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:36.980
is that traditionally,
it's been conservatives

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.140
who wanted local
or state control

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.420
and liberals who
wanted federal control.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.940
But it turns out that those
ideological positions are not

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:45.060
static.

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:49.730
It depends on who controls those
different levels of government.

01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:51.380
So that's one thing.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.420
One trend I'm concerned
about in federalism

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:57.560
is that we see a lot of what's
called preemption, which

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.172
is within states you have--

01:13:00.172 --> 01:13:01.880
well, obviously, we
have state variation,

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.800
which we've been talking about
today vis-a-vis the health care

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:04.700
system.

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:07.100
What we also see is
variation within states.

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.590
And so you'll have
cities carrying out

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:13.310
policies that are different
than what the larger state would

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:16.070
carry out, minimum
wage for example,

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:18.470
or paid sick leaves in cities.

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:22.430
And what's happening is that
state governments are engaging

01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:26.090
in preemption, passing laws that
then say, cities in this state

01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:28.374
can no longer their
own minimum wage laws.

01:13:28.374 --> 01:13:30.290
And sometimes we also
have federal preemption,

01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:33.020
the federal government saying
states can't do their own thing

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:34.800
in a variety of policy areas.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.480
And so for those who celebrate
the variation that federalism

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.390
can afford, this
preemption movement

01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:45.950
is undercutting
federalism in ways

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:51.370
that are not favorable
to tailoring programs

01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:55.720
to public opinion and
public preferences.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.580
- I think I'd quote
my esteemed colleague.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:58.830
I think it's follow the money.

01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:01.975
We have to ask
ourselves as Americans

01:14:01.975 --> 01:14:04.600
why the federal government feels
compelled through the Medicare

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.590
program to basically cover
the costs of care for seniors,

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:11.680
but does not feel compelled to
cover the costs for low income

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.190
people.

01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.036
They split it with the state.

01:14:14.036 --> 01:14:15.160
I don't know whether that--

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.150
I wasn't actively involved in
policy discussions in 1965,

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:20.360
I'm happy to report.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.760
But I think the--

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.160
so I don't know
the answer there.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.290
But I think it does
come down to funding.

01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:29.266
I'll take your comment about
preemption one step further.

01:14:29.266 --> 01:14:30.640
There are often
dollars that come

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.220
into a state that are
designated for Medicaid,

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.810
and then they go to
the general fund.

01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:36.490
That's the story of
Connecticut, which

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:39.310
you would think of as a
relatively affluent state.

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:41.710
But the facts are they
are close to bankruptcy

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:46.000
and are using FMAP,
monies intended

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.590
to match Medicaid health care
expenses, for just general fund

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:52.060
purposes, to keep
the state afloat.

01:14:55.190 --> 01:15:00.210
- You know, it's funny.

01:15:00.210 --> 01:15:03.480
I would argue that
as a national policy,

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.170
we should make sure that
everyone is covered and has

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:08.294
access to health care.

01:15:08.294 --> 01:15:10.710
And when I talked about creating
health as a shared value,

01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:13.440
that's what I mean.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.270
It starts with that.

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:17.190
And then everything
else is derivative.

01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:20.550
You know, yeah, you could
devolve all the dollars

01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:24.210
through the states, but
you'd have to trust them.

01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:28.320
And their track record so
far is that some states have

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.900
done amazing things,
because they've

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.660
adopted that as a
principle, and other states

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.590
have used it to do
non-health things with it.

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:39.990
And it doesn't matter whether
it's health care financing

01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:43.380
dollars or tobacco
settlement dollars, right?

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.102
I remember when the tobacco
settlement dollars came in,

01:15:46.102 --> 01:15:48.060
some of the more progressive
states that really

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.580
were concerned about
tobacco spend their dollars

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:53.140
on tobacco programs and
other health programs.

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:57.030
Others gave them to
the tobacco industry.

01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:58.420
It's just the most
amazing thing.

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:02.160
And you know, it's a value
of how those dollars are

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.000
going to be spent.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.364
And it's unfortunate.

01:16:06.364 --> 01:16:07.780
- My last question,
and then we're

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:09.290
going to open up
to the audience.

01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:10.760
And we'll start, Dr.
Benjamin, at your side

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.343
and work our way
back to Dr. Campbell,

01:16:12.343 --> 01:16:14.030
so you don't always
have to go last.

01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:17.224
This is the issue of
prevention efforts

01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:18.890
that are population
health-oriented, not

01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:22.010
health care-focused and
social services-focused.

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:23.460
How do you build mobilizations?

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.459
And we have a leader of
a national organization.

01:16:25.459 --> 01:16:27.380
We have a leader of a
very large, important

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.790
local organization.

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:30.740
And you're both
pointing our attention

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:33.140
to population health,
social services.

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:36.830
How do you get that sort
of mobilization and support

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:39.707
and political energy going for
those causes in the same way

01:16:39.707 --> 01:16:42.290
that we saw people rising up in
the last 12 months and saying,

01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:44.470
don't take away my
health insurance?

01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:46.790
- Yeah, it's more
difficult, because you

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:51.689
know preventing something
that didn't happen is tough.

01:16:51.689 --> 01:16:53.480
But I think one of the
things we have to do

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:57.140
is we have to do a better
job of grabbing the cases

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:01.040
when something does
happen and point it out.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:07.030
So Beaumont, Texas, they cannot
turn the spigot and get clean

01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:08.320
water.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.200
Well, you know, that's a
terrible thing from the storm.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.710
But frankly, we haven't
either made a big deal

01:17:14.710 --> 01:17:17.530
and pointed out the fact that
they lost a public health

01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:18.527
service.

01:17:18.527 --> 01:17:20.110
People have trouble
understanding what

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:21.400
a public health service is.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.100
A public health service is
when you can't turn the spigot

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:26.320
and you don't get
clean water, or when

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.050
you have something like
what happened in Flint

01:17:29.050 --> 01:17:30.902
with the lead in the water.

01:17:30.902 --> 01:17:32.860
And we've got to do a
better job of making sure

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:37.360
that people understand
that those services come

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.470
from good public health work and
a better understanding of what

01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:45.480
population health is, and
getting everyone involved.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:51.040
And the more you build across
sectors, it will be helpful.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.110
One example is that we
know that the business

01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:54.970
community, for
example, is trying

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:58.550
to figure out where they
want to put new businesses,

01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:59.710
new factories.

01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:01.480
And so they're
beginning to think

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:04.150
about putting those
things in fundamentally

01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:07.840
healthy communities, because of
the cost of their health care

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.217
to their health care
costs in the companies.

01:18:10.217 --> 01:18:11.800
And so they're looking
for surrogates.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:14.420
And it turns out one of the
surrogates that they use--

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:15.700
some companies have used--

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:19.750
is the percent of
obesity in the community,

01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:22.804
you know, because of all of
the outgoing costs on that.

01:18:22.804 --> 01:18:24.220
So the business
community gets it.

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.600
We just need to do a
better job of getting

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.558
other people to get it.

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:34.980
- I would add that I think this
is a challenging responsibility

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:38.220
for our organization
in terms of thinking

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:41.380
about where do our
responsibilities begin and end.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:43.320
You know, I use the
example all the time.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:46.050
Somebody falls in a pothole
on Dorchester Avenue

01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:47.220
and breaks their hip.

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.900
They come to our emergency room.

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.550
We decide they
need an operation.

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:52.510
Not to be graphic, we
take their clothes off.

01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:54.300
We put them on a
cold, hard table.

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:55.210
We paralyze them.

01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:56.100
We put them to sleep.

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.020
We jam a steel rod in their hip.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.170
We wake them up, and
they go upstairs.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.510
They learn how to walk
again, and they go home.

01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:06.150
Are we responsible
for the pothole?

01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:08.940
And we have to do what I
just described perfectly,

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:12.210
so that person thrives
through that operation.

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:14.370
And I worry that the
health care system

01:19:14.370 --> 01:19:17.340
will fall into what I think has
challenged some public schools,

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.650
particularly those who serve
low income communities.

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:21.370
Kids weren't earning
because they were hungry.

01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:22.170
We gave them breakfast.

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:22.961
We gave them lunch.

01:19:22.961 --> 01:19:25.410
We send them home with backpacks
of food on the weekend.

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:27.450
But no one's learning math.

01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:31.212
So I think that I was
very happy to come here

01:19:31.212 --> 01:19:33.420
to think about this from a
standpoint of citizenship,

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:36.957
because I think that those are
questions we have as citizens.

01:19:36.957 --> 01:19:38.290
I don't know what the answer is.

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:40.680
And I love what we do and
I love talking about it,

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.120
as was probably obvious.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:45.150
But I worry about where our
responsibilities begin and end

01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:47.430
and how you can't be all
things to all people, which

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:49.800
is why we have public
health colleagues

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.535
and colleagues in
academia and colleagues

01:19:51.535 --> 01:19:53.910
in the criminal justice system
and colleagues in housing.

01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:56.100
And we've got to pull
communities together

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:59.020
to solve these problems.

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.830
- I'll just add that just
as Dr. Benjamin said,

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.110
not only do we need to have
a sort of paradigm shift

01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:07.260
from treatment to prevention,
but also a paradigm

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:11.250
shift in recognizing the
social determinants of health.

01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:13.530
And you do see little
pockets of activity

01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:16.770
around environmental justice,
the rise in some pockets

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:18.332
of the citizen scientists.

01:20:18.332 --> 01:20:20.040
Unfortunately it's
oftentimes in response

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.915
to something like the
Flint crisis, you know,

01:20:21.915 --> 01:20:24.690
like it takes that to get
this kind of mobilization.

01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:27.270
But hopefully,
slowly but surely,

01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:29.252
we'll come to see all
these factors that

01:20:29.252 --> 01:20:30.960
affect people's health
and not just treat

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.375
people for a condition
after it starts.

01:20:35.375 --> 01:20:37.250
- So we're going to open
it up for questions.

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:40.160
and the way we're going
to do this is please--

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.660
we have a microphone here.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.320
--form a line.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.970
And then do we have
a roving microphone

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:46.669
if there's anybody who's not
able to get up to get in line?

01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:48.710
I think you can-- if you're
unable to get in line

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:51.950
you can also-- raise your
hand and flag somebody.

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:55.010
When you ask you question,
please tell us your name

01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:57.560
and if you're from a
particular organization.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.500
And also make sure
you do ask a question.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.250
Short comments with
a question are fine.

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:05.150
But we're not looking for
two or three minute speeches.

01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:05.970
Thank you.

01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:07.880
- OK, great.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.810
My name is Claribel Santiago.

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:14.600
I'm unemployed.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:19.160
I just wanted to
say that regarding

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.170
the advanced study,
the Radcliffe

01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:23.240
Institute for Advanced Study--

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:30.860
and Professor Cohen is
a history professor.

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:31.580
Let's see.

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:36.640
The history of the United
States is capitalism.

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:42.410
And all the presenters
today are hopeful.

01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:44.160
And I'm hopeful.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:59.620
But In other words, we come to
these meetings all the time.

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:09.550
And I think the only
way to mobilize people

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:15.025
so we stop the political risk
is the capitalist paycheck.

01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.400
And we need to--

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:26.240
again, the way I feel we
need to mobilize people

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:32.160
is wait till there's a holiday,
Thanksgiving, Christmas,

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.340
New Year's Eve.

01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:39.440
Get buses loaded,
and take them over

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.670
to the politicians'
suburban home

01:22:43.670 --> 01:22:46.250
and ask to use the bathroom.

01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:51.260
Ask to use-- you know, can I
have a piece of your turkey?

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:56.630
You know, I'm here
because I don't

01:22:56.630 --> 01:23:01.520
have enough funding
for the schools

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.080
or the infrastructure
in our cities.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.500
So it's not really
a question here.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.920
And I just wanted
to make that point.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:11.040
I don't know.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.840
I heard that a long time
ago or I read it somewhere.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:19.490
You know, just get
people's attention.

01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:22.910
Get people on buses and take
them out into the suburbs

01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:28.830
and ask the politicians that
are making tons of money.

01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:29.330
- Great.

01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:31.160
- And I just wanted
to make that point.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.368
- Thank you for your comment.

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:37.820
- Andrea Campbell
brought up a question,

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:43.060
but I'd really like Kate
Walsh to kind of answer it.

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:48.020
In a world in which the
child of a single parent who

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:51.320
makes $6,000 a year,
the child having asthma,

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.670
is considered too
rich to get Medicaid,

01:23:55.670 --> 01:24:01.130
the level of willingness to
share strikes me as appalling.

01:24:01.130 --> 01:24:02.520
And yet there we are.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.520
Those of us who are old
enough to have Medicare,

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.690
we've got ours.

01:24:05.690 --> 01:24:08.870
When I was employed by
an employer, we had ours.

01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:11.420
The problem is that it's
going to other people.

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:16.610
Except Kate Walsh, you represent
the one unifying institution.

01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:17.130
- No, no.

01:24:17.130 --> 01:24:17.760
[INAUDIBLE]

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.660
- Ah yes, rich people
and poor people both

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:21.830
count on that hospital.

01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:24.350
When you break your leg
on Dorchester Avenue,

01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:25.520
rich and poor--

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:28.340
the richest people
in the area want

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.540
to go to Boston City
Hospital emergency room

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.250
and get it fixed.

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:34.520
And so [INAUDIBLE],, in
my community in Oregon,

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.860
the head of the
regional hospital

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:40.290
said that before the ACA,
they were losing a couple

01:24:40.290 --> 01:24:41.510
of million dollars a year.

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:44.220
They were coming to the
donor community to find it.

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.590
Now with the ACA,
they're profitable again.

01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:49.430
At least they're
breaking even again.

01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:52.820
Are the hospital
administrators doing anything

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:57.470
to share with politicians
that the Medicaid expansion is

01:24:57.470 --> 01:25:00.640
the solution or a solution
to keeping hospitals open?

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.810
It strikes me that you
have the great power

01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:04.170
to make a difference.

01:25:04.170 --> 01:25:06.650
- I think we need to do
more, which is partly

01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:09.860
why I talked about the call
to action for our sector

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.030
around Medicaid.

01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:13.280
But just to come back to
Texas, not that it's not

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:16.490
fun to bash them, what
they do is they-- you know,

01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:19.630
they haven't accepted expansion,
but they have a $15 billion

01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:21.800
waiver.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.360
They have a $15 billion waiver.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.220
So a public hospital in
Texas has the ability

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:27.470
to care for low income people.

01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:30.230
They just do it through
a disproportionate sharer

01:25:30.230 --> 01:25:31.340
hospital methodology.

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.880
This gets pretty arcane.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.350
So the kid with asthma
in Texas probably

01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:38.967
gets his inhaler in a spacer.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.550
They probably jump
through more hoops.

01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:43.460
They're more apt to be at a
county hospital than they are

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:44.870
at Texas Children's.

01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:47.510
But I think-- actually, they're
probably at Texas Children's.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:50.000
I have a friend who's on the
board of a hospital in Corpus

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.265
Christi that's largely--

01:25:52.265 --> 01:25:53.140
it's called Driscoll.

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:54.740
It's a children's
hospital down there.

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.339
I think it's like 70% Medicaid.

01:25:56.339 --> 01:25:58.630
And then the rest they do
through supplemental dollars.

01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:03.950
So I think our sector has to
embrace the Medicaid program.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:06.850
And I'm proud to work
at a place that does.

01:26:06.850 --> 01:26:09.695
And Oregon is a terrific
state in that way as well.

01:26:09.695 --> 01:26:11.620
Do you have anything to had.

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:13.580
- As a researcher, I do
have to just point out

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:16.060
that the studies are pretty
unequivocal that states that

01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:17.810
haven't expanded
Medicaid, even if they do

01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:19.643
have other supplemental
safety net programs,

01:26:19.643 --> 01:26:20.510
it's not comparable.

01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:21.300
Health insurance is different--

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:21.450
- You're right.

01:26:21.450 --> 01:26:21.800
It's not.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.220
It's not comparable.

01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:23.303
--than safety net funding.

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:25.774
And the patients experience
a clear difference.

01:26:25.774 --> 01:26:27.440
When someone comes
to the emergency room

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.840
and needs emergency
treatment, yes, they're

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.310
required by law to receive it.

01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:33.741
But it's all of the cases
short of that emergency

01:26:33.741 --> 01:26:35.990
and after the emergency that
without health insurance,

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:37.240
people really struggle to get.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:37.960
- Yeah.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.137
- If our questioners can--

01:26:39.137 --> 01:26:40.470
Dr. Benjamin, did you want you--

01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.969
- Yeah.

01:26:40.969 --> 01:26:43.110
It's more than just health care.

01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:44.720
So for a lot of the
smaller hospitals,

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.660
they're the only hospital
in the community.

01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:51.220
I mean, one of the reasons
that the previous bills failed

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.060
was that in a lot of
rural communities,

01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.730
even those places
that didn't expand

01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:58.700
were going to the legislators
and telling them just that.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.180
Also, in many of
those communities,

01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:03.170
the hospital is the biggest
or only employer in town.

01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:05.824
And so it's also an
economic development issue

01:27:05.824 --> 01:27:06.740
for those communities.

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.620
So you know, people
keep forgetting

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:13.350
that this is 18% of our
gross domestic product

01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:16.950
and it is a major economic
engine for our nation.

01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:18.050
- I have a brief question.

01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:19.680
- And please introduce
yourself before your question.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:20.900
- I'm Horace [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.610
I'm a Harvard Medical
School graduate.

01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:26.600
And I spent the first half
of my career practicing

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.090
medicine at the Johns
Hopkins Hospital

01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:30.590
and the last half in big pharma.

01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:32.480
I work for Pfizer now.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.910
My question is this.

01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:37.040
I'm surprised that in
all these lovely talks

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:41.240
one thing I haven't heard about,
which was always my diagnosis,

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.410
was that part of the reason
we're in the fix we're in

01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:48.080
is because there
are too many people

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.700
making too much money
off the present system.

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:54.325
Is that my naivete
or is that important?

01:27:54.325 --> 01:27:56.105
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.980
- Well, I'd never go
after anyone's income

01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:04.050
other than to say that there
is a maldistribution in terms

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:06.120
of the work, in
terms of the value.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.400
And of course, one
thing to fix that

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.100
is to begin looking at value.

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:15.492
And you know, if
we did it right,

01:28:15.492 --> 01:28:17.700
that would mean that primary
care practitioners would

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:21.690
make a whole lot more
money than they do today.

01:28:21.690 --> 01:28:23.500
- Hi, my name is
Frank Singleton.

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:24.745
I'm a retired health officer.

01:28:24.745 --> 01:28:27.950
I've worked in four states,
the last 15 years in Lowell,

01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:31.720
Massachusetts, where we had
30 school nurses, for example,

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.410
because of the medical needs
of the population in the school

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:34.910
system.

01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:37.035
And I hope that we can now
bill the Affordable Care

01:28:37.035 --> 01:28:41.530
Act for their services, to just
help strengthen that program.

01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:44.300
But the point I want to make
is you're seeing an iceberg

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:47.470
and you're talking about
what's visible on this panel.

01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:50.500
If you look at the money, I
was the city's ADA coordinator,

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.750
for example, Americans
with Disabilities Act.

01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:56.470
Between the disability
community and long-term care,

01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:58.570
you're seeing almost
half the money

01:28:58.570 --> 01:29:00.700
in this pot of money
being spent in that area.

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.940
You may want to actually have
a separate panel sometime

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:04.990
in the future about that.

01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:07.420
Because I think Congress
didn't understand that.

01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:09.850
Medicaid to them
was poor people.

01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:11.150
They ought to be working.

01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:13.120
I'm looking at
the issues of, how

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:14.620
do you keep people
in the community

01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:16.930
without having support
services or they become

01:29:16.930 --> 01:29:19.150
institutionalized to disability.

01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:21.580
A lot of the chronic care
people fall into that category

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.360
as well.

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.360
But with support and
health insurance, they can.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.090
So I'm really looking
at can, we discuss--

01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:29.800
one of the biggest
issues here is

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.752
I think the fact that we are
not just talking wellness.

01:29:32.752 --> 01:29:34.210
We're talking what
happens when you

01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:36.990
start going into
you needing care,

01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:39.307
and especially when you
look at long-term care.

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.140
Right now, long-term
care is in grave danger

01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:43.930
of going bankrupt because of
the reimbursement structure.

01:29:43.930 --> 01:29:46.450
And I had to deal with 15
nursing homes on Lowell.

01:29:46.450 --> 01:29:49.409
And there are real problems
that need to be addressed.

01:29:49.409 --> 01:29:50.950
And I don't see that
being discussed.

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:53.490
Most of this revolves
around the exchanges

01:29:53.490 --> 01:29:56.830
and what goes on with that
part of the program, which

01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:57.490
is important.

01:29:57.490 --> 01:30:00.520
But I don't see much discussion
on the disability portion

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.950
and the long-term care portion.

01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:05.380
- I'll say that for political
scientists who study health

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:08.170
policy, the lack of political
mobilization around long-term

01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:10.210
care issues is one of
our central puzzles.

01:30:10.210 --> 01:30:11.860
And we have a few
ideas about why

01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:13.370
you don't see more activity.

01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:16.270
I mean, one is that we're
a youth-oriented culture

01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:18.850
and there's just not a
lot of public discussion

01:30:18.850 --> 01:30:24.360
about disability and senescence,
both culturally, societal,

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.500
and within families.

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.390
I have an 82-year-old mother
and a 70-year-old mother-in-law.

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:32.180
And it's really tough to talk
to them about these issues.

01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:33.427
So that's one issue.

01:30:33.427 --> 01:30:35.260
It's also a prime example
of market failure.

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.530
Private long-term care insurance
is a terrible market failure.

01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:42.400
And so really people are just
left with family resources.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.390
And you think about who could
be the potential constituency

01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.960
there.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.960
Well, there are the
adult caretakers.

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.940
But obviously the
caretaking episode

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:55.210
itself is all-consuming
and exhausting.

01:30:55.210 --> 01:30:56.920
If you're caretaking
for an elder,

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.500
it ends in that person's
death typically.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.290
And that's not a
moment where you're

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.437
going to embrace
political mobilization.

01:31:04.437 --> 01:31:06.020
Also, there's something
about Medicaid

01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:09.820
which is in some way I
consider the sort of tyranny

01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:12.184
of a half solution, which
is that policymakers know

01:31:12.184 --> 01:31:13.725
that long-term care
is very expensive

01:31:13.725 --> 01:31:17.380
and they don't want to take it
on more than they already are.

01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:19.995
And they just turn to
Medicaid and say, well, we

01:31:19.995 --> 01:31:22.120
don't need to do anything
else about long-term care

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:25.480
because we have Medicaid,
end of conversation.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:28.006
And so it's a puzzle why we
don't have more mobilization.

01:31:28.006 --> 01:31:29.505
That's something--
it actually would

01:31:29.505 --> 01:31:31.755
be a great forum for Radcliffe
to take up because it's

01:31:31.755 --> 01:31:34.430
a huge issue in our society.

01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:40.760
- Yeah, let me just add that
it was a great shock to many

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:44.290
members of Congress that
Medicaid covered long-term

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:44.790
care.

01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:45.420
- Yeah.

01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:46.260
- They had no clue.

01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.705
- Yeah.

01:31:47.705 --> 01:31:49.830
- Now, we can talk about
how people got to Congress

01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:51.210
and what their background
experiences were

01:31:51.210 --> 01:31:52.126
before they got there.

01:31:52.126 --> 01:31:53.740
- Radio talk show host.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.612
- But the enormous lack
of regular order when

01:31:56.612 --> 01:31:58.820
we had committee hearings
and had discussions and had

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:03.520
debate and things became
public was astounding.

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:08.590
They were not prepared
for some of the protests

01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:10.530
and for the nice
lady in the front

01:32:10.530 --> 01:32:12.900
here who talked about
citizen activism.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.590
What happen this time that
didn't happen after the ACA was

01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:23.950
originally passed and
the Tea Party revolted

01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:27.500
was that citizens
did not give up.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:30.100
They were arresting
people in wheelchairs,

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.600
dragging them out
of wheelchairs,

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.280
dragging them across the hall to
arrest them, all on television.

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:43.420
And these were people who
were certainly disable,

01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:47.300
but they were skilled
at protesting.

01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:51.140
They had been trained
not to resist,

01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:56.740
in nonviolent resistance
and proper advocacy.

01:32:56.740 --> 01:33:01.540
So you know, we had lots of
pictures of disabled people,

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:06.100
frankly, being
abused and not people

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.530
who were disabled
being the abusers.

01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:12.160
And I got to tell you that
that was, from an advocacy

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.515
perspective, helpful.

01:33:16.170 --> 01:33:19.070
- The Affordable Care Act debate
did include some features that

01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:20.820
I think got a little
bit less visibility--

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:23.280
and our panel's comments
probably reflected that--

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.060
that did apply to care for
people with disabilities

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.692
and in long-term care.

01:33:28.692 --> 01:33:30.150
One of the populations
that we know

01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:33.150
is most in need of
improved care and policies

01:33:33.150 --> 01:33:36.280
are those people dually enrolled
in Medicare and Medicaid.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.760
And this is a group
that has really never

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:41.850
had a dedicated policy focus
until the Affordable Care

01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:44.610
Act created a new center
for dual eligibles,

01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:46.650
to try to improve
that coordination.

01:33:46.650 --> 01:33:48.500
And then we also have
seen a lot of states--

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.380
well, federal
policymakers may not know,

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:52.796
but any state policymaker who
looks at the Medicaid budget

01:33:52.796 --> 01:33:54.340
knows that long-term
care and care

01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:57.846
of people with disabilities is a
huge portion of Medicaid costs.

01:33:57.846 --> 01:33:59.220
Now, the approaches
that then you

01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:02.970
see state policymakers proposing
varies quite a bit from, let's

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:05.280
provide more social supports
and all-inclusive care

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.317
and try to improve
care coordination to,

01:34:07.317 --> 01:34:09.150
let's find some private
insurance plans that

01:34:09.150 --> 01:34:11.181
have no experience caring
for this population

01:34:11.181 --> 01:34:12.930
and see if we can
contract them out there,

01:34:12.930 --> 01:34:14.138
and that might save us money.

01:34:14.138 --> 01:34:15.630
So there's a range of values.

01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:17.250
But it was a great
question and I'm

01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:20.900
glad that the panel got to
comment a little bit on it.

01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:22.470
- OK, my name is
Katherine Morrison,

01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:23.950
and I'm a member of APHA.

01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:25.165
So hi there.

01:34:25.165 --> 01:34:28.430
A quick question-- there appears
to be-- and Dr. Benjamin,

01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:30.510
you just actually
touched on it--

01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:34.380
a lot of ignorance when it comes
to the importance of Medicaid

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:35.820
among the legislator.

01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:38.760
So I'm wondering if
anything is being

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.030
done to try to actually
provide more education to those

01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:43.800
who make our laws and policies.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:44.910
And that includes Trump.

01:34:49.410 --> 01:34:52.440
- Yeah, certainly
there are many groups

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.970
that are going in and
talking to many legislators.

01:34:54.970 --> 01:35:01.729
And in defense of some of those
legislators that didn't know,

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:04.020
the fact that again, you
don't have regular order, that

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.150
meant a lot of things were being
discussed out of committee.

01:35:06.150 --> 01:35:07.775
So you had a lot of
people that weren't

01:35:07.775 --> 01:35:10.530
on the health committees
that ultimately had to vote.

01:35:10.530 --> 01:35:12.660
And by the way, their
staffs didn't know either.

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:16.170
Because again, when these
things go through the process,

01:35:16.170 --> 01:35:18.660
staffs become educated,
the legislator

01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:21.360
becomes much better
educated, and they

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.590
don't get surprised, frankly.

01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:26.940
And so yeah, there are
lots of efforts to do that.

01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:29.070
The biggest concern
that I have of course

01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:32.970
is the current
Secretary of Health,

01:35:32.970 --> 01:35:38.430
who has a perspective on
the Affordable Care Act

01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:43.530
which is best to say, and kind
for him to say, is old school,

01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:46.900
and doesn't believe in--

01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.990
he believes in
quantity over quality

01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:50.640
in terms of payment mechanisms.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.230
I'm sure he believes in quality.

01:35:52.230 --> 01:35:55.400
I don't want to disparage
him his critical skills.

01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:02.830
But the Affordable Care Act,
in terms of its intention

01:36:02.830 --> 01:36:04.785
got it right.

01:36:04.785 --> 01:36:06.160
But they're doing
everything they

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:10.420
can to undermine
regulations, under the guise

01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:14.860
of upsetting the
patient-physician relationship.

01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:19.210
And you know, I think both
his diagnosis is wrong,

01:36:19.210 --> 01:36:22.270
his therapy is wrong,
and everything he's doing

01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:23.060
is wrong on that.

01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:26.666
But you know, we will continue
to try to move that agenda.

01:36:26.666 --> 01:36:28.777
- Do you want to say
anything on this?

01:36:28.777 --> 01:36:31.360
You know, one thing I will say
is that I know that there are--

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.609
I see some of my colleagues
here who also do research.

01:36:33.609 --> 01:36:37.040
The last six to nine months have
been an interesting challenge

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:41.150
for academic researchers in this
area, which is how far are you

01:36:41.150 --> 01:36:44.977
willing to go to put out your
perspective and share evidence

01:36:44.977 --> 01:36:47.060
and try to influence how
policymakers are thinking

01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:50.120
about these issues when
some of the very basic facts

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:53.810
are either unknown
to policymakers

01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:56.330
or they intentionally
mislead about?

01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:59.510
And I think it has been an
eye-opening experience, and not

01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:00.200
just in health.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.408
We know we see this going
on in environmental health.

01:37:02.408 --> 01:37:05.810
We see this in sociology, legal
studies, immigration policy,

01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:09.410
this doubt of science,
and the need in academia

01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:11.460
to step outside of our
comfort zone and say,

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:12.440
here's what we do
know and here's

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.481
what we don't, here are
the areas of uncertainty,

01:37:14.481 --> 01:37:16.082
here are facts,
here are studies.

01:37:16.082 --> 01:37:17.540
And on the Affordable
Care Act, I'd

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:20.041
like to think that
some of that sunk in.

01:37:20.041 --> 01:37:22.040
The story I sometimes
tell when my students say,

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:24.052
does any of this matter,
the work we're doing--

01:37:24.052 --> 01:37:25.010
you know, my son's six.

01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:28.280
He brings home art
project after art project.

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.990
And my favorites are the
sprinkle, the glitter projects,

01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.490
right?

01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:32.720
You put all this glue on there.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:33.560
You decorate it up.

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.974
You pour all the glitter on.

01:37:34.974 --> 01:37:36.890
You pick it up and you
shake it, and 90% of it

01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:38.250
falls in the ground.

01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:40.610
I hope a little bit of
our research sticks.

01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:43.590
And that's my goal.

01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:44.090
- Hi.

01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:45.506
Thank you for
sitting on the panel

01:37:45.506 --> 01:37:47.450
and sharing your
knowledge with us today.

01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:48.140
I'm Victoria.

01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:52.250
I'm a graduate student at the
Heller School at Brandeis.

01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:53.690
My question is
more hypothetical.

01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:55.920
And it's mainly
directed at Kate Walsh,

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.310
but anyone else can respond.

01:37:58.310 --> 01:38:00.890
I love your optimism about
the holistic approach

01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:02.580
that hospitals are taking.

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:04.580
But I'm kind of
curious on how you

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:09.020
think institutional
citizenship would be impacted

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:13.130
by a single-payer system similar
to what Bernie Sanders just

01:38:13.130 --> 01:38:15.740
proposed in terms of
or under the assumption

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:18.740
that hospitals would lose money
due to reimbursement rates

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:21.980
and restrictions on
private insurance,

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:26.150
if you think it would
move that forward in terms

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:30.440
of an incentive to hit earlier,
or if it would kind of move it

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.392
back and regress to follow
the money and save on costs.

01:38:34.392 --> 01:38:35.850
- So that's a really
good question.

01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:37.160
I think we're in
a unique position.

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.326
I think I said at the outset,
but maybe too quickly,

01:38:39.326 --> 01:38:41.170
that we're about
79% government paid.

01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:42.950
So for us, that's
more theoretical.

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:44.650
We're already kind of there.

01:38:44.650 --> 01:38:46.820
We're a single-payer with
two different flavors

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:50.060
between Medicaid and MassHealth.

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:54.137
I think a single-payer could
be disruptive to our system.

01:38:54.137 --> 01:38:55.970
We were just talking
about that, whether you

01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:59.704
need to kind of install
it or evolve towards it.

01:38:59.704 --> 01:39:05.110
And I worry about it being
a stalking horse for people

01:39:05.110 --> 01:39:09.010
who point to that to use it as
a reason to upend the Affordable

01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:10.420
Care Act.

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:11.950
I think we did a lot of work.

01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:13.600
This is really
complicated stuff.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.700
And we really could
make your hair hurt

01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:18.250
if we started talking about
all the details behind it,

01:39:18.250 --> 01:39:20.680
particularly this end of
the table, or these guys.

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:21.970
But I think the--

01:39:21.970 --> 01:39:24.520
so I worry about it
being a stalking horse.

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.861
I think you see it a
little bit differently.

01:39:26.861 --> 01:39:27.360
- Yeah.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:33.600
So first of all, I'm excited
to hear the next panel.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.651
Because we don't know
what single-payer means.

01:39:35.651 --> 01:39:36.150
- Yeah

01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:36.810
- OK?

01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:41.100
We know that we've seen
Senator Sanders bill.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:44.340
I'm very excited about it and
by what he's thinking about.

01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.930
And I like the
construction on how

01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:50.870
he's talking about implementing
it over four years.

01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:53.890
Of course, you saw implementing
ACA over multiple years

01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:56.529
did for us.

01:39:56.529 --> 01:39:58.070
So I think there
are real challenges.

01:39:58.070 --> 01:40:01.022
And I think the question is
still, how do you pay for it?

01:40:01.022 --> 01:40:05.660
And you know, my organization is
strongly long-term single-payer

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:07.330
on the policy.

01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:09.530
The question has always
been, how do you get there?

01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:11.330
How do you evolve to it?

01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:17.260
One way may be to do Medicare
for all adults and Medicaid

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:21.310
for all children first
as an interim step,

01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:24.056
and then figure out how
you harmonize the two.

01:40:24.056 --> 01:40:25.555
So I suspect whatever
happens, there

01:40:25.555 --> 01:40:28.860
will be some harmonization
process, assuming we get there.

01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:30.610
- All right, we have
time for one or maybe

01:40:30.610 --> 01:40:33.100
two more questions.

01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.420
- I'll be fast then.

01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:35.150
I'm Debra Straud.

01:40:35.150 --> 01:40:38.010
I spent my first half of m y
career in technology transfer

01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:40.630
and the second half in
behavioral health policy.

01:40:40.630 --> 01:40:42.838
And I'm wondering if you
could talk a little bit more

01:40:42.838 --> 01:40:45.700
about workforce development
and specific challenges

01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:48.550
in recruitment and retention
and compensation and the skills

01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:51.540
that it takes to form this
kind of holistic collaboration

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:55.878
to care for communities.

01:40:55.878 --> 01:40:58.350
- Do you want to start first?

01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:59.740
- That's a great question.

01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:00.860
I wish I knew the answer.

01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:02.800
I think we've got
a lot of work to do

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:07.330
as we move from making sure when
people roll in the emergency

01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:10.069
room or come to the clinic
we can take really good care

01:41:10.069 --> 01:41:12.610
of them, but finding patients
where they live and finding out

01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:13.960
what's important to them.

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.610
You know, health
care in America is

01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:17.740
very good at asking,
what's the matter?

01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:19.840
We're less good at asking,
what matters to you?

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.610
So training a workforce
that can do that is--

01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:24.650
you know, you think
about end-of-life issues,

01:41:24.650 --> 01:41:28.270
think about community
health and wellness.

01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:29.470
We've got some work to do.

01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:31.178
I would not purport
to be an expert.

01:41:31.178 --> 01:41:32.136
You maybe [INAUDIBLE]--

01:41:32.136 --> 01:41:32.670
- Yeah.

01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:36.160
The medical schools at least are
beginning to teach and move us

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.490
from a training program
where we taught people

01:41:39.490 --> 01:41:43.210
to be independent, on their
own, and know everything,

01:41:43.210 --> 01:41:46.990
to working in teams and
relying on others in terms

01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:49.450
of being part of a team.

01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:51.100
And in addition,
there is much more

01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:52.930
work on the social
determinants happening

01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:55.360
within schools of medicine.

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.260
Schools of nursing have
always taught teamwork.

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:03.640
And the challenge of course
is recognizing, allowing

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.430
nurses to practice at
their full potential,

01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:08.320
and other practitioners,
you know--

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.580
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:15.130
- --pharmacists, PAs,
[INAUDIBLE] all those folks

01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:16.870
so we can build that.

01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:19.900
And we do need to begin doing
a better enumeration about what

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.540
our workforce is going to be.

01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:24.250
And the thing that's
going to drive us there

01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:28.480
is all of us baby boomers
getting old and recognizing we

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.560
don't have the workforce trained
in any way to take care of us.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.340
- [INAUDIBLE].

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:35.560
- We're going to move us
onto our very last question.

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.470
And then we're going to
adjourn before the next panel.

01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.970
- Hi.

01:42:38.970 --> 01:42:40.601
Thank you for being here.

01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:43.100
My name is [? Dayelle ?] Smith,
and I work as a consultant--

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.630
Hi, Kate-- to hospitals
and health care insurers.

01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:50.650
And I've worked for insurers
and even for Medicaid

01:42:50.650 --> 01:42:52.720
and do that stuff
that makes your hair

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.890
hurt with the numbers.

01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:57.160
But my question is--

01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:00.760
so here-- and my avocation
now since the election

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:05.470
has been the resistance,
advocacy, political activism,

01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:06.581
new to me.

01:43:06.581 --> 01:43:08.830
And I guess what I'm saying
is, here we in a situation

01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:11.770
where they were dragging
disabled people out

01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:15.220
of the congressional offices.

01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:18.310
And yet it still took John
McCain's one last vote

01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:21.950
to defeat the last proposal.

01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:24.110
And I guess what I
want to know is--

01:43:24.110 --> 01:43:25.090
we've protested.

01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:26.870
We've been in the streets.

01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:28.260
We've marched.

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:28.830
We've called.

01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:29.560
We've faxed.

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.700
We did everything we could.

01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:32.230
We're so close.

01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:34.900
What are your
organizations going

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.620
to be able to do with your
power, your voice, your money,

01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:43.290
to stop this horrible events?

01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:46.350
And you know, will you
get more political?

01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:48.090
Will you work on
the next elections?

01:43:48.090 --> 01:43:50.400
Will you become more partisan?

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:51.150
What is your role?

01:43:51.150 --> 01:43:51.550
- Great.

01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:52.620
- How do you see your role--

01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:52.710
- Thank you.

01:43:52.710 --> 01:43:54.160
- --in changing the future?

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.680
- I'm going to direct this
to our political scientist

01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.720
for the last word, just
given time constraints.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:00.120
Because I know that probably
Ms. Walsh and Dr. Benjamin

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.953
could talk about this
for a good hour or so.

01:44:01.953 --> 01:44:02.730
- All right.

01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:04.530
Yeah, well, you
know, I think we need

01:44:04.530 --> 01:44:06.480
to keep working on
mobilization of everybody.

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.855
And you know, organizations
have a tough time because you

01:44:08.855 --> 01:44:09.980
can't be too political.

01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:13.980
But we have to get the
voice of everyone out.

01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:15.105
Because we have one party--

01:44:15.105 --> 01:44:16.896
I won't say which one,
but you can probably

01:44:16.896 --> 01:44:19.530
figure it out-- that's not
so interested in governing.

01:44:19.530 --> 01:44:23.940
And we need to make sure
that everybody, especially

01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:25.300
those in need, are voting.

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:30.000
So the resistance needs to
continue, even against the more

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.700
sly and hidden ways that these
programs are being undermined.

01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:36.210
- Well, thanks so
much to our panel.

01:44:36.210 --> 01:44:37.835
And thank you for
your great questions.

01:44:37.835 --> 01:44:41.020
[APPLAUSE]
