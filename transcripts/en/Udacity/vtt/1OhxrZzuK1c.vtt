00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.600
The notion of axiomatic concepts is the classical view in cognitive systems.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.400
Here's an alternative view. This is called Prototypical concepts.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.940
Prototypical concept is a base concepts defined by some typical

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.080
properties that can sometimes be overridden. So, an example is a chair. You and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.330
I have a notion of a prototypical chair. Our notion of a prototypical chair may

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.370
have, for example, there is a back, there is four legs and so

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.500
on. So, here might be your and my notion of a prototypical chair. It has a back,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.710
it has a seat, it has four legs and so on. Now I can represent this notion of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.780
the prototypical chair in the language of frames. This is something we have come

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.740
across earlier in the class. A frame has slots and fillers, as you may recall,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.490
and we use frames to represent stereotypes. Here we're talking about prototypes,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.710
so very closely related. So concept is the a content you can represent.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.940
Frame is the form in which we can represent it. So a notion for

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.860
the prototypical chair might be, it has four legs, it, the material is metal,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.750
it has a back, it does not have arms, and it's not cushioned.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.530
Note that these are the typical properties of a chair. Of course, some chairs

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.830
need not necessarily satisfy all of these properties. That is why there are no,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.500
no necessary and sufficient conditions here. For example, we may come across

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.150
a chair. Which is made of wood. While you would still consider it a chair,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.940
even if you're not strictly satisfied with this particular definition.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.040
Thus, these properties can be overridden in case of specific instances.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.470
But we'll still have the basic notion of a prototypical chair so

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.520
that we can in fact communicate with each other about what a chair is.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.090
Despite the fact that we can override these properties we do still have

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.250
a notion of prototypical chair. So the relationships between concepts and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.740
frames actually is quite close. Recall that when we were talking about frames,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.270
we were also talking about inheritance and default. The notion of default in

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.510
frames is closely connected to the notion of typical properties and concepts. So

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.250
chair has this prototypical notion with some of these typical properties, and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.560
we can think of this as having a default values. By default, we assume

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.240
the number of legs is four, the material is metal and so on. Here is a stool and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.140
this stool is a kind of chair which means that it inherits all the values and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.560
all the slots that are there in the chair directly except for

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.290
those that happen to be different from the one in the chair. So then an example

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.710
here it over writes a notion that the chair necessarily has to have a back.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.260
In the case of a stool, the stool does not have a back.
