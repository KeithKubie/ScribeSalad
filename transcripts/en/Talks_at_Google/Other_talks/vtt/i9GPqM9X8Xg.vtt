00:00:01.582 --> 00:00:02.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.330
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.746
My name is
[? Masha Ka, ?] and I'm

00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:07.920
a part of the global
benefits team.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.230
Today I have the pleasure of
introducing to you Ms. Carrie

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.960
Schwab-Pomerantz CFP, who is
one of the country's leading

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.230
advocates for financial
education and literacy.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.490
As president of Charles
Schwab Foundation,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.110
a private nonprofit
organization,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.020
Carrie has continued
Schwab's tradition

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.620
of breaking down barriers by
spearheading two nationally

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.000
recognized financial education
programs in collaboration

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.230
with the Boys and Girls
Clubs of America and the AARP

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.270
Foundation.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.340
She has opened new doors to
thousands of low-income teens

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.410
and seniors.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.850
As a result of
this work, in 2010

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.740
Carrie was appointed
by President Obama

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.720
to The President's Advisory
Council on Financial Capability

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.210
and served as chair of the
council's partnership committee

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.340
until early 2013.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.600
Carrie speaks and
writes extensively

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.290
about personal finance issues,
offering guidance and advice

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.850
through her weekly
personal finance

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.320
column, "Ask Carrie,"
which appears on schwab.com

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.530
and parade.com and is syndicated
nationally through the Creators

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.070
News Service.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.970
She is also a frequent
contributor to national media

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.450
and has appeared on
"Good Morning America,"

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.580
"The Today Show," CNBC, and NPR.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.400
Now addressing the most
important financial challenges

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.030
of today, Carrie has
written "The Charles Schwab

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.420
Guide to Finances After Fifty:
Answers to Your Most Important

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.340
Money Questions."

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.320
In an increasingly
complex financial world,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.770
this book provides an antidote
true to Schwab's heritage:

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.340
straight talk, clear
direction, and the inspiration

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.860
to take control of
your financial future.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.420
"The New York
Times" described it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.730
as overwhelming
and appealing, also

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.690
noting that this book treats
the reader as a grown-up.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.300
There's little sugar coding
and few wasted words.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.290
"Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz and
gives realistic advice

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.330
throughout-- an excellent
personal finance book.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.330
The book is well
worth your time,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.540
whether you are over 50 or just
seeing the big 5-0 looming."

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.660
And to be quite honest, for
all of us it's very relevant.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.460
And now please join me
in welcoming Ms. Carrie

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.856
Schwab-Pomerantz to Google.

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:19.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.100
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
Thank you, [? Masha. ?]

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.680
Thank you all for
coming here today.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.940
I have to say, I've never
been to the Google campus,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.700
and everybody has been
extremely hospitable.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.450
I had a lovely
lunch in your cafe,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.040
and I'm taking a lot of notes.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.470
We need some fennel water up
at Schwab as well, I think.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.160
And I understand
that all of you are

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.500
Googlers, which I love to hear.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.150
I see some thumbs up.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.560
So I'm a Schwaby.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.610
And we have our own vernacular.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.830
So our cafe is a "schwafe," or
our buses are the "schwuttles,"

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.910
and our intranet
is the "schweb."

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.590
And then if couples get
together-- two Schwabies--

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.760
they become a "schwouple."

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.270
So we have all kinds.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.220
I'd love to hear all about how
you guys use your Googler name.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.980
But anyway, thank you again
for having me here today.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.650
So I thought would start with
sharing a moment of inspiration

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.090
that I had recently,
about six weeks ago.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.170
And you may have thought
about the same thing.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.160
In the newspapers--
it was across all

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.700
the major newspapers--
where we learned

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.350
that the number of
toddlers with obesity

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.270
has decreased 43% in
the last 10 years.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.680
And I thought to
myself, this is amazing.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.440
It seems like only
just a few years ago

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.900
when this country came
together and rallied around

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.880
this social issue of obesity.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.620
And it made me think
that when a country comes

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.340
together and makes something
of national attention,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.130
where the nonprofits
come together,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.310
employers come together,
schools, families, individuals

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.070
come together, we
can make change.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.240
Now I share this with
you because so much

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.180
of financial literacy
has such huge parallels

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.180
with physical fitness.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.170
And I have been an advocate
for financial fitness

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.370
and financial literacy
for most of my career.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.120
And unfortunately the
dial has not moved much.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.190
And this country--
there's a lack

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.750
of savings and a lack of
financial preparedness, which

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.170
ultimately means a lack
of financial security.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.890
And I would be lying
if I didn't share

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.820
with you that during the Great
Recession in the last five

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.590
years, I was extremely
disappointed that as a country

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.140
we did not make this issue
of lack of financial literacy

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.220
a national issue where
we all came together.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.510
And if you look back
at what happened,

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.450
there were a lot of components
that kind of brought down

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.470
our country.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.380
But one significant area
was where individuals

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.950
were taking out more loans
than they could afford.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.230
And certainly there were a
lot of unscrupulous business

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.050
practices that
helped that along.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.050
But the benefit of
financial literacy

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.580
is knowing when something
is too good to be true.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.530
And the great recession was an
example-- this whole subprime

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.220
phenomenon was an
example of an individual

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.250
making an ill-advised
decision, not only affecting

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.500
his or herself but her family,
and ultimately bringing

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.320
down a whole country.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.940
And I don't know if
you have friends--

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.760
I know plenty of people who
live beyond their mean, live

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.380
paycheck to paycheck.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.510
45-year-olds haven't saved.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.120
In fact, I was recently--
about a month ago

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.870
I was in Washington,
DC, and went to lunch

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.330
with a friend and her friend.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.920
And this woman-- I think
she was in her late 50s.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.950
And we happened to walk by her
beautiful apartment-- newly

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.060
built apartment, downtown
DC, around the corner

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.620
from the Willard Hotel.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.290
And at lunch when I was
telling her all about my book,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.440
I could just see her
eyes glazing over.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.310
And she admitted to me that she
only had about $3,000 saved.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.400
And yet, she had this
beautiful apartment,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.870
oversees a national nonprofit.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.270
And then said to me--
admitted that she only

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.840
had $3,000 saved--
and then asked me

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.540
should she buy this particular
hot stock with that $3,000.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.330
Now this is sort of an extreme.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.900
I see someone thumbs up.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.070
This is an extreme-- you must
be part of that investing club.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.810
That's an extreme
example, but I can

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.020
go on and on about
these stories,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.050
from a friend of mine's business
partner-- he's an attorney who

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.750
makes $350,000 to
$400,000 a year.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.577
And he lives a very,
very lavish life.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.160
Doesn't have anything
to show for it--

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.370
no house, no
retirement, nothing.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.010
But he has fine wine every
night out in San Francisco

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.560
and he Ubers everywhere.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.080
And he says he can't
afford to save.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.770
But I think we all have
stories about that.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.720
But the bottom line
is that I think

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.415
with a shift in this country,
with some adjustments

00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:15.680
in our behaviors, in
our financial knowledge,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.800
I think we can really
make a world of difference

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.560
in this country.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.410
So I thought I
would share with you

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.500
the definition of
financial literacy.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.830
My husband keeps telling
me, not everybody

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.870
understands what
exactly that means.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.620
And so what I want to
do is share with you

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.369
the definition from
the Financial Literacy

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:36.150
and Education
Commission, which is

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:41.220
a commission of 20 federal
agencies in this country.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.360
It's like HUD and the Internal
Revenue Service, Department

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.430
of Defense, all
those major agencies.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.020
And they care deeply
about financial literacy.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.120
So let me get you
the definition.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.420
They define it as the ability
to use knowledge and skills

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.570
to manage financial
resources effectively

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.040
for a lifetime of
financial well being.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.470
So using your knowledge
and your skills.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.350
And so from my standpoint,
what that means

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.070
is living below your means.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.200
It means budgeting, tracking.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.267
Budgeting your money.

00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:18.600
Tracking where you are spending.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.460
Prioritizing expenses.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.720
Saving and investing
for a lifetime.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.690
It means having an
estate plan in place,

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.990
whether you are 20 years
old or 50 years old.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.980
And also having
proper insurance.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.820
It's creating that foundation
for your financial security.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.520
Now as mentioned, I have been
a part of two President's

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.070
Advisory Councils under
President Bush and President

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.620
Obama.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.560
And I've been extremely
proud of the work

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.120
that we did on those councils.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.350
But I have to tell you
that it's not enough.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.610
And I think we really need
to take this obesity campaign

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.080
and learn from it and apply
it to financial literacy

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.250
in this country.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.345
And we need to get from the
White House to the school

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:09.240
house involved, similar
to what Michelle Obama did

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.640
with her platform with obesity,
where you use your bully

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.570
pulpit around the issue.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.801
Also creating
guidelines for what

00:09:18.801 --> 00:09:21.300
we as Americans should follow
around our financial literacy.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.350
There's no common definition.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.940
And to employers-- I understand
Google is a wonderful example

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.380
of an employer who sees
the benefit of teaching

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.970
its employees around the
basics of financial education.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:35.765
Also schools.

00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:38.490
Do you know that only seven
states in this country

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.000
require personal finance as
a high school requirement?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.500
Now I think all 50 states should
require financial literacy.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.740
And then families and
individuals and nonprofits--

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.880
we all need to come together to
create more financial literacy.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.420
Now as mentioned,
I've been involved

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.500
with a lot of programs
over the years--

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.030
financial education programs
for women investors, teens,

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.520
young adults, the working poor.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.250
And what I can tell you is that
the lack of financial literacy

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.280
in the country cuts
across Americans

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.060
from all walks of life.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:23.100
It is blind to socioeconomic
status, to gender, and to age.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:30.365
It affects everyone and
ultimately affects our country.

00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:32.990
Now also I can tell you through
the financial literacy programs

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.950
that I've been a part is that
financial education improves

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.920
lives, and I've
seen it firsthand.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.300
As president of the
Charles Schwab Foundation,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.780
we have had a national
financial literacy

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.740
program with the
Boys and Girls Club.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.140
And we have had over 500,000
kids go through the program.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.870
And what we see is
that these young people

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.450
get very excited about the
opportunities of saving

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.951
and opening up a checking
account for free or a savings

00:11:02.951 --> 00:11:03.450
account.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.070
Believe it or not, there's
millions of Americans

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.130
who are unbanked, and
this is the first step

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.487
into the economic system.

00:11:08.487 --> 00:11:10.070
And they start to
save, and they start

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.910
to see their money accumulate.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.120
Then college becomes
in their purview.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.800
And I see this over
and over again.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.820
This is a teenager, but
it happens in every age.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.720
And I'll share with you Alonzo.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.440
I've met a ton of these kids who
have gone through the program.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.160
Alonzo was a teenager in a
Native American community

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.110
outside of Phoenix.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.180
When he turned 18 he was going
be entitled to $30,000 stipend

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.430
as part of being part
of this community.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.500
And so his plan before going
to the Boys and Girls Club

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.670
was to spend the
$30,000 on a new car

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.240
and then get menial job.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.379
And that's kind of
life on his community.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.920
But then with the
Boys and Girls Club

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.240
learning about what it
takes to have a brighter

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.390
future around education,
being civicly minded,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.510
and also taking the
Money Matters program,

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.830
he learned the power
of compound growth.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.720
And he realized if he goes to
college, takes that $30,000

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.740
and goes to college,
and he starts saving his

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.090
after school money
going forward,

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.410
he'll have a couple
million dollars saved.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.030
So his whole life was completely
changed, went to college,

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.250
and now he's on the
road to being a more

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.160
productive citizen.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.350
And so I see this
over and over again.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.310
The last 14 years
there have been

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.420
a lot of headwinds
for Americans.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.340
Where starting back in 2000,
the technology bubble burst.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.995
Were you all still
in technology?

00:12:38.995 --> 00:12:41.120
Raise your hands if you
were in technology in 2000.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.030
So you know what
I'm talking about.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:48.320
I know at Schwab, we went
from-- it was 2000 or 2001

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.640
when the market tanked.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.620
Then you had 9/11 that happened.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.750
It all came at once.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.080
And then you had Enron, when
Enron and WorldCom folded.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.270
And then, of course, the
last great recession.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:07.350
So, so much is getting in the
way of us trying to stay ahead.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.790
And then you combine the
fact that the landscape

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.390
has changed tremendously over
the last 20, 30 years, where

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:20.060
the pension plan is now slowly
but surely going away, going

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.270
to be extinct.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.820
And so it's sort of
almost like a transition

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.030
for this wave of baby boomers
where no one really taught us.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.130
There's been no
formal education,

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.583
yet we have to-- and
by the way, whether you

00:13:32.583 --> 00:13:34.550
are a baby boomer
or younger you're

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.980
going to have to be
disciplined to save

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.730
and you're going to have to be
knowledgeable on how to invest.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.300
And then when you
do retire, you're

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.380
going to have to learn
how to create a pay

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.990
check with your
savings to supplement

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.090
Social Security and other means.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.377
So a lot on our plates,
without any formal education.

00:13:51.377 --> 00:13:53.210
And then on top of that,
the financial world

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.930
has gotten more
and more complex.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.560
Just being in financial
service for the last 30 years,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.910
the thousands and
thousands of accounts

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.360
that you have to choose from.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:07.700
Roth versus traditional,
IRA versus 401(k) 403(b),

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.650
you name it.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.650
And then the 529 account,
and custodian account.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.140
It goes on and on and on.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.130
And then the thousands
of mutual funds.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.950
So it's no wonder that
all of us either want

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:21.300
to put our head in the sand
or just hope for the best.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.490
But the bottom
line is that we now

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.930
live in a world of
doing it ourselves.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.780
And if we don't take
charge of our own finances,

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.645
there's no one else.

00:14:31.645 --> 00:14:35.560
If we don't take charge,
no one else will.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.110
And so I strongly
believe and was

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.770
hoping that we could create
more of a conversation

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.090
in this country
around our need to get

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.270
engaged with our finances.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.970
I believe it's time that
we have a wake-up call.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.330
But at the very least, we
have to start with ourselves,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.100
with getting engaged, and
bringing those around us

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.190
along with the ride.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:05.120
During our life, I think we
all run into different moments

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.440
where it makes a shift in our
thinking, in our behaviors.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.310
So when I was in my early 40s--
I had always been a saver.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:18.160
I'd been a saver since
I was whatever, a kid.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.070
But to be honest
with you, I wasn't

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:24.110
as intentional around my
savings, my retirement,

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.510
to be honest with you, because
that seemed so far off.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.330
But in my 40s, I
got intentional.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.660
And so I hired a
financial expert

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.460
to be my partner in managing
my money, which a lot of people

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.910
think is interesting.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.200
Financial experts get help
from other financial experts.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.290
It's common.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.650
He was a partner
for me to make sure

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.040
that I really was saving
at the rate I needed

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.120
to save to have the
retirement that I want

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.550
and create a plan for me.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.400
Now when I turned 50
just a few years ago,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.000
it was another pivotal
inflection point for me.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.442
It was lot of messages.

00:16:03.442 --> 00:16:04.900
Is anybody-- well
I shouldn't even.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.274
You don't have to tell me if
you're over 50 or nearly 50.

00:16:07.274 --> 00:16:08.490
It's OK.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.170
I just remember first of
all getting the AARP card.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.630
That is brutal.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.480
Those of you that have
a little ways to go,

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.040
but you'll realize how jolting
it is to get that card.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.360
But more so, it made me
think just about my life

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.245
and how I want to
have-- I'm only

00:16:25.245 --> 00:16:29.110
going to be here in this
world for a finite period.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:33.370
And what more impact can I have?

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.890
And it made me think
that perhaps this is not

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.110
an uncommon feeling when we
have those different milestones

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:42.050
in our life.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.400
But I think what might be
common at this age is thinking

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.470
not only-- that we want
more control in our lives.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.740
And so having more control
means thinking differently

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.700
about our life and our money.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.830
And so I created
this book really

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.470
as a way to make a contribution.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:08.160
Right now the savings rate
in this country is terrible.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.770
Only 40% of Americans
save for retirement.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:16.810
The average amount
saved is $35,000.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.652
$35,000 provides about
$100 a month income

00:17:20.652 --> 00:17:21.485
for your retirement.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.849
So only 40% of
people have saved.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.280
The average is $35,000.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.066
I think all Americans, the
average saved is about $3,500.

00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:38.010
And 2/3s of Americans,
Social Security

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.480
is their primary source of
income, and for one third

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.550
it's their only
source of income.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.975
So the average amount of
Social Security in this country

00:17:44.975 --> 00:17:46.880
is $15,000.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.400
It's just under,
which moves anybody

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.040
who solely relies on
that into poverty.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.780
And in fact, the statistics
show that probably about 50%

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.900
of baby boomers in the
next wave-- 20 years--

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.030
are going to have a lifestyle
a lot less than what they're

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.820
used to having because of
the lack of preparedness.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:11.270
So I created this book to
try to provide an accessible

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:16.240
way for people to get
engaged with their finances

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.210
and to see that people
can make some small steps

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.210
and big steps for
financial security.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:25.510
And so I organized
it in 50 questions,

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.380
the most common
questions that people

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.860
have around their finances.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.100
And we bucket it into
different groupings.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.100
So anybody who is
at least 10 years

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.040
away-- so if you are
in your 40s and over,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.460
but don't have retirement
for another 10 years,

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.660
there is a whole section
for those people.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.420
To those who are about
five years away, and then

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.030
to those who are in retirement.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.789
And then we have a whole section
on Social Security and estate

00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:52.330
planning and the
people in our lives,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.130
because a lot of the decisions
we make around our money

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.780
are not in a vacuum.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.600
So rather than dig deep in all
the details of the book, what

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.090
I thought I would like to
do is just share with you

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.050
a few things.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.530
I want to share with you
three common misperceptions

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.870
that people have, 50 and over.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.280
And then I want to share with
you three to four points that I

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.920
think everybody-- no matter
your age-- should know.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.720
So starting with the
three misconceptions.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.690
We just recently
had a Schwab study

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.370
that-- these are actually
three among about 10 of them,

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.270
but I tried to pick ones that
might be of interest to you.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.080
But these people who
had the misconceptions

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.900
were actually the ones
who considered themselves

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.080
the most savvy
around their money.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.900
So a lot of people don't
know what they don't know.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.590
So let me share a few.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:50.270
The first one is, I'm
50, and it's too late

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.232
to save for retirement.

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:53.940
Now I'm going to assume
everybody in here

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.070
is probably well on their
way, but believe it or not,

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.630
one third of
Americans 55 and older

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.060
has not started saving
for their retirement.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:08.440
So again, this is creating
this potential social crisis

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.800
coming up.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.930
But what I see-- we have
a whole chapter on this,

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.995
and we actually have a
chapter for people who are 60

00:20:14.995 --> 00:20:17.860
and haven't saved, because
it is a true reality.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.590
This book is for
all income levels.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.990
There's a real reality
of people who have means

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.650
who haven't prepared.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.130
So what I say to people
is, 50, well, it's

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.880
much easier to save
sooner than later.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.270
It's not too late.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.231
And let me just give you a
couple of financial examples.

00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:41.000
An individual at 50 years
old has the opportunity

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.100
to save in a 401(k)
up to $23,000.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.900
That's the $17,500 that
you can contribute plus

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.680
the $5,500 catch-up
contribution.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.795
So if you saved $23,000
for 15 years in a row

00:20:55.795 --> 00:20:58.860
at a 6% rate of
return, that money

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:05.090
will grow to over
$500,000, about $570,000.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.030
Now for the west coast
or the east coast,

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.920
that might not be
a lot of money.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.260
But it is a lot more
than just $15,000 a year.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.330
And there's obviously
people living longer

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.220
and working longer
than 65, but that

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.040
does show you the power
of compound growth

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.770
and still having 15 years later
that you can make a difference.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:29.470
For those who are younger
than 50 or 40 years old,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.400
I share this whole
idea that if you

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.200
start saving at 25 years
old, $10,000 a year

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.210
at 6% rate of return, the money
will grow to about 1.7 million.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.060
However, if you
save $23,000 which

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.810
for somebody younger
than 50 you would

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.980
have to save in an
IRA or somewhere else,

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.260
but at a 6% rate of return,
$23,000 for 40 years until 65

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.236
would grow to about $3 million.

00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:59.630
So it's that power of compound
that is actually exciting

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.060
and which I think
if people could

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.800
see more of that
would drive them

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.840
into making some
better decisions.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.920
The second point I
wanted to share with you,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.610
and while none of us
here are in retirement,

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.270
it is this misconception that
when you do go into retirement,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.610
you sell all your stocks
and you put everything

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:23.450
into bonds and cash.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.260
And I meet people
day in and day out

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.080
who are afraid of
the stock market.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.260
But the bottom line
is, is a diversified--

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.150
we suggest to people when
you're in retirement,

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:37.640
you should have at
least 20% of your money

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.990
in a diversified
portfolio of equities.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:47.250
Now I share another story,
a friend of mine who I know

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.760
is a diligent saver.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.270
She's 43 years old, and she
just recently came to me.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.730
And she said, Carrie, my
financial planner just

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.560
told me that I'm not on track.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.680
And I said, what do you mean?

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.340
You're so good at saving.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.860
And she said, well,
it's because I only

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.540
have 30% in the stock market.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.760
And I said, Eleanor, no way!

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.930
You're kidding me!

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:15.360
And I said, you are
investing like an old lady.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.150
And she said, well I think
that kind of explains who I am.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.000
But the point that
I share this story

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.820
is that this fear of the
market gets in the way for us

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.830
to build the wealth and the
security that we need to have.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.110
And for young people, the
20-something year olds,

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.880
which I think a lot of
Googlers are-- 20 or 30.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.950
In your 401(k) or your IRA, you
probably want maybe 80 to 100%

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.190
invested in a diversified
portfolio of equity.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.330
So it's really important.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.900
People don't realize
the impact of inflation.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.190
An example that we have
is that $100,000 today

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.840
at a 3% inflation rate in
20 years, which is high now

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.900
but it's actually low
compared to other inflation

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.970
rates we've had
over our history.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.420
But $100,000 today
in 20 years could

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.630
have a purchasing
power of about $55,000.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.160
So again, equities is what
we need to have the growth,

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.550
to have the financial
security that we want.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:25.300
Now another misconception
is about Social Security.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.480
And I'm also like you,
far from retirement,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.920
but I do find this fascinating
that the Social Security

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.927
Administration says
that 3/4 of Americans

00:24:34.927 --> 00:24:37.010
take Social Security as
soon as they are eligible,

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:42.185
which is 62 years old right now.

00:24:42.185 --> 00:24:43.560
And in fact, a
lot of people feel

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.900
that that's what they
are supposed to do.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.920
Now for some people, especially
what we just experienced over

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.250
the last few years with
job losses and so forth,

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.400
people had to take it.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.070
That's the only way,
their only means.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.210
Or someone in ill health.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.910
But I can't imagine
that 3/4 of 62 year olds

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.050
really need their
Social Security now.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.120
And I think this is something
for you to think about

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.090
and also to tell your
parents for those of you who

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.920
are on the younger side.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.420
Taking Social Security
out at 62 means

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.020
that your monthly contribution
will be permanently reduced

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.430
25%.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.120
And let me give
you another number.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.830
If you were to wait
until you were 70,

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:28.670
your monthly benefit
would be 76% more

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.410
than if you had
taken it out at 62.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.440
So in other words,
it goes up a little

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.075
bit every year, like
6 and 1/2 to 8% a year

00:25:36.075 --> 00:25:38.480
that you wait between 62 and 70.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.890
And in this interest-rate
environment,

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.140
you can't get a
better rate of return.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.290
So a lot of people are leaving
a lot of money on the table,

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.170
so it's very worthwhile for
you to look at your options.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.300
And there are also
strategies for couples

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.720
on maximizing Social
Security as well.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.240
Social Security also is not
necessarily just a benefit

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.850
I'll call it for old people.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.210
One of my best friends just
lost her husband last year,

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:10.270
totally unexpected
and out of the blue.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:16.000
She's 51, and she has a
small child still at home.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.045
She's entitled to
Social Security.

00:26:18.045 --> 00:26:19.920
And what was interesting,
it was about a year

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.870
after her husband passed away
that it dawned on me that she

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.540
was entitled to Social Security.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.595
And so I texted her and
said, did you're entitled?

00:26:27.595 --> 00:26:30.860
And she said no, what do I do?

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.380
And I realized, whoa.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.414
I know she has a financial--
somebody managing her money.

00:26:35.414 --> 00:26:37.580
And I also know she had an
estate-planning attorney.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.130
But no one knew that she
had access to this benefit.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.190
And not to say that
this is something

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.490
that was super important
to her at the time,

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.790
but for a lot of people,
it's an important benefit

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.660
that they deserve.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.460
So Social Security
is complicated,

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.020
but it's also
worth it for people

00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.057
approaching 60 to really
look at their options.

00:27:00.057 --> 00:27:02.015
So those are the three
I'll call misconceptions

00:27:02.015 --> 00:27:05.930
I was going to share with you
around the 50-plus year old.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:09.950
But let me also share with
you some points for you

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.214
to think about for all ages.

00:27:12.214 --> 00:27:15.820
I'll get a sip of water.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:21.760
The first one is crunch the
numbers and face your reality.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.440
I mentioned I had saved--
I've been always a saver,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.546
but I wasn't
particularly intentional.

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:31.840
I think it's really important
to be intentional, especially

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.876
as you start getting in
your 30s and your 40s

00:27:34.876 --> 00:27:35.750
around your finances.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.920
Where is it that you want to be?

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.770
Look at it as sort of
reverse engineering.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.440
I know a lot of
you are engineers.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.910
So if you are building a
building, it's the same thing.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:47.993
You've got to make a plan.

00:27:47.993 --> 00:27:49.930
You've got to create
the foundation,

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.190
and then you have to
take the steps to build

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:56.780
each of the floors to
get to that building.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.720
And so same thing with
your retirement money

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.570
or any finances for that
matter, is what is your goal,

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.830
where are you now, and what
do you need to get there?

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.020
And I only share that with
you for a couple of reasons.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.190
One is that 60% of Americans
guess how much money they

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.565
are going to need
for retirement.

00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:15.810
Yet it's one of the
most expensive endeavors

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.650
we'll ever confront.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:19.640
And secondly,
there's been studies

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.720
that show that those
people who actually crunch

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.910
the numbers, who actually create
a plan and follow the plan,

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:28.450
on average will have about
30% percent more saved

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:29.890
than those that do not.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:33.160
So it's just that act of
preparing and planning

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:39.280
and saving that can make a
big difference in your life.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.914
Now saving for a
lifetime-- that's

00:28:41.914 --> 00:28:43.080
the problem in this country.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.190
We live beyond our means
when in fact we really

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:49.940
should be living
below our means.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:54.300
So I'll share with you, about
10 years ago a woman who

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:59.130
started a big networking group,
one of the top Wall Street

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.020
investment banking firms--
I won't name names--

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.190
but it was like a-- I shouldn't
call it an employee resource

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.690
group.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:10.521
It was a networking of women
from this Wall Street firm.

00:29:10.521 --> 00:29:12.020
They were alumni,
and then they were

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.600
women that still worked there.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.370
And we were talking
on the phone,

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.020
and she started to hint
to me that she wanted

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:23.090
me to be a spokesperson
for this group.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:29.420
And I said to her, why do you
want Carrie Schwab from Charles

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.630
Schwab coming to talk to you
about savings and budgeting

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:39.920
and building wealth when you are
all the titans of Wall Street?

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.720
And she said, Carrie, what
happened is, a lot of us

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.580
got out of college.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.440
We had salaries the size of a
lot of CEOs in this country.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.980
And we squandered it away.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.560
And I hear this story
over and over again.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.080
We're young.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.380
We have the rest of our
lives in front of us.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.490
But guess what?

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.530
You don't know what life
is going to bring you.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.820
And in this case, it was
back probably close to 2000,

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.980
after the whole bubble
burst-- a lot of Wall Street

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.120
lost their jobs.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.980
Or there's the rat race,
working in New York.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.220
And people wanting to
change their careers

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.315
or be stay-at-home moms,
or whatever it may be.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.780
The point is, is
that as young people,

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.900
successful people
such as you are all,

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.890
it's so important to put as
much money away as you can now

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.370
because you don't know what
life is going to bring you.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:44.850
And so let me give you some
rules of thumb around saving.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:46.500
I call it the minus 10 rule.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.300
If you are in your 20s, you
want to save at least 10%

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.170
percent of your income.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:56.930
And I understand
that Google actually

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.880
has an automatic enrollment
at 10%, which is great.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.730
It's a best in class.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.340
But it's a minimum 10%.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.760
Now if you wait until
your 30s to save,

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.710
you're going to have to
up it to at least 20%.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.640
And then your 40s,
30% and 50s, beyond.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.740
So you can see that
it pays to start

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.580
saving earlier than
waiting later in your life.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.540
So that's savings.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.185
Let me talk a little
bit about investing.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.790
The last five years
or-- was it 2008,

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.960
2009-- was extremely scary.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.860
And I remember I
was having dinner

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.390
with a professor at
a prominent school,

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.760
and his wife was a lawyer.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.910
And when he got
whiff of what I did,

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:48.539
he felt compelled to brag
that he sold all his stock.

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.330
And this, of course,
he had sold it already

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.455
at a loss, so I don't know
if he got to the bottom.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.540
The basic principle
of investing is

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.090
to invest for the long term
in a diversified portfolio.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.860
And what this last five
years showed us is those

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.390
principles still apply.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.040
So this fellow
locked in his losses.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:15.210
Meanwhile, the market in
2007 was at a high up here.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.870
When I say the
market, I'm talking

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.050
about the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:24.070
When it went down, it
went down about 55%.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.550
But if you held on the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:31.700
you would be up about 20%
from this high in 2007.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:37.500
So those of us who saved
or stuck with our plan

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.910
are 20% ahead of the game.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.270
So again, it's all about
long-term investing.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:49.640
And this professor was not alone
in getting scared and saving.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.820
The other point I want to
make is about diversification.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.170
I think it's got to be
very relevant to all of you

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.910
as it is for myself and
my colleagues at Schwab.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.675
And that is, is that you want
to be a diversified portfolio

00:33:02.675 --> 00:33:09.450
in international, small cap,
large cap, US, and emerging

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.730
markets and so forth-- just a
broad-based diversification.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:16.190
You also on a rule
of thumb don't

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.360
want to be invested
in more than 20%

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.055
in any one stock or industry.

00:33:23.055 --> 00:33:26.206
Does that ring true to you all?

00:33:26.206 --> 00:33:28.080
We have the same problem
where you get over--

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.210
you have your company or your
investments in one stock.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.710
But think about Enron.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.950
Do you all remember Enron?

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:37.850
Right.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:43.620
62% of their employees' 401(k)
was in their company stock.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.480
So there was story after story
where those employees lost

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.440
everything in their 401(k)s.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.834
They lost their job.

00:33:51.834 --> 00:33:53.250
And I remember
there was one story

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.790
in "USA Today" where a
fellow, he had to sell his car

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.150
just to make his home payment.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.550
So he almost lost
his home as well.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.630
So while right now
it's a good days,

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:06.240
again, you do not know
what life will bring you.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:12.300
So it's really important to
diversify and save and invest

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.690
for the long term.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.179
And if you are in
a situation where

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:18.170
you do have too
much of one stock,

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.449
there are ways to
mitigate the risk.

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:23.850
So that's really worthwhile
for you to think about that

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:28.560
when you take a look
at your finances.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.940
So I understand that Google
is a very generous company.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.590
And I think one of the pinnacles
of having financial security

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:41.139
is being able to share
your wealth with others

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:42.790
through philanthropy.

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.429
And as president of the
Charles Schwab Foundation,

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.590
I have one of the best
jobs in the company

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.989
because not only do I get
to think about the strategy

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:56.556
and create programs for
others who need it most,

00:34:56.556 --> 00:34:57.930
but I also get to
use my business

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.200
skills around my philanthropy.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.290
And so I wanted to
share with you because I

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:04.210
know a lot of you--
I guess Googlers

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:09.640
get a match of $6,000 for your
philanthropy, which I think

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.290
is wonderful.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:16.940
So I'm going to share with you
my evolution of philanthropy.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.150
Back in my 30s, I
lived in Atlanta,

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.360
and I had small children.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.420
I was just focused on my
job, focused on the kids.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.590
And a friend of mine
in the financial world

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.890
invited me with about six
or seven other women--

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:31.450
we were all financial services.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:34.120
And she brought a woman that
runs the Atlanta Women's

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.230
Foundation which
is an organization

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.402
for underserved women.

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:40.110
And she brought us to
dinner and asked us

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.550
if we would collectively
come together and raise

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:46.540
$50,000 a year for three
years in a row for women,

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.850
for women's economic parity,
because it was sort of aligned

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:52.020
with our industry
and our passion.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.820
So economic parity for women.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.469
And at the time,
I had not really

00:35:56.469 --> 00:35:58.760
been involved with philanthropy,
to be honest with you.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.790
I was focused on
whatever, my life.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:06.070
And to think about having
to raise $50,000 for three

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:09.210
years in a row and make that
commitment seemed huge to me.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.700
I had never raised money.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.400
I think the most I had ever
done is sell Girl Scout cookies

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.760
to my grandmother, and
that was an easy sell.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.720
So I went home that night, and
I remember tossing and turning,

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.620
thinking about this whole
notion of helping women.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.170
I was tossing and turning
because I was very nervous,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:35.590
but I was also
tossing and turning

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:42.130
because my friend had somehow
unturned this passion that I

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.920
guess in a way sort
of forgot I had.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.550
My friends later said
I was always sort

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.267
of this women's libber
in college and so forth.

00:36:48.267 --> 00:36:49.100
I hadn't remembered.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.500
But I was so excited to be a
part of this, so I signed on.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.430
And not everybody did.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.020
Some people were a little
bit intimidated by the ask.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:04.370
And I ended up being the
number one fundraiser,

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.470
and then I ended up being
the chair of the event.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.680
And then I ended up on
the board and the chair

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.200
of the board of one of
its recipient nonprofit

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.470
organizations.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.112
And I only share this
with you because I

00:37:16.112 --> 00:37:18.320
think when it comes to
philanthropy, or even anything

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.640
that we all do, whether it's
our work or extracurricular,

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.890
when you have passion
nothing can stop you

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.710
from being successful.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:29.680
And so that in a way sort
of launched my career

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.290
around financial literacy
and economic parity.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.510
But it all really
started-- a lot

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.620
of advocacy started with women.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.800
And so I encourage
everybody to think about

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.800
what grabs you, what
gets you excited,

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.170
where can I make the imprint.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.980
And then the second
point is, it doesn't

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.540
have to be just about money.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.570
It's about leveraging resources.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:58.640
At Schwab, our colleagues go out
and provide financial education

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.430
to underserved populations.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.580
That's where we can bring
something to the table.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.246
I know all of you
with your technology--

00:38:04.246 --> 00:38:07.860
you have so much to give back,
so much knowledge to share.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.530
And recently I was in Africa
last summer with my daughter

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:16.370
and went to this high school for
girls who otherwise would not

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.800
have a high-school education.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.750
It's not free there.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.730
And so this young couple from
Marin started this high school.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:27.240
And so I went there and taught
them about financial literacy.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.140
I actually taught them
about public speaking

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.290
and also talked to them
about women and leadership.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.300
And again, sometimes we don't
think about some of the skill

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.230
sets we have and we
can bring to the table.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:44.470
Then lastly, use the
tools that are out there

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.350
to make philanthropy easy.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.700
One of these best kept
secrets-- donor-advised funds.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.840
Is anybody here familiar
with a donor-advised fund?

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.560
No?

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.520
A donor-advised fund is
like a mini 501(c)(3),

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.270
and most financial
institutions have them,

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.305
where you can put appreciated
stock-- it looks like an IRA,

00:39:04.305 --> 00:39:06.650
where it serves as tax deferred.

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:10.460
But you put your appreciated
stock into the account

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:14.860
so then more goes to charity
rather than paying capital

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.850
gains and then you
get to write off

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:21.110
that donation on your
income taxes that year.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.276
Then it goes into your
mutual fund of your choice.

00:39:23.276 --> 00:39:24.650
You get a selection
mutual funds.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.870
You can let it grow, or you
point and you click and give it

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:32.410
online and have it sent
to your favorite charity.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:36.900
And for me, I know I am
going to give every year.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.240
And so I work with
my financial planner

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:44.240
on what appreciated stock
to put into the account,

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.550
and then I point and click.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.210
And the great thing
about a program like this

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.580
is that you have a
history of where you gave.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.920
So my children's school come
to me seems like four times

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.670
a year.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:56.610
It's like, oh my gosh.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:57.840
Didn't I just give to them?

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.570
So I go onto my
donor-advised fund,

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:03.440
I look at my history of my
charity, and I say, oh, OK.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.250
It was last November,
so it's been a year.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.960
And I point and click
and send it off.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.470
So with charity, I think
it's really important

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.330
to find what your passion is
so you can be very focused

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.660
and you can be successful
at whatever matters to you

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.970
and bring your resources to the
table-- your other resources--

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:24.430
and also find a tax-efficient,
strategic way to give money.

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:33.310
So if I were to wrap this
whole presentation up in a bow,

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.690
I would just leave
you with one message.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.060
And that is, get engaged.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:46.210
And if you're already
engaged, get more engaged.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.564
Are you really saving
enough in your 401(k)?

00:40:48.564 --> 00:40:49.980
Believe it or not,
for most people

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.880
you need to save more
than just your 401(k).

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.300
Retirement is expensive.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:41:01.870
I didn't mention that we use
the 25% or 25 times rule.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:06.010
You need 25 times the
amount of money of income

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.380
that you'll need at retirement.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.050
So let me give you an example.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:13.690
If you need $40,000 a year
at the time of retirement,

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.930
you will need 40,000 times
25, which is $1 million.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.540
So that should last
a 30-year retirement.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.910
So that is just a ballpark.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.290
For some people it's more.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.670
For some people it's less.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.720
And this is from your savings
to supplemental Social Security

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.700
and any other reliable sources
of income that you may have.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.520
So bottom line is, get engaged.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.910
Are you saving as
much as you should be?

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:48.260
Think about are you
maxing out your 401(k)?

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.540
Are you bringing others in
your life along the ride?

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.760
Your colleagues?

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.970
Are they doing what
they need to do?

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.200
I was thinking.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.000
You are some of the
smartest people.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.150
Is there a way that
Google could figure out

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:07.819
a way for more Americans to
participate in their finances?

00:42:07.819 --> 00:42:09.360
Something for you
all to think about.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.070
I hear you have the 20% of
your time can go to innovation,

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.560
and I would challenge you
all to think about that.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.400
Now and I also
think when it comes

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.810
our finances we have to
be honest with ourselves.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:26.419
And I don't think there
is a lot of honesty when

00:42:26.419 --> 00:42:27.460
it comes to our finances.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.660
Oh, I can't afford that.

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.090
Oh, I can't afford to save.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.140
Oh, but my expenses--
I can't do this.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.060
I can't do that.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:40.360
I had a moment of my
own honest conversation

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.560
about being honest with myself.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.670
Completely different--
my sister has

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:49.310
a figure that I would die for.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:54.060
She worked, but she works
out six days a week.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.140
Works out really
hard six days a week.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.210
She always avoids fat.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:03.120
She never picks at
parties or buffets,

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.130
and she has salad
dressing on the side.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.600
I don't do any of those.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.270
Yet, well, I'm starting
to do some of them.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.920
But the bottom line is, is I'm
thinking in my mind why, why,

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.420
why.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.360
But I had to be
honest with myself.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.050
And while losing a
few pounds is not

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:32.520
as serious as getting your
financial security in place,

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:37.730
it's something that we still
need to be in charge of.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:44.070
And so when I talk about
obesity, for instance,

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:48.600
it's really not about
obesity for obesity's sake

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.150
or losing five pounds.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.530
It's about having a better life.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:58.860
It's about having the life that
we want to have for ourselves.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.670
And I think with
some adjustments,

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:05.760
some more financial education,
more national attention,

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.370
and individually
we take charge, I

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:11.457
think we can have a better life.

00:44:11.457 --> 00:44:12.290
Thank you very much.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.670
AUDIENCE: I'm 30,
but I think I might

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:24.130
be in the same situation
as a lot of people here.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:26.465
I'm hoping to retire in
about 10 to 15 years.

00:44:26.465 --> 00:44:28.090
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
Young retiree.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:30.320
AUDIENCE: How should
my asset allocation

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.940
be compared to a 50 year old.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.790
Because I look at the
target retirement funds,

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:37.650
and for those funds
that are around the date

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.320
that I'd like to retire, they
seem really conservative.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.290
Yet I'm young.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.217
I don't know.

00:44:43.217 --> 00:44:45.050
Should I have the same
stock bond percentage

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:46.550
that someone who
is 50 just starting

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.836
trying to retire at 65?

00:44:47.836 --> 00:44:49.960
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
The same asset allocation?

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.860
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.500
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
That's hard to-- I

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.500
mean that's a number.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.210
So this whole question
of you're going

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.610
to retire-- you're
going to retire young.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.230
So typically, the
rule of thumb, as I

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.020
mentioned the
25-times rule, It's

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:05.800
a rule that you can generate
4% off your portfolio,

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.390
and it will last for 30 years.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.640
So in your case, you're
going to need more

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.270
than using the 4% rule,
because you'll be probably

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:20.310
in retirement, if you
want to call it that,

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.870
where you won't be generating
a big paycheck anymore.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.960
So you're going to definitely
need more than that.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.540
And also the fact that
you do have more time.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.460
You definitely can
benefit from more stocks.

00:45:33.127 --> 00:45:34.960
Given that you're young,
you should probably

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.430
have more stocks anyway.

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:38.040
I don't see you
going into bonds.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.616
But when you do start to
have to rely on that money--

00:45:40.616 --> 00:45:42.490
I mean if it's truly
the only money you have,

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.940
you're definitely going to
need to go more conservative.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.780
And as I mentioned, somebody who
is in retirement is 20% stock,

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.212
I would definitely go
more than that with you.

00:45:50.212 --> 00:45:51.670
But you have to
crunch the numbers.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.930
What kind of income is your
portfolio generating for you?

00:45:55.930 --> 00:46:00.320
But you're going to need the
growth, because again, you

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.340
could live another 40
years at 50 years old, so--

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.590
AUDIENCE: So generally
higher stocks?

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:05.950
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ: Yes--

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:06.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:07.758
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ: Yes.

00:46:07.758 --> 00:46:11.080
And when I say minimum 20% for
a 65 year old, it's a minimum.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.000
AUDIENCE: Oh, right.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:12.400
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ: Yeah.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.317
AUDIENCE: So aside
from savings rate,

00:46:14.317 --> 00:46:15.400
just the asset allocation.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.016
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ: Yeah.

00:46:17.016 --> 00:46:18.140
You definitely can go more.

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:22.730
But you should check
in periodically

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:26.210
or when you get closer.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:28.200
You shouldn't be
in the stock market

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.150
if you need your money
within five years.

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:33.367
AUDIENCE: Hi, Carrie.

00:46:33.367 --> 00:46:34.200
Thank you very much.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.720
So I have a couple questions.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.090
One is what are good
milestones to have?

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.932
Say at 30 years old you
should have 100,000.

00:46:42.932 --> 00:46:46.160
40 years old you
should have $500,000.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.970
50 years old, you
should have a million.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.770
What are good numbers
so that I know

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.062
that I'm kind of on track for--

00:46:52.062 --> 00:46:53.311
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ: Yeah.

00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:54.360
AUDIENCE: Retirement.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.670
Because I can never find that.

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.000
People keep saying you
should be saving so much,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.990
but then-- I'm just curious.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:02.020
If I'm 40 years old,
how much should I

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.100
have saved and should
that saving also

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.910
include the equity in your home?

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:10.700
Or should that not include
the equity in your home.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.390
Thank you.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:14.020
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ: OK.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.409
So let's just talk
about the home first.

00:47:17.409 --> 00:47:19.950
A lot of people obviously their
home becomes their retirement

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:20.449
plan.

00:47:20.449 --> 00:47:23.944
But my belief is that
home is your home.

00:47:23.944 --> 00:47:25.860
So a lot of people have
to rely on their home.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.230
I get that.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.670
But if you can, don't
look at your home

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:30.690
as your retirement plan.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.210
It's an illiquid
asset, and you don't

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:37.580
know what it will be worth at
the time that you need to sell.

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:41.000
Like for instance, what
happened in the last five years?

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.660
The west coast, where we all
live, the houses keep going up.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:48.030
But in the middle of the
country or farmland areas,

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:49.090
that's not happening.

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:52.240
So I would look at
your home as a home.

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.661
There's no rule of thumb
that when you're 40

00:47:54.661 --> 00:47:56.660
you should have a million
and at 50, $2 million.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.730
I think the better
way to look at

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:03.870
is, is how much money am I going
to want to have when I retire.

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:09.920
So $100,000-- if you're going to
want $100,000 when you retire,

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.100
you're going to
need $2.5 million.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:16.260
So I would look at
what do you have now.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.860
Let's just say it's $100,00.

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.010
What do you have
now, and what more

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.130
do you have to do to
get to $2.5 million.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:25.900
And of course I don't
know the numbers offhand,

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.700
but there's plenty
of calculators

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.160
with a certain rate of
return, what will it

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.232
take to get to
that $2.5 million.

00:48:34.232 --> 00:48:36.165
So I think again you
have to say where

00:48:36.165 --> 00:48:38.400
do you want to
go, where are you,

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.650
and then how much you save.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.190
There's no ballparks
about how old you are.

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:44.600
It all depends on you.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.082
Some people live off
Social Security just fine.

00:48:47.082 --> 00:48:48.790
AUDIENCE: A lot of my
friends like trying

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.370
to suggest buying properties,
become landlords, and use them

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:55.660
as income source
when you retire.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.330
Is that a good strategy,
or it's not recommended?

00:49:02.017 --> 00:49:04.350
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ: So
people ask that all the time

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.990
about real estate.

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.001
I think real estate
is fine as long

00:49:08.001 --> 00:49:09.250
as you know what you're doing.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.880
Real estate like REITs should
be part of your asset allocation

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:19.670
because it is sort of
a hedge to inflation,

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:24.350
but what you're talking about
is being a landlord or investing

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.070
in commercial real estate.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:28.680
That's a whole
another expertise.

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.745
And you also don't want to put
all your eggs in one basket.

00:49:31.745 --> 00:49:33.120
You just need to
know what you're

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.100
doing because you're putting
everything in one egg.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:41.900
And also again, it's
illiquid as well.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.620
Another question people ask,
should I pay off my loan,

00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:46.700
my mortgage, when I retire.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.190
And again, it
doesn't necessarily

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:52.479
pay to take your liquid assets
and pay off your mortgage

00:49:52.479 --> 00:49:55.020
if you don't have enough liquid
assets to generate the income

00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:01.130
that you need at retirement
or whenever you need income

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.541
from your portfolio.

00:50:03.541 --> 00:50:05.040
AUDIENCE: As part
of diversification

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.690
that could be part
of the distribution

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:10.610
of your savings to be like--

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:11.402
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:50:11.402 --> 00:50:13.276
Rental income can
definitely be part of that.

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:15.010
And that would be
part of your equation

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:17.460
in terms of how much
money do I need.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.740
So for instance-- going
back to the $100,000--

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.530
let's just say I need
$100,000 to live off.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:27.180
$15,000 comes from
Social Security,

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.270
so that I need
$85,000 for my income.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:33.960
But if I get $10,000 more
from my rental income,

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.190
then I need to generate
$75,000 from my portfolio

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:41.842
to supplement and to create
that $100,000 paycheck.

00:50:41.842 --> 00:50:43.550
AUDIENCE: I'm pretty
close to retirement,

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:46.410
and I've been working
with a financial advisor.

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:50.040
And the only place where we
don't quite see eye to eye

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:55.100
is about fixed-income
investment bonds.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:51:00.440
He has the kind of view I
read in the newspaper advice

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.679
columns-- that you have so much
in equities, so much in bonds.

00:51:03.679 --> 00:51:05.220
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
Bonds, yeah.

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.450
AUDIENCE: And so much in cash.

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:10.690
According to him, I'm really
underweighted in bonds.

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.056
But my point of view
is in the current--

00:51:13.056 --> 00:51:15.180
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
Interest-rate environment.

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.513
AUDIENCE: Financial environment.

00:51:16.513 --> 00:51:19.520
With the Federal Reserve
deliberately holding down

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.090
interest rates,
bonds are currently

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.590
paying almost nothing.

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:25.620
And if the Fed does
let the rates go up,

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:29.090
they're going to drop in
value, so I've been very leery

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:31.600
putting practically
anything in bonds,

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:38.250
and I'm keeping it all in
equities and cash basically.

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.390
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
Bonds do provide a component

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.770
to asset allocation
and diversification.

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:47.412
They play an important role.

00:51:47.412 --> 00:51:49.870
We all think interest rates,
and interest rates will go up,

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.300
and bonds will go down.

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:54.580
A couple things to
think about-- it

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.260
does create stability
in your account.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:03.250
For instance, when the market
crashed, down 55% percent--

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:07.225
the S&amp;P went down 55%-- the
question is if you were all

00:52:07.225 --> 00:52:09.080
in stocks, could
you stomach that,

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.380
for your portfolio
going down that low.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.290
That's what you have
to really ask yourself.

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:18.640
A portfolio 40% bonds,
which I would not

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:24.020
suggest for the 30 year olds
but maybe 50-plus year olds,

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.790
maybe 40% bonds.

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:27.980
But it depends on
your risk aversion.

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:31.520
AUDIENCE: But you're talking
about 2007, when bond interest

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.750
rates were 4 and 5%, and not--

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.950
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
Not in 2000.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:34.741
AUDIENCE: 1 and 2%.

00:52:37.014 --> 00:52:38.680
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
Right, but they

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:45.510
create stability in a portfolio,
and they create income.

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.010
They have their
place, and so you're

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.220
timing the market
with just bonds.

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.550
And there are ways
to get into bonds

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:53.840
and have a higher
interest rate if you

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:59.610
go into bonds such as corporate
bonds and less of Treasury.

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.620
But just keep in mind how it
felt, especially if you're

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:07.820
right around from retirement, to
have your portfolio go down so

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:08.320
low.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.179
But they do have a place
in asset allocation.

00:53:14.179 --> 00:53:16.220
AUDIENCE: I wonder if you
could speak a bit about

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.590
cognitive decline
late in retirement.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:21.390
A lot of what I
hear sort of assumes

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:24.970
that throughout the
retirement, one's mental acuity

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:26.490
will be fantastic.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:30.960
But the fact is, you could
have been financially literate,

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.800
and you may die young.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.600
But if you live
a long time, odds

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.160
are you're not going
to be in a position

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.630
to well manage your finances.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:42.790
So how should one plan
for that possibility?

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:45.880
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ: Well,
there's no real easy answer.

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.150
There's no expert
answer to that.

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.620
In fact, we mentioned that I
oversee the national program

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:55.380
with AARP, and isolation
for older people

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:56.730
is a really big issue.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.620
And isolation leaves
you-- not only

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.750
because that you said
cognitive-- you're

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.910
brain impact is
not quite the same.

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:07.502
But also there's a
lot of isolation.

00:54:07.502 --> 00:54:11.340
And so older people
are more likely to give

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:15.290
their assets to the house
cleaner, or all of the sudden

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:18.644
their best friend that just
happens to come in their lives.

00:54:18.644 --> 00:54:20.560
So I do think it's going
to be a real problem.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.850
But I think having
a financial adviser

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:29.950
that you trust be
part of your plan,

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:33.520
making sure that your children
are involved with your finances

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.810
as well, surrounding yourself
with trustworthy people,

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:40.670
having your estate plan in
place before you think--

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:42.200
when you've got
all your marbles.

00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:48.420
AUDIENCE: As I understand,
the 4% rule still

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:52.162
has some failure rate, probably
5% or something like that.

00:54:52.162 --> 00:54:53.620
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
I'm sorry,

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:54.745
that some people have what?

00:54:54.745 --> 00:54:57.630
AUDIENCE: The 4% withdrawal
rate rule still has

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.045
some failure possibility
of around 5% or--

00:55:00.045 --> 00:55:02.170
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
It's not it's not perfect.

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:05.630
The 4%-- it's a
guideline, and it's

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:08.760
gone through a lot of
analysis, Monte Carlo analysis.

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:13.610
It assumes that you
have at least 60%

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:19.310
of your assets in equities
at least so-- or actually

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:25.290
20 to 60% in equities.

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.410
I think you have to
look at it year by year.

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:30.680
There's also the rule of thumb
that you can increase your 4%

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.350
by the inflation rate each year.

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:35.780
But we also when you're
in retirement-- so here's

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:36.550
a couple things.

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:38.650
For younger people who
aren't in retirement,

00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:43.265
you also want to
have cash worth three

00:55:43.265 --> 00:55:45.150
to six months of expenses.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:46.760
It's called your emergency fund.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.270
When you get closer
to retirement,

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:51.180
you're five years
away, you want to up it

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.109
to probably one year,
maybe even two years

00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:55.400
like the gentleman that just
mentioned one to two years

00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:00.550
in cash as well so that
you're not in the situation

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:04.760
to sell your portfolio when
the market's not doing so well.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.510
So that's where it gets tough
when the market tanks, and you

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:09.600
want to think about
maybe taking less.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.600
AUDIENCE: Are there
resources where you can say,

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.390
OK, this is the
withdrawal rate and here's

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:19.530
the failure percent or failure
chance, chance of failure.

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.770
Are their online resources
where you can run simulations

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:25.305
and say, oh, maybe
I'll only withdraw 1%

00:56:25.305 --> 00:56:26.680
and here's the
chance of failure.

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.054
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
Oh yeah,

00:56:28.054 --> 00:56:29.805
there's a lot of
simulations-- schwab.com.

00:56:29.805 --> 00:56:31.262
Do we have one in
Schwab MoneyWise?

00:56:31.262 --> 00:56:33.148
FEMALE SPEAKER: We don't
have a retirement--

00:56:33.148 --> 00:56:33.920
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ: Oh.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.770
There's a lot of retirement
calculators that you

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:37.550
can go in and put in
different variables

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:42.400
and see what different
saving rates will do

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:48.230
and inflation rates and
withdrawal rates and so forth.

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:51.730
But I do think you have to
look at it year by year,

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:54.655
and again, it's a ballpark.

00:56:54.655 --> 00:56:57.030
AUDIENCE: So one thing I
haven't heard in this discussion

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:59.950
yet is the talk about
expense ratios for funds

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:04.170
and how important that can be in
terms of hundreds of thousands

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.340
of dollars over
an entire savings.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:06.640
CARRIE SCHWAB-POMERANTZ:
I wasn't

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.280
trying to sell product or be
the financial consultant here.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.920
But I'll just tell
you my own point

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.440
of view about the way I invest.

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:18.300
I'm a big believer in passive
investing and investing

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.520
in index funds and exchange
traded funds, which

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:28.310
are based on broadbased indices
such as the Standard &amp; Poor's

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:34.770
500 or there's international
versions and bond versions.

00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:36.830
But for my equity,
my US equity, I

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:41.060
like passive because they're
very low-cost investing.

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:44.080
And you're right.

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.200
For example, 1%
on your mortgage--

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:49.960
think how much 1% you
paying on a mortgage

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.100
jacks up your monthly payment.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:56.240
So expenses are
really important.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.990
Also the idea of
passive investing--

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:01.990
the majority of active
traders or active mutual funds

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:06.200
do not outperform
the broad indices.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.410
So there's something to that.

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:10.200
There's definitely some benefit
to do some active management,

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.800
but with indexing, you
get low cost plus you

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.810
lower your taxes,
which in a sense

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:19.500
creates a whole
other level of I'll

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:24.910
call alpha in your returns,
if you can reduce your taxes.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:29.330
And for people who don't have
the time to manage their money,

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:30.839
you are participating
in the market

00:58:30.839 --> 00:58:32.130
and that's what you want to do.

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:34.230
It's all about
participating, not

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:37.730
about trying to outperform
or do some little tricks.

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:39.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well
thank you all so much
