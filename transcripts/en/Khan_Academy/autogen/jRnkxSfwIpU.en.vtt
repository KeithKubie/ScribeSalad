00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.589
 The condition for a cake is needed 

00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:05.623
 35 grams of sugar and 50 grams of flour. 

00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:07.780
 Let me stress it. 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.306
 "For a cake 35 grams of sugar and 50 grams of flour are needed." 

00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:15.661
 And then it is said: 

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.888
 "For a muffin, 30 grams of sugar is needed." 

00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:19.810
 Let me also emphasize this. 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.550
 A muffin is needed 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.342
 30 grams of sugar and 65 grams of flour. 

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:28.768
 What do they want us to do? 

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:33.768
 Shona must use at least 460 grams of sugar. 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.200
 Let me emphasize this with a different color. 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 "The Shona must use at least 460 grams of sugar, 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.543
 to make cakes and muffins, 

00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:50.360
 as she wants to use at most 970 grams of flour. " 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.137
 I will use another color. 

00:00:52.137 --> 00:00:54.375
 "And she wants to use 

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.955
 at most 970 grams of flour. 

00:00:57.955 --> 00:00:59.984
 To create a system of inequalities, 

00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:02.399
 which presents Shona's terms. 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.545
 Let C denote the number of cakes she makes, 

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:08.215
 but the number of muffins he does. " 

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:11.535
 "Compile the inequality that it presents 

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:16.376
 the situation based on grams of sugar. " 

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.837
 And so - the situation based on grams of sugar. 

00:01:18.837 --> 00:01:20.822
 That was highlighted here in green. 

00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:24.758
 The Shona must use at least 460 grams of sugar, 

00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:27.138
 to make cakes and muffins. 

00:01:27.138 --> 00:01:28.635
 Let's see how we can record that. 

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:32.199
 How much sugar would she use for cakes? 

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:34.840
 Here we are told she needs it 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.480
 35 grams of sugar for one cake. 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.820
 So the amount of sugar it will use for all cakes, 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.469
 will be 35 grams per cake ... 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:46.919
 let me write it a bit clearer ... 

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:50.994
 35 grams per cake per cake count. 

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:53.920
 So that's how much sugar she's going to use for cakes. 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.519
 35 grams per cake per cake count. 

00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:01.829
 How many grams of sugar will be used for muffins? 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.459
 This will be 30 grams of sugar per muffin. 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.380
 So we have plus 30 grams of muffin sugar 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.516
 by the number of muffins. 

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:14.281
 So we have on M. 

00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.336
 This is the total amount of sugar for cakes. 

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:18.437
 This is the total amount of sugar for muffins. 

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.725
 And if you bring them together, 

00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:22.036
 this is the total amount of sugar it uses. 

00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:23.054
 Subject to the condition 

00:02:23.054 --> 00:02:26.842
 it should use at least 460 grams of sugar. 

00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:28.641
 Everything here is in grams. 

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.323
 This should be greater or equal. 

00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:35.723
 It should use at least 460 grams of sugar, 

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:37.243
 to do both. 

00:02:37.243 --> 00:02:37.765
 So it is. 

00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:39.352
 We can simply build inequality, 

00:02:39.352 --> 00:02:42.700
 which presents the condition based on grams of sugar, 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.637
 which is the condition here. 

00:02:45.637 --> 00:02:47.297
 Now let's look at this next question: 

00:02:47.297 --> 00:02:50.280
 "Compile the inequality that represents the condition 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.923
 based on grams of flour. " 

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:56.345
 Well, that's what we highlighted here with orange. 

00:02:56.345 --> 00:03:00.274
 It should use at most 970 grams of flour. 

00:03:00.274 --> 00:03:02.597
 So we have no more than 970 grams. 

00:03:02.597 --> 00:03:05.697
 How will we say this as an inequality? 

00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:08.532
 How much flour will be used for cakes? 

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:11.312
 It uses 50 grams of flour for cake. 

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:15.274
 50 grams per cake per cake count. 

00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:17.933
 This is the amount of flour it will use for cakes. 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.040
 And then for the muffins: 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.060
 it uses 65 grams of flour for muffin 

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.452
 by the number of muffins. 

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:29.332
 So this is the total amount of flour, 

00:03:29.332 --> 00:03:31.214
 which she will use. 

00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:36.214
 And this should be less than or equal to 970 grams. 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.373
 Less than or equal to 970. 

00:03:40.373 --> 00:03:41.615
 And we're ready. 

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:43.652
 And thus, if you want, 

00:03:43.652 --> 00:03:47.694
 you can ask: "Which couples C and M 

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.357
 satisfy both inequalities? " 

00:03:50.357 --> 00:03:52.493
 And then you can say, "Well, that's the combination 

00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:55.035
 of the number of cakes and muffins she can make, 

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:58.275
 to satisfy its real conditions. "
