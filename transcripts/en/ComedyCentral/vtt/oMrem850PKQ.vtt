â™ª I walk in the dark I cry

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.477
I'm sorry,
can I help you?

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.346
Oh, I'm one
of the artists.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.647
One of the
sandwich artists?

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.350
No, I'm one of the--
the artist artists.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.685
Have any of the pieces
sold yet?

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:21.755
I know it's early.
I haven't heard anything.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.024
But I highly doubt it.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.560
Well, no, it's just that people
don't really come in here

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.161
for the art.

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:29.530
We're a sandwich shop.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:32.466
So we sell food.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.001
Would you like some?

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:35.836
Are they...
free sandwiches?

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:38.739
You can order
and then pay.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.241
Okay, so how it
usually works.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.442
It's-- Yeah.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.479
High-quality lotion,
I'm gonna take the lotion.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.214
God.

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.316
(scoffs)
Gallery.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.584
Step into reality.

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:11.338
Oh.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.807
Ilana?

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:16.710
Are you eating
garbage bagels?

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:17.878
Why are you here?

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.682
Abbi sent me a Facebook invite
to her gallery debut.

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:25.485
Do you...
look... crazy?

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.088
Mm-hmm.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.190
Yeah, I do.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.626
I got locked out
and then I--

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.563
I just, like, ruined
her night completely.

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:39.266
I'm an idiot,
I'm like a dumb ass.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.767
I, like, can't function.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.369
Oh, don't be so hard
on yourself.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:43.737
Nobody's perfect.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.439
I'm not
a perfect dentist.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:46.640
I eat candy all the time.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.876
I got, like,
six cavities.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.611
Thanks-- thanks for--
Ahh!

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:51.879
Ooh, what?

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:52.946
Oh.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:56.550
Oh, my God.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.585
Oh, my God.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.587
The keys to
my apartment.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.356
Don't you ever
tell Abbi.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.657
You can't ever tell her.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.058
You can't ever tell her this,
this is--

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:09.763
I won't tell Abbi, but I've
told you several times

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:10.797
and I'll
tell you again,

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.432
phone, keys, wallet--
Every time.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.568
Phone, keys,
wallet, P-K-W.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.839
Your brain is a muscle, Ilana,
and I feel like that muscle

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.874
isn't getting
enough exercise.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.476
You need to do your
brain kegels.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.149
And five.
