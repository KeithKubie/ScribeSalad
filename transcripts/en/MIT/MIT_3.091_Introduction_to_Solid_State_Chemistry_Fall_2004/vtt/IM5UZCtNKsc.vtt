00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.230
A couple of announcements.
The contest ends today 5:00.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.460
Get the email to my address.
Wednesday will be the test,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.690
Test 1, and I will say a few words
about that, coverage through the end

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.920
of lecture on Wednesday.
What I am talking about today,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.150
I will not be testing you, but maybe
you might pay attention because

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.380
about a month from now we will ask
you a few skill testing

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.210
questions about it.
But it's one of those pedagogical

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.640
things. If I test right up until
the last thing I say,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.070
I don't think that gives you enough
dwell time. The flip side is there

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.490
are going to be a couple of lectures
now where it is not going to be on

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.920
the test, so I think you will deal
with it. Monday I will be giving a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.350
seminar on engineering education in
Halifax, so in my place will be

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.780
Professor Ballinger who will
competently substitute for me and

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:41.326
keep the ball rolling.
But I will be back Tuesday.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.500
And you can contact me if you have
some questions in connection with

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.500
the material. First thing,
I will begin with comments about the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.500
test. And that way we won't have to
worry about running out of time at

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.500
the end. The test is Wednesday the
29th, and it will be written during

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:52.300
the normal class time.
So if you take the test at 11:00

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.920
come here, but there is a plurality
of rooms because we want to have

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.530
some vacancies here.
If your last name begins A through

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.150
Ke, you will come to this room.
If your last name begins Kh through

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.760
Ya, you go to 50-340.
That is the gymnasium on the third

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.380
floor of Walker.
There is a gym up on the third

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:34.493
floor and will accommodate a couple
hundred people there.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:25.270
And for those of you at the very end
of the alphabet,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.540
we have a special room for you,
1-190, so everybody has some elbow

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.810
room. Please go to the assigned
room. And, by all means,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.080
if you are scheduled to attend class
at 11:00, please take the test at

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.360
11:00. Don't all come crashing into
1:00 because we don't have the room

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.140
or the number of exams.
So please go to the assigned room.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.420
Here is what the mechanics are.
You are going to just go to the room,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.710
as you normally do,
come on in, sit down.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.990
That's all you have to do,
just sit down. What is the purpose

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.280
of the test, by the way?
Why do I give you a test?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.570
It is to give you a status report.
I want to give you some feedback to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.850
tell you how you are doing soon.
There are two messages I can give

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.860
you.
Either keep up the good work or you

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.590
better change your strategy because
you are not mastering the material.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.330
That is all I am trying to do. I
am not trying to run a cross-check

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.060
on the admissions process.
As I told you, I believe that

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.790
everybody that is in this room has
the intellectual apparatus to pass

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.530
this class, so there is no
gamesmanship here.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.260
If you have been investing in the
time that I have asked you to,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:04:02.320
you will pass handily. There are no
tricks.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:50.660
You can look at old exams,
you can look at your homework,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.330
that's the kind of questions you can
expect. Nothing to broadside you.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.990
On the other hand, if you haven't
been keeping up,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.660
I hope that you won't pass so I can
tell you, look,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.330
you have to do things differently.
That's all. Bring five things with

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.990
you. You have five fingers,
five things. Periodic Table,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.660
Table of Constants, and you are
allowed an aid sheet,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.330
an 8-1/2 by 11 sheet of paper.
You can write anything you want on

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:36.460
it. You can write on the front.
You can write on the back.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:23.520
You can write on the edge.
I don't care. You can photocopy.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.050
You can photo-reduce. You can take
everything from the last ten years

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.580
of 3.091 and make it microdots.
I don't care. Whatever you want.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.110
That is three, Periodic Table,
Table of Constants,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.640
aid sheet. Something to calculate
with. There will be some

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.170
computations, so something to
calculate with.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.700
And I don't care if it is a
programmable calculator.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.230
The only thing is no wireless
devices. This has wireless

00:04:48.230 --> 00:05:07.460
Internet here.
You are not going to be sending

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
emails during and exam.
No wireless devices. And Lord help

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
you if a cell phone goes off.
And last thing, something to write

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
with. And, believe it or not,
I have students walk in and first

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
thing a hand goes up and says do you
have a pen? I cannot believe it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Make sure you have batteries that
are in a good state of charge in

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
your calculator.
We don't have 450 calculators for

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
you. And you will write.
We will give you the question paper.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:23.730
You just fill in on the paper,
hand it in. You don't have to bring

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.460
any paper. We will start you at
00:05 and we will stop you at 00:55.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.190
Stop when we ask you to stop out of
courtesy to your classmates.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.930
Everybody might like a little more
time. But 00:55 you stop and we

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.660
will have people collect them either
down here or at the back.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.390
And we will get you out of here in
an orderly fashion.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.130
So that is the mechanics.
Now, strategy. I want you to do

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.880
well.
I want you to be able to put your

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.640
best foot forward.
I don't want you to get all

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.410
frustrated and fail to show what you
know, so here are a couple of tips.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.170
First thing, read the test. That
comes as a big shock.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.930
A lot of people don't read the test.
They just open it up,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.700
and they just start working.
There's going to be, I don't know,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.460
four or five questions. Well, I
just put them down in the order that

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.230
came out of my head.
I don't put them in any strategic

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:35.593
order. I don't put hardest
first, easiest first.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:23.330
I don't even think they are in
chronological order by topic.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.660
I think it is just whatever. I
said, well, let's do something on,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.990
I don't know, pick a topic. What
are we asking you?

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.330
I cannot remember.
They are all made up and ready to

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.660
go. But pick a topic.
Pick something about the Periodic

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.990
Table. Maybe that's number one.
But maybe that is not your strong

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.330
suit, so don't start on number one.
But you don't know that there is an

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.660
easy one for you down at number four
if you haven't bothered to look at

00:06:46.660 --> 00:07:07.453
number four. So take a couple
minutes and read the entire test.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.500
And zoom on the easiest question for
you, that way two things happen.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.000
First of all, you build some
confidence. Secondly,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.500
you settle your nerves and then move
in ascending order.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.000
The second thing is try every
question because I give part marks.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.500
It's not all about the number. I
only give, I don't know,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.000
about 10% or 20% for getting the
right number in a computation.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.500
I tell my graders, if the student
demonstrates minimal acceptable

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.000
proficiency that student has to get
a passing score.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
If it is out of nine,
it has to be five out of nine.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
If it is out of ten, it has to be
five out of ten.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
If the student hasn't mastered the
basic concept,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
we will make sure that the grade
scheme gives a failing grade.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So if you demonstrate something by
writing an intelligent answer just

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
by outlining it and saying,
well, what I would do is I would

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
equate the energy and then solve for
lambda, I can see that you know what

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is going on. I can give five,
seven out of ten for that.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And then the person who actually
plugs in all the numbers and gets

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
the right number will get ten.
But if you say, well, I don't know

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
how to do this,
I am not going to bother,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
don't grade the paper. I will grade
the paper. I have some people that

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
say I am not doing this well,
oh, forget it. No, keep going.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Keep going. And leave tracks.
Write your thoughts.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
You don't have to write everything
in equations. You can give me an

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:21.570
outline how to solve.
Work parametrically to the greatest

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.730
extent possible.
Let's say you have to go through

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.890
three or four operations to get a
final number, well,

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.050
do it algebraically.
I have some people, as soon as they

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.200
see it, oh, they have the frequency
here. Oh, E equals h nu.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.360
I will plug in. E equals h nu,
so I plug in. I look up h and plug

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.520
in 6.6 times 10 to the minus 34.
They plug it in and make a

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.680
keystroke error right off the bat.
They got some number that looks

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.840
like for the wavelength they got the
distance from here to Chicago,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:09:07.746
and they are going to drag that
through the whole calculation.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:53.520
What are you doing that for?
Conservation of keystrokes. Don't

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.050
touch the calculator until the last
line. Work parametrically,

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.580
because I can grade easily. I can
look at that and go she knows what

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.110
is going on, eight out of ten.
Boom, we are done. You got the

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.640
wrong number, forget it.
She has a good grasp of the

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.170
material. Instead,
right off the bat you have some

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.700
stupid number and you are dragging
that through the calculations.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.230
You have negative wavelengths.
You have square root of minus one

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.870
for something else. Focus.
Answer the question.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.620
Don't play games with me.
If I am talking something about the

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.370
Bohr model and you start giving me
some core dump about what you know

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.120
about the Bohr model,
it doesn't go by the pound.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.870
I have read an entire page full of
words and given it zero because it

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.620
is not on topic.
Just be surgical,

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.370
give me the answer and move on.
But don't start snowing me. My

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.120
graders are smart,
smarter than you. They are.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.870
I have smart graders.
Do your own work,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.620
I mean it. Do your own work.
Here we are terrorists. Keep your

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.370
eyes on your own paper.
I don't want to see anybody like

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.120
this. If I see that,
I will just go up and reseat you.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.870
And, by the way, if you ever feel
that you are in a compromising

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.620
position, someone is pressuring you
for information,

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.370
just raise your hand and ask to be
reseated. We don't ask any

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.120
questions. As far as we know,
the person next to you has BO. Just

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.660
take yourself out of the situation.
And, by the way,

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.990
this business on working on every
problem is important because I have

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.330
seen some people who start working
on number one,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.660
but that is not their strong suit.
Let's say you have four questions,

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.990
you have 50 minutes, take out five
minutes to read the paper,

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.330
so that's 45 minutes. That's
roughly 10, 11 minutes per question.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.660
There are some questions that might
be a different length.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.990
You spend 10 minutes on number one
and haven't solved it yet.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.330
Well, another five more minutes.
That's 15 minutes. Now they are

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.820
getting steamed.
It's 20 minutes into the exam and

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.460
you are still working on number one.
And then they get really angry and

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.110
say I am going to solve this if it
is the last thing I do.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.760
Sure enough 11:55 comes,
it is the last thing they are doing.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.400
Now, think about the math. Let's
do the math here.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.050
Suppose there is an epiphany at
11:54 and you get a perfect score on

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.700
that question and it is worth 25% of
the paper. You get 25 out of 25,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.350
terrific. You got zero on the rest
because you didn't write anything.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:36.766
You see what I'm saying? Try all
the questions.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:24.750
And good luck.
I mean. There is no attempt to

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:45.533
deceive. Come prepared and you will
do fine. And our goal is to grade

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:32.250
those things and get them back to
you the following day.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:52.033
We give a rapid turnaround.
And we will post the model

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:39.750
solutions. And there will be a
different exam in the afternoon,

00:11:39.750 --> 00:12:00.533
but I think it only makes sense for
you not to discuss the paper with

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:47.250
people that are taking it in the
afternoon. We're trying to run a

00:11:47.250 --> 00:12:06.700
school here that has some
professional standards.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And there will be plenty of
information on the website and

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
whatnot. All right.
Well, let's get on with the lesson

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
today. Just to refresh our memories,
last day we looked at the average

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
valence electron energy as a measure
of reactivity.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And en route we discovered that we
can divide the Periodic Table into

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
metals, which is about 75% of the
Periodic Table.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
These have low average valence
electron energies.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:22.880
Which means that these elements are
very good electron donors.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.760
And up in the other extreme are
elements with very high average

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.640
valence electron energy.
These are electron acceptors.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.520
They cling to their electrons quite
tenaciously. And,

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.410
subsequently, we looked at
photoelectron spectroscopy which is

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.290
a technique that allows us to
determine binding energies,

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.170
ionization energies being just one
example. But we will see later on

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.050
that PES can give us other important
information that we

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.300
cannot calculate.
And then, towards the end of the

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.920
lecture, we started looking at
reactivity. And we put up this

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.530
hypothesis that our observation is
that octet stability seems to be an

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.150
attractive electron configuration.
So we saw the Noble gases. And then

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.760
we said you can also achieve octet
stability and electron transfer if

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.380
you look at elements that are just a
little bit rich of electrons versus

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:36.026
octet stability or a little
bit lean of electrons.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:26.140
And so we got to ionic bonding.
And I think we just got to the

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.280
point where we were able to start
looking at the energetics of that.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.420
And we ran out of time so I want to
resume that. I think I had managed

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.560
to get to this point here where I
show what happens when the cation,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.710
here sodium, is in contact with the
anion here, chlorine.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.850
And we reasoned that these two
eventually reach some kind of an

00:13:46.850 --> 00:14:07.100
equilibrium separation which we are
using lowercase r to represent.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:55.300
This is the separation measured from
the center of the sodium nucleus.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.610
And there is this separation which
is a balance of attractive forces

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.920
because the chloride is net negative
and the sodium is net positive,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.230
but both of them, regardless of net
charge, have electrons.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.530
And so when they become very,
very closely spaced there is mutual

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.840
repulsion of those electrons.
And so there is a repulsive term

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.130
here.
And so the balance of the attractive

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.390
term and the repulsive term
eventually leads us to this

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.660
situation where we have the
equilibrium spacing.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.930
And this equilibrium spacing is
denoted r sub zero or r naught.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.190
And r naught really is nothing more
than the sum of the ionic radius of

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:42.460
sodium and the ionic radius of
chloride. So we could just say r

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.730
plus plus r minus gives you r naught.
And right off the bat you notice

00:14:46.730 --> 00:15:05.060
that I am making a huge
assumption here.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:54.860
I am modeling the ions as hard
spheres. I am modeling them as

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.730
billiard balls of a finite dimension.
And so they eventually reach this

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.590
equilibrium position.
And we saw last day that we have a

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.460
Coulombic force of attraction which
you have seen before.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.330
Cation is plus one, anion is minus
one. But it doesn't have to be.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.190
This could be magnesium. Magnesium
would be 2 plus,

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.060
so in here you would put 2e.
Or I could have an oxide here,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.060
so I would put minus 2e.
In this case we just have one and

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.190
one. And then the repulsive term,
some positive coefficient and r to a

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.330
very high number.
N lies between 6 and 12,

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.460
and this is known as the Born
exponent. And this is a very high

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.590
number because it depends upon
electron-electron repulsion.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.730
These electrons, first of all,
there are many of them. And they

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.860
are in motion and moving at very,
very high speed. And so the result

00:15:46.860 --> 00:16:05.986
is that this repulsive term
is very, very intense.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:54.860
But very short order.
Beyond a modest distance you don't

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.730
feel the electron-electron repulsion.
So you need the mathematics to

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.590
imitate reality.
And that is why this is such a high

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.460
number. And down here,
what do we have? We have the sum of

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.330
these two bottoming out.
See, at very, very high values of r,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.190
one over r dominates.
At very, very low values of r,

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:18.060
one over r to the 10th dominates.
And in between the two cancel, and

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.460
here we are at the minimum.
And we can find r naught by looking

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.380
for the minimum.
How do we get the minimum?

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:32.300
We differentiate dE by dr. We take
dE by dr equals zero at r equals r

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.220
naught. And, coincidently,
what is the partial of energy with

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:42.150
respect to distance?
That is force. So what am I saying?

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:47.070
The net force is zero.
Attractive and repulsive forces are

00:16:47.070 --> 00:17:04.806
balanced. So everything
makes sense here.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:56.300
And we can solve this.
And, if we do so, we can actually

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.610
get a handle on that Born exponent
by solving the equation.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.920
And I am not going to do it.
I am just going to put it up here

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.230
without taking time.
And so what I get is the energy of

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.530
the system at the equilibrium
separation is given by minus z plus.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:17.840
This is the most general form.
This is the valence,

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:22.720
the charge on the cation times --
I will common factor this.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.180
The charge on the cation times e.
The charge on the anion times minus

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:33.630
e, so there is the minus e squared,
and divided by 4 pi epsilon zero r

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:39.080
naught, because now I am evaluating
this function at r naught,

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.540
one minus one over n where n is the
Born exponent.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:18:02.680
And this applies only at,
obviously, r equals r naught.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:53.420
But that is good because that is the
equilibrium separation.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.850
So that tells us the energy of what?
What have I formed here?

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.280
I formed a bond, an ionic bond.
So this is the energy of a single

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:14.560
ionic bond.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And what do we notice?
We notice that the value of E at r

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
naught is negative,
as it should be. It's a negative

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
number. And what are the
characteristics of this bond.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Well, there are two things that I
want to highlight.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
First of all, it is omnidirectional.
What do I mean by that?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
There is no preferred direction.
It could form in any direction

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
because the Coulombic field is
radial in all directions.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
There is no preferred orientation.
The field is radial. This is the

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
electric field.
So there is no preferred direction.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:53.130
And the second thing is it is
unsaturated. What do I mean by that?

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.260
Well, I show you one sodium and one
chloride. There is nothing saying

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.390
that that sodium,
its positive charge has not been

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.530
neutralized. It still has positive
charge, and there is nothing saying

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.660
another chloride could not stick to
it. We get another chloride and

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.790
another sodium sticking to the
chloride. This means it is not a

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.930
strict bond one-to-one.
It is not monogamous is another way

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:23.330
of putting it.
It allows for plurality of bonds

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:29.990
from any ion. Plurality of bonds
can form from any ion.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:36.660
And, if you take all of these ideas,
omnidirectional and unsaturated,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:43.330
it means that ions can keep glomming
on. And that result is we get large

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:59.260
arrays of ions. Well,
what does give us?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:54.660
Well, if I have a large number of
species glommed together that means

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.330
it is going to be solid at room
temperature because gases exist as

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.990
discrete particles.
We have either single atoms or

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:08.660
molecules consisting of small
numbers of atoms.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.330
You don't have gas molecules
consisting of thousands of atoms.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.990
When it gets to thousands of atoms
things start to condense because

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.660
there is a capacity to form other
bonds secondarily,

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:26.560
which we will get to in a little bit.
So just take it on faith.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.680
If you have a large number of atoms
in an aggregate,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.810
it is going to require that the
substance turn solid and condense at

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.930
room temperature.
And word array is loaded.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.050
These don't just sit down anywhere.
They sit down in a special way.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.180
And so what you're going to end up
with is, well,

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.310
let's go over that.
Here is sodium and chloride.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.430
They keep attaching and attaching
and attaching, but

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.140
we have two sizes.
We are modeling them as hard spheres.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.420
And so they are going to fit
together in a regular array.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.710
And so this means that they will
form a crystal.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:04.990
So we are going to have solids and
we are going to have crystal.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.280
And what do we mean by crystal?
Crystal is an ordered solid, as

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.570
opposed to a disordered solid.
And we will talk about both in a

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.850
little bit. Now I want to show you
that this comes necessarily from an

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.300
energetic standpoint.
It is a really cool derivation.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.920
I want to compare two situations.
Here is an ion gas. This is my

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.530
humble drawing to indicate discrete
sodium chlorine pairs.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.150
This is one of these pairs that I
have shown up here.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.760
It has a negative energy.
We see that we get a negative

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.380
energy by attaching the chloride to
the sodium. And I am saying suppose

00:21:45.380 --> 00:22:04.426
these form, as they have to
initially, in the gas phase.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:56.590
And they remain two atoms per ion
pair discretely bombing around in

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:03.190
the gas phase.
That is situation number one.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:09.790
Situation number two is I take the
same number, and I make a row.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:16.390
They are all in one row. So what
happens? I have only drawn three,

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:33.780
but now let's pump up the volume.
Here, let's get N Avogadro.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:26.460
If I have Avogadro number of these
things in a long line,

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.930
you can bet it is going to be a
solid. It's going to be a

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.390
one-dimensional crystal.
The question is can I show you,

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.860
from an energetic standpoint, that
the crystal is favored over having

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.330
the discrete set of pairs?
And you know the answer is yes

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.790
because I wouldn't set myself up for
failure like this,

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.260
would I? So let's take a look.
First of all, situation number one,

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.460
well, you know how to do that.
Because you know the energy of one

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:56.380
pair. So let's just multiply that
by Avogadro's number.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.300
E1 will simply equal N Avogadro
times the energy of the ion pair at

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.220
r equals r naught,
which we can then substitute N

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:11.150
Avogadro. I am doing this for plus
one minus one like sodium chloride.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:16.070
We can make it more complex later.
And you have to get N from

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:34.940
experimental evidence.
You cannot pull that out of theory.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:27.180
The Born exponent is determined
experimentally,

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:33.360
and there are tables of that.
Now let's get the energy for the

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.540
line. For that I am going to draw a
line of these.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:45.720
All right. So here is the sodium
and the chloride on each side,

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:51.900
and then we will go for another
sodium and another chloride

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.560
on each side.
And so now what I want to do is

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.680
start here at the center.
And I am going to count the

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.810
energetics. And what I am going to
do is say start with this ion,

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.930
add up the energy associated with
the interactions between that ion

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.050
and everybody else in the row and
then multiply it by Avogadro's

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.180
number, because that is the number
of atoms there are in a row.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.310
Sauce for the goose is sauce for
the gander. You say,

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.430
yeah, what about edge effects?
I got Avogadro's number of these

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:37.226
things.
What do you think the error is going

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.500
to be by failing to recognize that
at the end of 6 times 10 to the 23rd

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:12.500
I have over-counted some energy?
It is vanishingly small. So don't

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.500
get preoccupied by the end.
Work the big middle. And the

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.500
middle is everything here.
So we can start. This distance

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.500
here is r naught.
I know the energy in this first

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:52.460
pair would equal --
That is just going to equal minus e

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.380
squared over 4 pi epsilon zero r
naught. That is just what we have

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.300
seen before. But,
in addition, the field is continuing

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.220
to radiate so it is unsaturated and
it is omnidirectional.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:12.150
This cation feels the repulsive
force of the cation over here.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:17.070
This cation is attracting the
chloride next to it and it is

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:35.406
repelling the sodium as the
next nearest neighbor.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:26.610
So that is a repulsive term.
I have to add that up. I have got

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:31.220
to put that in because that is a
repulsive energy and that is going

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.840
to decrease the energy of the system.
So I have a distance here of 2 r

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.460
naught. And at a distance of 2 r
naught, I have a positive repulsive

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.070
term. I just plug into the
Coulomb's Law.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:49.690
And so that is going to be plus e
squared over 4 pi epsilon

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.750
zero 2 r naught.
Now what happens?

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.250
Let's keep counting.
Now the next one is the chloride.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.750
It is of opposite charge and it
exerts an influence,

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:04.250
only that is minus to plus so that
is going to give me a minus term

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.750
here. That's 4 pi epsilon zero 3 r
naught and so on and so on.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.250
I think you can see the way this is
going. Well, what about the Born

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.750
term? Forget the Born term.
The Born term is not going to be

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.250
felt, except in this first one.
I am going to forget it now, and

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.690
then I will patch it in at the end.
You don't need Born repulsion at 2 r

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:28.070
naught. That is a waste of memory.
Then what are we going to do? I am

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:33.460
only counting in one direction,
so I have to multiply this whole

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.840
thing by two because I have to count
both directions.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:44.220
Now I am going to common factor
this and will get minus e squared

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.610
over 4 pi epsilon zero r naught
times two, times this series,

00:26:49.610 --> 00:27:07.953
one minus one-half plus one-third
minus one-quarter, etc.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:27:00.450
So this series is broken into two
terms that are conveniently

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:05.900
representing two physical ideas.
This is electrostatics right here.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:11.360
The pre-factor embodies all the
electrostatics.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.810
And what is all this stuff?
Y is at one, one-half, one-third?

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:22.270
This is the instant geometry. That
is to say the instant

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:28.120
atom arrangement.
In this case it is a line.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:34.370
Now what I am going to do,
this is off of just that one central

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:40.620
cation. So now let's do it for all
of the ions. What I am going to do

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:46.870
now is I am going to multiply by N
Avogadro and then add

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:52.720
Born repulsion.
And we put all that together and

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:58.180
here is what it looks like.
It looks like. E equal to minus N

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:03.630
Avogadro e squared over 4 pi epsilon
zero r naught,

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:09.080
one minus one over n.
And I am going to call this whole

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:14.540
geometric factor here,
I am going to put it into one number,

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:32.480
and I am going to denote that the
Madelung constant.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:24.130
The Madelung constant is simply the
geometric factor.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:28.260
That is a number.
Let's put that there.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.390
And so now the question is,
what I am trying to prove to you is

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:36.530
that E2 is more negative than E1.
So, ultimately, what I want is what

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:40.660
is the relative magnitude of E2 over
E1? What is it?

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.790
Is it greater than one?
That's the question. If I can

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.930
prove that it is greater than one
that means that the line is more

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:53.430
stable than the set of ion pairs.
And if you look at this series,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.310
the series log of one, what is the
series expansion?

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:03.180
Log of one plus x,
what is it? It is x minus x squared

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.050
over two plus x cubed over three,
etc. If you plug in x equals one

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:12.930
that is our series.
One minus one-half plus one-third,

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:17.800
it is all there. If you go and work
that out, log of two and you have

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.680
two log two, by math you can show
that for the line r series m is

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.560
equal to two natural log of two,
which is 1.386 which is greater than

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.220
one.
So what have I shown?

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.660
I have shown that by taking
Avogadro's number of individual ion

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.110
pairs and putting them all together
in a line, the system's energy

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.550
became more negative.
So that is to say that it is

00:29:45.550 --> 00:30:04.233
favored. We could say an
energy level diagram --

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:55.070
This would be energy.
Here is zero. If this is the

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:00.150
energy of the pair,
let's make this E over E of the ion

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:05.220
pair, so this is one,
and we have just shown that for the

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:10.300
line, so this is Avogadro's number
of pairs, this is Avogadro's number

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:15.380
of ion pairs in a line,
that is 1.386. And then,

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:20.460
if you go the real sodium chloride
crystal and you do this same

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:25.070
calculation but in three-dimensions.
So that you take every sodium and

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.230
you count all of its nearest
neighbors, next nearest neighbors,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.380
next next nearest neighbors, not
only on a line but in the plane and

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.530
above and below in all three
dimensions and go through that

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:41.690
calculation, it is even more
negative. It is 1.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.840
475. Conclusion: if I start to
react sodium with chlorine,

00:30:45.840 --> 00:31:05.013
the result is a crystal, a
three-dimensional array.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:53.770
Because at every point the first
thing happens is electron transfer.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.550
Why? To get a stable octet. The
result, I've got ion pairs.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.330
Pluses attract to minuses, minuses
attract to pluses.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.100
They start glomming together,
but they don't stop with one plus

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.880
one. One plus one and then an ion
pair grabs another one,

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.660
another one. And, before you know
it, you have crystal.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.440
So this is simply the energetics of
crystal formation.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.220
This is a three-dimensional crystal.
You can consider this line a

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:39.440
one-dimensional crystal
because it is ordered.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:28.130
So I would call it a one-dimensional
crystal. This says that when it

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:32.260
comes to ions line-dancing trumps
ballroom dancing.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.390
That is what it is saying.
They would rather be in a line than

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:40.530
dance two-by-two.
That doesn't apply to all things,

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:44.660
but it does in this case. Now let's
look at properties.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.790
Let's talk about properties.
See, we've gone a long way. We

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:52.930
started with this hypothesis of
octet stability and I'm talking

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:56.820
about properties of ionic crystals.
They are solid at room temperature.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.460
Why? What are the bonds? These
are huge energies,

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.110
Coulombic forces, high melting
points and boiling points.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.760
Why do they have a high melting
point and boiling point?

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.400
Because, when you ask yourself that
question, you should consider what

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.050
is the thermal energy versus the
bonding energy?

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.700
If the bonding energy is very
strongly negative,

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.350
thermal energy isn't great enough to
disrupt those bonds and allow those

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:41.433
bonds to be broken and
then have fluidity.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
So strong bonds means high melting
points and boiling points.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Transparent to visible light.
A sodium chloride crystal is

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
transparent to visible light.
I know table salt is white, but

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
that is because you have power and
you have multiple surfaces

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
scattering, but a large crystal of
sodium chloride is clear and

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
colorless. And it is faceted.
You can see that it has the shape.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:53.860
If you take one of those individual
grains of sodium chloride,

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.730
look at it carefully, you will see
the edges look like this.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.590
Why is it transparent to visible
light? Here is how you ask that

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.460
question. When you want to know if
something is transparent to visible

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.330
light or not, here is the mystery
material and here is visible light.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:13.190
And what is going to allow for
absorption or some interaction with

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.060
visible light?
Inside here you have electronic

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:21.140
states.
And you have to ask yourself is the

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.420
energy difference here,
the delta E in the electronic states,

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.710
how does that compare with the E of
visible light?

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:33.990
What is the E of visible light?
You know it is about two to three

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:38.280
electron volts.
This has what? Sodium plus.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.570
It is isoelectronic with neon.
Chloride minus. Isoelectronic with

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.850
argon. What do we know about the
average valence electron energies?

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.820
We just saw it in the first slide.
It is up around 13,

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.460
14, 15 electron volts.
This thing is not going to touch it.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:58.110
It won't lay a glove on it.
So what happens? It goes through.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:01.760
Nothing. All that glitters is not
gold, but it must have free

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.400
electrons. This has no free
electrons. They are all bound.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.050
That is how you determine if
something is transparent.

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.700
It is going to be electrical
insulators. There are no electrons

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:16.350
to move around.
They are all bound,

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:36.233
hard and brittle. Why?
Because they have strong bonds.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:24.280
Strong bonds means the material will
resist and applied force.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:28.560
You apply a force and the material
will resist it until you have a

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.850
force great enough to break the
bonds. So you don't have ductility,

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:37.140
which is what you have in metal.
That is what makes metal so

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:41.420
fascinating, because metallic
bonding allows the atoms to glide

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:45.710
over one another without resulting
in catastrophic failure.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:35:05.686
Whereas, ceramics, ionic crystals
will resist until they shatter.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
There are only two categories.
It is either elastic with full

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
resistance or destruction.
Again, the bonds soluble in water.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Other polar solids, we will have to
come back to that later.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
They melt to form ionic liquids.
Ionic solids form ionic liquids. I

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
showed you last day what happens
when they form and we were able to

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
electrolyze and make fantastic
metals like magnesium.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Where do we find these ionic
crystals? Where do we look?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:21.690
Well, you need electron transfer.
You need a donor and you need an

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:25.090
acceptor. So where are the good
donors? Donors are over here,

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.490
the metals on the left end of the
Periodic Table.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:31.890
And where are the acceptors?
On the right side of the Periodic

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.290
Table. If you take some from column
one or two and you mix it with some

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.690
from column eight and nine,
bingo, you have reaction. Here is

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.090
an example that shows some very,
very metallic elements, groups one

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.490
and two, and some non-metallic
elements over here,

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.890
five, six and seven.
And so you can imagine that if you

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.290
mix these, if you take sodium and
you mix it with chlorine

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:56.160
you get sodium chloride.
But there is nothing saying you

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.490
cannot take magnesium and mix it
with oxygen and make magnesium oxide.

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:04.830
And you would expect that that
would be a much stabler compound

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:09.160
because, instead of plus one
attracting plus one,

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.490
now you have plus two attracting
minus two. So the Coulombic forces

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:17.830
are much, much greater.
And that will be reflected in what?

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:22.410
Higher melting point.
Higher boiling point.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:27.240
Greater resistance to reactivity.
Does it strike you odd that maybe

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.080
magnesium oxide,
one of its applications would be

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.910
refractories? That is to say brick
work in high temperature furnaces,

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:41.740
maybe tiles on the Shuttle, to
resist high temperatures because of

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.580
the high internal bonding.
You see, there is a system here.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.820
Chemistry isn't a litany of facts.
We started out with a few simple

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.460
assumptions and look at what we are
doing now. We are designing systems,

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.110
building engineering systems,
making materials choices. It is

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.760
fantastic. We can do this one more
time. Let's do it one more time.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.400
I want to show you something else.
I want to show you another way to

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.050
get a sense of these energies.
And for that I want to look at the

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.700
energy starting from real material.
See, up until now I have been

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.350
talking about gas phase,
single atoms, all this stuff.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:36.633
Let's look at this reaction.
Sodium solid plus chlorine gas.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:25.810
It is a diatomic molecule.
And I want that to react to give me

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:31.630
sodium chloride as a solid and
crystal. **Na (s) + 1/2 Cl2 (g) --

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:37.450
NaCl (s, xtal)** I want an ordered
solid. For this I need to invoke a

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:43.270
couple of bits of science.
First one is Hess' Law. Hess' Law

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:49.090
states that for any chemical
reaction, the energy change

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:53.830
is path independent.
That is to say I can now reroute

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:57.490
that sodium plus chlorine reaction
and go a different way,

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:01.160
but I still end up with the same
change in energy.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.830
Why? It is because it is state
function. It is the same thing as

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.490
gravitational energy.
Whether you take the elevator to

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:12.160
the top of the Hancock Tower or
whether you walk up the stairs,

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.820
the change in gravitational
potential is identical.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:19.490
You might be winded doing it the
second way, but when you get to the

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.160
top and you are at the 60th story
your gravitational potential is

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.860
independent of how you got there.
And that is what this is saying.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.590
It is analogy. Energy change is
path independent.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:34.330
Now I am going to break this into
elementary steps and look at the

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:38.060
relative contributions.
What did we do so far? We talked

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.790
about this reaction here where we
had chloride ion in the gas phase

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.530
plus sodium ion in the gas phase.
We started with gaseous sodium to

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:49.260
make gaseous sodium ion and gaseous
atomic chlorine to make gaseous

00:38:49.260 --> 00:39:08.053
chloride ion through
electron transfer.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:56.850
All the gas phase.
Very idealistic, but that's not the

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:00.710
way the world works.
I want to get to there starting

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:04.560
from real sodium and real chlorine.
The first thing I am going to do is

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.420
I am going to convert the sodium
into vapor. This is sodium going to

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.280
sodium gas. And then I am going to
take sodium gas and I am going to

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.140
make this into sodium gas plus
electron. Oh,

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:34.813
by the way. This is called
sublimation.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:24.610
This process is sublimation,
solid to vapor. This is called

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:29.220
ionization, gas phase species loses
an electron. That is the strict

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.840
definition of ionization.
So I am already there with sodium.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.460
Now, chlorine I have to do a little
bit more heavy lifting here because

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:43.070
chlorine starts as a diatomic
molecule. The first thing I have to

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:47.690
do is bust that in half.
This is called dissociation.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:52.140
I need to dissociate the chlorine.
And now I have to convert atomic

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:56.420
chlorine into ionic chlorine.
I am going to do that by adding an

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.710
electron. And this reaction here is
the inverse of ionization,

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:04.990
isn't it? Its ionization would be I
take one of the electrons on

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:09.280
chlorine and throw it away.
Here I am actually throwing an

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:13.570
electron onto chlorine.
So this reaction is called electron

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:17.850
affinity. You can think of electron
affinity as sort of the ionization

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:22.260
in reverse of the ion.
It is the minus.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.790
It loses an ion.
And this reaction is what we call

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:31.330
crystallization.
Those are the five steps.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:35.860
Let's see if we can find
information. I am going to call

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:40.390
this one. Let's see.
I think I labeled this one two,

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:44.930
ionization I labeled three, electron
affinity I labeled four and

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:49.460
crystallization I labeled five.
And thanks to Professor Hess, I can

00:40:49.460 --> 00:41:09.453
now say that the total energy to
form sodium chloride should equal --

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:58.720
In other words,
delta H formation of sodium chloride

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:03.450
should be independent of paths.
I should be able to take the sum of

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:08.170
all of those delta Hs.
Oh, I'm using H. Forgive me.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:12.900
This is the term enthalpy. It is
essentially equal to internal energy

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:17.630
for condensed systems,
but when you look in the books

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:22.150
sometimes they will use this term.
For a first pass,

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:26.460
let's just say for condensed systems
we can go with it.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.760
We are going to take the sum of the
delta H's or the deltas H for all of

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.070
these little reactions.
Let's get some numbers here.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:39.380
Let's see. This is called the
Born-Haber Cycle,

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.690
what I am showing you right now.
And this was put up by two people,

00:41:43.690 --> 00:42:02.780
Max Born and Fritz Haber. Actually,
I put this up --

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:51.550
If you are interested in reading
about these people,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:55.100
there is a Nobel prize website here
you can learn about all these guys.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.660
This is Haber. He got the Nobel in
1918. He invented ammonia synthesis

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.210
with catalysis by iron.
A brilliant chemist. And Born

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.770
worked on a number of things,
including the Born exponent, and

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:09.330
taught himself crystallography sort
of as something to do during World

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:12.880
War I. And that is how come he got
involved in this,

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.440
because obviously this is talking
about crystal formation.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:36.213
So that is why this is called the
Born-Haber Cycle.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:24.610
Anyway, if you go to your Periodic
Table you will find that on the one

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:29.220
side you can get what is called the
enthalpy of atomization.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.840
And that is this first term.
Delta H1 is enthalpy of atomization.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.460
And if you look it up,
for sodium it is about 108

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:43.070
kilojoules per mole.
Actually, what I did was used a

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:47.690
different source so I have 107.
But that is OK. What's a kilojoule

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:52.140
between friends?
Number two is dissociation energy.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.420
And dissociation energy is 122
kilojoules per mole.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.710
And number three is ionization.
If you flip the Periodic Table over

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:04.990
you will have the ionization energy
of sodium, first ionization energy,

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:09.280
and it is about 5 eV which, when you
convert, is a whopping 496

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.570
kilojoules per mole.
This is looking bleak,

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:17.850
people. Look at this. I have three
out of the five energies,

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:38.000
and they are all positive.
This thing better start turning

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.500
negative soon or we are going to
change the way the world works here.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.500
And I know that sodium chloride
forms because,

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.500
if I look on the webpage at 3.
91, you see this down here, this is

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.500
sodium in kerosene.
That is metallic sodium that would

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.500
keep in kerosene so it doesn't react
with the oxygen in the air.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.500
And that is an Erlenmeyer flask
that has been filled with chlorine

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.500
and sodium has been added to it.
And there is the sodium chloride

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.500
crystal that forms between the two
of them. And,

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.500
because I looked at the website,
I know this reaction has a negative

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:52.140
number.
There is an interesting observation

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.420
about electronic structure,
by the way. Metallic sodium is

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.710
toxic to humans.
Chlorine gas, toxic to humans.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:04.990
Electron transfer, we cannot live,
we die without sodium chloride. So

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:09.280
this tells you that it's electron
structure that governs.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.570
Let's find some good news here.
Well, I have some good news.

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:17.850
Number four, electron affinity.
Chlorine has a high valence

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:22.130
electron energy.
It gobbles up electrons.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:26.390
And that is a negative number.
That turns out to be negative 349.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.660
That is for part four. And then
the last one, huge.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:34.930
If you go to the Madelung
calculation, it is basically this

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:39.190
one over here.
Multiply by 1.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:43.460
475 and you end up with minus 787
kilojoules per mole.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:47.730
When you add this whole thing up,
it gives you a net of minus 411

00:44:47.730 --> 00:45:06.526
kilojoules per mole or about
4 eV per ion pair.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:57.090
Good. I was worried there.
That is the Born-Haber Cycle.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:02.180
And the Born-Haber Cycle allows you
to see what the relative values of

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:07.270
the different energy components are.
Again, what's the utility of the

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:12.360
Born-Haber Cycle?
It deconvolves that reaction of

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:17.450
sodium plus chlorine into elementary
steps that are related to electron

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:36.700
transfer and acquisition.
That is the value of Born-Haber.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Here is a chart that just shows the
positive energies,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
and you can see the various
components, and then the negative

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
energies and the net.
But look at the lattice energy,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
the Madelung energy component is
huge which tells you that when ions

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
form they really want to continue to
glom onto one another and form that

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
giant crystal.
And so this is now a chart of just

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
a component number five,
the lattice energies.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Keep this number in mind,
787. Let's check. Here is sodium

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
plus chlorine.
It's 787. So that is one plus

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
against one minus.
But look at this one.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
There is magnesium with oxygen.
That is 3,791. It is almost 4,000

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
kilojoules per mole.
And magnesium oxide has a melting

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
point of 2,800 degrees C.
Sodium chloride is about 801

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
degrees C. Aluminum oxide,
aluminum plus oxygen. Look at this.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:22.570
Aluminum oxide almost 1,
00 kilojoules per mole. Alumina is

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:27.140
really stable,
which is why it takes so much energy

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:31.710
to make aluminum.
That is why aluminum is so

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:36.280
expensive because the oxide is so
stable. And why is it so stable?

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.850
Because aluminum ions have charge
of plus three and oxygen ions have

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:45.420
charge of minus two.
When you go into the Coulombic term

00:46:45.420 --> 00:47:05.106
here, instead of one times one,
it's three times two. That is it.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
So you want high temperature bricks,
what are you going to make them out

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
of? It's pretty obvious.
It's all here. It all falls out.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
It is fantastic. And this is an
interesting thing.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
This is ionic radii with a noble
gas configuration.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
All of these have engaged in
electron transfer.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
So, just to get your bearings,
there is our pal sodium plus.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Sodium plus is isoelectronic with
neon. It only has 10

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:21.660
electrons, not 11.
Magnesium 2 plus,

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.990
it is also isoelectronic with neon.
What do you see? You start with O

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:28.330
double minus, so that is oxygen plus
two electrons.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:31.660
It is 1.45. Ten electrons again,
1.33. Ten electrons again. Ten

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.990
electrons again.
Ten electrons again.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.330
What is happening? The same number
of electrons, but the number of

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:41.660
protons keeps going up,
up, up. The positive force of

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.990
attraction of the electrons on the
outside is greater and greater,

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:48.330
and that pulls everything in. And
so not only is aluminum highly

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:52.300
charged, but it is physically small.
It is tight, buff,

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.920
a lean, mean fighting machine.
It goes after oxygen because it is

00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:01.530
small. It is a high charged density.
And likewise down here.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:06.150
You see all of these. Look at
beryllium 2 plus,

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:10.760
very tiny, charge plus two.
Why do we need to know all of this?

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:15.380
I can take you and immediately
start designing batteries,

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:34.760
because we need ions in motion,
we need small ions in motion.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:24.420
All of this stuff is related,
fantastic stuff. What you see is

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:28.850
that the radius changes with atomic
number for constant electron number.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:33.280
Well, we are getting close. I
talked a lot about the exam so I

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.710
don't have a lot of time left to
talk about the structural metals.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:42.140
I will just give you this one
little slide so you get a sense of

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:46.570
what we are up against.
Number one structural metal is

00:48:46.570 --> 00:49:05.873
steel. Number two is aluminum.
Number three is magnesium.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:55.300
Aluminum and magnesium are both made
by ionic liquid electrolysis,

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:59.610
just as I showed you last day.
But look at the tonnage differences.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:03.920
Aluminum is 25 million tons per
year for the whole planet.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.230
Magnesium was 60,000 tons.
Iron or steel, 800 million tons,

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:12.530
almost a billion tons of steel.
That is virgin metal.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:16.840
That is not recycled.
And steel is the most recycled

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.140
material.
It sells for about 20 cents a pound,

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.420
so that represents about one-third
of a trillion dollars.

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:29.710
20 cents a pound. You build a
steel plant with a capital cost of

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:33.990
several billion dollars.
You bring iron ore from one part of

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:38.280
the planet, carbon,
limestone, you put it into this

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.570
reactor and you ship this all over
the world. Go to the grocery store

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:46.850
tonight. Tell me what you find on
the shelf that sells for 20 cents a

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:50.880
pound. This is amazing.
This is modern industrial chemistry

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:54.640
showing its strength.
Before you go, it is the weekend,

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.410
I will send you off with a joke. We
studied the Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:02.170
principle. The story goes
Heisenberg is giving a seminar.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:05.930
He has a rental car and is zooming
to the airport.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:09.700
He is doing 100 miles an hour down
the Mass Pike and gets pulled over

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:13.460
by a State Trooper.
The State Troopers says I want

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:17.230
title and registration.
He says, hey, buddy, where is the

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:36.193
fire? Do you know how
fast you were going?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.500
And Heisenberg says,
no, but I know where I am.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.566
Get out of here.
