00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Let's start in an unusual place

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.000
with an Australian supermodel called Miranda Kerr.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.880
She's pretty, successful and very rich.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.780
She's been named 3 years in a row as the sexiest woman on the planet.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.980
She's also deeply interested in developing her mind.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.720
And so she's become very involved with yoga, chanting, meditation and Japanese Buddhism.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.240
She recites "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo" twice a day,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.000
invoking the mystic law of the Lotus Flower,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.060
which asserts that Miranda and the cosmos are two sides of the same coin.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.240
Kerr has had some real difficulties with loneliness and loss:

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.620
her first boyfriend died in a car crash,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.840
a later lover turned out to be a crook,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.000
she married Orlando Bloom but it all fell apart pretty quickly.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.060
Her needs are real and she's turned for comfort and help to the east.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.180
She might have looked elsewhere.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.400
She might have found that Plato and Tolstoy had things to teach her.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.320
Maybe she could have been touched by Bach or medieval architecture.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.780
It's not as if the West doesn't also have a deep and long engagement with the sorrows of life

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.240
but like so many spiritually curious people

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.620
she didn't end up engaging with its culture.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.540
Instead she joined the Soka Gakkai Buddhist movement.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.800
How has it happened that Western Culture has largely bypassed Miranda

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.920
and so many others seeking enlightenment?

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.080
It's not their fault, they needed something and the West wouldn't give it to them,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.180
so they went elsewhere

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.280
and their decision tells us something hugely important

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.100
about how the Western World handles

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.100
or more accurately mishandles its culture.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.600
You'd imagine that Western University philosophy departments

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.740
would be natural places one might go in search of wisdom and consolation.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.140
But they aren't interested in these things:

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.400
they're trying to define Ontological Naturalism,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.740
Situate Wittgenstein and his proper historical perspective,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.480
footnote a volume of late Heidegger

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.280
and compare Plato's Phaedrus with Aristotle's ethics.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.080
It's not a bad way to spend the time

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.880
but it isn't arguably very helpful to anyone with anything resembling a real problem.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.420
Academic institutions have turned culture, which should help us to live and die well,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.420
into abstract scholarship.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.640
Buddhist philosophies are not like this:

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.800
they're on a mission to help you find your way through the challenges of existence.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.700
That's why it would be extremely strange to hear

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.600
at a middle-class dinner party that the person next to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.120
you had found solace in Hegel or Aristotle

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.200
but totally unsurprising to learn that they'd been to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.160
Nepal and were entranced by its traditional wisdom.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.380
We are missing out on a crucial resource.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.100
The great figures of Western cullture almost

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.100
all wanted culture to function as an instrument for the pursuit of a wiser life.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.000
Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Schiller, Tolstoy and Proust:

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.480
all wanted culture to be not an obeject of academic study

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.880
but a living resource that could offer council and direction,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.700
for when a boyfriend has died or someone has been fired,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.840
much as the Eastern Western tradition has always believed.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.200
It's time to return Western Culture to its rightful ambitions

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.900
not in order to win out over the East

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.560
but in order to stand as its legitimate equal.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.220
In the pursuit of a path

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.220
to human flourishing.
