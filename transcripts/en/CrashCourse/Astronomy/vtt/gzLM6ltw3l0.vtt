00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.979
The previous episode of Crash Course Astronomy
was a bit of a brain-stretcher. We saw that

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:13.340
the Universe is expanding, space is expanding,
and it’s carrying galaxies along with it.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.970
That means it was denser in the past, and
at some point — 13.82 billion years ago,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.939
to be fairly precise — all of space, time,
matter, and energy was compressed into a single

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.779
infinitely dense point. Astronomers call this
the singularity, which is as good a name as any.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.239
Something caused this singularity to suddenly
let loose, expanding violently, cooling, and

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.960
forming the Universe we see today. Coming
to grips with this idea took a while for astronomers,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.100
but nowadays the current working model for
how the Universe started is with a Big Bang.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.780
All the galaxies we see are moving away from
each other as space expands between them.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.060
That is, on large scales. Remember the ruler
analogy, where on small scales the expansion

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.860
is small, and on bigger scales the expansion
is faster. That’s why distant galaxies appear

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.730
to be rushing away from us faster.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.290
On small scales, the expansion is small enough
that gravity can overcome it. The Andromeda

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.020
galaxy, for example, is about 2.5 million
light years away. That means it should be

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.060
moving away from us as at about 50 or so km/sec.
But because of our mutual gravity, it’s

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.270
moving TOWARD us; its motion locally through
space is more than enough to overcome the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.920
expansion of space between us.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.180
It’s like running up the down escalator.
Run fast enough and you can make it to the top.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.020
But every galaxy has gravity, and there are
a lot of galaxies in the Universe! That adds

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.500
up, and should affect the expansion rate.
It’s a lot like the idea of escape velocity:

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.680
Throw a rock hard enough and, even though
gravity will slow it down, it will escape.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.000
But if you don’t throw it fast enough, it’ll
slow, stop, reverse course, and fall back down.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.200
Astronomers fully expected to see this effect
on the expansion of space. If you looked on

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.759
the very largest of scales, you’d expect
to see the Universe slowing down, the gravity

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.020
of the matter in the Universe itself putting the 
brakes on the expansion. And with the discovery

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.360
of dark matter, that meant the Universe should
be slowing down even more than we first thought!

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.440
But when they went looking for evidence of
this, what they got instead was probably the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.060
single biggest shock in the history of astronomy.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.660
In the 1990s, two teams of astronomers were
using the world’s biggest telescopes to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.250
peer as deeply as they could into the Universe.
They were looking for incredibly distant supernovae.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.420
And not just any kind, but special ones called
Type Ia’s.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.110
I talked about these before. They occur when
a white dwarf increases in mass until electron

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.700
degeneracy pressure can no longer sustain
it against its own gravity. It collapses,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.520
undergoes a catastrophic wave of thermonuclear
fusion, and explodes.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.050
The beauty of these types of supernovae is
that they all occur when the mass of the white

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.760
dwarf gets to about 1.4 times the mass of
the Sun; that’s the magic number where pressure

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.330
overcomes gravity, and they go kablooie.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.480
That makes them good standard candles: objects
whose intrinsic brightness, whose luminosity,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.220
is known. Knowing that, plus measuring how
bright they appear to be in a telescope, lets

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.980
you calculate their distances.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.660
Then those can be compared to the supernovae
redshifts, which is a different way of getting

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.580
their distance. This then tells you how fast
the Universe is expanding on really big scales.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.300
But the results they got didn’t make sense.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.540
Time and again, the supernovae were all fainter
than they expected. It was as if the predictions

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.000
based on the redshifts were underestimating
the distances to the exploding stars. The

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.760
astronomers did everything they could to see
if maybe they had made a mistake somewhere,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.410
including making a literal list of things
that can make stars look fainter — intergalactic

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.370
dust, different chemical compositions for
the stars that blew up — all kinds of things.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.180
But in the end, both teams independently came
to the same conclusion: The supernovae were

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.990
farther away than expected.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.150
And that meant something truly shocking: the
expansion of the Universe was accelerating.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.080
Now remember, that’s nuts. We were expecting
the expansion of space to be slowing down

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.610
due to the gravity of all the matter in the
Universe. But instead, it was speeding up.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.160
It’s hard to overstate how shocking this
is. It’s like tossing a rock in the air,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.120
and instead of it slowing down and falling
back down into your hand, it shot upwards

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.790
faster and faster, defying Earth’s gravity.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.850
Of course, scientists were skeptical. Many
still are. But in the end, several other independent

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.690
measurements have verified this result. The
Universe is not only expanding, but that expansion

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.709
is getting faster every day.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.500
What could possibly cause such a thing?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.660
To be flatly honest, we don’t know. Well,
not exactly. But whatever it is acts like an

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.560
energy suffusing space, pushing on the expansion.
And we can’t see it, so it’s invisible.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.790
We already have dark matter, so naturally
this got tagged “dark energy.”

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.540
It seems to be a property of space itself,
a tiny bit of energy in every single cubic

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.930
centimeter of the Universe. The amount per
cc is incredibly small, but there are a lot

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.850
of cubic centimeters in the Universe. It adds
up.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.370
And we can add it up. Now that we have measurements
of this, we can take an inventory of the Universe!

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.570
We can total all the matter and energy in
the Universe, making a sort of budget of stuff

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.400
in the cosmos. When we do, it looks like this:

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.320
95% of the universe

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.720
is made of stuff we can't directly see.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.960
Normal matter is outnumbered 20 to 1. Maybe
we should rethink calling it “normal.”

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.780
So if 2/3rds of the cosmic budget is made up of dark
energy, it must have some pretty big effects, right?

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.680
Yeah. Like, changing the eventual fate of
the entire Universe.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.950
A big question – one of the biggest – is,
“Will the Universe expand forever?”

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.000
Well, astronomers have a framework to answer
this question: We call it the geometry of

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.270
the Universe. Matter has gravity, and gravity
bends space, so is there enough matter in

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.380
the Universe to stop the expansion? The geometry
of the Universe mathematically describes its

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.660
overall curvature, the shape of space on the
largest scales of all.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.389
To be clear, this concept is important to
cosmologists, but it can be weird and confusing

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.840
to someone who is just learning about all
this. Still, a lot of astronomy classes teach

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.920
it, so I’m going to go over it very briefly, and if you want
more information, we have links in the dooblydoo.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.699
The idea behind the geometry of the Universe
is that if there’s enough matter in the

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.500
Universe the expansion will slow, stop, and
then everything will recollapse; a sort of

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.380
Big Bang in reverse. If there’s not enough
matter then the Universe will expand forever.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.040
And in between the two there’s just enough
matter that the expansion slows, but never

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.040
quite reaches 0 until an infinite amount of
time in the future. Conceptually, it’s a

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.620
lot like escape velocity.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.030
It was once thought that the geometry of the
Universe, tied to the amount of matter in

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.610
it, determined its destiny. But dark energy
threw a monkey in the wrench for that, and

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.100
geometry alone doesn’t determine the eventual
fate of the cosmos.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.710
We think there’s enough dark energy in space
to ensure the expansion will continue forever,

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.690
despite the geometry. Dark energy is just
too powerful, and will always drive the expansion

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.240
of the universe ever-faster.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.080
So, for now, the answer as far as we can see,
is: Yes, the Universe will expand forever.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.780
OK, there’s one more brain-melty thing we need to talk
about. For this part you might want to sit down.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.060
Space itself is expanding. As light travels
from one galaxy to the next, it fights that

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.300
expansion, losing energy – just like you
use up energy climbing a staircase. When light

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.380
loses energy its wavelength gets longer – that’s
what cosmological redshift is.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.690
The more distant the galaxy, the faster it
recedes, and the more energy light loses as

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.090
it travels to us. But wait. At some distance
from us, space would be expanding so quickly

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.050
that a galaxy in that part of the Universe
would be moving away from us at the speed

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.699
of light. Anything farther away would be swept
away from us faster than light.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.400
Now, before you start complaining, yes, this
IS possible. The speed of light is the ultimate

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.930
speed limit in the Universe – if you’re
traveling through space. But space itself

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.680
is exempt from that rule; it can expand at
whatever speed it wants. The matter in it

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.919
– galaxies, stars, and such – is swept
along with it, so they’re not traveling

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:48.180
so much through space as with it.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.110
When you solve the equations to calculate
distance and redshift, the distance a galaxy

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:57.370
would have to be from us to be moving away at
the speed of light is about 13.8 billion light years.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:03.240
Here’s the fun thing: We can still see galaxies that far
away. We can even see them farther than that. How?

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.139
It’s because that distance is how far the
galaxy is from us now. When it emitted that

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:12.690
light the Universe was much younger, smaller,
and the galaxy closer to us. It would’ve

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.540
been about 4.5 billion light years away at
the time, and the light took over 9 billion

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.729
years to get here. Back then, the space between
us and the galaxy wasn’t expanding as rapidly,

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:27.389
so the light could keep pace. now, after all
this time, the space between us and that galaxy

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:30.949
means we’re moving away from each other
at lightspeed. But back then we were close

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:32.500
enough to see each other.

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:36.800
For that same reason we can see galaxies that
are moving away from us faster than light,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.830
because when they emitted that light there
was less space separating us. The most distant

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:46.410
galaxies we see are now about 45 billion light
years from us. We call this the radius of

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.080
the observable Universe. It’s essentially
the cosmic horizon.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.670
Mind you, the actual Universe may be far larger
than this… who knows, maybe even infinite.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:01.590
But we can only see galaxies that are, by now,
45 billion light years away. That’s our horizon.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.160
If space were simply expanding, the size of
the observable Universe would expand as well.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.930
But we have dark energy, and space expands
more rapidly every day. That means a truly

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.160
distant galaxy’s light is fighting more
and more expansion all the time – it’s

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.850
like climbing an ever-steepening staircase.
Compared to a constant expansion, a galaxy

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.490
in an accelerating Universe has to be closer
for us to see it. It’s losing energy faster.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:30.360
Worse, that fight gets harder every day. A
galaxy just at the cosmic horizon, right on

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.190
the edge of the observable Universe now might
be visible, but in the future the space between

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.510
us and it will have expanded even more. The
light can’t beat that expansion, and it’ll

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.070
never reach us. The galaxy, over time, disappears.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:48.360
This has a weird and unnerving effect: The
observable Universe is getting smaller. The

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.330
cosmic horizon is approaching us. Eventually
it’ll be so close that every galaxy in the

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.320
sky except our own will lie beyond it. At
that point our own galactic gravity may overcome

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.870
the expansion of space, so we’ll remain
intact, but the sky beyond will be black,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.010
the edge of the Universe hanging over us just
a few hundred thousand light years away instead

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.360
of tens of billions.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.670
It’s the ultimate irony. The Universe itself
is expanding, but we see less of it every

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.510
day.
So we’d better study it while we can; we

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.670
may only have a few trillion more years left
to figure this all out.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.709
Today you learned that the majority of the
Universe is made up of dark energy, a currently

00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:28.320
mysterious entity that pervades space. We
don’t know exactly what it is, but we can

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.170
understand what it does – it accelerates
the expansion of space. We think this means

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:38.760
the Universe will expand forever, even as our
view of it shrinks as space expands faster all the time.
