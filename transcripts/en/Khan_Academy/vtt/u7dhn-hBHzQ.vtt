00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's say that we're interested in
approximating what

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.939
the square root of 4.36 is equal to.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.859
So we want to figure apro, we want to
figure out

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.440
an approximation of this, and we don't
have a calculator at hand.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.030
Well, one way to think about it is we know

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.780
what, we know what the square root of 4
is.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.520
We know that this is positive 2.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.740
The principle root of 4 is positive 2.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.464
So, okay, this is going to be a little bit
more than two.

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:28.400
Well, let's say that we wanna get a little
bit more

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.677
accurate, and so what I'm going to show
you in this video

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:35.025
is a method for doing that, for
approximating the value of

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:38.910
a function near, near a value where we
already know the value.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.570
So what am I talking about?

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.000
So let's just imagine that we had the
function.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.766
We have the function f of x is equal to
the square root of

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:53.340
x, which is, of course, the same thing as
x to the one-half power.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.570
So we know what f of 2 is.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.058
We know, we know that f of 2, I'm sorry,
we know that f of 4 is.

00:01:01.058 --> 00:01:04.519
We know that f of 4 is the square root of
4, which is

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.465
going to be equal to 2 or the principle
root of 4, which is

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:13.378
equal to positive 2 and what we want to
approximate, we wanna figure out

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:17.513
what f of, we wanna figure out what f of
4.36 is equal to.

00:01:17.513 --> 00:01:19.631
This is just another way of framing the

00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:22.553
exact same question that we started off
this video.

00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:25.740
So let's just imagine our function.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070
Let's just imagine it for a second.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.397
So, let me draw some axes.

00:01:32.397 --> 00:01:35.436
This is my y-axis.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:44.284
This is my, this is my x-axis, and let's
graph y is equal to f of x.

00:01:44.284 --> 00:01:46.389
So let's say it looks something like this.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.360
Y equals f of x looks something like that.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.200
That's pretty decent.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.671
All right, so that's, that right there is
y is equal to

00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:00.820
f of x, and we know f of 4 is equal to 2.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.260
F of 4 is equal to 2, so this is when x is
equal to 4.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.340
I haven't drawn it really to scale, but
hopefully, this is clear enough.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.852
So that right over here is going to be 2.

00:02:11.852 --> 00:02:12.710
That's f of 4.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:20.280
And what we wanna approximate is f of
4.36, so 4.36 might be right around, right

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.620
around there, and so we want to
approximate,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.870
we wanna approximate this y value right
over here.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.718
We want to approximate that.

00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:32.371
Right over here is f of 4.36, and, once

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:36.120
again, we're assuming we don't have a
calculator at hand.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.690
So, how can we do that using what we know
about derivatives?

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.769
Well, what if we were to figure out an
equation for the line

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.460
that is tangent to the point, to tangent
to this point right over here.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.262
So the equation of the tangent line at x
is equal to 4, and then we use

00:02:56.262 --> 00:03:01.916
that linearization, that linearization
defined to approximate values local

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:06.750
to it, and this technique is called local
linearization.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.010
So what I'm saying is, let's figure out
what this, the equation of this line is.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.800
Let's call that l of x.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.500
And then we can use that to appro, and

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.910
then we can evaluate that at 4.36, and
hopefully

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.620
that will be a little bit easier to do

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.360
than to try and figure out this right over
here.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.130
So how would we do that?

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.395
Well, one way to think about it, and
obviously, there are

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:35.763
many ways to express a line, but one way
to think about it is,

00:03:35.763 --> 00:03:41.165
okay, it's going to l of x is going to be
f of 4, which is 2.

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:46.403
It's going to be f of 4 plus the slope,
the slope at, at x equals

00:03:46.403 --> 00:03:51.253
4, which is, of course, the derivative f
prime of 4, so

00:03:51.253 --> 00:03:56.500
that's going to be the slope of this line
of l of x is f prime of 4.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.130
Let me make that clear.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.833
So this right over here is the slope.

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:03.500
The slope when x is at, at x equals 4, so

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.481
this is a slope of this entire line, and
so any

00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:09.305
other point on this is gonna be f' of 4
plus

00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:12.770
the slope times how far you are away from
x equals 4.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.920
So it's going to be times x minus 4.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.370
Let's just, let's just validate that this
makes sense.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.485
When we put 4.36 here, when we put 4.36
here, actually let me

00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:27.810
zoom in on this graph just to make things
a little bit clearer.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.603
So, if this is, so I'm gonna do a zoom in.

00:04:31.603 --> 00:04:33.760
I'm gonna do a zoom in.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.960
I'm gonna try to zoom in into this region
right over here.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.630
So, this is the point.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.640
This is the point (4, f of 4), and we are
going to graph l of x.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.670
So let me do that.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.560
So this right over here is l of x.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.850
That's l of x.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.313
And let's say this, right over here, this
right over

00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:06.359
here, is the point (4.36, f of 4.36), and
the way

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:11.505
that we're, we're gonna approximate this
value is to figure

00:05:11.505 --> 00:05:16.580
out what, to figure out, what this value
is right over here.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.706
And what is this one going to be?

00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:27.193
This right over here is going to be, this
is going to be (4.36, L of 4.36).

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:31.946
This line evaluated when x is equal to
4.36, and what is that going to be?

00:05:31.946 --> 00:05:34.910
What is that going to be equal to?

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:35.320
Well, let's see.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.340
Let's just evaluate it.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.470
L of 4.36 is going to be f of 4.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.641
So, it's going to be 2 plus the
derivative, so the

00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:50.830
slope of this line plus f prime of 4 times
x minus 4.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.740
So, 4.36 minus 4 is going to be times
0.36, and that makes sense.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.621
You're starting at 2 and you're saying,
okay, my

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:03.590
change in x, my change in x is 4.36.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.100
So, my change in y is going to be my slope
times that change

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.580
in x to get me that value, to get me that
value right over there.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.765
So, let's figure out, let's figure out
what this, let's

00:06:17.765 --> 00:06:22.170
figure out what this thing, what this
thing actually is.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.350
So to do that, we need to figure out f
prime of 4, so let's go back up here.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.800
I'll try to leave actually, I'll leave
this little visualization here.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.663
So let's see, f prime, f prime of x is
going to be

00:06:34.663 --> 00:06:40.622
one-half x to the negative one-half just
using the power rule over here.

00:06:40.622 --> 00:06:46.142
So f prime of 4, f prime of 4 is equal to
one-half

00:06:46.142 --> 00:06:51.663
times 4 to the negative one-half, which
is, of

00:06:51.663 --> 00:06:56.932
course, equal to one-half times one-half.

00:06:56.932 --> 00:06:58.119
4 to the one-half would be 2.

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:00.264
4 to the negative one-half is going to be
one-half.

00:07:00.264 --> 00:07:03.080
So, this is equal to 1 4th.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:10.048
So L of, we deserve a little bit of a drum
roll now, L of 4.36 is equal

00:07:10.048 --> 00:07:16.680
to f of 4, is equal to f of 4, which is
eq, let me just rewrite it.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:23.860
It's f of 4 plus f prime of 4 plus, gee,
why am I switching to that color.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.520
Let me do the yellow.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.571
Plus f prime of 4, times, times,

00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:36.001
times, 4.36.

00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:39.383
4.36.

00:07:39.383 --> 00:07:42.802
Let me make this actually a new color,
just so we see it.

00:07:42.802 --> 00:07:48.467
So, 4.36, so times 4.36 minus 4, minus

00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:54.130
4, and actually let me make all the 4s one
color,

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.816
too, so you see it's the same, so just
like that.

00:07:59.816 --> 00:08:01.464
So what is this going to be?

00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:05.670
Well, this we already established is
positive 2.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.000
This we already established, and we do
this in a yellow color.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:19.390
This, we already established is 1 4th, and
this part right over here is 0.36.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:24.507
So, this is going to be equal to 2 plus 1
4th times

00:08:24.507 --> 00:08:29.862
0.36, is 0.9 or is 0.09, so this is going

00:08:29.862 --> 00:08:35.250
to be equal to, this is going to be equal
to 2.09.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.645
So that is our approximation and should be
at

00:08:37.645 --> 00:08:39.974
least the way, based on how I graphed it,
a

00:08:39.974 --> 00:08:42.630
little higher than the actual value of the
square

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.447
root of 4.36, but we could write that up
here.

00:08:45.447 --> 00:08:49.010
This is going to be approximately, let me
just write it this way.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.942
The square root, I'll just write it down
here.

00:08:51.942 --> 00:09:00.002
So we could say the square root of 4.36,
which is the same thing as f of 4.36.

00:09:00.002 --> 00:09:04.198
This is approximately equal to 2.09.

00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:07.549
Now let's just say we happen to find a
calculator, and just

00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:11.247
out of curiosity let's see how good of an
approximation that is.

00:09:11.247 --> 00:09:13.150
Let's get a calculator out.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:22.220
And so, we wanna do the square root of
4.36, and we get 2.088.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.660
So, we actually, if we round to the
nearest hundredths,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.170
we got a pretty good approximation just
like we saw.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.832
In this, in this indicative graph right
over here, it is,

00:09:31.832 --> 00:09:36.320
our approximation was indeed a little bit
higher than the actual value.
