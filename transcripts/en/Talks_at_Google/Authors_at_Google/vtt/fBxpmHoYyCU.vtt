00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.180
MAEVE HIGGINS: Hi.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.350
Thank you so much.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.230
It's funny that like nobody
sat in the front row.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.480
But then you guys just
became the front row,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.700
because you're just one back.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.347
KELLY: It's a very cozy
atmosphere we have, isn't it?

00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:22.430
MAEVE HIGGINS: I mean, no.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.097
A really wide, weird room.

00:00:26.097 --> 00:00:27.055
KELLY: I feel like we--

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:29.090
MAEVE HIGGINS: And like lights.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.910
I wouldn't say cozy,
but I would say

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.770
thank you so much for
giving up your time

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.369
and coming to hear us chatting.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.910
KELLY: We would do well to have
like a little fireplace here,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.600
or--

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.391
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yes.

00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:42.530
KELLY: --a comically
oversized fish tank.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.780
MAEVE HIGGINS: And maybe drinks.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.460
Yeah?

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.712
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:47.712 --> 00:00:48.420
KELLY: OK, great.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.740
Thanks so much for
joining us today.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.240
MAEVE HIGGINS: Of course.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.120
KELLY: Your book is amazing.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.161
Everybody should read it.

00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:52.972
It's fantastic.

00:00:52.972 --> 00:00:54.180
MAEVE HIGGINS: Thanks, Kelly.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.680
KELLY: Yeah.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.080
But I want to chat with you
a little bit about your home

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.567
life, and where you came from.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:00:59.400
MAEVE HIGGINS: Sure.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.170
KELLY: So you've made the rounds
from a comedian to an actress

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.720
to a writer.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.620
And you write a lot.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.911
MAEVE HIGGINS: Like if
something doesn't work out, then

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.707
I just go.

00:01:10.707 --> 00:01:13.040
KELLY: You write a lot in
your book about your home life

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.220
in Cobh and how that--

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.610
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yes.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.030
KELLY: --influenced you.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.490
So can you tell the
audience a little bit

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.280
about where you come from
and what your family is like?

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.071
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yes.

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:21.390
So I'm from a place in
Ireland called Cobh.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.410
Is there any other
Irish people here today?

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.860
Oh, oh my god.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.760
That's cool.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.230
You know Cobh?

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.510
Yeah, so it's like
down, down south.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.767
And it's actually a
big immigration town,

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:34.850
which I've been thinking
about recently because it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.980
relates to my work here.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.070
Because I grew up from in
where everybody left from,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.140
like a million people
left from Cobh.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.670
This is a long time ago,
like during the famine,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.130
which is now over.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.690
Obviously we're fine.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.970
I'm actually really full.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.120
But I grew up there.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.750
I'm one of eight children,
which is maybe a little bit more

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.980
than the norm I would say.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.430
Like we still have big families
in Ireland, but eight is a lot.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.500
And very happy childhood.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.160
And but I do think that's
where like my obsession

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.919
with immigration started,
because we learned about it

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.660
in school all the time, even to
like inappropriate levels where

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.330
I remember learning
about Maritime tragedies

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.080
of like the boats leaving
Cobh and crashing.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.870
And then this one local
historian came into us

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.480
and said the people
would be clinging

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.750
on to the sides of the
boats, and the other people

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.350
would be chopping
their hands off.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.895
And I was like, maybe seven.

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:30.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.000
And I don't know that that's
ever been verified anyway.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.040
So always in my mind
that was like oh,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.070
I'm from this place
where people leave from.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.150
And so I write a bit about that.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330
And I write about
Annie Moore, who

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.220
I've been thinking
about these days

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.300
so much because she's the first
immigrant through the gates

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.770
of Ellis Island.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.950
She left from my hometown
of Cobh in like 18--

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.870
it was like the
150th anniversary.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.520
I can't really do the--

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.860
it was like 1898 or
something I think.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.740
Is that right?

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.560
150.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.010
I don't know.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.140
Anyway, it was
like 150 years ago.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.960
And she was an
unaccompanied minor.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.070
She was 17 years old.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.720
She left with her
two baby brothers.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.770
So three unaccompanied
kids coming across.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.417
No documents, no passport,
no visa, nothing.

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:22.500
And they were welcomed in.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.791
And they were reunited with
their parents, who had come

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.350
here years earlier to make--

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.060
get an apartment and
start to make a living.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.464
They lived on the
lower east side

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:32.630
for the rest of their lives.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.720
And I just think how different
it was for them compared

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.240
to what's happening
to kids today and just

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.530
all the various issues of
race and stuff around that.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.760
KELLY: You also lived
in Zimbabwe as a child.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.593
MAEVE HIGGINS: I did
live in Zimbabwe, yeah.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:49.320
Any Zimbabweans here?

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.960
No?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.660
What, are you nodding your head?

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.842
Like you are?

00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:55.228
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:03:55.228 --> 00:03:57.070
MAEVE HIGGINS: Oh,
you're like, as

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.407
if there'd be Zimbabweans here.

00:03:58.407 --> 00:03:59.644
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:59.644 --> 00:04:01.269
AUDIENCE: It's that
it's an unfortunate

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.660
comparison between Irish and--

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.590
MAEVE HIGGINS: Right.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.480
True, very true.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.730
So much easier for white
immigrants from Europe

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.550
to get here than it is for
black immigrants in Zimbabwe.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.010
In fact, I-- yeah, I have a
friend at the moment who is

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.610
trying to get the 01 visa, which
is the one I'm on, which is

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.160
the alien of
extraordinary ability.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.830
He's like won this big
film festival in Zimbabwe

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.060
two years ago.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.334
I was on a hidden
camera show in Ireland.

00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:27.000
Like so anyway--

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.499
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:31.890
--he technically is probably
more extraordinary than I am,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.210
but it's proving a
lot more difficult.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.140
And so anyway we
lived in Zimbabwe.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.260
The whole family went to
live there for two years.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.530
My dad was in construction.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.490
He was building a
hotel over there.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.540
And I think that was a
really valuable experience

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.510
for me, just from--

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.700
if any of you have kids, I don't
have any kids that I know of.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.215
That's like a terrible joke.

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.570
You're shaking your head.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.485
You're like, a Google
executive would never say that.

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:04.860
Kelly and I were
talking earlier,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.230
and she normally has to
interview Google executives.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.460
Or not Google executives--

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.626
KELLY: Executives generally.

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:13.390
MAEVE HIGGINS:
Executives generally.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.580
KELLY: None of whom
I hope watch this.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.660
MAEVE HIGGINS: No, but
I mean they're great.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.220
But I mean they wouldn't
make terrible jokes.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.844
They're better.

00:05:18.844 --> 00:05:19.660
That's better.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.640
They wouldn't be like,
I don't have any kids

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.392
that I know of in
like that dumb voice.

00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:25.600
KELLY: I think that's lovely.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.269
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:29.352
MAEVE HIGGINS: But anyway,
what I was going to say

00:05:29.352 --> 00:05:32.662
is like if you do have kids, I
really think it's cool to like,

00:05:32.662 --> 00:05:34.870
if you can at all, and it's
a hugely privileged thing

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.270
to be able to do, to
move country and have

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.340
them live somewhere
else when they're small.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.260
So that they can
understand they're

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.690
not the center of the
world, them and everyone

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.530
who looks like them.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.050
Because in Ireland
everyone is very--

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.190
I mean, like look.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.150
You and me could be sisters.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.800
And so it really was
a great thing for me

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.960
to go away and
see like, oh, here

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.280
is all these other ways
of living basically.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.780
KELLY: Yeah.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.029
And you write about growing
up in a family where humor

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.447
was prized above all else.

00:06:06.447 --> 00:06:08.030
So how did that
affect you as a child?

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.180
Can you tell the audience
about your family?

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.013
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yeah.

00:06:11.013 --> 00:06:11.846
I mean, I think--

00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:13.720
I don't know if it's
like a big family thing,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.261
if it's an Irish
thing, but certainly

00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:18.450
being funny in my family was--

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.930
no one cared if you're
athletic or clever or--

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.340
being funny was like the thing.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.290
And it wasn't just like
nice funny, you know?

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.940
Often there's like
an edge to humor,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.220
and that's definitely
the way my family is.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.070
Where you kind of sit around the
table and you're a little bit

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.240
scared, and then it starts.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.310
And it's tough, but it's
like you show your affection

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.477
for people by bullying them.

00:06:49.477 --> 00:06:51.310
KELLY: I grew up in the
same kind of family,

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.976
and I'm curious if
that's the experience

00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:55.005
of a lot of other Irish
people in the audience.

00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:56.380
MAEVE HIGGINS: I
mean, everyone's

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.847
too nervous to put
their hands up,

00:06:57.847 --> 00:06:59.430
because they've been
bullied so badly.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.596
KELLY: They're all very shy.

00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:02.482
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:02.482 --> 00:07:04.690
MAEVE HIGGINS: But what,
how many are in your family?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.550
KELLY: Oh, it's small.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.049
Just two.

00:07:06.049 --> 00:07:07.870
But I've got loads of
cousins, like dozens.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:08.830
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yes.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.680
Yeah, I would definitely count
our cousins and even our aunts.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.420
And my aunts still give
me a really hard time.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.320
And yeah, it's
just never-ending.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.790
But I mean, I think that's
good if you end up working

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.250
as a comedian the way I did.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.430
But also I would say at
least two of my six sisters

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.560
are funnier than I am.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.130
Like Rosie my sister, who still
lives in Cobh where we grew up,

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.500
and she's a beautician in Cobh.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.790
And she is like--

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.710
first of all, she knows
all the town secrets,

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.550
because she does all their
waxing, and you know.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.800
And then and eyebrows
and everything.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.960
And then she's a really
good Impressionist.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.840
And she's just like
so sharp and funny.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.460
But she doesn't have
like a compulsion

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.767
to show off about it
like some of us do.

00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:52.600
KELLY: When did you
realize that being funny

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.340
was your superpower?

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.170
MAEVE HIGGINS: Oh,
well I'm not being

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.510
self deprecating when I say
I'm not good at anything else.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.230
Like I'm good at writing,
and I'm good at being funny

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.460
and do those two
things together.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.360
But I didn't realize the
writing thing until about like

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.920
five years ago.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.310
And I still need a
lot of outside what,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.980
like proof of that.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.110
Like now I'm like I
write for the New York

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.995
Times, that has to be--
mean something, you know?

00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:24.995
KELLY: Yeah, validation.

00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:26.078
MAEVE HIGGINS: Validation.

00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:29.090
But with being funny I was
always like, I'm funny.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.610
Even though in school and
everything I was quiet,

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:36.169
but I was like the kind of
judgmental outsider one.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.419
And also, I think,
being female, it's

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.059
harder to be overtly like I'm
the funniest one in the room.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.150
You're more sly about it.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.102
And so that's kind of
what I always have known.

00:08:47.102 --> 00:08:48.935
KELLY: Yeah, well it's
used to great effect.

00:08:48.935 --> 00:08:49.976
MAEVE HIGGINS: Thank you.

00:08:49.976 --> 00:08:51.710
KELLY: So your writing
has been compared

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.590
to if David Sedaris and Tina
Fey had a daughter, which

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.740
I think is perfect.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.080
MAEVE HIGGINS: I mean, that's
who's on the cover of the book.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.310
KELLY: I know.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.400
Isn't that beautiful?

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.075
MAEVE HIGGINS: But it's also--

00:08:59.075 --> 00:08:59.360
KELLY: And so accurate.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.610
MAEVE HIGGINS: Don't you
think it's kind of grotesque?

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.550
Because Tina Fey
and David Sedaris

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.600
wouldn't have a daughter.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.290
Also, like obviously
David Sedaris is a gay man

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.050
and wouldn't have a child
with a straight woman.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.160
And she is not that
much older than me.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.220
KELLY: If you could update
it to fan fiction of who you

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.857
would like to have a daughter.

00:09:20.857 --> 00:09:22.940
MAEVE HIGGINS: No, I'd
love them to be my parents.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.460
KELLY: Sure.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.940
MAEVE HIGGINS: But I just think
in the natural order of things

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.520
it would be highly unusual
to have a 13-year-old mother

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.020
and a kind of an
older gay man be my--

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:36.874
be my parent.

00:09:36.874 --> 00:09:38.790
KELLY: I guess I see
where you're coming from.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.380
MAEVE HIGGINS: Do
you know what I mean?

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:39.710
KELLY: Yeah, I
know what you mean.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:40.751
MAEVE HIGGINS: But it's--

00:09:40.751 --> 00:09:41.940
Glamor magazine said it.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.460
And then we were
all really happy,

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.510
because it's hard
to get good quotes.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.135
So we were like, yeah
put it out there.

00:09:47.135 --> 00:09:47.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:47.890
KELLY: Yeah.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.000
So who do you look to
for writing inspiration?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.624
MAEVE HIGGINS: For
writing inspiration,

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:55.610
I mean, I definitely, I tend to
read lots of nonfiction books

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.860
about war.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:06.535
So but for funny writing, I do
love David Sedaris actually.

00:10:06.535 --> 00:10:07.035
Daddy.

00:10:07.035 --> 00:10:10.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.014
God, I sometimes think--

00:10:17.014 --> 00:10:19.430
KELLY: Well, I'm interested
in hearing about the war books

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.045
as well.

00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:20.920
Do they influence it?

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.753
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yeah.

00:10:21.753 --> 00:10:24.260
I don't know that they
influence my writing.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.140
I mean like I certainly--

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.220
I write here about
when I went to Iraq.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.190
And I did a workshop in Iraq.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.981
And I definitely
didn't want to be

00:10:32.981 --> 00:10:34.730
one of those people
who come from the west

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.620
and like land there and spend
a few weeks there and go

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.040
on about like oh, the
sound of the mosque

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.460
in the early morning,
or the usual crap that

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.250
like I feel like white
Western people write

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.960
when they go anywhere there.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.830
Or they're like, actually,
the people were friendly.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.220
This kind of-- I hate that.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:56.780
KELLY: Yeah.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.005
MAEVE HIGGINS: So maybe it was
helpful to me that I do read.

00:11:02.005 --> 00:11:03.440
There isn't really--

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.420
I think my favorite book of the
last years is called like no--

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.910
what's it called again?

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.070
I told you, I'm so dull today.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.820
It's a book about Afghanistan.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.920
And it's an American who
went to live in Afghanistan.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.460
Anand Gopal is
the writer's name.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.530
It's called like
No Country For--

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.831
or like No Good Country For
The Living or something.

00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:28.580
Can you Google it?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.210
Can you Google it?

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.230
Just like everyone
who makes that joke.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.751
No Good Place For The--

00:11:37.751 --> 00:11:40.000
No Good Country For The
Living or something like that?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.125
AUDIENCE: Give me a second.

00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:42.270
MAEVE HIGGINS: Sorry.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.275
No reception.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:50.790
Anyway, it's a really cool
book because basically he was--

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.000
I think he was like a
neuroscientist, young,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.410
just studying neuroscience.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.260
And then he was downtown
when the World Trade Center

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.070
attacks happened.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.050
And he was like stuck
under a car all day.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.290
And that made him think suddenly
about like America's place

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:05.940
in the world, and
about geopolitics

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.560
in a way that he hadn't before.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.750
And then he just decided
to move to Afghanistan.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.190
And he lived there and
he learned the language.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.400
And he like got a motorbike
and traveled around

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.180
and had access to like even
one member of the Taliban.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.650
And so he just learned so much.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:24.090
And then he wrote about it in a
way that was and so informative

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.480
about what really happened
there, and what the American--

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.280
why it's such a mess.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.280
And he also has these
really great human stories.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.230
He traces like three people.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.120
One a Taliban commander,
one is a widow

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.040
who ended up in Parliament.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.620
And then he just--

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:45.450
the combination of a news
story deeply researched

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:50.130
and like on the ground,
and also the human.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.060
Both the human cost
and human opportunity,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.090
because both of those things
happen in war obviously.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.880
And so I loved his writing.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.460
And I would say then when
I am writing about Iraq,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.810
or I also went to Iran,
then I try and think.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.032
There's only so much you can
be aware of your own biases

00:13:07.032 --> 00:13:08.490
or whatever, but
I am always trying

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.675
to think like what if I
didn't grow up in Ireland

00:13:10.675 --> 00:13:11.800
and didn't live in America.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.500
Like what would I
really be thinking?

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.730
Or what's really happening?

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.690
That's helpful.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.189
KELLY: I certainly
see a lot of ties

00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:19.690
to that in your journalism, so
your podcast and the articles

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.272
that you write for
the New York Times.

00:13:21.272 --> 00:13:22.350
That makes total sense.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.266
Where do you find your
reading recommendations

00:13:24.266 --> 00:13:26.032
around those issues?

00:13:26.032 --> 00:13:27.240
MAEVE HIGGINS: I mean, I am--

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.530
I definitely have a lot of
like immigrant journalists

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.160
that I follow.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.640
It's not hard to find good,
interesting work written by--

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.350
like if I'm going to read about
the Mexican-American border,

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.010
I want to read about it from
a Mexican point of view too.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.550
Like very simple.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:53.640
There's very simple ways to,
I think, inform yourself.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.630
And like it is kind of amazing.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.161
It is kind of amazing
when you realize

00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:04.070
all the different points
of view that I'm getting.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.380
You just need to scratch
the surface a bit

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.204
and look a bit deeper.

00:14:08.204 --> 00:14:09.620
KELLY: I bet a lot
of the audience

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.060
hasn't had a chance
to read the book yet.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.950
And I'd love to give them
an insight into what you

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.033
did in Iraq, if you could
tell them about that.

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:15.220
MAEVE HIGGINS: Oh, sure.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.020
So I did a comedy workshop.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.700
I'm talking all about war
and I did a comedy workshop.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.700
And I went there in 2016.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.350
And I was in Erbil,
which is up in Kurdistan.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:32.120
And it's like a very safe
place, but I did tell my parents

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.650
that I was going to Kurdistan.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.720
I didn't specify like Iraq.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.690
And then I got two other
comics to come with me.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.230
Well, one is-- he's a TV writer.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.560
Joel Randazzo his name is.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.440
And he used to
write for The Onion.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.450
And then he wrote
for At Midnight,

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.080
and a few different places.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.080
And then Mo Amer, who's
a Texan comedian who

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.500
tours with Dave Chappelle.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.200
But he's Texan by way of like
his family are Palestinian.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.620
And he's Arabic speaking.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.140
So the three of
us went out there

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.080
and we did a workshop with
40 of our Iraqi peers.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.480
I was obviously
like a bit hesitant

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.990
about coming from
America to teach.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.510
The history of American
involvement in Iraq

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.040
has never been good.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.980
And then also to
like hey, we're going

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.940
to-- don't you think
jokes are so important?

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.230
And to teach like
comedy or whatever.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.260
But I did my research.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.910
I also, coming from
Ireland as you know,

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.100
we were a conflict-ridden
country for a long time.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.440
And I was definitely--

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.810
I'm definitely too young to
claim that story as my own,

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.900
but certainly when I used to
do gigs in Belfast I remember

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.400
the owner of the Empire,
the comedy club up there,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.110
he said that whenever there
was a very bad atrocity,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.380
that that's Sunday night
for the comedy show

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.540
there would be like
lines around the block.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.120
And the people
really used comedy

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.930
as a way to come together, and
as kind of a form of relief,

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.760
and a way to connect
with each other.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.840
And I always found that
really interesting.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.900
Plus like in Northern
Ireland I think

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.210
it's fair to say they have
like a slightly darker

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.370
hue to their humor.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.630
And so going to Iraq, I
kind of had that on my mind.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:27.740
I also wanted to talk about
the power of creativity

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.080
when you're in--

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.830
going through dark stuff,
whether that's just yourself

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:40.180
or it's your family, or it could
be your community or country.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.630
But that's all very lofty.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.650
I was really nervous.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.000
And then I got there.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.710
And of course, it was like doing
a comedy workshop anywhere.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:53.090
Like there was four
women and 36 men.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.830
And there was like
goofy, loud guys

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.250
who were just wanting to
do comedy to meet women.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.630
And then there was like
older, like earnest men who

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.640
kind of were--

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.200
had always wanted to express
this side of themselves,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.339
but they were working or
looking after a family.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.420
It was just like I could have
named people's equivalents

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.020
that I had met in New Zealand,
in Edinburgh, in Dublin.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:17.630
Do you know what I mean?

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.380
KELLY: Absolutely.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.930
MAEVE HIGGINS: It was cool.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.380
And there was cartoonists
there, and people

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.780
who made short videos.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.880
And stand-up comedy
is like a younger kind

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.220
of a craft in Iraq.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.150
And it was a lot of-- there was
a sketch group there and stuff.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.530
And we just had this workshop.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:42.649
And it was really good, like
it was really helpful, I think.

00:17:42.649 --> 00:17:44.690
It was certainly helpful
for me, and I would hope

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.460
it was helpful for them too.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.190
And I'm still in touch with a
few people took the workshop.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.710
And what was extraordinary
was we were just like 40 miles

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.770
from Mosul, which was still
under ISIS control at the time.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.570
And they're making
funny videos about ISIS.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:09.970
And that was kind of the ISIS
is so good at social media,

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.920
and at making videos to travel.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.630
And I think that for the
people at the workshop, some of

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.390
whose family, they were IDP,
so their family were still

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.010
stuck in Mosul.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.920
I think it was useful
for them to have comeback

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.540
and to use their
creativity to oppose

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.860
this kind of destruction, and
this narrative of destruction.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.690
So that's what they said.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.510
And I think, and I do
believe them actually.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.955
And I also was like god,
I was so stupid coming

00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:44.160
out here thinking, oh,
what's the point of this?

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.100
Because I was like, well, if I
just happened to grow up here,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.600
I'd be the one in the workshop.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.870
I'd be one of those kind
of like girls being like

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.610
is this going to be good?

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.339
KELLY: You mentioned the
impulse for self-expression.

00:18:56.339 --> 00:18:58.380
So if you were a cave
woman, you would be the one

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.670
who's writing on the walls.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.628
MAEVE HIGGINS: Totally.

00:19:00.628 --> 00:19:04.350
I'm constantly, as you
can see, trying to say,

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.980
like trying to figure out
what I'm thinking and feeling

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.320
and how I understand things
and trying to share that.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.290
And it's just a, I
think, it's very human.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.450
Maybe it's like a bit stronger
in some of us than in others.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.880
But I think it's a very
human impulse to try and say

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.270
like to just express yourself.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.470
And then to get
heard is amazing.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.970
KELLY: Yeah.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.700
Well, we all reap the benefits
you expressing yourself,

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.720
so thank you for that.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.929
MAEVE HIGGINS: You're welcome.

00:19:30.929 --> 00:19:32.970
KELLY: So teaching this
comedy workshop opened up

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.340
a lot of questions about the
shared space between comedy

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:35.880
and tragedy.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.790
I'm going to read a little
excerpt of a question

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.150
that you posed, which is what
if comedy and creativity, these

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.880
nebulous things I've
devoted all these years to,

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.160
are in fact in the
grand scheme of things

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.450
unhelpful or even pointless?

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.440
So how did your experience help
to clarify those questions?

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.990
And do you still ever
struggle with them?

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:01.040
MAEVE HIGGINS: I think
a lot of times comedy--

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.540
like I think that we pat
ourselves on the back too much.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.090
Like I think if you're on the
kind of left side of things,

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.100
you watch John Oliver and
you're like yeah, like, get him,

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.150
like you said it.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.700
Or Jon Stewart or whatever.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.480
And ultimately I don't
think it's really--

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.450
I don't think if your
goal is to change things,

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.070
I don't think that's changing.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.460
It's like you get a laugh
and you feel good, but--

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.220
and you definitely get that
sense that we're a tribe.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.560
But like that's, I don't
know how helpful that is.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:40.570
So but for when I went and
spent that time in Iraq,

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:45.330
I do think that I could see the
value of it from kind of a--

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.680
just it's an important
part of being human.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.160
And I think often when people
are serious all the time,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.330
even if it's because they're
sad or because something bad is

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.460
happening, I think
that's a disservice

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.920
to their own humanity.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.410
Because I think in all of us
there is like light and dark,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.600
and there is levity,
and there's depth.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.710
And unless you allow
both of them to come out,

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.900
then it's like you're
not being fair.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.940
It's like if you were giddy
and upbeat all the time,

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:24.240
that's not a true representation
of really being human.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.780
KELLY: Yeah.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.890
MAEVE HIGGINS: So that's why
I think a lot of narratives

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.130
around, of course,
like around war

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.470
and of course
around immigration,

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.380
forced immigration, like
what's happening to Syrians

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.200
are so tragic and so sad.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.990
But within those stories,
which I found in my podcast

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:48.000
when I interviewed Syrian asylum
seekers, like there's jokes.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.340
There is love.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.850
There's humor.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.760
There's all those things that
people who aren't in a war

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.730
and people who don't
feel a great sadness,

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.920
like they still get to have--

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.610
they still get to
have that levity.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:03.110
KELLY: Yeah.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.720
MAEVE HIGGINS: But I think
it gets lost in the telling

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.410
sometimes.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:06.950
KELLY: Yeah.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.280
What made you choose to do
a podcast on immigration?

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.640
MAEVE HIGGINS: Well, I think it
was because, like I was saying,

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.750
where I came from was--

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.230
Ireland is such a country that
pushes people out all the time.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.060
And we end up all
over the world.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.890
And then I became
an immigrant myself,

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.080
like moved here five years ago.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.200
And I could definitely see the
contrast between my immigration

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.120
experience and so
many other peoples.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.290
And it was definitely a
question of why me, and like

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.360
why not them, and why not?

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.685
Because America is such
a fortress, really.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.750
So there was that.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.310
There was just that
central question

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.800
of what's really going on here.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.580
But also immigration
stories, as you

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.680
know if you're an
immigrant yourself if you

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.590
know immigrants, there's
always a story there.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.310
Because it literally means
you've left one life behind,

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.200
and you've come and
started a new life.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.950
And that is, like from a
storytelling point of view,

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.970
there just has to
be something there.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.172
Even in the most boring
immigration story,

00:23:07.172 --> 00:23:07.880
there is a story.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.890
There's a beginning and a middle
and then what's happened now.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:11.390
KELLY: Yeah.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.430
The podcast is no
longer in production,

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.122
but the back issues are amazing.

00:23:15.122 --> 00:23:17.330
And if you haven't listened
to it, you really should.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.680
It hits all the right notes--

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.460
MAEVE HIGGINS: Oh
thank you, Kelly.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.180
KELLY: --to change
hearts and minds.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:20.792
Absolutely.

00:23:20.792 --> 00:23:22.250
MAEVE HIGGINS:
Well, I mean you say

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.840
that it changed
hearts and minds,

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.720
but like it's interesting
because I really thought--

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.250
like so basically the
podcast is quite simple.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.530
It's like me interviewing
different immigrants,

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.540
about their own stories.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.660
It's like immigration stories
told by the people who've

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.890
lived them.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.050
And I really thought--

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:43.890
we went into production in 2015.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.720
I started the idea
working in 2015,

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.270
but the way the timing
worked, the show

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:55.370
only started airing like
right after Trump got elected.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.660
And then I think he was
inaugurated while I was still

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.070
taping on the West Coast.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:04.520
Anyway, and so
obviously immigration

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.770
is always a huge
topic here in America,

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.070
but it had really heated up.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:15.250
And I think I did
naively probably think,

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:20.680
oh but if anybody hears
this, like if they hear Zaza,

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.760
the Syrian asylum seeker, if
they hear him talking about how

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.299
he really needs to quit
smoking because he has

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.840
this one-year-old now and his
wife is giving him a hard time,

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.670
and yeah, he wants to quit
smoking, but he's afraid

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.370
is going to put
weight on because he's

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.430
like a comfort eater.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.510
Like he reminded me of my uncle.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.040
And I was like,
when they hear him,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.789
they're not going to
be scared of Syrians.

00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:43.120
And they're not going
to even consider

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.440
a Muslim ban or whatever.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:53.680
I don't know that hearing
stories from immigrants

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.062
directly does change
facts and minds.

00:24:58.062 --> 00:24:59.520
KELLY: I like to
hope that it does.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.145
MAEVE HIGGINS: I hope
that it does too,

00:25:01.145 --> 00:25:02.790
but it's hard to get
that qualitative,

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.540
like does it actually.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.200
KELLY: Yeah.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.540
MAEVE HIGGINS: I don't know.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.810
it's a really-- I'm still
trying to figure out.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:09.310
KELLY: Yeah.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.740
I think reaching the
correct audience is probably

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.220
the hardest part of the battle.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.720
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yes, yeah.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.670
KELLY: Yeah.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.520
So there's an innate
tension in the whole book

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.960
about the hope you have
for humanity, society,

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.910
and the insecurity of the
self that everybody faces.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.000
So can you give us
any words of wisdom

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.715
for people in the
audience who might want

00:25:29.715 --> 00:25:31.090
to make a difference
in the world

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:36.150
and contribute to change but
need the courage to start?

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.510
MAEVE HIGGINS: Well,
I mean, I could

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.700
say what I'm doing
at the moment, which

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.130
is kind of a small thing.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.300
But it's actually helping me.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.920
So I started this other
podcast this year.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.170
And it's about climate justice
which is something I never--

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.520
I knew about, but I wasn't
really paying attention.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.220
Anyway, we did this
issue, we did this episode

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.390
about divestment.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:07.800
Like big, big countries or
corporations or universes

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.290
or whatever divesting
their money from, say,

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.770
like fossil fuel
funding of fossil fuel

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.810
operations to putting
it into something

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.370
else, like clean
energy, or something

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:23.710
that's kind of whatever, cleaner
and better for the environment,

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.900
and better from a human rights
point of view and stuff.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.970
And so then we did
this whole episode.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.940
And I was kind of
like, OK cool, you

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.760
can petition your
government to divest.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.600
The great news is that the
Irish government has recently

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.520
divested all of their
money, which is amazing.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.130
But then I was looked
at Chase Bank, which

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.064
is just where I
bank for no reason,

00:26:47.064 --> 00:26:48.980
except that that's where
I opened up the bank.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:56.500
And then I was like, oh,
I'm going to move my money.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.610
This is like last week.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.990
I was on the phone with them.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.630
And I owed them four grand.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.110
Like I had like zero on my
current account, and four

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.935
grand on my credit card.

00:27:07.935 --> 00:27:10.230
So I was like taking
a high moral--

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:11.950
I phoned them, and
I was like I think

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.754
I'm going to leave
the bank, because I've

00:27:13.754 --> 00:27:14.920
been reading all this stuff.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.960
And you've been funding
this huge tar sands project.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.540
And the lady was
like, you can't leave.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.635
Like you owe us.

00:27:23.635 --> 00:27:26.425
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:34.150
And I was like, no, I
know, but I'm telling you.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.430
Anyway, then because the
day in your book gets

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.470
published you get your
check or whatever.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.960
So I got my check
on Tuesday, was it?

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.240
Yeah.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.460
And then I was
like, Julia Roberts

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.070
kind of that moment where
she goes back into the shop

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.945
and she's like, big mistake.

00:27:49.945 --> 00:27:51.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.080
But still the woman in
Chase was like, fine.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.820
You can leave.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.890
They were just like,
what is your problem?

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.954
Anyway, so then like
this other lady,

00:28:00.954 --> 00:28:02.620
because I was like I
should record this,

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.030
like it's really funny.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.170
And this other lady--

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.984
first of all, I called Chase
and I was like, now I have money

00:28:07.984 --> 00:28:09.400
and I'm paying off
my credit card.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.733
And you're not getting the
rest of my money or whatever.

00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:13.650
And then it's like
a lady who works

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.960
in a call center in the
Philippines, you know?

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.860
And I wasn't about to
like go off on her.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.160
Do you know what you're doing?

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.059
Like climate change
is real problem.

00:28:23.059 --> 00:28:24.100
She's in the Philippines.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:24.955
I think she knows.

00:28:27.352 --> 00:28:28.810
We had a really
nice chat actually.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:29.800
And she was like,
look, I'm going

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.030
to do my homework after this.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.280
I was like, OK, sorry to
keep you on the phone.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.210
And then I got put through
to media relations,

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.710
because I was
recording or whatever.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:42.340
And she hung up on me, this lady
in like the Manhattan branch

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.060
hung up on me.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.999
So anyway, this is--

00:28:43.999 --> 00:28:45.790
I'm sorry, this is a
really long-winded way

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:51.610
of saying I'm personally taking
responsibility for like this

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:53.860
is like a small thing, right?

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.780
Where my money goes.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:00.430
I also, when it
comes to immigration,

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.390
I try and really look
at my own status,

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.600
which like I said is
I have this 01 visa,

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.360
which is a very
privileged one to get.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.420
And I try and help
other people get it.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:15.240
And I just try and
speak to and understand

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.680
other points of view.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.160
It's very basic.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.584
Like I said, when I started
the podcast I was like,

00:29:22.584 --> 00:29:24.000
my responsibility
as a storyteller

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.440
is to change the attitude
towards immigration

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.610
in this country.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.424
And it's like, no.

00:29:29.424 --> 00:29:30.090
I can't do that.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.580
Like what I can do
personally, really do,

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.470
is like these small things.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:38.460
I can-- another thing which is
more, again, climate justice

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.290
related is like check
where my food comes from.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.480
And not just order
Seamless all the time,

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.300
which is like a lot of
packaging and a lot of very--

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.000
so I'm doing very small things.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.500
KELLY: Yeah.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.170
MAEVE HIGGINS: That's
like my latest approach.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:51.670
KELLY: Yes.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.570
I'm hearing start small,
and speak to your talents.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.120
Because you've leveraged your
talents in incredible ways

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.096
to effect change.

00:29:59.096 --> 00:30:00.970
I want to leave space
for audience questions.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:01.803
MAEVE HIGGINS: Sure.

00:30:01.803 --> 00:30:05.174
KELLY: So please don't be shy
if you want to ask something.

00:30:05.174 --> 00:30:06.090
We've got microphones.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:07.230
MAEVE HIGGINS: You
could ask me for a loan.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:08.021
Now is a good time.

00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:10.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.910
KELLY: But also this book was
completed about a year ago,

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:15.510
is that right?

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.343
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yeah.

00:30:16.343 --> 00:30:18.020
I basically finished
it last September.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.970
And then it's quite a long
process with publishing.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:22.030
It takes a while.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.946
KELLY: What's changed
in your life since then?

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.070
MAEVE HIGGINS: I've got a dog.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.160
I got a dog.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:36.910
I got made a columnist at the
Times and at the Guardian.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.730
And also at the Progressive,
another magazine.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.330
So suddenly now I have a
lot of writing work to do,

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.350
which is fine.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.020
And I think that's kind of it.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.220
KELLY: Yeah, that's big.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.360
You have a really cute
passage about-- so many

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.180
cute passages about
dogs in this book.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:55.680
I love it.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.650
MAEVE HIGGINS: Well you see,
because I used to always walk

00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:59.810
dogs from Sean Casey.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:03.050
It's like a rescue place.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.990
And you can walk dogs from
there, like you don't have to--

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.370
I mean really you just go in
and give your email address.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.370
I think they kind of want
you just to take them.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.572
And then you can take the
dog to the park or whatever.

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:15.780
And I used to always do that.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.800
And I was like, I
got to get a dog.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.420
Well, money and like looking
at the time and everything.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.874
But then I just kind of--

00:31:24.874 --> 00:31:26.540
I don't know if you
have a dog, but what

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.970
happens is you act
like you're just

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.350
going to foster it for a while.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:35.060
Anyway, I ended up getting this
dog full time now for almost.

00:31:38.215 --> 00:31:38.840
And it's great.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.457
Like actually when I
got her I was like,

00:31:41.457 --> 00:31:43.040
I guess she's like
half border collie,

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.230
so I was like she's going to
be really busy and energetic.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.620
And she's going to
make me start running.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.330
I used to run.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.590
I don't run anymore.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.560
And then I was like,
it's going to be so good

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.910
for me and my mental health.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.770
And I'm going to lose
weight and everything.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.010
She's also a half--

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:57.800
anyway, she's like the laziest.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.470
Not lazy, but like she's
a puppy and she's just

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.480
like let's snooze.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.187
So she, yeah.

00:32:03.187 --> 00:32:04.520
So that's what's happened to me.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.620
KELLY: She's quite
large for a puppy.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.203
MAEVE HIGGINS: She's
a big puppy, yes.

00:32:07.203 --> 00:32:10.100
She's 60 pounds now, because
she just sleeps all the time.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:10.675
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:10.675 --> 00:32:11.550
KELLY: That'll do it.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.530
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yeah.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:13.760
Yeah.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.230
KELLY: And so we
covered your trip

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:18.464
to Iraq and mentoring
Iraqi comics.

00:32:18.464 --> 00:32:20.130
And all the issues
that come up for you.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:21.450
MAEVE HIGGINS: And my dog.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.170
KELLY: Yeah.

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.050
MAEVE HIGGINS: Oh, we
hit all the big ones.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.400
KELLY: Around the
Berlin utility of comedy

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.700
and its relationship
to tragedy there

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.160
was this really
interesting juxtaposition

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.310
in the book about your hope
for all of these comics

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.650
and how they can affect
change, and being

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:41.240
very positive and
optimistic about the role

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.670
of comedy and politics in Iraq.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.970
But I saw a lot of
insecurity bubbling up

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.040
around the podcast
and its ability

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.357
to affect change
in the same way.

00:32:51.357 --> 00:32:52.940
Imposter syndrome
is something that we

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.140
talk about a lot at Google.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.754
It's a big discussion point.

00:32:55.754 --> 00:32:57.170
So do you have any
words of wisdom

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:00.440
about kind of closing that
gap between how you perceive

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.420
other people and how you
can bring your own self

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.067
perception to the same place?

00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:06.900
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yeah.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:11.400
I mean, this newest
podcast that I'm working on

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.350
is with Mary Robinson, who's
the former president of Ireland.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.860
She's their first
female president.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.870
And she's 73 years old now.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.260
And so you can imagine what it
was like for her coming off.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.370
She was a human rights
lawyer first in like,

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:28.680
I guess the '70s
in Ireland, which

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.026
was a tough time for women.

00:33:30.026 --> 00:33:31.650
And she was like a
human rights lawyer.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.130
So anyway I asked
her about that,

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:42.300
because I think it's like a real
phenomenon with younger women.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.760
Maybe men feel it too,
imposter syndrome.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.540
I hear it most from women,
but maybe men feel it too.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.380
And I asked her about it.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.070
And she was like,
I never had it.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.465
She was so unhelpful.

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:55.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:59.622
Like I really thought that she'd
have some kind of like wise,

00:33:59.622 --> 00:34:01.080
and she was just
like I don't know.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.989
And someone else that
I talked to about this,

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:10.679
she's a black woman.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.320
And she was like, that
I don't have time for--

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.199
she's like, everyone
does doubt me.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:20.610
Everyone in her, I guess
she means not black people,

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:24.850
does doubt her and she does have
to prove herself all the time.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:27.330
So if she also doubts herself--

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.830
so that made me think this
is just one black woman.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.010
I don't know if that's--

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.739
but that made me
think like I wonder

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:39.670
if it's a bit of making a
problem where there isn't one.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.090
But I feel it.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.880
It's a real-- and I
know like feelings

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.380
aren't facts, but whatever.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.985
I do still feel it a bit myself.

00:34:48.985 --> 00:34:50.020
KELLY: Yeah.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.260
MAEVE HIGGINS: And I feel like
what do I think I'm doing here,

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.330
or if I'm doing like
a high-status thing

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.620
or whatever, I'm like, me?

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:05.820
I think it's helpful to
remind yourself of past.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.900
Like using logic helps me.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.540
Like I can say to myself,
but you did this other thing

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.790
like two weeks ago, and
that was on the same level

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:13.750
and you did fine.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:18.670
So like using logic to say
like, I wasn't cut out then.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.440
Nobody kicked me out then.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.610
So I can do this again.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:26.159
And then I use that for a lot
of things to trick my brain.

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:27.700
Like I often think,
oh, I'm not going

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.320
to be able to write this piece.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.040
Like it's too hard, or it's
too long, or it's whatever.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.867
I don't have time.

00:35:32.867 --> 00:35:34.450
But then I think,
but you thought that

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.420
before but you did it.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.504
So just using evidence
from your past.

00:35:38.504 --> 00:35:39.420
KELLY: That's amazing.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.190
I mean, we're a very
databased company.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.610
It should resonate for us.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.443
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yeah?

00:35:44.443 --> 00:35:45.580
KELLY: Yeah.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.480
Well, thank you so much for
joining us at Google today.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.890
Maeve in America: Essays by
a Girl From Somewhere Else

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.447
is now available.

00:35:52.447 --> 00:35:53.530
Pick it up on Google Play.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:54.935
We have copies in the back.

00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:56.310
Hopefully, Maeve
will be around--

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:57.030
MAEVE HIGGINS: Thank you, Kelly.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.510
KELLY: --to sign
some copies as well.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.225
MAEVE HIGGINS: Sure.

00:35:59.225 --> 00:35:59.550
KELLY: Yeah.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.110
But thank you so
much for joining us.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:01.859
It was a pleasure.

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:04.110
MAEVE HIGGINS: Thank you, Kelly.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.222
Yeah, you ask such
good questions too.

00:36:07.222 --> 00:36:07.930
KELLY: Thank you.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:09.460
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yeah, like
you really read the book.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.085
I was doing radio
interviews this week.

00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:12.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:12.820
You don't know.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.060
I was doing radio this week.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.768
Radio interviews.

00:36:14.768 --> 00:36:17.500
And then some people were
like, oh Maeve, so great

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.240
to talk to you.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:18.330
Anyway.

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:18.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:22.412
KELLY: I'm just in it
for the compliments.

00:36:22.412 --> 00:36:24.370
MAEVE HIGGINS: Does
anybody have any questions?

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.180
Yeah, go ahead.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.565
AUDIENCE: Did you also change
the spelling of your name

00:36:30.565 --> 00:36:32.000
for America?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.430
MAEVE HIGGINS: No, but
there are other spellings,

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.620
more complicated ways
to spell my name.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.100
But luckily this was the
one my parents gave me.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.370
I know another Maeve,
she's like, M-A-E-D-H-B-H.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.110
And people are just like
ha, [SPEAKING NONSENSE]..

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:51.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.000
So I was good.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.520
This is like kind
of the phonetic.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.880
Like people definitely
call me Ma-eve.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.810
But I answer it.

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.760
That's fine.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.010
Mauve is my worst, because
I don't like that color.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.380
But I'm just like what?

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.900
But I do answer to Mauve.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.940
Any other questions?

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.638
Yeah?

00:37:15.638 --> 00:37:17.730
AUDIENCE: Are you going--

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.930
are you done now with stand-up
and, let's say, improv?

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.850
Are you going to
focus on writing?

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.740
Could you see yourself
going back to that?

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.990
MAEVE HIGGINS: I mean, I
still do bits of stand-up.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:32.620
Like definitely writing
is 80% or 90% probably now

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.790
of my time and stuff.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:38.260
But I do a show every Monday
in Brooklyn with my friends.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.470
Aparna Nancherla
and Jo Firestone,

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.971
two very good comics.

00:37:41.971 --> 00:37:43.470
And we do a show
there every Monday.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.360
That kind of keeps my hand in.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.630
And I see all the
youngsters coming up.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:53.370
But I don't-- but yeah, it's
mainly writing now, yeah.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.069
Yeah.

00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:56.110
You have a lovely accent.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.086
[MURMURED LAUGHTER]

00:37:57.086 --> 00:37:59.526
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Cork as well.

00:37:59.526 --> 00:38:00.699
MAEVE HIGGINS: Cork as well.

00:38:00.699 --> 00:38:01.490
Where are you from?

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:02.254
AUDIENCE: Dublin.

00:38:02.254 --> 00:38:03.170
MAEVE HIGGINS: Dublin?

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.920
AUDIENCE: Donegal.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.299
MAEVE HIGGINS: Donegal.

00:38:05.299 --> 00:38:07.090
We have a good spread
of Irish people here.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:07.798
KELLY: Beautiful.

00:38:07.798 --> 00:38:08.860
MAEVE HIGGINS: Yeah.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.100
KELLY: All right, thank
you so much everybody.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.391
MAEVE HIGGINS: Thanks everyone.

00:38:12.391 --> 00:38:14.470
[APPLAUSE]
