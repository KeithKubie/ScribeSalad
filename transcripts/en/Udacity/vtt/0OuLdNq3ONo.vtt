00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.060
In this and in the remaining lessons for

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.090
the course, we turn our attention to
the study of polynomial algorithms.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.450
First however, a little perspective.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.830
In the beginning of the course,

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.530
we defined the general
notion of a language.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.480
Then we began to distinguish
between decidable languages and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.240
undecidable ones.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.531
Remember that there were uncountably
many undecidable ones, but

00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:23.950
only a countably many decidable ones.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.710
In comparison, the decidable ones should
be infinitesimally small, but I'll give

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.240
them this big circle here anyway,
because they're so interesting to us.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.400
In the section of
the course on complexity,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.510
we considered several subclasses
of the decidable languages.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.400
P, which consists of those languages
decidable in polynomial time.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.400
NP, which consists of those languages
that can be verified in polynomial time.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.970
And within this we have this little
bend of NP complete problems,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.840
which are the hardest problems in NP.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.350
If any one of these turned out to be
polynomial, then P would expand and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.290
swallow all of NP.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.670
Or equivalently, we can think of NP
collapsing down into this class P.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.980
In this section,
we're going to focus on this class P,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.470
the set of polynomially
decidable languages.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.160
The overall tone here will hopefully
feel a little more optimistic.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.960
In the previous sections of the course,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.380
many of our results were
of a negative nature.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.240
No, you can't decide that language, or

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.480
no that problem isn't trackable
unless P is equal to NP.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.310
Here, the results will
be entirely positive.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.030
No longer we'll be the excluding
problems from a good class.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.930
We'll just be showing the problems
are in this good class, P.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.320
Yes, you can do that in polynomial time
or it's even a low order polynomial, and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.870
we can solve huge instances in practice.
