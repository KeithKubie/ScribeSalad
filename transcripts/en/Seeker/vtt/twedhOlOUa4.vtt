00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.100
When talking about weed people usually just
say it's "safer than alcohol," but is that

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.100
true?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.940
New science looked at THAT QUESTION and their
findings might kill your buzz.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.070
Howdy 420 familiars, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.760
Recently, the University of California-Davis
announced the first results of a nearly 40-year

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.150
long study exploring if marijuana was worse
for you than alcohol.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.900
According to their findings, “People who
smoked cannabis four or more days of the week

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.369
over many years ended up in a lower social
class than their parents, with lower-paying,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.570
less skilled and less prestigious jobs than
those who were not regular cannabis smokers."

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.460
To put it as simply as I can, after following
over 1000 people from birth until age 38,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.239
and controlling for every variable they could
think of, people who were supposed to be here,

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.329
were here - and the only correlation they
could see as to why they weren't here -- was

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.329
pot.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.370
Yah, I know, you're already down in the comments,
but let's break this down and explain why

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000
this study is super important to science.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.400
Firstly, let’s go back to that “four or
more days per week, over many years."

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.030
The researchers weren't trying throwing shade
at pot users, they were drawing a box around

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.940
"heavy use" and how that affects their life.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.409
Heavy use categories are those who are consuming
more of a drug than the average.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.229
Heavy use for alcohol was determined ages
ago, as5 or more drinks in day, 5 days in

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.229
a month.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.180
Once they know what heavy use is, they can
see how lifestyles of heavy users are affected

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.869
by their drug of choice.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.390
Secondly, sociologists have been studying
social class for decades with tens of thousands

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.820
of people from across the globe; researchers
are able to predict what level someone with

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.110
specific social upbringing, opportunities
and personalities should reach.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.790
So, that’s where these researchers started
from.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.109
They KNOW people who are say, middle-class
SHOULD clear certain social and economic hurdles

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.590
-- remaining in the middle class UNLESS something
changes.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.470
So they followed a bunch of people for almost
four decades to determine what, if anything,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.470
changed.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.280
The interesting thing about this, is researchers
wanted to know what specifically affects people

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
over time.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.660
So they looked at absolutely everything: credit
rating, debt, net worth, what jobs they've

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.989
taken and the successes and troubles at said
job, food security, relationship quality or

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.040
abuse, whether they were on welfare or unemployment,
missed credit card payments, traffic violations,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.190
childhood IQ, childhood achievement, ethnicity,
level of self-control, and information about

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.970
their parent or parents!

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.450
This study was crazy.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.590
After all that they put the data into a computer
program and started looking for correlations,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.700
finding… perhaps surprisingly, a connection
between heavy pot use, and a drop in expected

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.709
class.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.709
Super intriguing, right?

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.640
People don't normally just, drop in class
for no reason… so they wanted to see how,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.640
and why…

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.480
It looks, based on this data, a lot of the
drops had one thing in common: the people

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.080
were smoking pot four days a week or more.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.230
AKA, heavy use.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.250
So, to bring it back: is pot worse for you
than alcohol?

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.510
More research is needed.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.900
This study didn't look at health, or driving,
or whether you raise kids well, or creativity,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.910
just at how regular, heavy pot use over time
affected people's place on the economic and

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.990
social ladder.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.099
With the legalization of marijuana comes more
scrutiny.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.690
The scientists for this UC-Davis study now
say marijuana is not, quote "safer than alcohol."

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.739
And, in fact, the data indicates "persistent
cannabis users constitute a burden on families,

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.920
communities, and national social-welfare systems."

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.870
They went on to say heavy use of pot did not
cause less harm that heavy alcohol use when

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.050
it comes to people's social and economic livelihood.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.451
And if it was good, scientists would definitely
say so!

00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:30.230
They have!

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.390
Studies done with thousands of twins found
marijuana didn't negatively affect IQ!

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.690
And because opioids are habit-forming, cannabis
may be a "safer" choice for pain management,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.540
just to name a couple.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.940
Scientists simply want to study pot use to
find out what it does to people.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.060
Because alcohol is legal and heavily studies
we know it can affect personal lives, work,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.930
relationships, driving, et cetera…

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.930
We don't have definitive answers about all
this when it comes to weed, yet.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.060
Use pot, don't use pot, that's up to you,
but either way, when it comes to heavy use

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.019
and socioeconomic effects, now we know.

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.590
If you're thinking about pot and saying, YEAH!
AND IF YOU SMOKE POT, you'll go through some

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:12.099
gateway into harder drugs!

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:25.280
Is that true?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.799
We looked into it… here.
