00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.000
I don’t know if you’ve been watching the
news, but by my count there have been two

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.110
disasters lately.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.620
Let’s all just chill out and wait for the
third one we all know is coming.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.260
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.670
Have you ever noticed misfortune tends to
come in groups of three?

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.970
Celebrity deaths, natural disasters, and personal
problems all seem to come in triplicate.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.789
Surely there must be a scientific explanation
for the pattern.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.789
Well there is.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.160
And that explanation is: there is no pattern,
it’s just you.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.730
It’s not the universe ticking through some
equation that occasionally spits out grief

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.550
in bunches, it’s that you want to see a
pattern in random information.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.980
The phenomenon is called apophenia, and humans
are guilty of it all the time.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.920
Part of the reason we’re the most dominant
species on the planet is because we see patterns

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.399
and exploit them to our advantage.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.000
That’s a great skill when it helps us derive
some truth, and a real problem when it deludes

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
us.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.520
The examples I like are math and astrology.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.980
A mathematical equation is really just a description
of a pattern and it can be used to accurately

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.640
predict a specific outcome.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.090
Whereas astrology is combining random information
into a perceived pattern and it only makes

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.539
vague predictions that can’t be tested.

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.890
So why is it that despite my insistence, I
haven’t killed astrology yet?

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.469
Well the reason apophanies are so persistent
is because of another human flaw: confirmation

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:15.469
bias.

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.729
We don’t just see patterns, we see the patterns
we want, and we ignore information that doesn’t

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.020
obey our pet theory.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.439
English psychologist Peter Wason first demonstrated
this in the ‘60s with an experiment.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.499
He told participants that the numbers 2, 4,
and 6 satisfied some rule he had in mind,

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:34.429
and invited them to suggest three other numbers
to try and figure out the rule.

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.329
Most people only gave even ascending numbers
and when they were told those numbers followed

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.590
Wason’s rule, they concluded that was the
pattern.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.509
But it wasn’t, Wason’s only rule was the
numbers had to increase, but they could be

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.069
even, odd, positive, negative, integers or
fractions.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.560
Most people didn’t suggest a pattern they
thought might be wrong though, they only tested

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.869
answers they were already sure fit.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.719
In other words, they only tried to confirm
their bias.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.289
Then there’s our affinity for the number
three in western cultures: Christianity’s

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.789
deity comes in three forms, satisfying lists
of examples have three things.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.470
But numbers have different significances in
different cultures.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.290
In China the number four is bad luck because
it sounds a lot like the word for death, and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.739
that’s true in both mandarin and cantonese.

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.689
So some chinese hotels and hospitals don’t
have floors or rooms labeled with numbers

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:19.689
ending in 4.

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.989
When you combine our western preference for
trilogies with the human tendencies for apophenia

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.940
and confirmation bias, you get the belief
that bad things come in threes.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.360
The truth is bad things happen all the time.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.069
Sometimes they come in threes, yes, but sometimes
they come by themselves, or in twos or fives.

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.769
If your rules are loose enough you could correctly
say that tragedy is constant.

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.439
On a long enough timeline, the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.959
How tragic is that?

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.510
Notice in the intro I didn’t explicitly
list what two disasters had just happened?

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.409
I figure you can watch this video at any time,
and two recent events will immediately spring

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.409
to mind.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.019
I know that’s not a cheerful thought but
look at it this way: great things are happening

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.200
all the time too, the only reason you’re
not hearing about it is because bad news drives

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200
up ratings.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.090
So when the universe dishes out bad luck on
a personal or grand scale, do what you can

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.640
to make the situation better for yourself
or those affected, and know that two more

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.530
probably aren’t around the corner just because
of some mystical “rule of threes.”

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.870
Unfortunately at the time we shot this, there
was a massive earthquake in Nepal.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.349
I encourage you to do what you can to help,
and if you want to learn more, Julia’s got

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.719
an explainer on the science of it here.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:33.379
Are there any other superstitions you think
are actually scientifically sound?

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.750
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
