1
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:01.990
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:06.190
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday. Uh,

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.370
December 26th, 2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.690
how are ya. Oh my God.

5
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.320
It's the last Monday of fucking 2016.

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.660
Um, George Michael passed away on Christmas Day.

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.460
Um, wake me up before you'd go go, uh,

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.150
condolences to him. And uh,

9
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.860
you know what the best thing about 2016 being over is, is, um,

10
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.781
you know longer,

11
00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:41.140
you're gonna have to listen to people blaming a year for bad things happening.

12
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.400
You know, it's a big thing. Fuck you. 2016.

13
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:49.480
I saw Madonna tweeted that. Fuck you. 2016.

14
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.670
Fuck you. You fucking year man. You know,

15
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.990
why do people keep blaming the fucking year? You know,

16
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.970
it has nothing to do with the fucking year you're talking to. There's this,

17
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.270
people's genetics are involved. There's a lifestyle choices.

18
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.480
There's substance abuse. I mean, that's what's going on here.

19
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:15.160
I don't know why you're a, you know, we're picking on 2016 like,

20
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:17.650
it's a, a religion from the Middle East or something.

21
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:21.190
I have no fucking idea how it's getting the blame for all of this.

22
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.370
You know what I mean? Fucking 2016 with your liver cancer,

23
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.530
you know, let's blame 2016 rather than the pharmaceutical companies.

24
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.000
That fucking was given out opiates like Flintstone vitamins and created a

25
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.670
fucking heroin epidemic. Fuck all of that.

26
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
<v 0>2016 has robbed us of some of the greatest artists of our time.</v>

28
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.380
2016 he did like, it's a fucking person.

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.050
How to fucking Madonna. Madonna is world traveled.

30
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.210
She's been around the fucking world.

31
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.810
Whoever you talked to enough people to not know to blame a fucking year. Well,

32
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.770
maybe she's saying that metaphorically, Bill. I don't give a shit.

33
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.640
<v 0>You know, if I try to see her side of the things,</v>

35
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.900
how can I come up with the comedic angle to try to fill out this next fucking 60

36
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:16.170
minutes? Fuck you. 2016 oh yeah.

37
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:19.220
You didn't like seeing the cubs finally win a world series. Ah,

38
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.610
nothing good happened to you this year. You just gonna focus on the bad.

39
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.533
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.700
<v 0>Anyways. I like people also then try to have like a religious thing,</v>

41
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.930
like when a prince is backup dancers had this whole fucking religious thing that

42
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:38.580
she went on saying like, you know, like wake up people, you know,

43
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.160
that's, that's when you know, you're out of your fucking mind. You know,

44
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.410
when you start telling people to wake up like, like you're,

45
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.880
you're reading the fucking, uh,

46
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.180
you're reading the tea leaves better than anybody else in your fucking,

47
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.990
you know, garrison colonial, wherever the fuck you live,

48
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.100
wake up people he capital h is,

49
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.860
is taking a, it's robbing us of some of our greatest artists.

50
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.853
<v 2>You know,</v>

51
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.460
<v 0>like that's a sign. Like all these, these great musicians are leaving us,</v>

52
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.840
which means like what?

53
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.203
<v 2>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.120
<v 0>Like Jesus is mad at all the fucking plumbers and electricians and shit.</v>

55
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.450
Granted, they fucking overcharge you and they, they,

56
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.170
they lie about when the date, the date of whatever's going to be done,

57
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.300
the job's going to be done.

58
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.840
<v 2>Um, yeah. I don't fucking know. I mean,</v>

59
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.280
<v 0>I don't understand. I understand blaming them fucking year.</v>

60
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.053
<v 2>You know,</v>

61
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.041
<v 0>dude,</v>

62
00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:35.540
I just can't wait for this year to be over and then it's going to be 2017 I'm

63
00:03:35.541 --> 00:03:39.350
not going to do any work on myself and I'll basically make the same fucking

64
00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:44.030
decisions I made in 2016 but somehow 2017 is gonna be better without me having

65
00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:45.680
to make any effort whatsoever.

66
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.653
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.750
<v 0>Jesus Christ. I mean,</v>

68
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:52.440
why don't you just get out your rosary and say all your fucking prayers rather

69
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:57.441
than fucking making a positive step towards trying to make a real change.

70
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.810
<v 2>Um,</v>

71
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.050
<v 0>anyway, so let's talk about that Madonna thing. When she was shaking her folks,</v>

72
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:09.010
she was talking with that fucking woman, Jesus Christ. Unbelievable.

73
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.310
I just like, I hate that she does that because it makes me feel old.

74
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.193
<v 2>You know,</v>

75
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.560
<v 0>when she, she was all hot say [inaudible]. Anyway, so let's plow ahead.</v>

76
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.220
This is not, this is not why I wanted to do this thing here. Um,

77
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.150
did you guys have a nice holiday? Did you have a nice Kirwan Zoo?

78
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.060
Did you have a nice Chat Hanukkah? Did you have a nice Christmas there, Joe?

79
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.670
Hey Jewish people do. Do you guys like how many you actually, uh,

80
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.600
when I was a kid,

81
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.690
people who weren't Jewish told me how you guys celebrate Hanukkah.

82
00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:42.730
And I realized, well they weren't really Jewish. Were there,

83
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.620
let me ask you this. Do you, do you do,

84
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.300
how many people do the traditional thing?

85
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.150
Is it a one day thing or is it like a nine day thing?

86
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.690
How many candles are on the manure? Is that the same as a baseball team?

87
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.970
And if so, do you give fucking one gift a day for nine days?

88
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.270
Like total old school, you know,

89
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:05.170
we're baking our own bread here type of thing, right? Is that our actually,

90
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.810
is that a religious story? Isn't that there's always bread.

91
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.250
There's always bread, there's always fish. There's a fucking leper, you know?

92
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.110
And then there's always the one guy, Abraham Mohammad or Jesus, right.

93
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.360
Hog it up the whole fucking budget.

94
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.960
Like the same way they make movies nowadays we're Tom Cruise gets all the

95
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:26.440
fucking money, right? He gets all the fucking money.

96
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.790
And what about those character actors? I go fuck yourself. Right? You know,

97
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:34.030
back in the day you could, you could make a living as a character actor.

98
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:36.460
You know what I mean? Not any more. That's not how it works.

99
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.630
<v 2>Okay?</v>

100
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.310
<v 0>Not In the age of, uh, the fucking superhero movies. So anyways,</v>

101
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:45.100
let me see how many days of Hanukkah. Why don't we, why don't we look this up?

102
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.930
Happy Hanukkah. Happy Hanukkah. All right.

103
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.800
How many days in a Nuka he's eight days a days.

104
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:03.680
A week. All right, so it's eight days. I'm sorry. Nine guys on a baseball team.

105
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.320
Eight days a Hanukkah. Do you fucking give a gift?

106
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.590
Every deaths the traditional way as far as the non Jewish people told me that

107
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:14.480
they give a gifted date. Now if you do that, my question, my question to you is,

108
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.360
how do you give out those gifts? You know, how do it,

109
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.400
do you do it? Like how I do is stand up set? Well,

110
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:23.810
you gotta start with something strong.

111
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.830
You got to establish that you're the fucking man for the job, right?

112
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.980
I don't mean to be sexist about that, but when you really think about it,

113
00:06:31.981 --> 00:06:36.620
men do a better fucking job just generally speaking.

114
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.170
You know what I mean? Women have been nowhere near the fucking moon. Okay,

115
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.560
<v 1>okay.</v>

116
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.080
<v 0>And we were there like, fucking how many of you, I don't,</v>

117
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.510
I'm fucking years ago where we, you know, oh Jesus. I just felt,

118
00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:52.750
I just thought of one of the worst fucking jokes ever. And I will not say it,

119
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:57.580
but I'll describe it to you. Okay. I will describe it to him.

120
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.240
I can't do it. I can't, I,

121
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.100
the only way to get away with it is if Nia is here also laughing.

122
00:07:02.101 --> 00:07:05.400
I was going to say, you put the guys out in the space, you know,

123
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.210
we get all the way to the moon. You know, you try to bring a lady up there,

124
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.940
right? You see where I'm going? I can't do that. It's a day after Christmas.

125
00:07:11.941 --> 00:07:15.660
I would not do that. Um, anyways, eight days. So what do you do?

126
00:07:15.661 --> 00:07:19.670
Do you start off with the fucking something strong? You know,

127
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.110
and then you establish like this is the little level of gift giving and you

128
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:28.670
gradually start your ascent through days. Two, three, four, five, six. Whoa,

129
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.590
whoa. We're going into another level. Seven and then eight.

130
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:34.790
You gave him the all A's you fucking gift now fuck off for a year.

131
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.170
That's how I would do it if I was Jewish. All right.

132
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.600
Me and Nia were Jewish and I had to get Niyah eight gifts. All right.

133
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.100
What would I start off with? I'd start off with some shoes, right?

134
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.920
Cause bitches be loving the Jews, right?

135
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:53.390
I gave her the fucking some shoes then a Jesus Christ.

136
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.220
Fucking eight gifts.

137
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:56.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

138
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.860
<v 0>Yeah, we got to go. Go close. No, you know what?</v>

139
00:07:59.861 --> 00:08:02.110
I would start right out of the gate. I'd start with something silly.

140
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.820
You know like her stock had stuff for this year. Like I know like she, you know,

141
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.330
certain kinds of foods she likes. Like one year I told her, like I said,

142
00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:12.640
I know I'm going to get you for Christmas. She goes, well you get [inaudible],

143
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.320
I'm getting you a bag of Fritos. Right. She just kept laughing. You know,

144
00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:19.630
thinking it was the funniest thing ever that I wasn't actually going to do it.

145
00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:22.840
So of course the first gift I gave her, she opened it up,

146
00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:26.230
it was a bag of Fritos and I gave her a big bear hug and I was like,

147
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.690
oh this is the greatest Christmas ever.

148
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:31.670
And she thought it was the funniest fucking thing ever. So if we would Joe et,

149
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.060
what I would do, I would start off with stupid fucking gifts.

150
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.810
Cause who's kidding who? I'm not going fucking broke here. All right.

151
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.600
Is a Christian a non practicing Christian?

152
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.870
I don't get my wife eight gifts a year. You know what I mean?

153
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.320
<v 1>Okay</v>

154
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.300
<v 0>Dude, you guys should do it like a game show. Okay.</v>

155
00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:52.350
Do you want a pretty good gifts? Uh, one fucking great one.

156
00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.570
That's like when you win the lottery,

157
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.650
do you want get it all at once or have get paid a hundred grand over 20 years.

158
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.510
And anybody who always takes the payments doesn't understand money. And also,

159
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.750
you know, it's just like, well don't go, don't we all once I'm going to blow it.

160
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.680
You get it all at once even though you were in a bigger tax bracket.

161
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:11.903
You know what I mean?

162
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.960
It gets you over the hump into being a fucking millionaire.

163
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.080
I don't give a fuck how much money you make. If they give you 200 grand a year,

164
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.290
you're never going to get up over the million cause they're going to fuck it.

165
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.850
They're going to tax the shit out of you

166
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.920
if you take it all at once roughly.

167
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.290
I mean you could do it if you just fucking sat there eating corn flakes and

168
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:35.640
shit. But like if you take it all at once and then you invest it,

169
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.490
but you're not going to know what to do and they wasn't there a whole

170
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:41.580
documentary on that. I have no idea.

171
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.030
But my wife fortunately liked to give, so she gave me this year and you know,

172
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:45.451
it was funny,

173
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:50.451
I made fun of getting socks for Christmas and she got me socks that she was all

174
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:51.421
embarrassed. She goes,

175
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:54.240
you sent it on Thursday that you didn't like saying I like socks,

176
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:56.580
I'm just fucking around. That was,

177
00:09:56.581 --> 00:10:01.260
that was the only thing in my stocking this year, she bought me a little box,

178
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.290
three pairs came in this little box. It literally was going to be cookies.

179
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.690
I opened it up with some tape,

180
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.450
Baker tape his socks and I don't give a fuck. You know what I mean? Okay.

181
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.670
Sediment adults, you can give me a Choo Choo train. Silver. It's fucking over.

182
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.520
Um, so anyways, um, okay,

183
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:22.560
I'll tell you this quick story. Fortunately,

184
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:26.620
Nia lights her gifts and I always have a little bit of anxiety whenever I give

185
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.410
him the gifts because, uh, first my first girlfriend I ever had,

186
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.460
I think I told you this story before, did I? Um,

187
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.060
my first girlfriend I ever had, I had to get her a gift.

188
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.000
Now I didn't grow up around the ladies.

189
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.310
I just had brothers for the longest fucking time. Right.

190
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.670
And I don't mean black people. I mean, I mean I had like,

191
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.700
I was related to these people. I had brothers. Um,

192
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.520
so, um, this cough is never going to go away by the way,

193
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.760
cause the fuckin prescription I got, you know,

194
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.360
just fucking put it down on the mat and now it's just fucking hanging around

195
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:08.300
like this thing that won't leave. I know you guys are thinking, oh,

196
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.100
he must be smoking like a chimney. I'm not, I'm not fucking smoking at all. Uh,

197
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.740
slash I might be done with cigars. Um,

198
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.120
and I'm Kinda, I'm kinda done with booze too.

199
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.980
I just can't fucking do it anymore. You know, I love it and all that shit,

200
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:30.570
but I just hate waking up in the morning like, ugh. Like I'm over,

201
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.970
I'm over hangovers. Fuck you. 20, 60. Um,

202
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.180
yeah, I'll have like a beer. I'll, I'll have like, you know, uh,

203
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.780
like one glass of Scotch at this point, but I can't do the fucking, uh,

204
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.700
I can't take the ride anymore. You know what I mean?

205
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.110
And it just hit me one day, like, you know how quickly Brett Farve got old,

206
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.470
just Bam, done over out of the fucking league. You know,

207
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.540
he hung around and he hung around and he hung around.

208
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.280
Then he took that last fucking hit when he was on the Vikings. You know,

209
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.810
it just looked like his clothes were just laying on the ground for,

210
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.500
didn't even believe there was a person, you know,

211
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.740
and all the really religious people got all concerned that you know,

212
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:13.480
that they get left behind and it's like, no,

213
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:17.200
that's what it looks like when a fucking 42 year old guy takes a hit from my

214
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:21.430
fucking defense event. Um, yeah,

215
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:25.210
I'm fucking done within all of that shit. Uh, however,

216
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.690
let me tell you this story. The first girlfriend ahead, so it was,

217
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:30.700
her birthday was coming up and um,

218
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.530
I had absolutely no idea what to get a, uh, a female.

219
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.360
So I go to the mall and I'm looking around, I'm looking around,

220
00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:40.380
I had no fucking idea.

221
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.180
And I came up to this table and they had all these polo style shirts,

222
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.270
nice shirts, shirt I would wear,

223
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.790
and they were on sale and all that stuff and it just,

224
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.290
all these different colors.

225
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.580
So I bought her like four of them and I wrapped him up and I gave them to her

226
00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.280
izods and Polo shirts and shit.

227
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:04.340
And she fucking unwrapped these things and the level of disappointment on her

228
00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:08.930
face. And she just was like, what? What is, what is this?

229
00:13:08.931 --> 00:13:13.520
What the fuck and do? She just fucking went off. She flipped out,

230
00:13:13.521 --> 00:13:15.590
she started yelling at me like, like a, you know,

231
00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:20.300
like a head coach mad at halftime, you know, you know, I said, kick the ball,

232
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.950
my Tony Jacket, you know, flipping out on me. And I literally did,

233
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.950
I was so embarrassed. I like kind of put my head down.

234
00:13:27.951 --> 00:13:31.580
I looked at my feet and then just sat down on the edge of the bed as she was

235
00:13:31.581 --> 00:13:35.960
yelling at me. Right. And, uh,

236
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.340
I dunno what happened. Like I was so fucking embarrassed and she, you know,

237
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.810
was young.

238
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.260
I didn't know anything about women and Shit and she was just going off on me and

239
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:49.660
about three quarters of the way into her rent,

240
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.380
which was really a good 90 seconds long, by the way, which is fucking forever.

241
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.330
I think she was kind of coming to her senses that she was taking in what she was

242
00:14:00.331 --> 00:14:03.780
doing to me by my body language and the fact that she had just given,

243
00:14:03.781 --> 00:14:07.800
gotten a gift and the way she was reacting and, uh,

244
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.340
she started to try to pull back on the stick and be like, ah, no, you know,

245
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:14.220
it's Kinda, and that's when the anger fucking hit me.

246
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.050
That was one of the first times in my ute that, um,

247
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.540
I actually address my feelings in the moment. You know,

248
00:14:23.541 --> 00:14:27.320
I was fucking one of those people brutally. Like three days later I'd be like,

249
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.700
Hey, wait a minute.

250
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.720
That person took advantage of me or that person was being rude.

251
00:14:32.721 --> 00:14:35.630
I should've fucking said something. Right. Um,

252
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.550
this fucking wave of anger came up and, uh, I just, you know,

253
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.190
handle it classically like the German Irish guy. I am,

254
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.300
I didn't communicate anything. I just stood up. I walked over,

255
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.930
I started putting my jacket on and all that. Now of course she's fucking, no,

256
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.630
don't leave doing all that shit. You know what I mean?

257
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.540
And all you want to do is the, you know, the, you know,

258
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:59.780
the swim move that a defensive lineman does. You know,

259
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.530
you fucking pushed to the side and then you fucking bring your arm up and over.

260
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:05.090
That's what I wanted to do. So of course,

261
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.610
now I'm walking towards the door and she does what all,

262
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:09.770
what every fucking woman does in that moment.

263
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:14.360
She's blocking the door and now she's crying. She's crying, you know,

264
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.060
it's like, what are you crying about after everything you just said to me?

265
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:20.060
I'm holding it together pretty fucking good here. So she's crying.

266
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.680
Now she's between the door and I say, you know, I want to leave.

267
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.790
I'm leaving, I'm leaving. No, blah, blah, blah. Look, you know, and then that,

268
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.930
then they said awful thing.

269
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.850
They standing there whole none of the fucking door jam and you can't put your

270
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.800
hands on them or else you're going to go to fucking jail.

271
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:39.470
Even if you're just trying to remove it. So weird. You know what I mean?

272
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.970
It's like you're a human being. You want to leave the room that you're in,

273
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:45.020
you're in a free country.

274
00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:47.240
There's another human being preventing you from doing it there.

275
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.010
They're holding you there against your fucking will, but they're a fucking lady,

276
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.780
so it's totally fine. So what do you do?

277
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.590
You just have to sit there and not looking them in the eye.

278
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.860
Just staring at the fucking door. Like I'm fucking leaving.

279
00:16:04.861 --> 00:16:09.660
You can stand here as long as you want. I am going to fucking leave. Right,

280
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:11.940
Ms. Brutally key. You can't,

281
00:16:11.941 --> 00:16:14.850
you can't put your hands on and you can't even try to like, you know,

282
00:16:14.851 --> 00:16:17.040
with the outside of your arms. So to try to, you know,

283
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.600
kind of shoehorn your way past them. Um,

284
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.780
cause then they start flailing around like deliberately trying to get themselves

285
00:16:24.781 --> 00:16:26.160
hurt during the altercation.

286
00:16:26.161 --> 00:16:29.160
So then you feel bad and then you won't fucking leave. They're fucking loaded.

287
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.510
Ticks. I wanna leave. Right. Look at me. It's still bugs me.

288
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.270
So, you know, and I swear to God, you know,

289
00:16:36.271 --> 00:16:39.360
I've always wanted to come up with something that you could sell for 1995 late

290
00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:42.710
at night and all these mouth breeds and fucking morons that think Trump's going

291
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.840
to make the fucking planet great again or fucking or United States great again

292
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.120
and all these fucking dumb brides.

293
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.460
I thought that because Hillary also had a vagina,

294
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.240
that somehow their life was going to improve those fucking morons. Right?

295
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.860
As yet another day of disappointment has gone past and they fill themselves up

296
00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.400
with buying absolute shit for 1995 I've always thought,

297
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.960
how can I take advantage of these people for $20 a pop? And I've, you know,

298
00:17:06.961 --> 00:17:08.400
every time I've come up with something,

299
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.590
I find out somebody else's already invented it.

300
00:17:10.591 --> 00:17:13.350
Like I came up with this fucking thing that, you know,

301
00:17:13.351 --> 00:17:15.570
you stick between the car seat and the console,

302
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.760
so every time you drop something, it doesn't go between the seats.

303
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.830
Someone already came up with that, right?

304
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.410
That was the only thing that I ever came up with,

305
00:17:22.411 --> 00:17:23.520
but somebody already came up with it.

306
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.820
So it'd be great if for like 1995 you could come up with a device that gets the

307
00:17:31.591 --> 00:17:36.570
woman away from the fucking door so you can fucking leave when they're blocking

308
00:17:36.571 --> 00:17:37.530
it would,

309
00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:42.531
that does not involve like hurting them or her at any point.

310
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.570
Also being able to say that you put your hands on. So I figured there's like,

311
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.780
I don't know. I know what you have.

312
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.490
Like you have like giant fucking like these nerf hands. Okay.

313
00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.660
And you just put 'em on either side of her. Right. Then once you stick them on,

314
00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:01.650
they just stick on. Like,

315
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:04.530
you know when they have like those plastic explosives that you just slap on the

316
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:07.020
side of a tank. It's like once they on you, they're fucking on you.

317
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.590
You're going to owe her a new shirt. All right. But at the end of the day,

318
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.100
that's worth, worth the fucking price of just getting the fuck out of there.

319
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.850
Okay. So you put them on either side of her and then you have, you know,

320
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:20.310
those blood pressure pumps as a, you

321
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.150
xxxxxx that she can't fucking move, you know, and then, yeah. Then you, you,

322
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.780
you got an inflatable BBA, right? And then you just guide her over.

323
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.690
You put her down on the fucking bean bag, you open the door,

324
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.320
and then you fucking bring the blood pressure pump just to the outside of the

325
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:40.020
door. You close the door and right as your, by ready to close it,

326
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.400
you release it, see closed the door, and then you fucking run to your car,

327
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.713
right?

328
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.830
You know that day where you're fucking running and you feel lightheaded in shit

329
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.260
and she's going to be come running down the hall after you.

330
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.730
Now it's like you're in a horror movie.

331
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.880
You're trying to get your keys out in here. She fucking comes.

332
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.440
You get in the fucking car of,

333
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:03.441
hopefully you get the car door close before that fucking lunatic comes up to

334
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.280
stick her fucking arm and you close the door, you lock it,

335
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.320
and then you know what she's going to do.

336
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.310
She's going to stand behind your fucking car.

337
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.530
Then all you do is you just start the car right? And you rev the fucking engine.

338
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.650
Get those admissions in her face. You listen to some tunes.

339
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.800
Eventually she's going to have to go to the bathroom and who knows?

340
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.000
Maybe an hour later, maybe a fucking hour later, you know,

341
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:28.050
you get the fuck out of there.

342
00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:31.323
<v 2>Bye.</v>

343
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.190
<v 0>1995 I can put that in infomercial, not even infomercial. That's too much money.</v>

344
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.360
I can do that in a fucking 32nd spot, right?

345
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:41.680
Fellas?

346
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.220
Have you ever wanted to leave your girlfriend's apartment but she won't let you?

347
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.590
What do you do? You've tried moving her out of the way, right? She yells,

348
00:19:50.591 --> 00:19:55.000
fucking rape that the cops come in and fucking tackle you and show you in a cell

349
00:19:55.001 --> 00:19:59.500
with a fucking giant cellmate looking at you like he's going to bang you in the

350
00:19:59.501 --> 00:20:00.220
ass. Right?

351
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.040
That's the first six seconds of the commercial and I think you guys can do the

352
00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:07.450
rest of it. Maybe that's a reason to have a four wheel drive vehicle.

353
00:20:07.451 --> 00:20:10.960
So when she's like, uh, standing behind, you can't back out.

354
00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.590
You just put it in drive. Go right up and over a curb. I don't know.

355
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.880
I guess what I'm really getting at here is I hope you guys all enjoyed your

356
00:20:18.881 --> 00:20:22.270
holidays. Your Nice fucking days off here.

357
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.540
You know, I spent so long since I've had a day job yet.

358
00:20:25.541 --> 00:20:29.610
Do you guys have to go back to work today? That sucks, man. You know,

359
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.400
the day after Christmas, you write back and then let's see, what is it?

360
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.750
New Year's Day is what? It's Sunday.

361
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.310
Yeah. News days. Sunday. But then they played the bowl games on Monday.

362
00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:47.710
So maybe next weekend you get the fucking three day weekend. I have no idea.

363
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.310
All I can say is fuck you. 2016.

364
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.600
Glad this year's over man. Um, you know,

365
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:58.740
a while ago when they came up with the college football playoffs,

366
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.500
somebody play off. Somebody asked me to comment on it. Um,

367
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.200
and I was too fucking busy editing to the goddamn show.

368
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.780
I'd never really looked at it. Um,

369
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.360
and it just dawned on me that Ohio state is in and Penn state is out.

370
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:14.800
How the fuck does that work?

371
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:16.990
<v 1>Okay,</v>

372
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.730
<v 0>somebody please explain that to me.</v>

373
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

374
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.980
<v 0>Penn State won the big 10 championship and they beat Ohio state.</v>

375
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.660
Penn state's in the fucking Rosebowl and Ohio State's in the playoff.

376
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.380
I've got a friend of mine who's a buckeyes fans and he's bitching about Alex

377
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:33.700
[inaudible],

378
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.450
<v 3>Bam, Oh dude, who these, these schedule</v>

379
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.330
<v 0>as fuck. And he's whining. It's like, dude, you shouldn't even be in there.</v>

380
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

381
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.310
<v 0>Iowa state should not fucking be in there.</v>

382
00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.560
That makes no fucking sense whatsoever. And all you fucking cons.

383
00:21:48.561 --> 00:21:52.610
Who are going to go will Alabama had a real easy schedule. Sec sucked this year.

384
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.170
So what sec was there?

385
00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.560
The whole fucking year was basically playing a national championship game like

386
00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:04.970
fucking two, three times. They, the conference was that good for 10 years?

387
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.710
Alabama had to fight through all of that. So one time they get an easy year.

388
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.330
Um, yeah. Anyways, having said that,

389
00:22:14.331 --> 00:22:16.820
I'm still rooting against them cause you have to, they're so fucking good.

390
00:22:16.821 --> 00:22:20.120
It's fun. It's fun. And I told you my favorite thing in sports,

391
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.130
Alabama down at the half.

392
00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.460
And then Nick Saban has to talk to one of those sideline reporter women.

393
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.860
You know, all he wants to do is fucking slam some lockers,

394
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.040
is chew out his punter or some shit. And he's got to sit there.

395
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.070
Like I'm telling you, if anything is going to put that guy in an early grave,

396
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:42.010
it's that fucking interview we asked to do. Um, so anyways, yeah, I don't,

397
00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.080
I mean I'm not like Anti Ohio state, but that does,

398
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.210
that does not seem fair to me at all.

399
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.660
How does a team that didn't win the big 10,

400
00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.990
it didn't even win their fucking conference championship is in the final four.

401
00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:59.840
It's all bullshit. It's all fucking money. It's all money.

402
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.970
Iowa state is going to get better ratings.

403
00:23:01.971 --> 00:23:05.060
I bet it's going to give them better ratings than fucking Penn state.

404
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.260
Other than that, it makes no fucking sense on paper. You know?

405
00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.250
And I love those kids that are going to sit out there ballgame and every,

406
00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.910
<v 3>but he's just like, Whoa, what the fuck</v>

407
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:18.700
<v 0>sports talk radio guys. It's like, dude, it's fucking slave labor.</v>

408
00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.450
Remember that dude on Ohio state played that fucking Penn state. Uh,

409
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:26.260
was it Willis from a gay, he got his fucking knee blown out for free.

410
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.360
Caused him a career in the NFL. If he didn't have such a great fucking agent,

411
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.800
um, yeah. Fuck you. You're going to sell,

412
00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.520
sell a Jersey with the kid's name on it. You're going to make millions more.

413
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:46.450
The fucking players are selling out 100,000 seat and don't get a fucking dime.

414
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.460
Figure that one out.

415
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:50.650
<v 2>Okay?</v>

416
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:55.090
<v 0>All those players throughout the fucking century of the damn team that have</v>

417
00:23:55.091 --> 00:23:59.470
created the excitement gone out there, blown out their knees,

418
00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:03.370
got concussions, got paralyzed, died early fucking deaths.

419
00:24:03.371 --> 00:24:06.060
Do not get one dime. Fuck you and your ballgame.

420
00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.640
They got to start giving these kids money, man. It's fucking brutal.

421
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.080
It's brutal.

422
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.890
I love all the fucking nerds that actually go to class and they get mad at the

423
00:24:14.891 --> 00:24:17.230
athletes because they don't show up. It's like, hey fucking,

424
00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.500
if it wasn't for that kid out there, you would,

425
00:24:19.501 --> 00:24:22.510
you would have a class in a tent right now. You know,

426
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:26.080
what do you think paid for this? This fucking biology classroom,

427
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:27.883
<v 2>Huh?</v>

428
00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.950
<v 0>People show up 100,000 people showing up to look at you.</v>

429
00:24:31.951 --> 00:24:35.070
Look through a fucking microscope. It didn't, all right.

430
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.340
You don't have a sexy job deal with it. Right.

431
00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.860
I don't get it. Having said that, I'm still going to watch and I'm,

432
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:50.920
I dunno, I like Clemson too, but uh, I don't know. I'm kind of a big 10 guy too.

433
00:24:50.921 --> 00:24:53.140
I probably still root for house state, but that, that's so fun.

434
00:24:53.141 --> 00:24:56.110
It doesn't make any fucking sense. I mean,

435
00:24:56.111 --> 00:24:59.680
there's always going to be a reason to complain because football's such a

436
00:24:59.681 --> 00:25:02.590
violent game that they can't have like march madness.

437
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.480
They just can't be too many fucking games and too many kids getting hurt. Right.

438
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.830
So every year someone's going to get mad and a,

439
00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:16.640
so I usually blow it off, but this year Penn State got fucked.

440
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.070
You know? I mean, maybe it's leftover San Dusky Shit. You know what I mean?

441
00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:23.660
Like not enough time has gone by.

442
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.920
I'm just going to pause here to listen to all the Penn state fans go. Ah,

443
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.050
you know, it's funny.

444
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:38.050
Is the fucking Tom Brady deflate gate story lasted longer than that sent Dusky

445
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.420
Shit. And that's the world that we live in. Fuck you.

446
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.260
Um, all right, let's get to some of the questions here for this week shall we?

447
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.260
Um,

448
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:50.560
<v 2>okay.</v>

449
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.860
<v 0>Oh, how about the fucking Celtics man, that's Celtics Knicks game was great.</v>

450
00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:58.000
The NBA too, by the way. Bravo for saying, all right, NFL,

451
00:25:58.001 --> 00:26:00.130
you get thanksgiving, we get Christmas.

452
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.940
They actually muscled the NFL out a position on a football Sunday to the point

453
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:10.930
that all the fucking games are on Saturday, Saturday.

454
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.080
Were there any NFL games yesterday? I didn't even look.

455
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.050
The NBA Games was so fucking great. I missed the first one.

456
00:26:17.051 --> 00:26:21.470
I watched the Celtics and Nick's great fucking game then we almost blew it.

457
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.530
And here's the funny thing is Michael Rappaport still owes me dinner from the

458
00:26:26.531 --> 00:26:29.470
NBA finals and that cause he's a cheat motherfucker or anything.

459
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.150
It's cause we're both fucking busy and we just,

460
00:26:31.151 --> 00:26:34.390
we run into each other like once every six months. So Celtics,

461
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:39.040
the play in Nicks on Christmas Day. And I saw, I texted him, I said, Hey Mike,

462
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.590
you want to go double enough and I'll take the Celtics straight up. And he goes,

463
00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:47.460
absolutely. And then he goes, wait, he goes, so if,

464
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.800
if I lose, do I owe you two dinners? I go, no, you owe me breakfast.

465
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.440
You owe me dinner and now you owe me breakfast.

466
00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.540
And then we'll bet on the Superbowl and if I win, you know, if you, if you win,

467
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:02.670
you don't owe me shit. And if I, when you owe me breakfast,

468
00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:04.560
lunch and dinner and you're going to fucking take me out,

469
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:08.910
we're going to do a youtube video of you taken me out on the town for the entire

470
00:27:08.911 --> 00:27:13.410
fucking day. And uh, so he said, all right, so he's in.

471
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.630
So what I'm hoping is that there's going to be a Patriot's giants fucking the

472
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:19.620
trilogy.

473
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.660
And of course I'm taking my patriots and I'm hoping this is the year that our

474
00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:27.300
defense doesn't let Tom Brady down.

475
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.900
Cause the first two times we played the giants,

476
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:35.400
He drove them at the Patriots down the field for the go ahead score. Both Times.

477
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:38.550
He has six for six in Superbowls.

478
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.120
When it is counted right,

479
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.420
the time would Dunavan McNabb fucking throws up.

480
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.160
Neil O'Donnell throws a pick paint, manning throws a pick six.

481
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.800
Tom Brady has manned up all six.

482
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:57.780
He's gone six and o unfortunately his defense has gone forward too.

483
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.700
Um, so I want to see that rematch.

484
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.220
And um, of course I'm going to take the Patriots and I texted him,

485
00:28:08.221 --> 00:28:11.280
I said, okay, so patriots and giants play each other.

486
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.770
What's going to happen? Are the Patriots going to go oh and three?

487
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:17.911
No.

488
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:20.580
The giant's going to go out and say that the giant is going to go three and no

489
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.590
against the Patriots. Or is Michael Rappaport going to go oh,

490
00:28:25.591 --> 00:28:30.450
in three against the menu. So, um, hopefully that's going to happen.

491
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.590
You know, I want the Patriots to play. We'd go back to super.

492
00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:37.680
We have to play the fucking charts. I don't give a fuck about Seattle.

493
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:39.090
We already played them. We already beat them.

494
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.030
I don't give a fuck about anybody else. We gotta we gotta go back.

495
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.990
You got to do it. You know, I talked to some fucking patriots. Fans are like,

496
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:49.410
oh my God, that makes me sick to my stomach. So what are you gonna do?

497
00:28:49.411 --> 00:28:50.280
You're gonna quit.

498
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.400
Now you're gonna put your Paul revere hat between your fucking legs and go home.

499
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.240
You know, I think the biggest thing this year as they, as their coach,

500
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.660
even though their coaches doing like a good job and everything, but you know,

501
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.880
I don't know, I just though this is so stupid, I just look at a coach,

502
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:10.440
I judge a book by its cover and I just look at that guy and I'm just like, yeah,

503
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:14.550
you know, I'm not feeling, I'm not feeling this guy. This guy just looks like a,

504
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.460
it looks like a die giants fan. That's what he looks like.

505
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:21.480
He does not look like a a head coach.

506
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:26.790
Um, so anyways, we shall see. And I told you I'm not buying into, I don't,

507
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.870
I don't buy, I'm not, I don't believe in the cowboys. I don't like their coach.

508
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.570
I look at them, I'm like, I do not, I just don't like that guy.

509
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.580
Not like personally don't like him.

510
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:37.950
I just look at him and he just doesn't look at your head coach

511
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.580
like a head coach. You gotta look at them. You gotta be like, aw man,

512
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.560
I would not want to get yelled at by that guy.

513
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.190
I know what you guys are thinking. What about p Carol?

514
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:50.350
P Carol looks like he's going to Bible study. Yeah,

515
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.030
but if you look into p Carol has shark eyes. Okay.

516
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.480
I'm telling you that fucking guy, you know,

517
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.490
I'm not trying to put rumors out there,

518
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:05.170
but if that guy had like a dead hooker in his past, okay. Or at least, you know,

519
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:08.920
one that lost consciousness and he brought her around, you know,

520
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.060
it would not surprise me.

521
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.470
That is so fucked up to say, I'm sure he's a hell of a guy. All right,

All right, I'm back. I'm back finally to fucking clean my God damn throat.

609
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.870
You know what happens? I woke up this morning, but dude, we do dude.

610
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.900
And I just started doing the podcast cause I've got to do much of shit today as

611
00:35:09.331 --> 00:35:10.680
always, as always.

612
00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:15.150
A hey Billy Balden Billy Ball. Dan,

613
00:35:15.151 --> 00:35:19.500
do you get it? Billy balding business. Billy Ball. Dan His brother.

614
00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.750
I heard you ranting about how New England keeps offloading defense defending

615
00:35:24.751 --> 00:35:29.610
players. You're half right, but this year is a big year for salary cap.

616
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.740
What do you mean? I'm half right?

617
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.350
Name One person that is finished their fucking career with the Patriots on the

618
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:40.950
defensive side since fucking uh,

619
00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:42.360
<v 2>yeah.</v>

620
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.510
<v 0>Teddy Bruschi or fucking Willie McGinest.</v>

621
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:47.023
<v 2>Okay.</v>

622
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.040
<v 0>We never keep them. I'm not half right dude.</v>

623
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:53.990
Richard Seymour lawyer Malloy Thai law. Uh,

624
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.250
who's a big fucking um, oh my God,

625
00:35:57.251 --> 00:36:00.190
I can't believe we forgot his fucking name cause they're only with us for a few

626
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:04.720
years. Who is the Big Fat Guy? Our nose tackle. He's gone.

627
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.193
<v 2>I don't know.</v>

628
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.010
<v 0>Anyways, he said you're half right. Dante, hightower.</v>

629
00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:13.330
Malcolm Butler are both in their mid twenties and in contracts years expect both

630
00:36:13.331 --> 00:36:17.620
of them get big contracts in the off season. I don't expect that.

631
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.100
I don't expect that at all. Maybe one of them will.

632
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:25.060
So what you're saying is I'm half right. You're saying expect them.

633
00:36:25.061 --> 00:36:28.340
So on your forecast, I'm telling you what has happened.

634
00:36:28.341 --> 00:36:30.470
You're saying on your forecast that what you are you,

635
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.940
what you are projecting that that's, that's one of your points. Okay.

636
00:36:33.941 --> 00:36:36.610
Your first point is out the fucking window. All right.

637
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.080
That's science fiction there. Okay.

638
00:36:38.081 --> 00:36:41.620
Expect to see both of them get big contracts in the off season. Patrick Chung,

639
00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.740
the strong safety is 30 now and we have a great young backup in Landon Collins

640
00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:48.940
who is also in a contract year. Okay.

641
00:36:48.941 --> 00:36:53.530
So expect Patrick Chung to get the fucking evo because he's 30 and now we'll

642
00:36:53.531 --> 00:36:55.930
probably be like, hey, I'm a veteran. I play in this league.

643
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:58.660
I've demonstrated that I can do the job and that's when they go. Okay,

644
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:03.520
fucking see you later. Finally, the pro bowl, free safety,

645
00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:07.900
Devin McCourty is getting top dollar dollar. So it isn't just the offense.

646
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.950
Okay. So in all of that shit you just said,

647
00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:15.580
you only named one guy who's getting top dollar.

648
00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:21.250
Okay. Everything else was projecting shit. Right.

649
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:27.150
Hope that brings some clarity to Billy Superbowl's pre-trade deadline move

650
00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.830
sending Jamie Collins,

651
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:34.330
another middle linebacker entering a contract year who was underperforming

652
00:37:34.331 --> 00:37:38.770
compared to hightower. Thanks for a great podcast. Underperforming.

653
00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.410
All right. Whatever. Well like how you,

654
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:46.060
I like [inaudible] you ignored a Chandler Jones who's having a fucking pro bowl

655
00:37:46.061 --> 00:37:48.010
year with Arizona.

656
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

657
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.890
<v 0>Um, you basically told me that Devin McCord is getting paid.</v>

658
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.940
That's basically what you told me. And um,

659
00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.510
they've always paid guys who are in their mid twenties, when I'm talking about,

660
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.870
is that next contract, that next one. They're like, yeah,

661
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:07.790
get the fuck out of here. You add a Patrick Chung,

662
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:13.060
get the fuck outta here. All right. Um, here we go.

663
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.880
I mean, look, as much as I'm complaining it is working,

664
00:38:15.881 --> 00:38:20.881
but it does get frustrating to see these guys that just shut down this side of

665
00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:23.630
the field in every couple of years. We get rid of that. Right.

666
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.720
<v 2>Okay. And, um,</v>

667
00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.460
<v 0>like I always feel like, you know what, I always feel like our defense,</v>

668
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.013
you know,

669
00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.330
sense the McGuinness variable and Teddy Bruschi years,

670
00:38:37.331 --> 00:38:41.440
I always feel like it goes in, it's like my pie, it looks like it's done,

671
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:45.940
but inside it's still soupy, you know? So when we go up against the giants,

672
00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:49.020
I just feel like we don't know. Those two times we went up again,

673
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:53.290
we didn't match up well against them. They had a monster defense.

674
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.580
You know, we're coming in there. You know, we had Leanna,

675
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.110
I just, I dunno, I love I, that's why I love the giants.

676
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.510
I love the giants cause they always have a great fucking defense.

677
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.000
I always have a great fucking defense. I that, you know,

678
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.620
that's why I like to steal Steelers back in the day,

679
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:11.990
that doomsday defensive cow where's you got to love those teams, you know,

680
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.490
cause then your offense can just be like good and you're going to win the

681
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:19.390
fucking game. That's how fucking Mark Sanchez, everybody will ask.

682
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.360
They started calling them Sanchez. They fucking defense was great.

683
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:27.190
Then they lost everybody and all of a sudden, you know,

684
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.920
uh, USC boy there didn't, couldn't just manage the game.

685
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.970
He at nanny had to play from behind. He's like, Eh, where do I go?

686
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:37.451
Where do I go?

687
00:39:37.451 --> 00:39:41.530
And he runs right into the fucking ass of his linemen and got a concussion.

688
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.550
Well, you would've got a concussion. No, he probably didn't get a concussion.

689
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:49.030
That guy probably did too many squats. His ass was probably like an elbow.

690
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.680
Alright. Podcast inspired girlfriend to quit job that was making her miserable.

691
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.580
Oh Jesus Christ. This should be on the Oprah Winfrey network or we are.

692
00:39:57.581 --> 00:40:00.190
We actually going to have like a feel good fucking story here.

693
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.040
Fuck is going on with these blinds. Open the blinds. Okay.

694
00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.680
What did we get here? 40 minutes in. Okay.

695
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.460
Somebody's got to stretch this shit into another 20 minutes of ignorance. Okay.

696
00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.180
I've been, well, Bill, you've been doing great for the first 40 minutes.

697
00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:16.901
All right.

698
00:40:16.901 --> 00:40:20.020
Podcast inspired girlfriend to quit job that was making her miserable.

699
00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:22.540
Hey Billy bilichick. Um,

700
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.560
my girlfriend and I love the podcast and we listened to it together.

701
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.980
Whenever we're on a long road trip.

702
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:31.510
A few months ago we put on your interview with Joe Rogan, uh,

703
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:35.560
when you guys started talking about jobs you hated and how you knew, uh,

704
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:38.590
and how you had to, to know when to walk.

705
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:43.720
My girlfriends started crying. Oh, Jesus. Up to that point,

706
00:40:43.721 --> 00:40:45.790
I knew that she had issues with their job,

707
00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:50.680
but had no idea that our company was putting it through so much grief. Um,

708
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.130
so much grief that it was making her absolutely miserable deep down inside.

709
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.150
Once you heard the interview it convinced and inspired her to take action as

710
00:40:58.151 --> 00:41:01.150
quickly as possible to seek new employment. Good for her.

711
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:06.220
Yeah and that's a great habit to get into and you do it when you fucking young

712
00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.120
cause you don't have any kids, no wife, no husband, no mortgage.

713
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.430
That's when you fucking make you moves.

714
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.140
I'm not to say you can't do it after that but it's obviously um,

715
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:22.420
you know the there's, there's no reason not to do it when you're young. Okay.

716
00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:26.980
Now she's on the right track for really great job and the possibilities of a

717
00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:30.910
permanent hire with a really good companies seem to be in the works of seem to

718
00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:32.110
be in the works. Knock on wood,

719
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:35.510
I would like to personally thank you and Mr Rogan for not only providing us with

720
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:40.511
great entertainment but also inadvertently helping out someone I truly love and

721
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:43.160
care about to seek a positive work environment. Dude,

722
00:41:43.161 --> 00:41:44.930
is there going to be anything I could make fun of in this?

723
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:48.020
This is just like a nice letter. She is also,

724
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.760
she is already in better spirits than ever before and it's in part thanks to

725
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:56.420
you. Hope to see you come through the Carolina's next time around.

726
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:58.850
Thanks again and have a wonderful holiday. Well that's great.

727
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.530
All I can do is reiterate. I can't remember what the fuck I said, but yeah.

728
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:08.630
Um, you know, I, I had a friend of mine that was working for, uh,

729
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.430
was working for the Nestle Company, I think it was Nestle.

730
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:17.330
He's one of those fucking corporations and they will run in this person ragged.

731
00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:22.130
And I literally watched this person go from a positive person to somebody that I

732
00:42:22.131 --> 00:42:27.131
started to avoid his phone calls because like it was getting so fucking

733
00:42:27.651 --> 00:42:32.030
negative. And then, uh, one day this person just said,

734
00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:32.960
fuck this,

735
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:38.860
quit and actually started working for like a nonprofit and was happy as fucking

736
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:43.961
hell and is now back in the corporate world at a company that he fucking loves

737
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.950
in. Like, you have to fucking do them, man. You know,

738
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.830
that whole fucking fear of like, you know,

739
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.110
how am I going to pay for Shit?

740
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:58.460
We'll keep you in these bad relationships with these horrific fucking companies.

741
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:01.040
Right. Um, but what she had,

742
00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:06.041
you have to always be willing to sacrifice for your own happiness.

743
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:11.210
And if that involves downsizing your fucking life and just getting,

744
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.300
just looking at all this shit on your shelves and all of this stuff that you

745
00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:18.200
fucking have, it'd be like, how much of this shit do I even fucking need?

746
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:20.510
Cause I'm sitting here, you know,

747
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:23.780
in our guests room where I have all my drum videos, my magazines,

748
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:27.200
all these fucking books, they've just sat on the shelf for fucking years.

749
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:30.710
Like if you literally took everything off of this fucking shelves.

750
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:35.930
Okay. Other than the sentimental value of a few fucking things, I wouldn't even,

751
00:43:35.931 --> 00:43:37.070
you can empty all the fucking,

752
00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:41.810
those little cabinets if you emptied all of it other than when I walked in and I

753
00:43:41.811 --> 00:43:46.430
didn't see it, I wouldn't miss any of it. Um,

754
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:53.960
except for I have the 1970 is in 1972.

755
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:58.210
It's the most expensive years of football cards. Um,

756
00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:02.630
I have the complete set that I would miss that I witness.

757
00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.140
There's a couple other things I got up there. But other than that, I, you know,

758
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.090
I'm, you know what? I'm going to get rid of all that fucking shit.

759
00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.760
I'm gonna downsize my fuck. But I'm saying you can do that.

760
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:15.080
Think about when you first fucking, you know, moved out of your house.

761
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.770
What did you have? You had to close on your back. Couple pieces. Shit,

762
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.820
things have furniture, right? And then other than that, just over the years,

763
00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.360
you get subscriptions to magazines. You say that you start collecting shit.

764
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:27.410
People give you stuff,

765
00:44:27.411 --> 00:44:31.410
you go and fucking trips and you buy shot glasses and then all of a sudden what

766
00:44:31.411 --> 00:44:36.390
you really yet your house is just this giant storage shed for a bunch of shit

767
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:39.630
that you don't lead. Your apartment becomes the same way.

768
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.720
So if you downsize all of that to get out of a fucking job,

769
00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:49.650
you don't want to be in and you reduce your fucking overhead in the meantime,

770
00:44:49.651 --> 00:44:52.830
you can actually make less. You know,

771
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.300
there's all different ways to get out of the job, start spending less,

772
00:44:57.301 --> 00:45:01.800
saving up fucking money so you can quit your job and live for four months

773
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.090
without having to fucking work or whatever, or making a little bit less money.

774
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.141
In the meantime,

775
00:45:07.141 --> 00:45:10.830
just get rid of a bunch of shit that you don't even fucking need. Um,

776
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:15.870
I got to do that with the baby coming in any fucking day. Now I gotta uh,

777
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.440
I gotta get rid of a bunch of shit cause God knows she's going to have a bunch

778
00:45:19.441 --> 00:45:22.720
of shit too, right? Uh,

779
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.730
I don't fucking know. Anyways, here we go. Let's fucking, let's,

780
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:31.350
let's plow ahead here. Uh, return gifts. Alright, dear bill,

781
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.160
I got to get into a debate with my fiance. I got into a debate with my fiance.

782
00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:38.490
She seems to think it's rude. I don't wanna be rude.

783
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.080
It seems to be rude to ask someone for a gift receipt for a gift they did not

784
00:45:43.081 --> 00:45:43.914
like.

785
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:46.230
<v 2>Um,</v>

786
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:50.160
<v 0>I told her that it would be worse to keep the gift and never use it than to</v>

787
00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:52.980
return for a better size of something different. All together.

788
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:58.260
I take you for the type of guy to just say thank you and throw it out if you

789
00:45:58.261 --> 00:46:02.370
don't like it. Good call man. I actually, if I don't like something,

790
00:46:02.371 --> 00:46:06.240
I would never, I just don't do that. I just, uh, I take it down to goodwill.

791
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:11.160
Um, I got a jacket from my aunt that I don't like and doesn't fit.

792
00:46:11.161 --> 00:46:16.161
She thinks I should just exchange it for a proper size and call it a day.

793
00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.620
I know for a fact that my aunt wouldn't be offended because we're close enough

794
00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:23.850
that I can tell her that thoughts on this, you know?

795
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:25.100
<v 2>Okay.</v>

796
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.140
<v 0>This is one that I, it's up to you.</v>

797
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:33.010
I think it's a good exercise to tell somebody what you're really feeling at the

798
00:46:33.651 --> 00:46:37.610
price of their feelings. I just don't know if it's with a Christmas gift.

799
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.693
<v 2>Um, [inaudible]</v>

800
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.700
<v 0>I think you can do it once to somebody, but if next year,</v>

801
00:46:43.701 --> 00:46:48.380
if they come back with something ugly again, then you're just saying,

802
00:46:48.381 --> 00:46:51.830
you know, you have bad tastes. But, uh,

803
00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.540
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

804
00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:58.270
I don't think there's anything wrong with it and a date. Look,

805
00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.700
I gotta be honest with you. If I've got somebody a fucking gift right now,

806
00:47:01.701 --> 00:47:05.420
if they didn't start screaming at me, make me sit down. Like if I ever got,

807
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.700
if I ever got my wife a gift, she was like, you know, I don't like this.

808
00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.700
Can I exchange it? I'd be like, yeah, fuck yeah, absolutely. Here's the receipt.

809
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.700
Have Fun. Go into those crowded malls. I'm done.

810
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:17.150
I have fulfilled my end of the,

811
00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.540
the verbal contractual agreement that we have that I will buy you a Christmas

812
00:47:20.541 --> 00:47:23.030
gift. But you know, when you go to return the fucking thing, I mean,

813
00:47:23.031 --> 00:47:26.570
that's on you. You can go back in there with all those fucking animals again.

814
00:47:26.571 --> 00:47:29.650
I'm not doing it. Um, yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

815
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.810
I think a, that that's maybe that's a preference thing. You know,

816
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:39.290
if you want to fucking, do you want to go that route? You know, God bless Ya.

817
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:45.000
You go that fucking route. If you don't, I respect that too. Um,

818
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:49.130
all right. I slept my sister on Christmas Eve. I don't believe this.

819
00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.230
I don't believe this at all. Dear Billy Bitch tits.

820
00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:56.090
I'm bitch tits and you slapped a woman. Um, hey Billy.

821
00:47:56.091 --> 00:48:00.380
Recently my family celebrated my dad's birthday, which is on Christmas Eve.

822
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.820
And like every year we went to a local Mexican restaurant.

823
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.360
My mother bought him a very expensive bottle of Middleton triple distilled Irish

824
00:48:12.051 --> 00:48:15.680
whiskey. I'd never heard of that shit. Uh, I hope I said it right,

825
00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.750
which we proceed to drink once we returned to my parents house. All right.

826
00:48:20.751 --> 00:48:24.350
How many of you are on this bottle and there's a woman slapped in the end of

827
00:48:24.351 --> 00:48:26.930
this? Jesus Christ. This is like a fucking country music video.

828
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.880
Once we were back,

829
00:48:28.881 --> 00:48:33.881
my sister who's 30 asked if she could collect pictures of us as little kids,

830
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.870
she could make an album. I see.

831
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:40.930
I knew exactly where some great ones were of her as a baby and my mother's

832
00:48:41.331 --> 00:48:44.660
drawer where she, my mother had previously shown me,

833
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:47.380
um, you know, I,

834
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.360
I don't know what's going to happen in this thing or if it's even a true story,

835
00:48:50.361 --> 00:48:52.700
but I'm already saying at some point somebody should have said,

836
00:48:52.701 --> 00:48:55.820
fair enough before somebody gets slapped with he goes,

837
00:48:55.821 --> 00:48:59.990
my sister has a different father than I, and from what I gather,

838
00:48:59.991 --> 00:49:04.991
her dad was a not so great guy and my mother doesn't seem to have any fun

839
00:49:05.481 --> 00:49:07.010
memories of that relationship.

840
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

841
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:10.370
<v 0>Um, okay.</v>

842
00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:15.700
I presented the pictures to her expecting her to have either seen them before or

843
00:49:16.971 --> 00:49:19.160
to be thrilled to be seeing them for the first time.

844
00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.940
The pictures were of her and her father with my mother's family.

845
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:28.760
Um, I'm getting lost here. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

846
00:49:28.761 --> 00:49:31.190
You guys have the same mom but different dads. Okay. Also,

847
00:49:31.191 --> 00:49:34.130
her birth certificate was in the certificate was in the envelope,

848
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.370
which she apparently, which apparently she had never seen.

849
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:41.960
She's 30 she never had to produce a birth certificate. Once she saw them,

850
00:49:41.961 --> 00:49:43.100
she freaked out.

851
00:49:43.101 --> 00:49:47.960
She began to berate my mother for never showing them to her in a full blown

852
00:49:47.961 --> 00:49:52.250
fight in suit. Of course, I was mortified.

853
00:49:52.251 --> 00:49:56.180
I had no idea this was going to happen. Um, I'm going to go out on a limb here,

854
00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:00.050
sir. When I say at this moment, this is not about you anymore. Okay. I mean,

855
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.110
she didn't have a good relationship with her dad. This could be, you know,

856
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:09.140
something that she needed or something that seems to be between her and her mom.

857
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:11.700
And if you're going to go third man in,

858
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:15.090
that's a game as conduct and I would say a fucking 10 game suspension,

859
00:50:15.091 --> 00:50:16.510
at least a,

860
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.560
she said horribly hurtful things to my mother and tried to storm out once I

861
00:50:22.711 --> 00:50:26.790
stepped in and tried to stop her. Oh Shit. Now you're doing that thing,

862
00:50:26.791 --> 00:50:28.760
so need this product too. Fuck.

863
00:50:28.761 --> 00:50:32.090
I'd make a zillion dollar the male or female.

864
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:33.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

865
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.960
<v 0>Person remover. Oh,</v>

866
00:50:35.961 --> 00:50:40.320
ignorant am I then I never thought that a woman ever had to fucking try to get

867
00:50:40.321 --> 00:50:43.050
through the door with some fucking asshole guys. Dan,

868
00:50:43.051 --> 00:50:46.740
my apology and all the ladies. All right. Once I stepped in and tried,

869
00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.720
once I stepped in and tried to stop her,

870
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:52.950
she began to attack me and shout out everything that was wrong with me and my

871
00:50:52.951 --> 00:50:57.510
life. I defended myself yelling back all the fucked up shit she's done.

872
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.930
Um, that's not defending yourself, sir.

873
00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.750
What you did was you went to her emotional level,

874
00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:08.340
which you should've done was just laid on the fucking ropes, let her go,

875
00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.020
and then afterwards she would have owed you an apology. Uh, anyways,

876
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.290
so he goes then with Mike, this is,

877
00:51:13.291 --> 00:51:15.180
this is why you don't go home for the holidays.

878
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:18.750
This shit always ends up happening. Then with my mother and father there,

879
00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:24.210
she charged me and punched me square in the eye with this insane look on her

880
00:51:24.211 --> 00:51:27.120
face while she wanted to leave. And you weren't letting her,

881
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.610
I was trying to keep her at arms length and telling myself over and over don't

882
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:33.444
hit her.

883
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:38.250
The final Straw came when with both my parents trying to hold her back,

884
00:51:38.251 --> 00:51:41.070
she managed to kick me in the face with their boots on.

885
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:42.990
<v 1>Okay,</v>

886
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:46.970
<v 0>aren't you standing up? How the fuck did she do that? Oh,</v>

887
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:50.450
they held her back and Ted gave her leverage or is she like Anderson Silver and

888
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:53.540
she just gave you that front upkick that you didn't see whatever the fuck you

889
00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:54.680
call it in MMA terms.

890
00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.040
Then I proceeded calmly and coolly to pick the exact moment when to reach in and

891
00:52:01.131 --> 00:52:05.480
give her an open palm slap right across the whole left side of her face.

892
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:09.170
You did that calmly and coolly. Oh, Jesus.

893
00:52:09.171 --> 00:52:12.980
She immediately stopped at Tirade and went in her car to pout.

894
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:19.070
Wow. Have Dude. He slapped her in the face. I don't think she's pouting.

895
00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:23.180
She laid chilled out and fell asleep on the sofa. Christmas being tomorrow.

896
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:24.043
I need your help.

897
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:28.430
Did I do the wrong thing and how can I keep things from being fucked up from

898
00:52:28.431 --> 00:52:31.280
here on out. Thank you. Go Fuck Yourself. Did you do the wrong thing?

899
00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:35.600
You slapped a woman? Yes. I mean, she's coming at you with a knife then. Yeah,

900
00:52:35.601 --> 00:52:37.640
you can go close fist that at that point. But I mean,

901
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:44.180
all she was trying to do is leave. Um, here's the thing, dude. She had

902
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.720
<v 1>oh,</v>

903
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:50.720
<v 0>a valid reaction to something that really hurt her in,</v>

904
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.500
in her pain. She said a bunch of mean things to her mom.

905
00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.830
All right? Now she comes from a broken home. I mean,

906
00:52:59.831 --> 00:53:01.720
this shit's gonna happen during the fucking holidays.

907
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:05.800
You're fucking drunk on Whiskey, right? You guys a it, from what I can tell,

908
00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:09.400
there's only two of you on that bottle, maybe three or whatever, but you know,

909
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:12.550
three, four people killing a bottle of whiskey, you're all going to be hammered.

910
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.450
All right? Um, then she wanted to leave.

911
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.250
<v 1>Okay?</v>

912
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:20.770
<v 0>Now, if she's drunk and she wants to drive, that's one thing.</v>

913
00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:24.130
He did not put that in there. If she just wanted to leave to go beat by herself.

914
00:53:24.131 --> 00:53:27.090
There's nothing more than when you're hurt and you're emotional.

915
00:53:27.091 --> 00:53:30.720
You want to leave a room and people won't let you leave. It's fucking annoying.

916
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.720
All right? If she has no history of trying to hurt herself, she's not drunk.

917
00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.740
You gotta let her leave. Um, the fact that you just said,

918
00:53:38.741 --> 00:53:43.741
you calmly coolly waited for the fucking exact moment to reach in and slap her

919
00:53:45.041 --> 00:53:47.420
across the face means you contemplated this shit.

920
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.120
It's like she hit you and then you reacted.

921
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:51.190
<v 2>Um,</v>

922
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:54.800
<v 0>and did it, you made the decision, you thought about it and you waited for them.</v>

923
00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:59.620
So that point from like fucking second degree to first degree, um, so yeah, no,

924
00:53:59.621 --> 00:54:01.270
you didn't do the right thing and you should,

925
00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:04.390
I would feel terrible if I fucking did that.

926
00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:05.923
<v 2>Um,</v>

927
00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:11.400
<v 0>and how can you stop things from being fucked up from here on out? Uh,</v>

928
00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:17.800
well I would sit down and I would just keep playing over and over again how it

929
00:54:18.141 --> 00:54:23.141
escalated and you kind of zigged every time you should have zagged and just try

930
00:54:23.541 --> 00:54:26.300
to think of what you can do the next time. But, uh,

931
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:31.600
calmly coolly picking the exact moment to slap your sister in the face on

932
00:54:31.601 --> 00:54:32.440
Christmas Eve is

933
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:33.920
<v 2>okay.</v>

934
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.950
<v 0>Yeah, I would say you did the wrong thing. I mean, like I said, literally,</v>

935
00:54:36.951 --> 00:54:41.890
unless she was literally going to be doing physical harm to a well,

936
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.210
I guess she hit you that God, that's so fucked up.

937
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:48.320
I'm not even thinking that she kicked you in the face and she did all of that

938
00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:52.820
type of stuff. Um, I still gotta say,

939
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:54.470
cause they were holding her back.

940
00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.490
It's just one of the things that women get to get away with. They get,

941
00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:00.340
they get to get away with the salt veteran.

942
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.820
You see like you shouldn't fucking hit him.

943
00:55:01.821 --> 00:55:04.100
But how fucked up is it that even as a guy,

944
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:09.130
I wasn't even validating the point that she kicked you in the face and a punched

945
00:55:09.411 --> 00:55:12.440
you square in the eye with an insane look on her face.

946
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:16.640
I think it's very easily for me to be sitting here in bed,

947
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:20.330
not emotionally invested in any of this to say whether the fuck you did the

948
00:55:20.331 --> 00:55:24.950
right thing or the wrong thing. Um, you know, you got a, a,

949
00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.870
your family's gone through a fucked up time.

950
00:55:26.871 --> 00:55:30.290
You throw alcohol in there and some old fucking pictures and uh,

951
00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:32.293
you know,

952
00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:33.483
<v 2>okay.</v>

953
00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.280
<v 0>Your sister, you know, puts her hands on you when you hit her back. I mean,</v>

954
00:55:37.281 --> 00:55:39.620
I don't know. I don't know. I would have to look

955
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:44.500
maybe cause you said you calmly and coolly picked the exact moment,

956
00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.110
went to reach out. I Dunno. Maybe that's what fucking threw me off.

957
00:55:47.111 --> 00:55:51.730
But like if this all went down and like fucking three seconds, uh, you know,

958
00:55:51.731 --> 00:55:54.190
I think you guys all need some fucking group therapy. Um,

959
00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:58.210
all I can say is I'm glad I wasn't there. I'm glad I wasn't at that party.

960
00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.160
That's all I can say about that one. However,

961
00:56:03.161 --> 00:56:07.660
I do feel that I owe you an apology for judging your actions without even taking

962
00:56:07.661 --> 00:56:10.930
into consideration that you took two hits to the head, to the face.

963
00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:15.220
You hit me in the face. Right. Um,

964
00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:16.580
<v 2>okay.</v>

965
00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:17.413
<v 0>And you know,</v>

966
00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:22.250
I've see women like that and I know how hard they punch and kick and all that

967
00:56:22.251 --> 00:56:24.250
shit and they have no concern

968
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:29.150
for the fact that they're wearing shoes and they kick you in the face.

969
00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.660
So just said, you know, they weigh over a hundred pounds in,

970
00:56:31.661 --> 00:56:32.770
who wants to get hit by somebody,

971
00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.830
weighs a hundred pounds right in the fucking face. You don't,

972
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:39.790
and that the natural reaction to getting hit is to hit back and they got that

973
00:56:39.791 --> 00:56:42.760
whole, well, cause I'm a girl, you can't do it yet. I can just fucking,

974
00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:44.540
<v 2>okay.</v>

975
00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:46.910
<v 0>Break all the fucking rules in the, you know, it's, it's,</v>

976
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:49.010
it's one of the things, but you know, something I,

977
00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:51.443
<v 2>okay.</v>

978
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:54.040
<v 0>Maybe that's just one of the, one of the perks you get for being a woman,</v>

979
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:55.780
you know, they got to have their period every month.

980
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:59.110
They got to go through fucking labor. You know what I mean?

981
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.360
They got to get all those free drinks.

982
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:03.190
They always get the house during the divorce. I mean,

983
00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:05.230
there's a lot of things that they have to go through that maybe,

984
00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:09.460
maybe it's okay that they can hit us. I have no fucking idea. Um,

985
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:14.050
all I know is that, you know, if a woman ever hits you, you just,

986
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:18.100
you just fucking walk away. You just walk away. And, um,

987
00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:22.780
if they're not related to you, you just end the relationship like this is over.

988
00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:25.930
Yeah. You know, what are you coming back to ut and get me a gift now?

989
00:57:25.931 --> 00:57:28.900
Where am I? I'm like the battered woman now and I'm like, oh wait,

990
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:33.730
she's usually not like that. She shuts a good for to go fuck yourself over.

991
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:39.190
Um, all right, so what I do a five. Okay. Did I do the wrong thing? And it can,

992
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:43.360
how can I keep things from being fucked up from here on out? Okay.

993
00:57:43.361 --> 00:57:44.500
This is what the first thing you do.

994
00:57:44.501 --> 00:57:49.060
I would not drink whiskey around volatile family members. Uh,

995
00:57:49.061 --> 00:57:51.250
I wouldn't do that. I would try to be the sober person.

996
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.130
I think if you were more sober, I probably wouldn't have done that.

997
00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:55.840
Or at the very least she would have saw the punch coming.

998
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.420
Sounded like she threw a straight right. You know,

999
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:59.860
should've made a little slip that, you know,

1000
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:02.543
<v 2>yes,</v>

1001
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:06.790
<v 0>I'm fucking with you. Sorry that that happened. And uh, you know, I dunno,</v>

1002
00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.300
you guys had kind of evened out. She hit you twice. You only hit her once.

1003
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:14.290
And maybe that's fair. Who the fuck knows? I don't fucking know, but I, I don't,

1004
00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.960
I don't buy into that whole chivalry thing that, you know,

1005
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.290
that once somebody starts swinging on you, it's, they've, they've,

1006
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:23.350
they've fucking, you know,

1007
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.660
they've waived all rights of chivalry and, uh,

1008
00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:33.340
and rules between the sexist in my own opinion, but like, it's the fat. It's,

1009
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:38.350
but for the guy though is his, if he reacts immediately, I give you a pass.

1010
00:58:38.351 --> 00:58:41.770
But the fact that you thought about it, it, she'll still come back to,

1011
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:46.360
even though she deserves it, she still a lady and then you don't, I mean,

1012
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:49.540
personally, I could, I could, uh, well I guess she never say never,

1013
00:58:49.541 --> 00:58:52.840
but I've never run into that. And I've had a lot of women hit me. I mean,

1014
00:58:52.841 --> 00:58:55.960
I'm an asshole. I've had a lot of women hit me. Uh,

1015
00:58:55.961 --> 00:58:58.690
I've had women throw shit at me. Um,

1016
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:04.230
but it's never a, it's never gotten to that point where I, I w I,

1017
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.200
I couldn't do that. She's a,

1018
00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:09.070
it's like hitting a fucking kid or a dog or some shit, you know? I couldn't,

1019
00:59:09.071 --> 00:59:13.000
I couldn't do it like an animal. The defenseless, you know what I mean?

1020
00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:16.870
Unless it's like Rhonda Rousey, who's fighting this fucking weekend?

1021
00:59:16.871 --> 00:59:21.040
Everybody you know that fuck. If you, if your, there's a question for you.

1022
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:26.230
You're dating someone who is not just takes karate or fucking MMA shit is

1023
00:59:27.591 --> 00:59:31.820
actually in the UFC. Then what does that become?

1024
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.193
You know what I mean?

1025
00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.350
If she fucking hits you and say, you serve five that

1026
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:45.503
<v 2>okay.</v>

1027
00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.950
<v 0>Oh God.</v>

1028
00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:52.370
There's not a woman who's even remotely thought about getting into the UFC.

1029
00:59:52.591 --> 00:59:53.790
That couldn't kick the shit out of me.

1030
00:59:53.791 --> 00:59:57.540
I can't imagine fighting one that was actually in the UFC and be fucking

1031
00:59:57.541 --> 01:00:01.020
hilarious. Then later they're apologizing is I have a stake over my eye.

1032
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:06.570
I'll make it up to your freckles. All right.

1033
01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:08.490
Ex-Girlfriend is a cunt.

1034
01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:12.060
Jesus fucking James Blunt here.

1035
01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:15.510
Ex-Girlfriend is a cunt. Hey Bill.

1036
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:18.930
I am a lady and a huge fan of yours.

1037
01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:21.710
I love Nia as well. Uh,

1038
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.930
get her on the case if possible, please.

1039
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.690
Oh well she's still downstairs sleeping. Okay.

1040
01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:31.470
I dig other ladies and recently I broke up.

1041
01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.620
I broke a very important relationship in my life.

1042
01:00:34.621 --> 01:00:39.150
I was dating this girl on and off for many years and felt totally in love with

1043
01:00:39.151 --> 01:00:41.100
her. Um,

1044
01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.640
all the while she claimed she loved me more than anything. Uh,

1045
01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.680
which she still does claim by the way, by the way, and says,

1046
01:00:49.681 --> 01:00:53.850
I am the only person she has ever wanted to spend your life with. However,

1047
01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:57.450
she's one of these people who just needs her freedom and can't function in a

1048
01:00:57.451 --> 01:01:01.230
fucking relationship. Well, then you got to let her go. Uh, before we broke up,

1049
01:01:01.231 --> 01:01:03.870
we had this huge fucking argument about commitment and I said,

1050
01:01:03.871 --> 01:01:06.420
I didn't see the point in continuing this relationship.

1051
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.000
She reflected on it and said, I was absolutely right.

1052
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.570
That I don't deserve to dedicate my entire life to someone as complicated as

1053
01:01:12.571 --> 01:01:15.510
her. Well, yeah, I agree with her and walk. I agreed.

1054
01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:20.690
She then said she tried but can't reciprocate my feelings in the same intensity.

1055
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:22.833
All right.

1056
01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:27.920
That was eight years before this broad was jerking me around saying I'm the love

1057
01:01:28.411 --> 01:01:32.310
of her life, and she wanted to marry me and live with me forever.

1058
01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:36.330
All these years. Every time I confronted her about her troublesome behavior,

1059
01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:40.380
it was never cheating. At least a, she didn't tell me, hey,

1060
01:01:40.381 --> 01:01:42.630
I don't think our feelings match. This may not work.

1061
01:01:42.631 --> 01:01:46.110
She led me to believe she loved me enough. Uh,

1062
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.210
she's still saying I'm the love of her life and whatnot,

1063
01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.340
but feels horrible for all the pain she's caused me and the time I wasted.

1064
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.780
I said, being in love,

1065
01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:58.170
the love of her life wasn't enough to make her act like a good girlfriend.

1066
01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.770
And then I wanted to move on with my life. So we parted ways. Good for you.

1067
01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.670
Strong move. I like that move. Now I'm not sure what to do, where to start.

1068
01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:10.500
My identity is so intertwined with this intertwined with this person and how we

1069
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.660
used to be in the beginning. I want to start over,

1070
01:02:12.661 --> 01:02:15.000
but I don't know who I am outside of this relationship.

1071
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.390
I like to hear your thoughts about it because I think you guys give some good

1072
01:02:18.391 --> 01:02:22.800
advice. All right. I would say this, what you're feeling is totally normal.

1073
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.520
And what a lot of people do is when they feel those feelings of like,

1074
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.840
well now what do I do? Who am I? How do I pick up the fucking pieces?

1075
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:35.370
There is that initial feeling,

1076
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:40.650
which does not feel good and your natural reaction is to go for the quickest

1077
01:02:40.651 --> 01:02:43.470
fix, which is to go back into that fucking horrible relationship,

1078
01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:47.730
which you have to do as the song goes. You've got to walk through the fire here.

1079
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.880
I would write down, you know, I started journaling something so you can kind of,

1080
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:54.541
you know,

1081
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:59.490
it's something to just be feeling your thoughts versus writing them down and

1082
01:02:59.491 --> 01:03:02.250
then you can see them and then you can kind of get outside of yourself,

1083
01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:05.520
which is what you need right now. And you know, friends help with this too.

1084
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:10.560
We have to be like, look, you can't go back to this person. You know that.

1085
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.660
Okay. But right now is like,

1086
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:17.700
the worst part is now you're going to be lonely in a heartbroken by yourself and

1087
01:03:17.701 --> 01:03:20.300
this person that usually comfort you is the cause of it's,

1088
01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.520
you can't go to them for comfort cause it's gonna fuck you all up and get you

1089
01:03:23.521 --> 01:03:28.420
back to square one. So, um, um,

1090
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.550
you're asking me what you should do is I think that you should

1091
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.470
acknowledge the fact that you're going to, you have to go through some pain.

1092
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:42.670
You're going to go through some pain over the next like, you know,

1093
01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:44.680
certainly three months.

1094
01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:50.820
But what you do during that time is you gradually build a new life without this

1095
01:03:51.401 --> 01:03:52.234
person.

1096
01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:57.010
So the first month you're going to be in the fetal position crying and just,

1097
01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:00.300
you know, going through the next tool,

1098
01:04:00.301 --> 01:04:03.310
the psycho to detox of this person.

1099
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:08.430
But what I would try to do is introduce a new fun activity.

1100
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.010
You know, that you could do like, I don't know, whatever the fuck is into,

1101
01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.160
even if it's like a fucking TV show that you meant to binge watch.

1102
01:04:19.161 --> 01:04:23.380
Something as simple as that. That is something that you do.

1103
01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:26.560
And in that it's yours that you don't do with this other person.

1104
01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:30.970
And then you just introduce something else little when you ready for something

1105
01:04:30.971 --> 01:04:34.510
else. Maybe you always want to learn how to ride a horse. Go fucking do that.

1106
01:04:34.511 --> 01:04:37.420
God knows you got the Goddamn time, something fun,

1107
01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.340
but there's something that you've always wanted to do,

1108
01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:43.270
but she didn't have the time with work and being involved in a relationship.

1109
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:47.920
Go do that fucking thing. Take a trip, do something.

1110
01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:50.710
And all the time when you're feeling sad,

1111
01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:53.950
give into the sadness and cry some of that fucking pain out.

1112
01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.800
I'm a big believer in crying. Um,

1113
01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.810
it's something that guys are not allowed to do.

1114
01:04:58.811 --> 01:05:01.840
It's why women get passionate and guys carry shit.

1115
01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.330
Women still can look back and see the sadness,

1116
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.110
but they're done feeling fucked up over cause they didn't hold onto the emotion.

1117
01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.640
They let the emotion out. Guys hold the fucking thing and like,

1118
01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:14.650
I believe that guys should, you know,

1119
01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:16.960
cause it's too embarrassing for people to see us cry.

1120
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.890
They should in every house, the way you have a bathroom, a bedroom, a kitchen,

1121
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:24.970
there should be a crying room for the man. He goes into,

1122
01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:28.420
closes a door, it's soundproof. And he's allowed to go in there,

1123
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.690
in whale out all of his fucking pain, the way women are,

1124
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.040
and everyone flocks to them and hugs them and gives them comfort. And uh,

1125
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.300
you know, I'm a big believer in it now than after,

1126
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:40.090
after half a century of holding it in.

1127
01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:41.800
I believe that you should fucking let it out.

1128
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.400
You should go Chris Bosch if you're a guy. Um,

1129
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.460
so that's what I would say to you and just acknowledge the fact that this is

1130
01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:51.280
going to hurt. I'm proud of you that you got out of this relationship, you know,

1131
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:54.100
eight years of this person jerking you around and you know what you did.

1132
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:57.700
You got out of something toxic and you opened the door for the right person to

1133
01:05:57.701 --> 01:05:58.630
come into your life.

1134
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.200
You know some that's gonna respect you and make you laugh and you'll have a

1135
01:06:02.201 --> 01:06:04.180
great time, you know, and one day you're gonna look back on,

1136
01:06:04.181 --> 01:06:06.390
what the fuck did I waste eight years with that person.

1137
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:09.430
You know why you did so you could realize how great the person that's going to

1138
01:06:09.431 --> 01:06:12.340
come into life is going to be. And there you go. There's your pep talk.

1139
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:16.300
All right, you can do it. I believe in you. All right, here we go.

1140
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.950
Let's read the last two fucking ads here and then I got to get the folk atty.

1141
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:25.780
Alright. Um, oh, blue apron. Everybody. Hey is something you could do.

1142
01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:27.070
By the way, the person who just,

1143
01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.600
I just read because one of the things you might want you might do is, uh,

1144
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:34.810
eat a bunch of food and put on fucking weight. You don't want to do that.

1145
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.153
You know,

1146
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:40.120
that's like another being another bad fucking thing that this person created.

1147
01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:40.841
They broke your heart.

1148
01:06:40.841 --> 01:06:43.630
Now they're going to fucking put more stress on your heart because you're going

1149
01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:44.650
to eat bad food. You know,

1150
01:06:44.651 --> 01:06:48.760
it'd be great to think is he ate healthy meals and you know what? You're crying.

1151
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:49.840
You're in the fetal position.

1152
01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.170
Would it be great if somebody just brought the food to you? Blue Apron.

1153
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.200
This is like the fucking that this is the best move you can make.

1154
01:06:56.201 --> 01:06:58.990
If you go through a breakup right here, blue apron,

1155
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:02.020
they're going to bring your healthy food. It's easy to fucking cook.

1156
01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:06.200
You're going to stay in shape, right as you get over that fucking last asshole.

1157
01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:10.180
A client that was in your fucking life and a, you gonna be in good shape.

1158
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:13.000
Does baby attracting somebody else in your life? Who knows,

1159
01:07:13.001 --> 01:07:16.810
but do not just jump into something. I forgot that part of the advice.

1160
01:07:16.811 --> 01:07:18.640
Do not jump into another fucking relationship.

1161
01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.320
