00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.670
I'm currently deployed to Iraq as an east six in the army.

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.250
I've listened to your podcast and really enjoy your stuff,

3
00:00:06.251 --> 00:00:07.900
especially different discipline equals real.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.510
I know as a sergeant and as a leader,
your focus isn't to be liked.
However,

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.010
your soldiers should respect you.
Respect both you and your rank.

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.880
My question is,
how do you tell your soldiers to do the small stuff?

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.490
Tedious stuff like taking out the trash and still be like,

8
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.420
<v 1>all right,
well,
first of all,
if we want to get respect from people,</v>

9
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:35.390
we have to give them respect.
For sure.
Think about this.

10
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.050
Think if you took out the trash for some time.
You don't think.
If you're the,

11
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.680
you're the boss,

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.440
but you see that the trash is getting overfilled and you just grab it and take

13
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:46.910
it out.
There's think about what that does.
Think about what that does.

14
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:47.840
The attitude of the guys.

15
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.980
If you took out the trash you,

16
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.820
you maybe in your mind you think you'd be losing respect,

17
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.470
but you actually wouldn't be at all.
In fact,
everyone looks at you and goes,
oh,

18
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:02.780
he's a good guy.
He's taken out the trash,

19
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:04.970
it was little full that he's taken care of it.

20
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.540
So maybe if you're insecure you'd think you'd lose respect.

21
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:13.460
But I think if you're secure in your ability to lead and if you know that doing

22
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.520
some tedious stuff is gonna make you guys appreciate you,

23
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.500
then to me that means it's kind of worth it.
Yeah.
Right.
Um,

24
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.710
another example,
you know we talked about taking all the trash,

25
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:27.860
but like what if the platoon space has to be cleaned

26
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.430
and on Friday you,
you just say,
hey guys,
you guys can go ahead and roll out.

27
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.140
I got this
right.
There's a chance.
They're like,
hey boss,

28
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:43.540
we're not leaving.
We know.
We'll help you there.

29
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.610
There's of course there's a chance you'd be like,
oh,
that's awesome.
Thanks boss.

30
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.880
And they bail
overtime.
That might be [inaudible].

31
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.330
If they don't respect you at all,

32
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.320
they might bail now in order to regain the respect,

33
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.900
the you make them stay in Boston around more.

34
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:01.510
Does that increase the respect for you?
You see,

35
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.180
you see how interesting it is is that if you go,
hey guys,

36
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.760
that's cool,
I'll do it.

37
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.400
And you're working hard and you still got to maintain the discipline and you

38
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.030
don't take any slack.
But at the,
it's the same balance,

39
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:20.810
the balance we talk about all the time.
So

40
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.140
the more that you treat them with respect,

41
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:32.060
the more they're gonna respect you and they're going to know that you're not,

42
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.620
you know,
too high and mighty,
they're going to know that you're down to earth.

43
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.640
When I was a platoon commander,
tasking to commander,
I picked up brass,

44
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.750
I cleaned the ranges with the boys.
That's just the way I operated.

45
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.890
And I would recommend that kind of attitude.
It didn't make people think,
oh,

46
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.370
Jockos doesn't have anything better to do.
They actually knew I had stuff to do,

47
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.510
but what I've got to do,
pick up brass with the boys,

48
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.610
build the relationships,
set the example.
Yeah.
They're gonna respect you for it.

49
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.200
<v 0>Yeah,
makes sense.
At the end of the day,
do you have something better to do?
Right.</v>

50
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.190
Because the whole,
in the big picture,
it's like how you say like that's a leader.

51
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.190
<v 1>It's like sometimes you literally have something then no,
no.
Like,</v>

52
00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:17.640
sometimes you literally like,
Hey,
the boys are picking a brass and guess what?

53
00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:20.820
You got to meeting with the commanding officer.
You gotta go,
do you,
you know,

54
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.650
sometimes we,
you actually do.

55
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.060
And what's cool is tactically is,

56
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:30.210
and you heard us saying this at the uh,
FTX and we're up in Utah.

57
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.310
If you see the leader doing something menial,
what you should do as a,

58
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.450
as a followers step up and say,
hey echo,
I got this.
You can go and lead.

59
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.500
That's what,
that's what you want.
That's what I want to do for my leader.

60
00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:47.430
I want to take things off my leader's plate as much as possible.
Now

61
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.670
the more you try and you just have to build those relationships,

62
00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:55.860
the way you build those,
if you don't have anything better to do,

63
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.700
then you get down there and you help you help clean up the range,

64
00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:01.470
you help pick up the brass.
That's the way it is.

65
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.760
I actually did notice that about you and life to where,

66
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.290
<v 0>you know,
like I'll have my camera equipment and you know,</v>

67
00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:12.110
lights or whatever and it's not a bunch of stuff.
But you know,

68
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.490
you're always like,
oh,
you'll like grab something and you don't like your camera.

69
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.440
Yeah,
don't touch,
don't touch,
don't touch.

70
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.650
But [inaudible] when it's just me and you,

71
00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:24.020
it's kind of like cool cause we're just kind of friends or whatever.

72
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.000
There's no perceived or no like hierarchy kind of thing.

73
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.090
Like you're,
you know,
but let's say like at the muster,
whatever,

74
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:36.080
it's obviously like you guys have a,
a specific job.
I have a specific job,

75
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:36.950
you know,
kind of thing.

76
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.230
And meanwhile you n and life will like if I'm around,

77
00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:45.110
I'm carrying something,
you'll always like grab something or,
or say,
hey you need,

78
00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:49.010
you know that though at the Utah thing it's like,
Oh are you good?
I'm like,
Bro,

79
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:52.100
you're the instructor here kind of thing.
That's what I'm thinking in my head.

80
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.530
And um,
and yeah,
you guys always offered it like help.
Interesting.

81
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.250
I'm like almost offended.
Like Bro,
like do I look like I need help?

82
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.750
Cause you shouldn't really be asking me

83
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.330
<v 1>very capable individual.
Yeah.
And</v>

84
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.240
this small tedious stuff.

85
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.080
And the other thing is you explained to him why it's important,
right.

86
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.240
Not to answer.
We give all the time.
Why is it important?

87
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:20.670
Why is it important that the platoon huts clean?
Well,

88
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.850
because I want you guys to have time off over the weekends and not be stuck here

89
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.451
cleaning.

90
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:27.270
Cause the commanding officer came in and saw that this place looked like a hell

91
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:29.640
hole.
Okay,
well that makes sense to us.

92
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.900
We understand why you want us to clean now you want us to clean so that we can

93
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.290
have time off.
You want us to clean?
So you want us to train hard?

94
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.250
Do you want us to do this?
Cause?

95
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.950
Cause we want to be ready for combat cause I want you guys to be able to come

96
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:41.880
home to your families.

97
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.750
Make sure they understand why they're doing what they're doing.

98
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.980
And if there's no reason why to,
if the reason let mean even cleaning,

99
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:52.230
even taken out the trash,
there's a reason for that,
right?

100
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.470
There's an actual reason for that.
We can't just have junk everywhere.

101
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.570
So explain why participate when you can build the relationships with your

102
00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:05.940
troops,
you'll be good.
