00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.460
Welcome back.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.180
So where I left off
we said that I was

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.690
going to throw a ball.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.700
And I threw it at an angle of
45 degrees to the ground.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.460
Let me draw the ground
in green as

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.070
hopefully the ground is.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.620
That looks more like green
water, but I think you get

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.500
what I'm saying.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.150
So I throw a ball at a 45 degree
angle and I throw it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.940
at-- what did I say?

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.930
I think it was 10 meters
per second.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.710
I want to figure out how far
this ball will go or how high

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.910
does-- not how high.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.220
Well, I could figure
that out as well.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.480
Or how long does the ball
stay in the air.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.820
And what we said is we can
break this vector.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.610
This vector has magnitude 10
in the 45 degree direction.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.030
We can break into its vertical
and horizontal components.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.600
So it's horizontal components,
this horizontal component

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330
would be this vector.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.900
And its vertical component
would be this vector.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.660
Whoops.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.440
The other way around.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.230
Vertical and horizontal are
always the two things that I

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.340
found most confusing.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.330
Its vertical component would
be this vector and its

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.420
horizontal component would
be this vector.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.410
Sorry for confusing it.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.820
And so we could treat it just
like the sides of a right

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.650
triangle because as we know, the
vertical is perpendicular

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.890
to the horizontal.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.550
And what I find very fascinating
by that is we're

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.370
dealing with the velocities and
we can still treat them

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.150
like they're the sides
of a right triangle.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.750
And that's why vectors in
general are so useful.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.060
And as we do more problems,
hopefully you

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.700
get more of an intuition.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.090
And we said from the previous
problem that-- well, not the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.800
previous problem, the previous
presentation-- the length of

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.700
this side, if you just use your
basic trigonometry would

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.360
be-- the vertical component
of my velocity, so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.630
that's v sub v.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.370
So v sub vertical, which is an
unconventional way to write

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.420
it-- would be 10 sine
of 45 degrees.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.310
And that equals what?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.600
What's sine of 45 degrees?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.730
That's square root
of 2 over 2.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.360
So it's 10 times square root
of 2 over 2, which equals 5

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.840
square root of 2.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.920
And the horizontal component
of my velocity is

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.900
10 cosine 45 degrees.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.520
To figure out this and this
we just used soh cah toa.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.670
We just said that the vertical
velocity over the hypotenuse

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.690
is equal to sine
of 45 degrees.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.920
And then we just rearranged
it to get this.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.900
And we said that the horizontal
velocity over the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.970
hypotenuse is equal to the
cosine of 45 degrees and then

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.310
we solved it to get this.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.250
We solved for the horizontal
velocity.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.620
And this also equals
5 square root of 2.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.720
So what can we do now?

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.750
This is what I find to be the
really interesting part.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.520
If we wanted to figure
out how long does the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.820
ball stay in the air?

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.160
The only thing that's keeping
the ball from staying in the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.400
air forever is gravity.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.160
Gravity is what's bringing the
ball back down to the ground.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.690
And gravity only works in
the vertical direction.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.430
Gravity only works-- I don't
like this color.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.700
Gravity only works in the
vertical direction, always

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.340
pulling directionally down at 10
meters per second squared.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.930
So what we can do is we can
break this problem up into two

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.870
problems.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.760
We can say well this ball is
going to stay up in the air

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.060
just as long as a ball that was
thrown straight up with

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.310
the same vertical velocity.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.940
This ball is going to stay up in
the air for the same amount

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.065
of time as something thrown
straight up at 5 square root

00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:51.050
of 2 meters per second.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.140
And I want you to think
about that.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.263
Because that's actually-- at
least, when I first learned

00:03:54.263 --> 00:03:55.310
it, it wasn't intuitive.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.220
And the more you think
about it, it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.740
kind of becomes intuitive.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.590
And then you might want
to experiment with it.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.330
A ball that's thrown at an
angle will stay up-- well

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.140
let's say a ball that's thrown
at an angle that gets as high

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.220
as like-- let's say it gets
as high as 500 meters.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.530
Let's say I throw a ball
and this is the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.360
motion of the ball.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.829
So let's say this is the
path of the ball.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.899
The ball looks like this.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.980
And let's say the highest point
that the ball traveled,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.120
let's say this is 500 meters.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.850
That would be a very--
probably more like a

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.770
cannonball or something.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.620
I can't throw a ball
500 meters high.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.950
So this is the ball that's
actually thrown at an angle.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.750
That travels some distance
along the ground.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.180
What I'm saying is that this
ball is going to stay in the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.740
ground-- is going to stay in the
air the exact same amount

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.350
of time as a ball
that does this.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.990
And this is 500 meters.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.240
That's interesting.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.200
The difference between these two
balls-- and I'm probably,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.970
I should probably use
different colors.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.200
The difference between this
ball, which is thrown at a

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.720
steeper angle, then this ball,
which is thrown at kind of a--

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.920
it looks almost like a 45 degree
angle, is that this

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.530
ball's horizontal velocity,
its velocity in this

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.230
direction was lower.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.110
This ball had a much better
horizontal velocity.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.820
But the time that they stay in
the air-- and once again,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.020
we're assuming nothing about
air resistance or anything.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.370
The time they stay in the
air is exactly the same.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.120
That's really interesting.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.980
Another way to think about it
is, if I'm on a cliff and I

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.920
just drop a ball and it just
goes straight down on a 500

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.290
meter cliff, that ball is going
to take the same amount

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.380
of time to hit the ground.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.230
It's going to take the same
amount of time to hit the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.710
ground as if another ball that
was moving-- let's say it was

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.070
moving, it only had
horizontal motion.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.000
So the second ball
goes like this.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.360
So it moves along
the horizontal

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.450
axis the whole times.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.630
So it's moving to the
right the whole

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.470
time while it's falling.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.410
But both of these balls--
let me draw the

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.700
second ball in magenta.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.680
This second magenta ball is
going to take the same amount

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.100
of time to hit the ground.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.550
And that's because its vertical
velocity at any given

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.570
time, its velocity in the
downward direction is going to

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.120
be the exact same.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.830
And that's because gravity
is only pulling in

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.040
the downward direction.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.280
I want you think about that a
lot because that's kind of a

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.200
core intuition of vectors and
physics, is that you can break

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.240
out the velocity into horizontal
and vertical

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.990
components.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.770
And that once you do, kind of
the things that are affecting

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.730
it in the vertical component
are identical regardless of

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.520
what's happening in
the horizontal.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.740
So that might have
been helpful.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.380
It might have confused
you further.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.230
But let's just continue
on with the problem.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.700
So let me put this a little
bit of the side.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.590
I took too much space.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.950
So my vertical velocity is going
to be 5 square root of 2

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.990
meters per second up.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.200
And we're going to stay with the
convention positive is up

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.200
and negative is down, just like
in the coordinate axis.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.570
So how long is it going
to stay in the air?

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.480
If I threw a ball straight up
at 5 square root of 2 meters

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.230
per second, how long is it
going to stay in the air?

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.630
Well, the way I think about it,
the easiest way to think

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.990
about it is the same amount of
time it takes to go up is the

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.560
same amount of time it's going
to take it to go down.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.310
We learned that in a couple
of videos before.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.600
So how long is it going
to take it to go up?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.220
Well to go up, it's going to
start at this speed, 5

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.400
square root of 2.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.740
And then at the top, when it's
at the top, it's going to be

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.710
going-- it's going
to have 0 speed.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.560
So it's going to decelerate from
5 square root of 2 to 0

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.720
in some amount of time.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.740
And here we could just use a
very simple equation: change

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.950
in velocity.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.960
Change is velocity is equal to
acceleration times time.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.320
Well what's the change
in velocity?

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:03.530
It's the final velocity, which
is 0, minus my initial

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.440
velocity, minus 5 square root
of 2 is equal to the

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.250
acceleration.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.310
That's 10 meters per
second squared.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.520
And forgive me for not putting
the units in right now because

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.830
I'm running out of space.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.060
Times time.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.840
So if we solve for t, we get--
the negatives cancel out.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.220
The 0 doesn't matter.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:27.520
So we get t is equal to 10 over
5 square root of 2, which

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.650
equals 2 over the square
root of 2 seconds.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.860
t equals 2 over the square
root of 2 seconds.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.970
And of course, if we wanted to
rationalize this, we could

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.929
multiply the top and
the bottom by the

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.169
square root of 2.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.770
Well actually, you don't
have to do that.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.590
What's 2 divided by the
square root of 2?

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.750
Well that's just equal to the
square root of 2, right?

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.270
Because the square root of 2
times the square root of 2 is

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.290
of course, 2.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.570
So it takes a square
root of 2 seconds.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.020
But is that the total time that
the ball's in the air?

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.390
No, that's the amount of time it
takes for the ball to go to

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.780
its highest point.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.530
It takes square root
of 2 seconds to go

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.010
to its highest point.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.080
But then it's going to take the
exact amount of time to

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.500
come back down.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.790
So the total time in the air
is going to be-- and I know

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.960
I'm doing this very messy.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.760
The total time in the air
is 2 square root of 2.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.700
Just two times this.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.990
Because it takes the same amount
of time to go up as it

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.150
does to come down.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.580
And it might be confusing, but
all I did is I figured out the

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.960
vertical component of the
velocity using some basic

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.070
trigonometry.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.030
And I said well, it's going to
decelerate with gravity and

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.330
over that time, when it's going
up, however long it

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.640
takes is going to be going from
that initial-- that 5

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.820
square root of 2 meters
per second to 0.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.100
So how long does it take to
decelerate from 5 square root

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.880
of 2 to 0 given that I'm
decelerating with gravity?

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.165
Given that I'm decelerating at
10 meters per second squared.

00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:54.020
And it takes us 2 square
root of 2 seconds.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.480
I will continue this
in the next video.
