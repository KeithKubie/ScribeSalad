00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.560
 
oh yeah absolutely I understand the

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570
oh yeah absolutely I understand the
 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.689
oh yeah absolutely I understand the
universe as a whole I know it's funny

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:12.699
universe as a whole I know it's funny
 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.480
universe as a whole I know it's funny
there some people will say to me think

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490
there some people will say to me think
 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.700
there some people will say to me think
theory what a strange concept and then I

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710
theory what a strange concept and then I
 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.790
theory what a strange concept and then I
sometimes will say well of course thing

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800
sometimes will say well of course thing
 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.660
sometimes will say well of course thing
theory is a kind of a joke and people

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670
theory is a kind of a joke and people
 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.279
theory is a kind of a joke and people
will say oh yes because it's a play on

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289
will say oh yes because it's a play on
 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.839
will say oh yes because it's a play on
string theory and that's actually not

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849
string theory and that's actually not
 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.230
string theory and that's actually not
the joke but I mean but it's but it's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240
the joke but I mean but it's but it's
 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.490
the joke but I mean but it's but it's
interesting that that a bunch of people

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500
interesting that that a bunch of people
 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.119
interesting that that a bunch of people
do and I'm sure that with enough effort

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129
do and I'm sure that with enough effort
 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.030
do and I'm sure that with enough effort
I could actually make that joke really

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040
I could actually make that joke really
 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.579
I could actually make that joke really
work for for a few people and for myself

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589
work for for a few people and for myself
 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.259
work for for a few people and for myself
the joke as I understand it is much more

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269
the joke as I understand it is much more
 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.320
the joke as I understand it is much more
oh surely things are precisely not what

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330
oh surely things are precisely not what
 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.439
oh surely things are precisely not what
is theory you know like oh gee you know

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449
is theory you know like oh gee you know
 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.990
is theory you know like oh gee you know
one races to the concrete in order to

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000
one races to the concrete in order to
 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.450
one races to the concrete in order to
avoid theory so now you know now we have

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460
avoid theory so now you know now we have
 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.850
avoid theory so now you know now we have
to actually have thing theory along with

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860
to actually have thing theory along with
 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.859
to actually have thing theory along with
all these other theories that for me is

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:01.869
all these other theories that for me is
 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.920
all these other theories that for me is
more of the joke
