00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:12.076
In 1984, an enterprising Australian doctor
named Barry Marshall

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:14.186
decided to take a risk.

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:19.016
Too many of his patients were complaining
of severe abdominal pain

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:20.756
due to stomach ulcers,

00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:24.957
which are sores in the lining
of the upper intestinal tract.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:28.708
At the time, few effective treatments
for ulcers existed,

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:33.757
and many sufferers required
hospitalization or even surgery.

00:00:33.757 --> 00:00:35.478
Desperate for answers,

00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:39.506
Dr. Marshall swallowed a cloudy
broth of bacteria

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:43.418
collected from the stomach
of one of his patients.

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:47.287
Soon, Dr. Marshall was experiencing
the same abdominal pain,

00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:48.098
bloating,

00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:49.540
and vomiting.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.468
Ten days later, a camera called 
an endoscope

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:55.979
peered inside his insides.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.278
Marshall's stomach was teeming
with the same bacteria as his patient.

00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:06.028
He'd also developed gastritis,
or severe inflammation of the stomach,

00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:10.388
the hallmark precursor of ulcers.

00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:12.230
Dr. Marshall's idea challenged

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.051
a misconception 
that still persists to this day:

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.650
that ulcers are caused by stress,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.649
food,

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.180
or too much stomach acid.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.007
Marshall thought the culprit
was bacterial infections.

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.699
Initially, his idea was considered crazy

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:31.879
by the brightest medical 
minds on the planet.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:37.590
But in 2005, he and Dr. Robin Warren
received the ultimate validation

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.610
when they were awarded the Nobel
Prize for medicine.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.601
Our stomachs are J-shaped organs
with surprisingly intricate ecosystems

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.972
awash in hormones and chemicals.

00:01:50.972 --> 00:01:54.570
The stomach is under constant attack
by digestive enzymes,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.421
bile,

00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:56.412
proteins,

00:01:56.412 --> 00:01:57.381
microbes,

00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:00.331
and the stomach's own acid.

00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:02.791
In response, it produces bicarbonate,

00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:03.651
mucus,

00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:07.130
and phospholipids called prostaglandins

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.112
to maintain the integrity
of its own lining.

00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:12.962
This delicate balance is constantly
regulated

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:16.712
and referred to as mucosal defense.

00:02:16.712 --> 00:02:23.922
Since the mid-1800s, doctors thought
stress alone caused most stomach ulcers.

00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:26.982
Patients were given antidepressants
or tranquilizers

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:30.062
and told to visit health spas.

00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:34.923
This belief eventually shifted
to the related notion of spicy foods

00:02:34.923 --> 00:02:37.861
and stress as culprits.

00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:42.255
Yet no convincing study has ever
demonstrated that emotional upset,

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:43.866
psychological distress,

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:45.616
or spicy food

00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:50.448
directly causes ulcer disease.

00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:55.384
By the mid-20th century, it was widely
accepted that excess hydrochloric acid

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:58.404
prompted the stomach to eat itself.

00:02:58.404 --> 00:03:03.821
Fervent proponents of this idea
were referred to as the acid mafia.

00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:07.683
The biggest hole in this theory
was that antiacids only provide

00:03:07.683 --> 00:03:10.056
temporary relief.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:12.194
We now know that some rare ulcers

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:16.125
are indeed caused 
by too much hydrochloric acid.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:20.194
But they make up less than 1%
of all cases.

00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:24.486
Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren pinpointed
a spiral-shaped bacteria

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:30.619
called Helicobacter pylori,
or H. pylori, as the real offender.

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:35.189
H. pylori is one of humanity's oldest
and most frequent companions,

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.816
having joined us at least 50,000
years ago,

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:41.985
and now found in 50% of people.

00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:44.365
Previously, we thought the stomach
was sterile

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:48.910
on account of it being such an acidic,
hostile environment.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.286
Yet H. pylori survives the acidic turmoil
of the stomach

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:57.486
with a variety of features that disrupt
mucosal defense in its favor.

00:03:57.486 --> 00:04:01.176
For example, it produces an enzyme
called urease

00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:05.107
that helps protect it from 
the surrounding gastric acid.

00:04:05.107 --> 00:04:08.437
H. pylori can make over 1,500 proteins,

00:04:08.437 --> 00:04:13.447
many of which are dedicated to maximizing
its virulence.

00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:15.917
We still have unanswered questions,

00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:20.786
like why specific people develop ulcers
at particular times.

00:04:20.786 --> 00:04:23.667
However, we do know individual genetics,

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.197
other medical problems,

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:26.957
use of certain medications,

00:04:26.957 --> 00:04:27.937
smoking,

00:04:27.937 --> 00:04:34.059
and the genetic diversity 
of Helicobacter strains all play a role.

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:39.338
In particular, certain pain medications
used to reduce inflammation in joints

00:04:39.338 --> 00:04:42.098
have been discovered to work
with H. pylori

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:45.408
to create more severe stomach ulcers.

00:04:45.408 --> 00:04:51.698
Dr. Marshall ended up being fine after
his famous, albeit dangerous, experiment.

00:04:51.698 --> 00:04:57.429
He ingested a course of antibiotics
similar to the ones taken now for ulcers.

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:01.139
To be treated by simple antibiotics
is a modern triumph

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.989
for a disease that previously 
needed surgery.

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:10.541
Marshall's work also reminded us that
scientific progress is not always smooth.

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.361
But there's value in trusting 
your proverbial,

00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:15.960
and sometimes literal, gut.
