&gt;&gt; Phoebe Connelly: Good
afternoon, I'm Phoebe Connelly,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.060
the deputy director of video
at the Washington Post.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.750
We are a charter sponsor of
the National Book Festival.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.770
I'd like to start by
thanking the co-chairman

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.090
of the festival David Rubenstein
and the other generous sponsors

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.030
who have made this
event possible.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.370
If you'd like to become
a financial supporter,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.960
please note the information
to how to do

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960
that is part of your program.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.600
We'll also have time after the
presentation for your questions,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.700
and I've been asked to remind
you that if you do come

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.870
to the microphone, you will
be included in video tape

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.500
of the event, which may be
broadcast at a later date.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.310
So, I am delighted to
introduce our guest today,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.610
Jessica Kensky and
Patrick Downes.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.740
They were married in 2012

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.730
and were injured during the
Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.260
Their dog, Rescue,
is also on stage.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.400
Rescue joined their family
several months later.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.790
They're going to speak about
their book "Rescue and Jessica:

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.220
A Life-Changing Friendship".

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.830
About their first
picture book they say,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.540
"We hope this story inspires you
to celebrate others in the way

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.350
that we have been celebrated.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.190
Making this book has
been therapeutic,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.130
and we hope you enjoy
the story as much

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.480
as we enjoyed telling it."

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.240
They will also be
signing books at 1:30.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.370
So, without further
ado, our authors.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.690
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes:
Thank you, Phoebe.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.990
Thank you.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.930
Good morning, everyone,
how are you?

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.300
You people in these back
chairs are really missing

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.060
out on something, because there
are plenty of bean bags upfront.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.520
You kids picked the right spot.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.560
We are going to read for you
our book "Rescue and Jessica:

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.430
A Life-Changing Friendship".

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.520
It is very important
for you all to know

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.160
that this is the real Rescue.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.420
That's him from the book
here with you today.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.360
Yeah, he'll accept
a round of applause.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.160
Thank you.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.070
[ Applause ]

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.850
Sometimes, he'll need a little
encouragement throughout this

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.960
presentation, so
applause is welcome,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.090
and this woman right
here is the real Jessica.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.390
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: Hi.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.970
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes: This
is her from the book.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.690
We're going to read
this story for you,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.380
and then at the end we want
to hear your questions,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.050
your comments, if you
have a favorite page.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.360
We're going to show you
some of the amazing things

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.560
that Rescue can do, and we're
going to make this as fun

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.330
as you would like it to be.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.630
Sound good?

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.930
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: Yeah.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.270
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes: All
right, let's start.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.570
That's Rescue as a puppy.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.970
It's pretty cute.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.800
On a special farm

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.050
in the countryside a pup
named Rescue was in training.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.670
He was learning to help people

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.880
who could not see,
but he was worried.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.570
His trainer had just
said, "You aren't meant

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.130
to be a seeing eye dog."

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.720
That was hard for
Rescue to hear.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.100
Helping people who can't
see was the family business.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.740
"The service dog team is better
for you," his trainer said.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.110
Service dogs work beside
their partners instead

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.260
of in front of them.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.580
"Will I be a good service dog?"

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.150
Rescue wondered.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.420
"What will my new
partner be like?

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.820
Will she like me?"

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.360
that is Rescue's real voice.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.090
Rescue didn't want
to let anyone down.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.410
In a hospital in the city a
girl named Jessica was worried.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.410
Both of her legs
were badly hurt.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.570
Everyone hoped the right leg
would heal, but the doctors had

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.450
to remove part of her left leg,
so she could be healthy again.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.630
"You're an amputee now,
Jessica," the doctor explained.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.090
"You have to wear a prosthetic
leg or use a wheelchair

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.650
for the rest of your life."

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.620
That was hard to hear.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.090
She had only ever walked
on her own two legs.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.030
"How will I do things
on my own?"

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.040
Jessica wondered.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.790
"When will I be able
to walk again?

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.870
What will my life be like?"

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.280
Her whole family was
worried about her,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.000
and she didn't want
to let anyone down.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.440
Back in the country,
Rescue was learning how

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.480
to be a service dog.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.520
When he wore his blue cape,
that meant he was in training.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.750
He had to stay by
his partner's side.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.710
He fetched all kinds of things.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.450
He even learned how
to open doors.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.740
"Rescue, you are a
natural," said his trainer.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.250
At the hospital --

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.830
we can welcome people up on
the stage too if they'd like.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.680
At the hospital Jessica was
learning new ways to do things

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.330
that used to come easily.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.240
She used a wheelchair
to get around.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.450
She practiced getting
out of bed differently.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.870
She put on prosthetic
leg, so she could stand.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.860
She was learning
how to walk again,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.360
even though her right
leg was still hurt.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.970
"Jessica, you are becoming
strong," said her doctors.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.030
Rescue was proud of all
he had accomplished,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.350
but he still worried.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.920
He was named in honor
of a brave firefighter.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.150
He had big shoes to fill.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.090
Rescue wanted to help people
just like his namesake.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.890
Jessica knew she had
made a lot of progress,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.690
but she was frustrated and sad

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.360
about the things she
still couldn't do.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.990
She wondered if she would
ever be happy again.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.140
She felt like the changes
were too big, too much.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.020
One day, a visitor
came to see Jessica

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.700
and she brought her
service dog Curry.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.830
Jessica saw how a smart dog
like Curry could help her.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.680
That very day she started
filling out the application

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.980
to ask for a dog of her own.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.290
After a while Jessica gets
some very exciting news.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.160
Rescue got exciting news too.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.930
He also got a new red cape.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.760
Finally, the big day arrived.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.920
"It's nice to meet you,
Rescue," said Jessica.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.020
"She looks nice and so
pretty," Rescue thought.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.670
Rescue stood up very tall.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.140
He hopes she didn't notice
his legs were trembling

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.640
but his wagging tail give away.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.870
Jessica smiled a big smile
and laughed a big laugh

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.360
for the first time
in a long time.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.990
Jessica and Rescue stayed in
the country for a few weeks,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.090
and Rescue showed her all
the things he could do.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.280
"You're amazing,"
Jessica told Rescue.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.310
"You think I'm amazing?"

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.970
Rescue thought, "I
think you're amazing."

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.170
Back in the city Rescue

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.200
and Jessica get used
to working together.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.690
Rescue brought her
the things she needed.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.680
He opened things that
are hard for her reach.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.270
Rescue barked if
Jessica needed someone.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.590
If she tripped, he
would hold steady,

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.450
so she could get back up.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.120
Rescue and Jessica
were always together,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.430
but when she didn't
need his help,

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.610
Rescue really liked to sleep.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.120
That's why we bring the tent.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.790
Jessica knew that even though
Rescue was special he was a

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.030
regular dog too.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.820
She made sure that Rescue
had playtime every day,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:29.310
but Jessica still wasn't
completely healthy.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.690
One day her doctor told her

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.160
that her right leg would
have to be removed too.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.280
She would need to
wear prosthetic legs.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.630
This didn't get any
easier for Jessica to hear.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.650
The night after the doctor
removed her right leg,

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:53.970
Rescue knew just what to do to
help Jessica all on his own.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.660
Rescue and Jessica had
to start all over again.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.190
Slowly, but surely, they learned
all the things they needed

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.920
to do together.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:13.070
They did choirs together, played
together, and they were so good

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.370
at snuggling together.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:23.420
For the first time in a long
time Jessica felt happy,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:29.010
and that made Rescue happy too.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.140
"You changed my life,
Rescue," she said,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.590
"I couldn't have done
this without you."

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:41.220
"I'm so proud of
us," he thought.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.680
"You rescued me,
Rescue," said Jessica,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:53.130
but the truth was they
had rescued each other.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.930
The end.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:03.470
[ Applause ]

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.630
So, who is going to be the brave
first one to ask a question,

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.830
have a comment, tell us
about their favorite page?

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.500
Is the [inaudible]
guitar, does that count?

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.970
What's your question
or comment, Sir?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.910
This gentleman is very astute.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.170
He noticed in the book
that there's a little boy.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.230
Are we able to pull
the pages back up?

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.970
Thank you.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.560
There's that boy
on the left-hand

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.760
of the screen next
to the refrigerator.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.800
Does that boy look
like someone to you?

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.120
It looks like me?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.310
How do you know he
looks like me?

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.060
Because someone told you?

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.660
You had some insight
information.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.960
I thought you were going to say

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.570
because of his boyish
charm or his good looks.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.410
No, just someone told you.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.890
Yeah, that's understandable.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.280
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: So, there's
a lot of hidden Easter eggs

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.260
in our book that our
illustrator Scott Magoon put in.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.420
So, our friend, Scott, who drew
all these amazing pictures,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.590
and one of the many Easter eggs
is that is a little Patrick.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.490
In real life Patrick
and I are married,

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.050
and in real life I
was actually a grownup

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.340
when the story was
happening, but for lots

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.250
of reasons we decided to draw --

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.680
have Jessica shown

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.950
as the technical term,
I'm told, is a tween.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.860
Do you guys know any
tweens, any almost-teenagers?

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.690
So, because I was a teenager,
I couldn't really be married

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.190
in the book, and
Patrick was a little sad.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.950
He felt kind of left out,

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.530
and so we've got a
little Patrick in there.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.610
Another Easter egg is that
in almost every scene,

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.250
what do you guys
notice that Rescue

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.190
or that little Patrick
is carrying?

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.670
That's a great one.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.360
A firetruck.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.660
[Inaudible]

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.960
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes: Sorry.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.850
If we remember from the story,
Rescue is named after a brave--

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.150
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: Firefighter.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.320
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes: Firefighter,
and when we were hurt,

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.030
brave firefighters came
to help us and save us,

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.890
and so this is our
way to say thank you

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.150
to all the special
firefighters in our lives.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.450
Yeah, excellent question.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.870
Thanks for being so
brave to kick it off.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.530
Yes, Ma'am?

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.510
So, she would like to know
what happened to my leg.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.570
Jessica and I were
hurt at the same time.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.870
We had just been married.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.740
We were at the Boston Marathon.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.810
Has anyone ever been to a
marathon or a road race?

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.350
They're really fun, right?

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.470
Lots of energy, lots of
amazing people running very far

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.630
distances, and in Boston it's
the best day of the year.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:55.250
It's Patriot's Day, and
so everyone gets work off,

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.880
no one goes to school,
and your job is

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.610
to either run the marathon
or go and cheer everyone on,

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.940
and that's where we were.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.080
We got hurt at the same time.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.160
She would like to
know how we got hurt.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.230
Unfortunately, two really mean
people decided to hurt us.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.060
They created a bomb,
which made an explosion,

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.320
which hurt our legs and
hurt a lot of other people,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.910
but the most incredible
part from that day isn't

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.720
that a bomb went off, it
was all these amazing people

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.510
who ran toward us to help us,
the brave firefighters, yes.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:38.060
[ Applause ]

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.710
We had these brave firefighters.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.060
We had people with no training.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.210
We had police offers, nurses,
doctors, EMTs ran toward us

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.460
to help us, so that
we could be healthy

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.840
and be with you here today.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.020
It's pretty amazing.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.580
Thanks for asking
those brave questions.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.880
Yes, dear?

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.390
What's your question?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.550
You've read this book before?

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.450
Where did you read it?

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.370
At home? Wow, you must have
some special people at home

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.630
to bring this kind of
book into your house.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.440
What did you think
of it the first time?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.740
It was great?

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.180
And, what did you think
about it this time?

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.480
It was awesome, okay.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.480
This is an important -- I'm
glad you brought this up.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.790
So, anyone who has the book at
home or in their classroom needs

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:39.500
to make sure that whoever reads
the book uses a Rescue voice.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.510
It has to be high-pitched
and loud

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.660
and as goofy as possible, okay?

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.300
So, make sure that
happens next time.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.600
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: I
think we have a question

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.900
of the microphone
over here, Honey.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.340
&gt;&gt; How long did it
take you how to walk?

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.950
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes:
Great question.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.690
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: That's
a really good question.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.540
So, just like in the book,
I had to learn how to walk

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.950
on one prosthetic, and then the
doctor said you need a second

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.210
prosthetic leg, so
I had to learn how

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.460
to walk on two prosthetics.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.550
I would say it took me two
years to be able to walk

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.270
and you know what one of
the hardest things is to do,

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.610
as an amputee, which
is what we're called,

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.990
amputees, standing.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.130
So, to stand on this
stage and pretend

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.550
like I'm casually talking to
you guys today is really hard.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.070
I'm using all kinds of
muscles to stand and balance

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.120
when I can't feel
the ground anymore.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.410
So, I'd say it took me
about two years and Patrick?

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.710
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes:
Like a year and a half.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.670
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: And, the
thing is we have to practice

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.020
and keep trying hard every day.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.370
That's probably the
most important thing.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.910
So, that's a great question.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.210
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes:
Great question.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.510
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: I
think before we run

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.660
out of time we want
to wake Rescue up.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.830
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes: He's
going to need a big noise,

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.510
clapping, maybe some yelling.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.330
We got to wake him up.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.430
Come on, buddy.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.730
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: Come on, bud.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.030
Let's do it.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.330
Come on. So, good boy.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.630
I want to show you a couple

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.900
of the tasks Rescue
can help me with.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.060
I don't call them trick,
because they're special things,

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.050
for the most part, that he
does that help me every day

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.080
or he knows how to do
just in case I need him.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.890
One of the most important
things is that Rescue only barks

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.710
or talks when I tell him to

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.510
or when he's having
free time, his recess.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.160
So, if I had a bad fall at
home and Patrick wasn't home

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.460
and I couldn't get up
and I needed help --

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.240
we live in an apartment
and our neighbors know

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.840
if you hear Rescue bark, will
you please come check on me.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.630
So, if I had a bad fall, I
could say, "Rescue, speak."

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.400
Speak. That's pretty
good, right?

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.170
Pretty loud.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:59.360
If he's barking and barking
and barking and no one's home

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.500
and no one's hearing us, he has
a command to find my cellphone.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.190
So, there's a little
bit of vanilla extract

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.320
on the back of the cellphone.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.120
So, when I tell him
to find my phone,

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.850
he's going to bring
anything that smells

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.850
like vanilla extract, which
your mom or dad or brothers

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:20.150
or sister might bake with it,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.910
and I can't smell it
anymore, but he still can.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.220
So, we're going to
see how he does today,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.800
because there's all kinds of
new smells and sounds in here,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.480
but if I, again, had a bad fall,
it's an emergency, I need help,

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.970
I'd say, "Rescue, fetch phone."

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.150
Go closer, closer, give.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.450
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes:
How about that.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.250
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: Good boy.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.270
[ Applause ]

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.150
There's also just a
general term for fetch.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.870
So, just like in the book,
sometimes I'm in a wheelchair,

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.580
sometimes I'm on crutches,
sometimes I'm like today,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.230
where I have both prosthetics
on, and if I'm out somewhere

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.570
with -- he found the cookies.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:05.870
Rescue [inaudible].

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.480
He's a very good dog,
but he's still a dog.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.400
So, I I drop something, I
could bend down and pick it up,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.580
but I might lose my balance.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.660
He's -- he really
wants a cookie.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.040
He didn't even wait.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.340
Good boy, bud.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.650
So, the general term is
fetch, and that just can be

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.420
for anything on the ground.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.050
He'll start with the
closest things to me

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.610
and then move further away.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.710
So, if I have a really
messy bedroom,

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.050
which sometimes I still do,

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.780
he might bring me a couple
things off the floor before he

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.230
brings me maybe the one
thing that I really want,

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.770
because it's just a
general term for fetch,

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.070
and then we'll show you.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:48.440
This one was actually one of his
hardest ones, believe it or not.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.150
Rescue, come here.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.480
Over here, come here, down.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.460
Ready, down, roll over.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:00.070
He's going to -- that -- very--

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.680
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes:
Gravity defying stunts.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.980
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: Should
we do the [inaudible] one?

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.280
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes: Yeah.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.580
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: And,
these ones are obviously more

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.540
for cuteness, but cuteness
ones are important too.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.690
Rescue, say your prayers.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.250
Good boy, and then,
Rescue, come here.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.660
Give me a hug.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.970
Give me a hug.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.990
Tell me a secret.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.230
Tell me a secret.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.020
He said he's very exciting
you all came out today.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.440
So, those are just a few
of the things that Rescue

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.670
in real life can do, everything
we show you he does in the book.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.970
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes: We have time

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.530
for about one, maybe,
two questions.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.830
Yes?

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.660
You've read the book before too?

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.610
We came to your classroom?

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.280
To Lafayette?

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.120
How did we do that time?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.420
You don't know.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.300
Did you learn anything
new from the story today?

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.350
No, you picked up
everything the first time.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.970
You must be smart.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.270
Yes, dear?

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.760
How long did it take
to train Rescue?

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.060
Great question.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.890
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: So,
Rescue started training,

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.240
just like in the picture,
when he was a tiny puppy.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.080
He was eight weeks old, and it
took him from eight weeks old

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.000
to 18 months old
for him to get his,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.920
what color cape did he
get when he graduated?

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.220
A red cape.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.920
So, it took almost two years,
and at that point Rescue

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.720
and I matched, and I had to go
to his school, because I had

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.520
to learn everything
Rescue already knew.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.120
So, we worked together for
about two weeks at that point.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.220
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes: We are going
to do a signing after this.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.540
If you get our book,
you get your own special

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.740
pawtograph [phonetic].

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.890
This paw is in a stamp,

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.680
and we'll put it right
inside your book,

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.270
so that Rescue signs your book.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.570
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky:
And, it is authentic.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.870
It is his real paw print.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.170
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes: Yes.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.470
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: Well, yeah.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.770
&gt;&gt; Patrick Downes:
We're so honored

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.070
to have been here
with all of you.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.370
Thank you for your
questions and curiosity.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.670
Have a great day.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.970
&gt;&gt; Jessica Kensky: Thank you.
