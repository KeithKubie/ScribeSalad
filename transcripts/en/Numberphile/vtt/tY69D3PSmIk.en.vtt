00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:10.349
Unbeknownst to many, there are two ways of tying your shoelace. You see, the first step is usually like this.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.380
In the second step, you can

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.049
either

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.560
do it like this,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
in which case,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.049
you see, the knot becomes kind of perpendicular to the direction of the lace at the end.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.720
Or, you can do exactly the mirror image of what you have just done.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.059
And it is slightly wrong, actually, when you do this.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.519
But that's a nice way to do it.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.820
When you do that,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.020
in this case, the knot becomes kind of parallel, if you see what I mean, to the shoelace.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.480
What did I do? So, there are two ways of doing it, right? You can do, start from, like, this,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.940
or the other direction. So let's do it in this direction, in some sense.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.540
Now, that determines one of the orientations.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.280
So, one way to do it is to, from my point of view, the right hand, and pull it over, and then do this,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.090
which produces a

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.950
perpendicular knot.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.380
The other way is

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.760
to make the loop with my

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.500
left hand, and then turn it over and through, and then make the knot, in which case

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.819
the knot becomes parallel to the shoelace. That's quite interesting. Now, it turns out that these two things have a difference.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.320
And I'd like to show one of the differences. Which is also a nice trick to know in practice, in daily life. Let's make a knot

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.940
by first doing this, and then, secondly,

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.959
by doing that. If you think of this as a mirror, this is not

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:59.789
symmetric with respect to this mirror. Because you see, this strand goes under this loop, whereas this one goes over this loop.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.790
It's kind of more like a, you know,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.750
rotation symmetry. Whereas if I put them in this configuration, that's symmetric, in the sense that they're both going under.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.970
And you can see that it is symmetric. Now,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.120
Brady: "So which one matches which shoelace?"

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.240
I think this one matches the parallel one, and the rotation one matches the perpendicular one.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.240
I'm not entirely sure about this. You explore. Okay.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.229
So, let's make a tight knot with this. And this is a fairly tight knot. This was the symmetric one.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.120
And, you know, if you wanted to undo this knot, you have to go in, and it's really a bothersome.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.240
But there is actually a nice trick to undo this knot.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.080
Let me show it to you first. I hold it like this. It comes straight off.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.860
What did I do?

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.630
Let's do it in slow motion and in detail. Again, this is the symmetric one. And when I

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.050
close it, it's like that.

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.049
You grab those two or those two. It doesn't matter which one, let's. And when you pull them taut,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.380
you get the straight line.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.649
And it turns out that the knot, the entire knot, can slide across the, along the straight line.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.590
And it just comes off the end

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.790
and undoes itself.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.679
So this kind of symmetric knot is quite fragile.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.640
Or, if you like, if you knotted it like this, as far as it's somewhere in the middle,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.660
it's quite tight, and it's, it's secure. But if you want to untie it,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.070
you don't have to go in and mess around with just undoing that, I need to, a little bit.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.740
You can pull it off, slide it off completely. Whereas, if you made the other

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.060
rotational knot, which one is it? It's I think this one.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.790
Brady: "This is a the asymmetric."

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.209
Asymmetric one. And this one goes over, this one goes under. It's not symmetric with respect to the similar.

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.039
That's a very secure knot. You can't really undo it. The only way to undo it is to actually go in.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.190
So it's useful to know, by the way.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.440
You know, what is this thing? It certainly has a lot of crossings. But again

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.429
we're looking for the minimal number of crossings, so we try to untangle this and open it up as much as we possibly can.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.369
And if you're patient enough and do that
