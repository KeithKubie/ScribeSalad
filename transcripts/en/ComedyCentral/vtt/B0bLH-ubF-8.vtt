00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.236
The fallout continues

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:04.137
from the incendiary comments
made yesterday

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:06.306
by rich-guy-taking-a-dare
way-too-far

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.310
-Donald Trump, when he...
-(laughter)

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:13.046
...seemed...
seemed to imply, uh,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.815
encouraging violence
against Hillary Clinton.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.884
Not... I mean, he didn't
flat-out say it,

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:18.218
but there was an implication.

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:20.454
CNN captured this GIF
of an audience member's

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.955
real-time reaction to Trump's

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.724
thinly-veiled
second amendment threat.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.025
Uh, here it is.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.394
Oh. Oh! Ho, ho, ho, ho.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:30.564
-He sure...
-Ho, ho! -That's rich!

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.367
He sure crossed a line,
Mrs. Claus.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.502
(laughter)

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.504
(applause and cheering)

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.806
-Nice.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.608
Uh, with an unprecedented
possible death threat

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.844
against a presidential nominee
from a rival candidate,

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.013
the Secret Service leapt
into action,

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.216
leaving the White House lawn
exposed.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.817
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.153
...on social media by releasing
the following tweet.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:55.122 line:0%
 
(reading):

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:00.494
(laughter)

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:03.597
That is mildly
passive-aggressive.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.466
Weirdly, they followed this up
with an <i>Arthur</i> meme captioned,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.203
"When there's an assassination
threat on Bae."

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.271
(laughter, applause)

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.240
Comedians...

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:17.778
the tone of the previous
Twitter post is pretty annoyed.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.780
What's another exasperated tweet

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.982
we might see from
the Secret Service? Jimmy Pardo.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.718
Hey, @berniesanders,
your Uber has arrived.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.053
-HARDWICK: All right. Yeah.
-(laughter)

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.088
-Please get in it. Please.
-Yeah, let's go.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.123
-Moving on.
-Uh, Dave Krumholtz.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:33.160
Hey, @realDonaldTrump,
there's only so much we can do,

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:34.761
so shut the (bleep) up.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:37.865
-HARDWICK: All right. All right.
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.800
Uh, Doug Benson.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:43.070
The Secret Service is tired of
tweets

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.405
about the Netflix show
<i>Stranger Things.</i>

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:45.506
-We're only on episode two.
-HARDWICK: All right, perfect.
