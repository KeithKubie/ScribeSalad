00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.320
This photograph exemplifies
the harsh reality of war.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.170
A US Marine experiences
an extremely close call

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.860
from a Taliban attack.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.230
The dirt wall protecting him
exploding from an enemy bullet.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.240
We can see that the
soldier is in danger,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.830
but what about the person
who took the photo?

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.410
The person standing feet
away from this nearly fatal

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.400
firefight.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.619
It makes you wonder, is it
worth it to risk your life just

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:25.660
to get the perfect photo?

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.439
Photography has been around
since the early 1800s.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.420
And wars, of course,
much longer than that.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.850
Before photography, wars were
reimagined on the canvas.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.170
Heroic paintings created by
artists who weren't there.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.630
Many times, completed long
after the battles were over.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.150
But when people started
to photograph war,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.200
these images helped bring the
realism and the horror of it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.160
to the world, to people living
far away from the conflict.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.645
These images had an immediate
impact on how people saw war.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.800
One of the first major wars
that was covered extensively

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.950
by photography was the
American Civil War.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.110
There were other war
photographs before,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.590
but nothing like the coverage
that the Civil War received.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.350
These pictures documented the
soldiers, both living and dead,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.650
in one of the bloodiest
conflicts in history.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.120
The camera technology at the
time couldn't capture action.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.610
No bullets flying,
no soldiers running.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.190
But it could show the impact
and the consequences of war.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.230
One person at the time
even compared the work

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.010
of famous Civil War
photographer Matthew Brady

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.900
to having the actual
bodies of deceased soldiers

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.680
laid at the front
doors of the public.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.340
With the growth
of war photography

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.040
and the knowledge that it
can influence the public,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.400
it soon got the attention
of the American government.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.274
During World War I, many
photographs were censored.

00:01:49.274 --> 00:01:50.690
Some because the
government didn't

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.590
want to give away
troop movement,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.000
but many because
they didn't want

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.910
the photographs to negatively
impact morale back home.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.980
World War II saw both the
allied and axis countries

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.780
using photography as
a propaganda tool.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.470
America wanted to show the
heroic American soldier,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.990
doing good across the world.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.170
Germany wanted to show
the world something, too.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.490
How well they were
treating prisoners,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.060
and how life wasn't changing
negatively in the countries

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.370
they occupied.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.610
Both countries continued
to censor images that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.370
could possibly lower morale.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.340
It might not have been
until the Vietnam War

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.280
that Americans once again
saw the horror of conflict.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.680
The images that were sent back
were not censored or screened.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.820
The world was once again
exposed to the reality of war,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.460
and told the truth about what
was happening in Vietnam.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.430
Pictures appeared on the cover
of Time and Life magazines,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.260
and on television
screens around the world.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.390
So it's not a surprise that
back home, the war was not

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.730
thought upon as popular.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.060
Today, war journalists
and photographers

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.950
are as important as ever.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.130
In an internet era, a world
with instant communication,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.390
they can show what's
happening in almost real time.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.070
We can see the tragedy
that happened yesterday,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.580
or the heroism from
the night before.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.530
Photographers today
are putting themselves

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.130
on the front lines of violence
around the world in a fight

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.950
to bring you the truth.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.970
What you do with that truth,
well, that's up to you.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.780

America used these images

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.130
as propaganda.
