00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.799
 hi I'm the barn grandson of the team should 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.460
 privilege in Brazil and in the debate 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.870
 today 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.119
 Let's see how to get started 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.640
 fragments your android projects and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.400
 after all what are the fragments 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.890
 Fragments are a behavior or a 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.920
 the user interface area of ​​a 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.800
 tivit you can combine several of these 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.610
 fragments on a single tivit riding 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.829
 so a multi-panel interface is not 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.149
 use of the fragments also allows 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.680
 the use of the code 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.800
 you can get this same behavior 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.960
 this same piece of cte 20 and use 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.780
 other activities or even in other 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.760
 applications that you develop 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.280
 this feature has been running since 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.590
 android 3.0 honeycomb that was when 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.410
 started the part of the tablets officially 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.879
 the android and at that point we had to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.890
 create some support so that you 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.690
 could have a more fluid interface than 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.670
 would work best on large screens and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.280
 also on smartphones 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.540
 the fragments then allow the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.510
 application has an interface that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.520
 adapt to each situation the size 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.430
 without you have to develop a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.020
 specific code a certain situation 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.810
 as the classic example here is in the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 screen that is from a list where when you 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.670
 click on this list it takes you to a 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.159
 next screen usually a new one that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.020
 I had with the details of this element that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.540
 You clicked if you want to have 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.720
 back in the list will select a new one 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.790
 new selection but do not imagine that you 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 there's a tablet now I know you're going 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.079
 then put a list of seven or 10 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.360
 inches you can use the space better 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.979
 how do we do it using 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.009
 panel layout yesterday on the left 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.509
 list panel and on the right the details 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.729
 this time with the Flemish I click on a 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.420
 list it updates the details to the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.189
 right 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.560
 this is the most practical example 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.490
 classic in the use of flagrant 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.020
 we have several other examples 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.969
 that it is also worth giving a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.159
 I have to justify and 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.979
 eg compress where you set the 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.379
 left width so that you do not 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.810
 has a balanced interface with the 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.500
 size of the right and also has here the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.110
 battery 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.880
 where are you going to stack the panels 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.070
 fragments according to the orientation of the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.280
 Sodré will quote and so you enjoy 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.290
 better the space of your business 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.230
 also has the part to expand and 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.810
 collect where unlike the young kit 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.240
 before scut will expand collect 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.709
 showing more or less information 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.080
 relevant to the size of the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.540
 brings left panel hold there 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.270
 the right panel and also has the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.090
 show hide where sometimes even 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.220
 on a tablet but it does not stay legal on 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.380
 show mode the left panel 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.340
 gets very flat they end up losing a 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.980
 identity 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.470
 then you hide the part of the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.239
 left shows part that is right 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.459
 full screen and allows the user to 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.520
 go back to previous screen using gay pv 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.959
 chan, for example, and you have to take 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.959
 mind when we are going to design a 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.570
 multi-panel interface the first point 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.820
 plan ahead as your ep 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.020
 will behave on different screens 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.910
 guidelines 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.250
 then draw an interface design one 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.330
 mockup plans that you do not get caught 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.610
 surprise 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.170
 another thing identifies way more 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.120
 suitable for composing the screens 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.250
 reorganizing the panels when you change the 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.140
 do not think it's just that you have a 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.570
 tablet or have a screen phone 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.580
 greater is to place a larger stiffening design 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.290
 to the same place does not think how 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.989
 make better use of this space 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.580
 more comfortable for your user 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.730
 We also have to look for 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.829
 opportunities to consolidate screens in 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.100
 many panel compositions ie 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.100
 suddenly a tablet of 7 where 10 or 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.049
 your nexus 41 phone by the smaller you 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.900
 you can end up joining two screens in one 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.079
 only and with possible more comfortable interface 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.980
 and more fluid user and law enforcement 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.530
 end 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.690
 make sure your cells offer 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.360
 the same features when they are in 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.110
 different rotations or sizes 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.910
 many different 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.980
 for example if you are accessing a 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.140
 party functionality resolves to 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.360
 screen and at that point a feature 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.820
 add at this moment that is one thing 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.100
 always try to offer the same 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.239
 group of features when you have 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.080
 working with these different 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.729
 parliaments 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.410
 Let's now see what the 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.330
 steps for us to create a fragment 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.610
 first thing then is to create 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.280
 the class descending from fragment 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.240
 then to define a layout that will be 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.120
 used 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.030
 you use to program about writing the 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.409
 method a customer has seen and this is indeed is 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.289
 the only method you really 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.430
 need to develop to have your movie 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.830
 working 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.870
 the other life cycle methods also 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.800
 are important but you can implement 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.300
 them later 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.610
 according to your needs. 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.020
 functions and characteristics of your 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.789
 screen 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.610
 so I think you've already created if the 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.849
 Flemish you need to add it 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.969
 activity 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.009
 in this case they are modular objects 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.440
 that work by themselves but you have to 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.750
 each instance of it is added a 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.060
 activity in the case of the dreaded pelé 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.219
 saw it before 11 you use a 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.889
 fragmented activity that is made available 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:19.469
 by free support 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:22.110
 then it is possible to associate 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.210
 a semed layout file with shred 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.360
 so that you can then mount your 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.650
 multi-panel interface with personal 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.960
 let's see now how to work with 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.789
 front and in this specific example the 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.710
 People are going to use ego support. 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.050
 I had the class start right away. 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.789
 Fragment layout support where they will be 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.770
 encapsulated all classes 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.659
 in this example it extends from 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.969
 fragmente active as I explained 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.740
 previously it is necessary for you to 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.710
 can use food with support 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.169
 hare good here logo 17 content view 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.849
 I had this and I'm defining layout 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.050
 let's take a look at that layout 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.080
 because of the movies that's where it's 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.759
 defined the use of the films in this first 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.370
 here we are seeing that there is only one 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.800
 defined frame and in this case is the 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.810
 fragments because I'm in portrait mode 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.490
 In this case, then I will only display the 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.889
 list does not have because there is another 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.110
 flagrant when clicking here it will have 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.009
 another tite who will then show the 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.330
 Details 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.849
 in this case a list of 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.729
 shakespeare after the dialogues goes down 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.710
 of this part already in this other file 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:26.250
 remembering that the same name but now is 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.770
 saved in layout folder lend trace 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.560
 landscape I have two elements because 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.289
 fraud are still on the list that 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.500
 is on the left and another a frame layout 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.389
 with the id of yours that is used for the 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.009
 inclusion of the fragment of the details 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.779
 with the dialogues 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.479
 the type you selected in the list 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:47.400
 do not have landscape mode 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.110
 Let's go back here and let's the woman then 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.599
 in the list class what it is 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.550
 making 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:56.939
 in this case the flame tyton is fragmented and 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.499
 extends from it is a list of 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:00.659
 is normal that it encapsulates some 

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:02.909
 behaviors have everything to do with 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.529
 garbage adapts and you can look after 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:05.249
 waiting documentation have some 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:07.830
 doubt 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:10.469
 but the point is the following when I click 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.189
 in an item I see that no item list 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:14.520
 click 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:16.439
 I have a show from God that he does it 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.050
 first check that you have two 

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:21.749
 panes on the screen or in landscape mode 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.689
 where I have there are lists that form 

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:27.479
 right and if I have I'll raise the chicken 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:30.330
 again with the details of this dialogue and 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:33.360
 I'll look through the dts as far as I can. 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.849
 20 defined in the layout and I'll make the exchange 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.409
 put the new fragmente in that layout there 

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:39.180
 then making the dynamic exchange of 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:42.059
 fragments on the screen 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.589
 if you are in portrait mode that will be 

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:46.319
 this is what there is a code that 

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:48.240
 What do I do, Dilma understands and says 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:50.759
 to a new activity that is where you 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.899
 detail can be displayed. 

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:57.289
 find this class I had here in 

00:07:54.899 --> 00:08:01.319
 our code that shows exactly what 

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:03.870
 it shows that when creating the class if by 

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:05.849
 chance you have a landscape mode it 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.370
 will kill this activity 

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:10.319
 but why does it all landscape me 

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.240
 I do not have the assets I'm going to use 

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:14.189
 two panels and I'll use your 

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.919
 fragments down here in the code people 

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:19.620
 also can see the god fragmente that 

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:21.059
 nothing else having to display the items 

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.120
 that you submitted to the case was a 

00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:25.949
 dialogue and there are the text and 

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.580
 scroll all right 

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:32.250
 So what we're seeing here is 

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.440
 I have a list that displays the 

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.269
 items a fragment that will display 

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.729
 update and if you are in 

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:40.349
 I'm going to have assets that are released 

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:42.449
 by that same list 

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:44.639
 good folks in today's episode we 

00:08:42.449 --> 00:08:46.980
 we have seen what the fragments are and some 

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:48.920
 options for how to combine these 

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.540
 in several panels for its interface 

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.360
 and also how to create layouts for 

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.810
 guidelines and add these 

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.110
 lion 

00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:00.180
 fragments and activities and at the end 

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.060
 we saw how to communicate between two 

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.920
 fragments or start a new 

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.290
 according to the orientation of your 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.090
 device from now on you 

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.500
 you can start using fragments in 

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:14.660
 your android projects 

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.660
 this is the debate today and in the next
