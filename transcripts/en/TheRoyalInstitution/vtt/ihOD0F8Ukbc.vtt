00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.300
These are some of Faraday's
objects that we've got on

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.550
display in our collections.

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:25.715
I'm interested in fluorine,
because it represents one of

00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:27.990
the very few failures that
Michael Faraday-- who worked

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.410
in their Royal Institution, in
the early part of the 19th

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.830
century, made.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.940
In 1834 and 1835 he sought to
isolate fluorine using the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.520
sorts of electro-chemical
techniques that Davy used to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.830
isolate sodium potassium a
generation or so before.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.620
Faraday was an extraordinary
meticulous worker.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.210
He kept a very detailed set
of laboratory notes which

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.110
ultimately ran to
just over 16,000

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.050
paragraphs, that he numbered.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.000
Fluorine is an extraordinarily
reactive substance.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.950
It was first discovered--

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.760
well, the mineral which contains
fluorine was first

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.099
discovered in late
18th century.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.711
And people sought to try and
isolate fluorine for the

00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.220
following 50 years.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.510
And in 1834 and 1835, Faraday
spent a huge amount of time

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.280
trying to isolate fluorine
for the first time.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.910
This is his entry for the 10th
of February, 1834, paragraph

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.340
1477, starting with
the wonderful

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.200
line, "Worked for fluorine.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.050
Used a small strong platina
vessel, like a little

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.900
crucible, and having made a tube
of platina soldered by

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.350
gold, soldered it
onto the former.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.090
Adjusted a thick, plat wire,
P, so as to go into it.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.660
Touching nowhere, but dipping
into fused fluoride of lead,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.870
which was kept in that state
within by the heat of a spirit

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.760
lamp without."

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.100
And what Faraday basically honed
in on, as a method to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.130
try and isolate fluorine, was
to heat up lead fluoride.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.860
And it's really surprising that
when he got molten lead

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.244
fluoride he didn't die as a
consequence, as they are both

00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:10.830
really nasty materials.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.130
And then use electrolysis to
try and dissociate the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.640
fluorine out of the compound.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.690
So here you have this spirit
lamp down there taking off

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.000
electric current--

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.040
positive pole there, negative
pole there,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.070
But the problem with
fluorine is it's

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.390
such a reactive substance.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.400
As soon as it was liberated it
would react with another gas,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.730
like oxygen, for example.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.950
And so Faraday never ever
got pure fluorine.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.950
And indeed, it was such a
difficult problem that it took

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.210
another 50 years before Henri
Moissan, a French chemist, in

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.755
1886 isolated fluorine
for the first time.

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:50.050
And for that he won
the Nobel Prize in

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.960
the early 20th century.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:14.837
