00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.260
So, you might be wondering why anyone
would ever choose pulling over pushing

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.210
because there's no obvious
advantage to pulling.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.820
So does that mean that
you missed something?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.280
No, you didn't.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.540
Properly configured pushing will
always be less expensive for

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.180
the device on which your app is running.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.910
It will lead to fewer syncs, which will
lead to fewer uses of the cellular

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.850
radio, which will lead
to longer battery life.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.580
It also makes things
easier on your server,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.600
who won't have to deal with
nagging devices all day everyday.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.570
Note, however,
that I said properly configured.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.460
The cost here is extra engineering
effort to set up the pushing server.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.530
And it isn't always a simple process.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.340
So that's why we introduced
Google Cloud Messaging,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.890
to make it easy to communicate
with your applications.
