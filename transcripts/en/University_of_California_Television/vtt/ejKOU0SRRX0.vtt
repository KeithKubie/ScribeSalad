00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.980
- [Announcer] This
program is a presentation

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.203
of UCTV for educational
and noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.022
(peppy techno music)

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.400
- Welcome to A Conversation With History.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.930
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.520
of International Studies.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.900
Our guest today is John Perry who is

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.630
the HW Stewart Professor of Philosophy

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.170
at Stanford University.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.980
He is the 2009 Howitson, Howison Lecturer

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.870
in Philosophy at UC Berkeley.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.703
- [John] Hi Harry.
- How are you?

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:56.536
Glad to be here.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.760
- Where you born and raised?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.760
- I was born in Lincoln Nebraska
and was raised in Nebraska.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070
Stayed in Nebraska through college.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.232
Left in

00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:10.040
1964.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.450
- And looking back how do you think

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.950
your parents shaped your
thinking about the world?

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.493
- Well I think they had a
profound effect of course.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.230
They were very much...

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.270
My father and his family
were very republican.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.900
My grandfather had run
for congress in 1936

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.723
and was sadly defeated in
the Roosevelt landslide.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.500
And I learned that Roosevelt
was evil and so forth.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.930
My mother's family on the
other hand were democrats

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.600
and my grandfather had a picture

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.003
of Roosevelt in his bedroom.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.670
So the biggest shape was probably

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.070
my maternal grandfather
who was a sign painter

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.220
but a very thoughtful
man, did a lot of reading.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.500
And, I don't know, it's just you grow up

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.770
in Nebraska you think that's
a normal place to grow up.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.430
You look back at it 60 years later

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.730
and you think, "Well, that
was, it was a rather..."

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.020
Nebraska in the 50s was
a rather unusual place.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.140
Very suburban, very...

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.540
My grandfather and I used to go up to

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.830
the belfry in a local college
every Saturday morning

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.520
and watch for Russian
airplanes (laughter).

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.203
This is in Lincoln, Nebraska
in the ground observer core.

00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:35.630
And (laughs) you know, of course we,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.890
Like I suppose you're
old enough to remember

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.100
ducking and covering in
case of nuclear attacks.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.050
So all that seemed
normal, now seems bizarre.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.260
Seemed normal then,
seems quite bizarre now.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.940
- And so as a result
of a line of democrats

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.370
and a line of republicans was there

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.510
a lot of political arguments
at the dinner table?

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.070
- No, no my grandfather and my mother's

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.903
side of the family learned that
they should just keep quiet.

00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:01.770
(laughter)

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.270
Because the republican side of the family

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.720
was all lawyers and all
articulate and all...

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.240
One of my earliest memories
actually is the 1948 election.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.160
My father and my uncle and a whole...

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.660
The families and a whole
bunch of republicans

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.810
had gathered around the big console radio

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.445
in the living room to celebrate
the end of democratic rule.

00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:25.710
(laughter)

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.720
And you know as a five year old

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.140
I just remember the
emotions of that night.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.890
They made a tremendous impact on me.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.780
I think it's when you learn
your father is not omnipotent

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.070
and I certainly learned that they

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.763
were just so devastated
that Truman won, so.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.780
- And what about in school in Nebraska,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.180
before you went to college?

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.080
Any teachers who really influenced?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.370
I'm curious as to when you
got the philosophy bug.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.790
I guess it was much later?

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.840
- Well there was a couple
of really good teachers.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.600
There was one guy named Glenn Fozott,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.030
actually his son was
one of my best friends

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.030
and he was just a
homeroom teacher actually.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.340
He must have taught something else,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.140
but he had a big influence and he was...

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:12.990
He may have been the one
that told me to go read

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.353
Will Durant's Story of Philosophy,

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:16.710
that the first philosophy
book I ever read.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.670
I was very mediocre student.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.033
Tried to play football without success.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.430
But I did a lot of reading,
it just didn't translate

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.680
into much academic prowess
until I got to college.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.370
- And where did you go to college
and what did you major in?

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.660
- Well I went Doane college,
I'm sure you've heard of it,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.490
it's the Harvard of
Selene county Nebraska.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.630
I wanted to go away from home
and I wanted to play football

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.190
and it was 25 miles away and
with only about 300 students

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.990
I thought I should be able
to make the football team.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.040
- And did that work out?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.577
- No.
- (laughs) I see.

00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:51.870
Did they have a football team?

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.380
- They had a very good football team

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.390
and I played my freshman year

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.383
or I sat on the bench my freshman year.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.970
At the end of the year,
or at the end of the

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.520
the football season the coach put his arm

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.273
around me and said, "Perry,
you're small but you're slow."

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:08.637
(laughter)

00:05:08.637 --> 00:05:10.861
"But I bet you'd make
a really good student."

00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:11.920
(laughter)

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.143
So that was very inspiring
and I got into academics.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.483
- But I believe I read somewhere that

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:20.200
you wanted to be an engineer?

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.890
- Well, yeah, as I said I didn't have

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.990
my eye on the ball as
a high school student.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.440
Actually originally I
wanted to go to West Point

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.020
but my eyes weren't good enough

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.030
and probably wouldn't
have gotten in anyway.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.030
So finally I went to Doane
and I had a vague feeling

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.530
I could be an engineer
but they didn't have

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.980
a school of engineering, I
had forgot to check that out.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.720
That was about the way
things were going then.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.273
Then I met my wife,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.000
now my wife of 46 years Frenchie,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.570
my freshman year and
she straightened me out.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.380
- And so you majored in philosophy?

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.520
- Majored in philosophy and went to

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.482
philosophy graduate school
at Cornell University.

00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:06.400
And philosophy's been
very very good to me.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.590
You know I think philosophy
is this discipline

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.514
who's main function is
to provide a little place

00:06:14.514 --> 00:06:18.869
for bizarre occupants
of the gene pool, right?

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:20.947
(laughter)

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:23.460
Until maybe centuries later their

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.500
particular skills mature right?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.840
So I think if you go back 50 years

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.240
all the people that are now great

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.280
computer programmers
would've been philosophers

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.970
but then now they're, now they fit

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.430
into society in a more normal way.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.870
- And so what does it
take to be a philosopher?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.753
What are the skills involved?

00:06:43.682 --> 00:06:47.000
Thinking alone or what?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.340
- Well that's an interesting question.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.190
Of course as somebody said,
philosophy has many mansions.

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:59.680
But the dominant philosophy
in America, during my career,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.700
has been what's called
analytic philosophy.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.180
It doesn't mean too much
but it means basically

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.210
you're supposed to be able to write

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.790
and think clearly and
not get into a lot of

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.860
pomposity in a way that
philosophers often do.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.890
And you know I've been
happy in that movement.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.530
But there are philosophers,
different kinds

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.260
of philosophers who love to read.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.580
Love to read philosophy and love to

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.530
talk philosophy, don't
like to write philosophy.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.040
And I think they're maybe
the best philosophers of all.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.600
But they don't fit very well into

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.530
our current academic situation

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.380
where you're rewarded
for writing what we call

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.903
research scholarship and thinking
in the case of philosophy.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.300
Other people like F.H. Bradley,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.240
a great turn of the century philosopher,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.350
he just didn't like to
interact with much of anybody.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.083
Didn't like to give seminars,
didn't like to talk to people.

00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:54.513
Just like to sit alone and read his books.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.780
Bertrand Russell, just tremendous energy.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.013
Loved to talk, loved to
argue, loved to lecture.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.430
So it takes all sorts
but an appreciation for

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.367
thinking either slow careful thinking

00:08:08.367 --> 00:08:10.520
and the process of
writing in your own study

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.153
or quick on the feet
thinking in the seminar room.

00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:18.715
All great philosophers are good at

00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:21.686
one kind or other of thinking.

00:08:21.686 --> 00:08:24.970
- So does the fact that
you have to publish

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.570
as a philosopher bias the pool

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.590
because you might have
really great philosophers

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.940
who would be great undergraduate teachers?

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.750
- Well yes you might have not only

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.780
great undergraduate teachers

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.930
but huge contributors to their department.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.570
In the old days you used
to get by with that.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.440
There was a fella named Rogers Albritton

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.920
who was a professor at Harvard for

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.630
a long time then he went to UCLA.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.170
Published very few things
but had this wide reputation

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.862
as a brilliant interlocuteur

00:08:54.862 --> 00:08:58.270
and a great person for graduate students

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.657
to talk to and so forth and so on.

00:09:00.657 --> 00:09:02.457
And I remember when the chairman at,

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:08.310
at UCLA a wonderful guy named Monty Firth

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.117
made the case that we should
hire Rogers Albritton.

00:09:13.117 --> 00:09:15.270
And of course the comparisons
always with Socrates.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.670
Socrates didn't publish anything

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.110
but everybody he was around benefited

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.680
by talking to him and that's the way

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.993
Rogers Albritton would be.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.750
So Albritton got appointed but the Dean

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.517
sent a memo that said, "Don't try

00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:30.356
"that Socrates argument on me ever again."

00:09:30.356 --> 00:09:31.900
(laughter)

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.860
Now-a-days that kind of appointment

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.673
would be very very hard to make.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.560
But those are often the most

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.950
useful people in the department.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.250
People like me who aren't very good

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.130
at getting things read and like to write

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.360
may be much less useful
to their colleagues

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.026
'cause I depend on my
colleagues to find out about

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:58.970
the literature and on
my graduate students,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.120
rather than being a resource for them.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.330
So I mean I don't think I'm useless but.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.840
- What sort of courses
are a useful preparation

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.760
for philosophy, other than
philosophy courses, math or?

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.281
- Well I think math is always

00:10:12.281 --> 00:10:14.250
a good preparation for anything.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.103
I think people should always...

00:10:17.103 --> 00:10:19.668
My educational view is kids should take

00:10:19.668 --> 00:10:24.668
some kind of math each year
as long as they possibly can.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.250
Even if they're not really
making much progress.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.160
Just to keep those brain cells working.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.560
I'd wish I'd done that.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.030
I quit taking math about
halfway through college

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.773
when I decided that wasn't
gonna be the area I went into.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.940
But linguistics these days can be

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.190
very very useful because so much

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.980
philosophy connects with language.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.980
And then coniginatve science in general.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.440
Computer science, the
more theoretical parts

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.460
of computer science, AI,
those are very relevant.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.230
Course if you're doing
the history of philosophy

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.510
it's good to know some history.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.120
Political science, your field is

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.223
a very closely associated field.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.360
Psychology is very important these days.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.450
Philosophy has gotten a lot more

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.710
interdisciplinary over the
years I've been involved.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.970
When I was a graduate student at Cornell

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:15.000
there wasn't much connection
with any other department.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.793
The feeling was, "Well you know,

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:21.297
"philosophers doing our
analytic philosophy,

00:11:21.297 --> 00:11:23.317
"we're just kind of our own thing

00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:25.367
"and if other departments wanna come

00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:27.577
"and have their conceptual mistakes

00:11:27.577 --> 00:11:29.597
"straightened out that's fine."

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.590
Now it's much more interdisciplinary.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.620
Philosophers

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.800
get ideas from experiments and cognitive

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.100
psychology and all sorts of things.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.240
So for the areas of philosophy
I've been involved in

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.100
all the different so called cognitive

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.263
sciences are very relevant.

00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:52.180
- And what about temperament?

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.840
What sort of a temperament
does a would be philosopher

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.880
should he have, should he or she have?

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.110
- Well you think maybe they should have

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.030
a philosopher temperament, right?

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.950
You know kind of take
a broad view of things.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.990
Be able to see all sides
so forth and so on.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.060
I can't say honestly that I see much

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.430
correlation between having a broad

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.130
philosophical temperament and being

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.830
a successful academic philosopher.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.750
I mean, some do, maybe a little more

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.470
than the average run
of the mill population

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.780
but unfortunately, or fortunately

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.300
you get pre-Madonnas and you get a lot

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.090
of people who sit around
department meetings

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.810
and don't seem aware that the university

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.390
has any other mission
than promoting philosophy.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.140
You get small minded people
and so forth and so on.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.430
- So all types?
- All types, I'm afraid.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.930
- But there must be a lot of the

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.590
loneliness of the long
distance runner in philosophy?

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:59.590
That is that you go off and do
a lot of thinking and so on?

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.130
- Well it's, compared
to a lot of other things

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.390
that happen at the university

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.093
a lot of philosophy is more like math.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.090
Where basically the work is done

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.413
sitting alone trying to
unravel some problem.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:25.143
And less done with a laboratory group.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.423
I try to have group
meetings every so often

00:13:30.423 --> 00:13:32.080
with the students who are working with me

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.573
but frankly it never works very well.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.060
So it is much different than the

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.310
kind of team based scientific endeavors

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.300
that are fairly common in the university.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.320
- Does that kind of setting require

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.863
a kind of courage, basically?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.410
As you're grappling with problems

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.560
and especially if you're making

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.260
kind of a breakthrough in some area?

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.343
- Well I think chutzpah
might be a better word.

00:13:58.343 --> 00:13:59.540
- Be a better word (laughter).

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.487
- Yeah, I mean you're sitting there

00:14:00.487 --> 00:14:02.160
and you're, I mean like I'm gonna give

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.720
a talk this afternoon on free will.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.880
Now people have been thinking about

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.933
free will for a long time
and very very smart people.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.920
Go back to Lucretius, he was no dope

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.030
and he had his theory of free will.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.700
Then we got the people I'm criticizing,

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.290
really brilliant guys like Carl
Ginet and Peter van Inwagen.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.370
So for me to walk in to
a seminar at Berkeley,

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.940
the greatest university in the world,

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.180
with all these smart
people like John Searle,

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.330
God knows what he
believes about free will.

00:14:30.496 --> 00:14:34.130
And say, "Hey I've
figured out the answer."

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.210
You know I'm defending Hume, so at least

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.927
I got one really smart guy on my side.

00:14:38.927 --> 00:14:40.359
But I'm gonna tell you what Kant,

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:44.260
and van Inwagen, and Ginet
and all these guys have wrong.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.210
It takes a certain amount of

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:51.210
chutzpah or stupidity,
but you know why not?

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.470
On the other hand it's a little bit

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:53.943
like Jimmy Carter you know?

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.410
He sat on his, when he
was Governor of Georgia,

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.760
he sat on his front porch and he met

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.370
all the candidates that
came through running

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.390
in the Georgia primary
or the Georgia caucus.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.310
And he had this great revelation that

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.193
these guys weren't any
smarter than he was.

00:15:10.193 --> 00:15:11.970
(laughter)

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.810
Actually you might say,
"Well he was wrong."

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.410
But I think he was a
pretty good president.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.459
But anyway, so as you
go along in philosophy

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:20.780
you start of kind of awestruck.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.280
I mean you're in this profession

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.270
that's the world's
second oldest profession

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.833
and you know all these
brilliant guys from Plato.

00:15:28.176 --> 00:15:30.967
And then you meet some people
that you know you just say,

00:15:30.967 --> 00:15:34.717
"Well no doubt about it that
guy's a lot brighter than me."

00:15:36.497 --> 00:15:38.600
You meet a Bob Adams or a David Lewis,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.760
the names might be familiar
to some of my colleagues.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.988
Or John Searle and you
say, "Well, you know."

00:15:43.988 --> 00:15:46.490
On the other hand you do a lot of reading

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.700
and you meet a lot of people with

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.440
good reputations and so forth

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.147
and you have a little bit
of the Jimmy Carter feeling.

00:15:52.147 --> 00:15:55.240
"Well, gosh I mean my ideas
are as good as those."

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.590
I've come to have the
following view of philosophy

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.052
that's a little bit metaphorical.

00:16:00.052 --> 00:16:02.956
I think there's a muse of philosophy.

00:16:02.956 --> 00:16:06.456
And I think the muse of philosophy is like

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.230
the head person in the public
defenders office, right?

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.830
And they're assigning
philosophers to ideas.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.720
And idea's to philosophers
and the philosophers

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.240
are supposed to defend the ideas.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.305
And the brighter the philosopher
the stupider the idea.

00:16:23.305 --> 00:16:24.660
(laughter)

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.910
So it's like you give your very best

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.750
defense lawyer the guy
who's most obviously

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.570
guilty and say, "defend him", right?

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.480
And then more mediocre talents like me

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.380
you give really plasuable
ideas that are easy to defend.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.860
So that's my picture, right?

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.180
- I see, now in the case of the

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.530
person who has the worst idea.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.760
- I won't tell you who I'm picking.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.190
- No, just following up on the metaphor.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.670
Does he then improve the idea or is it

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.460
like banging his head against the wall?

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.040
- No, no he becomes, he or she becomes

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.690
incredibly famous for working out

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.530
some elaborate scheme where the idea

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.513
seems within the scheme quite plausible.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.210
Like Leibniz for example
would be a good example.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.550
With these ideas of monads and

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.170
really isn't any causation
and so forth and so on.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.643
Bizarre ideas but wonderfully defended.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.730
- So give us a general sense
of what a philosopher does.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.920
We've talked about the skills,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.160
I mean are you bringing order,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.160
a set of rules, to a domain of ideas?

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.600
Or is that a fair question,
is that a fair question?

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.183
- I suppose to a certain extent.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.787
I mean a lot of people find it baffling.

00:17:46.787 --> 00:17:48.133
"What do you do in philosophy?

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:51.470
"I mean science is research
but what do you do, you just?"

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.303
They kind of have the feeling,

00:17:52.303 --> 00:17:53.657
"Well philosophy's a finished business.

00:17:53.657 --> 00:17:55.127
"There's all the dead philosophers

00:17:55.127 --> 00:17:58.330
"and philosophy must consist of teaching."

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.720
But actually no you get
involved in the same...

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.070
I had a teacher once named Okay Balsmunt,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.120
at the University of Nebraska.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.290
I went up and went to a seminar

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.070
that he put on when I was going to Doane.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.188
And he said the first step in philosophy,

00:18:10.188 --> 00:18:13.020
the basic philosophical talent is

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.570
the ability to quicken
the sense of the queer,

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.117
which in those days meant notice

00:18:18.117 --> 00:18:21.963
what's odd about every day things.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.410
Get puzzled about
personal identity, right?

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.543
Or about you know what
happens when I lift my hand?

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.930
That's the, not every, some
philosophers don't have that.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.700
Some philosophers just pick up problems

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.310
from the past and they
can do a good job too.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:45.310
But to me that's the fundamental
thing, is you get puzzled.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.590
And it turns out that
there are these long,

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.400
there's problems that have been puzzling

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.600
to people from time in memorial.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.320
And we can think about them now

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.170
just as they could think
about the very same

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.600
problems in Plato's time
or in Descartes's time.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.110
Of course we have a lot more constraints.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.350
We have a lot of science.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.790
We have the criticisms that have been made

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.940
of earlier philosophers and we should

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.000
take all those things into account.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.591
But when it comes right
down to it and you think,

00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:12.899
"What is the relation
between the feel of a pain

00:19:12.899 --> 00:19:16.807
"that I'm aware of in my consciousness

00:19:16.807 --> 00:19:20.877
"and the brain state that is caused

00:19:20.877 --> 00:19:23.640
"physiologically by the
thing that causes the pain?"

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.020
Are they the same thing?

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.830
It doesn't seem like a brain state

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.120
but what else could it be?

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.630
There's nothing in there but the brain.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.750
When you get, you're
probably thinking thoughts

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.840
not all that different from the
ones that Descartes thought.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.830
You're thinking about the same problem.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.460
And I think it's a great thing about...

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.790
I mean (laughs) the philosopher

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.277
Gottlob Frege asked in 1892 he said,

00:19:45.277 --> 00:19:47.160
"Well A is identical with A.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.867
"A is identical with B.

00:19:48.867 --> 00:19:50.767
"If they're both true they both

00:19:50.767 --> 00:19:53.550
"say the same thing 'cause
they're just one thing."

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.840
But you can learn something from

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.910
"A is identical with B" that

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.220
you can't learn from "A
is identical with A".

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.740
How is that possible?

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.040
Well he thought about it,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.270
Russel thought about it,
Quine thought about it,

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.710
we've gone through a whole...

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.100
The end of the 19th century,

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.660
all of the 20th century, and now we're

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.110
in the 21st century and we're
still thinking about it.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.180
Now isn't that great?

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.870
I mean that's very ecological right?

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.130
We're not wasting problems.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.672
Now in that time the theory of relativity,

00:20:18.672 --> 00:20:21.630
quantum physics, the airplane,

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.940
the automobile, atomic energy,

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.668
global warming all this stuff has happened

00:20:27.668 --> 00:20:29.680
and yet we're still thinking
about the same problem.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.117
Now some people might think,
"What a dumb discipline.

00:20:32.117 --> 00:20:33.420
"It never gets anything solved."

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.987
But I think, "Isn't that great.

00:20:34.987 --> 00:20:37.347
"We have these problems
that last forever."

00:20:38.474 --> 00:20:41.640
- And in finding the
complexity in the simple,

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.735
you're sort of clearing
the thought basically.

00:20:45.735 --> 00:20:48.110
Especially your students basically

00:20:50.751 --> 00:20:52.830
and helping them think about things

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.680
in their own existence in a way.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.819
- Well I think, particularly

00:20:55.819 --> 00:20:58.020
when you think of
undergraduates, that's your job.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.323
Students come in and

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.520
their minds are full of structures

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.210
that they've gotten from their parents,

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:07.720
their teachers, their culture,

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.070
the particular place they live,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.790
now the television and so forth and so on.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.670
And then they often have very firm

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.430
convictions that they don't
really have any right to.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.740
And so your job as an introductory

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.840
to philosophy teacher is to liberate them.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.447
To say, "Look you shouldn't
really believe anything.

00:21:23.447 --> 00:21:25.190
"Shouldn't really desire anything

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.073
until you yourself thought about it.

00:21:27.073 --> 00:21:29.377
"You in some sense made
it your own desire,

00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:30.877
"your own belief, not just something

00:21:30.877 --> 00:21:32.567
"you believe 'cause your father did.

00:21:32.567 --> 00:21:35.517
"Or what's just as bad,
'cause your father didn't."

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.830
So shake 'em up and teach 'em to think.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.800
That's what you do with undergraduates.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.700
And philosophy problems just turn out

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.413
to be a great way to get
that process started.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.930
Because at least for some students

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.830
they find them very
gripping and they learn

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.920
what a good argument is,
what a bad argument is.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.550
How something they believed all their life

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.280
can turn out to be not at all
obvious and that's very good.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.850
And then when you get to the end

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.500
you get the graduate students,
that's very different.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.700
They've got some big
project they're deeply into

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.000
and they know more about it than you do

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.970
and there's this huge literature

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.360
and your job is just to kind of

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.815
keep asking questions and
make 'em clarify things

00:22:18.815 --> 00:22:21.700
and tell 'em that they're getting

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.530
too much into jargon
and so forth and so on.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.780
- What does creativity
look like in philosophy?

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:33.753
Especially when you're rehashing
a lot of the old problems.

00:22:35.664 --> 00:22:38.750
- Well creativity is looking
at an old problem in a new way.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.480
Even if the new way is something that's

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.350
borrowed from a couple centuries before.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.740
And all of a sudden some philosopher

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.923
makes it seem plasuable where
it seemed implausible before.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.200
Say, take this problem I'm
talking about this afternoon.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.500
When I was a graduate student

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.339
everybody thought that Hume was right

00:22:56.339 --> 00:23:00.110
and free will and
determinism were compatible.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.547
That is everybody feels, "Well gosh

00:23:01.547 --> 00:23:03.337
"if the world was run according to laws,

00:23:03.337 --> 00:23:05.913
"including human action,
are we really free?"

00:23:05.913 --> 00:23:07.910
A very natural reaction
is to say, "No we're not."

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.787
Hume said, "Ah, yes you are.

00:23:09.787 --> 00:23:11.487
"Being free is just doing what you want.

00:23:11.487 --> 00:23:14.730
"And it's okay if your
wants in a law like way

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.500
determine what you do, your free."

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.900
Very plasuable view when in 1970

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.680
probably if you took a poll of

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.003
analytic philosophers
90% would be compatibles.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.920
I went to a conference a few years ago

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.470
and discovered that while I
hadn't been paying attention

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.650
this whole field had been transformed

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:37.785
by people like Ginet and Peter van Inwagen

00:23:37.785 --> 00:23:42.640
who revitalized these
arguments for incompatibilism.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.727
The arguments that they say,

00:23:43.727 --> 00:23:45.957
"No the common person's intuition

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:47.957
"that there's something screwy about

00:23:47.957 --> 00:23:49.717
"being free if the world is run in a

00:23:49.717 --> 00:23:51.937
"law like way including human actions

00:23:51.937 --> 00:23:54.550
"can be given a good firm solid argument."

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.880
Well that was very original.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.100
Produced a lot of good work,
a lot of good distinctions.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.513
Even though in my humble
opinion they're wrong.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.840
- Now let's go back to your education

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.060
because what do you do your dissertation

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.690
on at Cornell, identity was it?

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.767
- Identity yeah.

00:24:10.767 --> 00:24:14.250
I went to Cornell primarily

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.060
because it was a hotbed
of Wittgenstein studies

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.140
at the time and I had become

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.840
very enthralled with Wittgenstein.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.070
But after a couple years I got

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.150
less enthralled with Wittgenstein

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.710
and more enthralled with Gottlob Frege,

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:31.150
a great philosopher of language

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:32.940
and logician and mathematician

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.193
of the late 19th century
and modern people,

00:24:37.193 --> 00:24:39.010
more modern people with the same interests

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.690
like Willard Van Orman
quine and Peter Geach.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.470
And so my dissertation was rather

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.740
on a rather narrow topic, identity

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.120
and defending what Frege said

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.003
as opposed to what Geach said.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:58.590
And a couple years
later when I was at UCLA

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.460
a fella named Artie Kauffman asked me

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.350
if I wanted to do an anthology

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.190
for a series he was putting together

00:25:06.378 --> 00:25:07.730
on my dissertation topic.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.310
And I said, "Sure that
sounds like a good idea."

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:10.200
And he says, "Well what's the topic?"

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.500
I said, "Identity."

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.507
He said, "Okay."

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.480
And a couple months later he brought

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.700
in a contract to do an
anthology on personal identity.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.840
I think it never occurred to him

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.000
that anybody could be interested

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.340
in just identity (laughs).

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.730
So he interpreted it as personal identity.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:29.120
So I was too embarrassed to (laughs)

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.930
to say anything so I did an anthology

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.670
on personal identity and that's been

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.301
a big part of my research ever since.

00:25:35.301 --> 00:25:36.440
- And that was the subject of your

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.240
Howson lecture here.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.500
- Yeah.
- Yesterday?

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.830
- Yeah, the nature of the self

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.550
and self knowledge, very related to

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.640
the problem of personal identity.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.687
What is the difference between thinking,

00:25:49.687 --> 00:25:54.370
"Well I am sitting here and
John Perry is sitting here."?

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:55.780
Well I believe I'm sitting here

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.830
and I believe John Perry is sitting here.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.650
You believe John Perry is sitting here

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.500
but you believe you're sitting there.

00:26:03.423 --> 00:26:07.120
So these "I" thoughts
are very interesting.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.390
What's the difference between thinking

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.270
about yourself in the first person

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.690
and thinking about yourself
in the third person?

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.390
What's the difference between

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.683
the meaning of the word "I"
and say your proper name?

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.750
- And so here you are with a problem

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.810
that you've grappled with
throughout your whole career.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.960
How has your thinking evolved?

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.420
I mean are you affected, for example,

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:37.420
by breakthroughs in
brain research between,

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.720
by fads in psychology and so on?

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.510
I know in the 60s identity
was quite a craze.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.230
- Well not as much as
I probably should be.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.960
(laughter)

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.160
Mostly indirectly by talking to people

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.660
who've conducted the research

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.270
or their students or my students

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.080
that have talked to their students.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.420
But I must admit mostly it's
a very narrow set of topics.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.950
If you go back to 19

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.760
76 say, I had my first sabbatical.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.890
I'd come to Stanford, I was trying

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.750
to write a book on personal identity.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.300
And I got to this problem
of self knowledge.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.140
And I had this confidence that I had

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.170
this whole, whole bunch of concepts from

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.330
working in the philosophy of language.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.410
And then this appreciation of the problem

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.130
of the self and personal
identity from my work there.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:27.963
And I thought, "Well I'm kinda

00:27:27.963 --> 00:27:29.647
"uniquely qualified to put those

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.880
"together and develop a theory."

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.870
And it turned out to be very difficult.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.760
To work within what I thought a Frega,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.860
Gottlieb Frega inspired framework,

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.680
I thought was pretty much correct

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.750
to explain the difference between just

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.090
these "I" thoughts and thoughts about

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:54.491
yourself under some other guise

00:27:54.491 --> 00:27:57.263
or some other mode of
presentation as he would do it.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.420
So it didn't avail me much to go,

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.050
I mean I did some reading
but the problem was there.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.221
There was nothing to do but
think about it, you know?

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:12.377
And you know somebody could've told me,

00:28:12.377 --> 00:28:14.913
"Ah, they've just discovered
that the brain isn't,

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:19.087
"is silicone based or that the brain

00:28:19.087 --> 00:28:21.227
"really it's just oatmeal and it's

00:28:21.227 --> 00:28:23.160
"your right shoulder that..."

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.810
Wouldn't have made any
difference about that problem.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.170
So in that way it's a little bit

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.470
more like math or logic than

00:28:34.077 --> 00:28:36.710
a lot of other parts of academia.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.210
- In your lecture and in your book;

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.460
Identity, Personal Identity, and Self.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.990
You use the example of

00:28:45.427 --> 00:28:48.903
a story told by Mach, the
scientist philosopher.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.410
What is it he saw, and let's play with

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.453
that a little here to give our

00:28:53.453 --> 00:28:56.090
audience a sense of your lecture.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.680
- So the Mach example
is Mach relates this,

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.680
early in the analysis of
sensations, and I don't know...

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.500
So his point isn't exactly the

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.490
one that intrigues me about it.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.970
But he gets on a bus in Europe,

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.230
or a tram and it's one of these

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.670
things that has a mirror
at the opposite end.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.090
So the conductor on a crowded day

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.130
can see people sneaking on and off.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.790
And Mach just gets on the bus

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.140
looks up and just sees himself

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.370
in the mirror but doesn't
realize it's himself.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.520
He just thinks he's seeing a
guy at the far end of the bus.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.367
And he thinks, "What a
shabby pedagogue that man is.

00:29:36.367 --> 00:29:39.010
"That man is a shabby pedagogue."

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.260
Now if you think about it

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.530
that man really refers to Mach himself.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.190
'Cause he's referring to the fella

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.570
who's reflection is in the mirror

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:50.750
and he is the fella who's
reflection in the mirror.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.390
So he saying about
himself, or he's noticed

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.060
about himself that he's
a shabby pedagogue.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.463
But we wouldn't really ordinarily
call that self knowledge.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.527
But after a while it suddenly hits him.

00:30:01.527 --> 00:30:03.300
"My goodness that's me!"

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.990
So now he believes "I
am a shabby pedagogue."

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.027
And that's what we would
ordinarily call self knowledge.

00:30:08.027 --> 00:30:10.627
The kind of thing you express
with the first person.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.263
I suppose he used German
but we'll forget that.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.070
And then you can imagine that he might,

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.237
if somebody asked him he'd say,

00:30:21.237 --> 00:30:24.030
"Well I guess that means
Mach is a shabby pedagogue."

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.140
He could refer to himself
in the third person.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.730
I mean de Gaulle used to do
that, Bob Dole used to do that,

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.960
I don't know about Mach
but if Mach had been in a

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.520
Bob Dole-ish or General de Gaulle-ish mood

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.380
he might have said, "Mach
is a shabby pedagogue."

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.715
So there's three different
ways of saying the same thing

00:30:40.715 --> 00:30:41.770
and they really correspond

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.930
to three different ways of
thinking the same thing.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:46.060
We say it's the same thing

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.670
because it's the same individual

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.610
and the same property,
being a shabby pedagogue.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.770
But the thoughts are quite different.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:56.300
They have different causes and
they have different effects.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.870
When Mach realizes that
he's a shabby pedagogue

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.977
that is when he realizes
what he would express was,

00:31:00.977 --> 00:31:02.210
"I am a shabby pedagogue."

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:06.610
Then he might wipe the lint off himself.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.323
As long as he doesn't realize that

00:31:08.323 --> 00:31:09.943
it's he that he's seeing he might,

00:31:09.943 --> 00:31:12.740
if he's really upset by
the lint on the guys tie,

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.637
he might shout at him at
the other end of the bus.

00:31:14.637 --> 00:31:15.727
"Get that lint off your tie!

00:31:15.727 --> 00:31:19.107
"You're disgracing all
the pedagogue in Vienna."

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.370
So we have three different thoughts

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.700
with in a way the same truth conditions.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.060
So a certain person has a certain

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.810
property, being a shabby pedagogue.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.510
And yet they seem to have
different causes and effects

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:33.630
and the different cause and effects

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.330
seem to be related to different meanings

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.690
of the thoughts in the sentences
we use to express them.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.330
Now you note about this you have

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.100
to be in a certain theoretical framework

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.013
to be bothered by it, right?

00:31:46.533 --> 00:31:48.170
I mean if you're an analytical philosopher

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.660
and you're coming from the works of Frega

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.720
and Russell and you think that

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.090
there's a strong connection between

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.743
the meaning of a sentence
and it's truth conditions.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.230
And you believe more or less in truth

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.610
then you might be bothered by it.

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.760
Somebody coming from
a much different angle

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.637
might just think it's a trivial thing

00:32:07.637 --> 00:32:09.210
and not worth worrying about.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:12.023
But to me, it was of
fundamental importance.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.460
- And what would be significant

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.570
for somebody who's not a philosopher?

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:19.690
I mean, does this,

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.260
does this open up,

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.630
let's assume somebody
follows what you're saying,

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.620
does it open up your understanding

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.130
in a way about yourself
and the world around you?

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.760
As opposed to just the philosophical,

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.373
the debates within philosophy?

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:41.100
- Probably not (laughs) to be honest.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.540
Because in a way what the philosopher,

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.110
what the philosopher meaning me here,

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.970
is having trouble with is understanding

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.100
distinctions that ordinary people

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.820
make every day with no problem, right?

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.900
It's like my friend Michael
Brartman worries about,

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.860
a lot about philosophy of action.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.613
What's involved in scratching
your head intentionally.

00:33:01.735 --> 00:33:02.900
Now when he gets this all figured out

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.833
it's not gonna help people
scratch their heads.

00:33:07.501 --> 00:33:08.350
The main effect

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:11.650
is negative.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:15.020
That is people, bad arguments

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.980
convince people of crazy things

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.183
that somehow have profound effects.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.800
If you're convinced by, you know

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.120
in the immortality of the soul

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.010
or the immateriality of the mind

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.104
it may be that these views are connected

00:33:39.104 --> 00:33:42.160
with misunderstanding the logic of

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.040
self knowledge at some point.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.740
Or misunderstanding basic things

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.140
in the philosophy of action.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.040
So I think philosophers do
have occasionally good effects.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.980
Sometimes a bad effect, but
occasionally good effect

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.438
by undermining very complicated views

00:34:01.438 --> 00:34:05.710
with sometimes broad social
and political implications

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.420
that ultimately are
based on confusions about

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:14.300
very complicated things under the surface

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.830
but very simple thing on the surface

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:18.360
like the way we talk and
think about ourselves.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.834
Or what's involved in
scratching your head.

00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:23.400
- In explicating these
ideas yesterday you used

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.320
the concept of a buffer and a file

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.830
which as a layman struck me as

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:32.810
clarifying things.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.800
Explain that to our audience
'cause I think it's useful

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.650
and then it helps one
understand this recognition

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.860
that you were talking about earlier

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.380
which when Mach realizes
that the shabby person

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.100
that he has seen is himself.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.046
- So this is basically a view I've come to

00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:53.130
that in my view, demystifies

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.460
self knowledge to a certain extent.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.550
And so let me give you this analogy.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:01.800
Instead of a buffer let's talk
about an inbox or a notepad.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:07.400
So you're a professor and
you have a certain number

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.000
of undergraduate advisees
you have to deal with

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.410
and at the beginning of the term

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.930
they come in and introduce themselves.

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:18.380
So you have this pad of paper

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.760
and you write down things about

00:35:22.965 --> 00:35:25.010
about the person you're talking to.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.090
Their name, what they look like.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:28.130
What are you trying to do there?

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:29.350
Well you're trying to do two things.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.330
You're trying to get information

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.817
to allow you to recognize them again.

00:35:32.817 --> 00:35:33.960
And you're trying to get information

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.240
that will allow you, once you

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.060
recognize 'em, to say something

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.020
intelligent to them and to
help them with their problems.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.660
So two really different
kinds of information.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.440
And while you're in face to face

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:49.440
contact I call that accumulation
of information a buffer.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:53.970
Then they leave, so now you're

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:58.050
information is no longer
attached to a perception.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.430
So if it's gonna be of any use

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.610
to you it has to have enough stuff

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.560
there that you'll be able
to recognize them again.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.440
Then what do you do with that?

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.410
Well if you're me you
toss it on your desk,

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:09.940
you lose it, and you have
to start all over next time.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:13.990
But ideally you go pull
open your filing cabinet,

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.840
or I guess in these days
do something on a computer,

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.390
but let's say pull open
your filing cabinet

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:20.450
take out a manila folder,

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:24.550
put the kids name on the top
of it, put your notes in there.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.669
Then pretty soon from
the registrars office

00:36:26.669 --> 00:36:30.040
comes his grade sheets or so forth

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.620
and if you're good you stick
those in the same file.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.912
And maybe get an email or
two and you print them out.

00:36:35.912 --> 00:36:39.210
So you get a file that accumulates stuff.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.868
The file is what I call detached.

00:36:41.868 --> 00:36:45.140
It's not tied to any particular perception

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.173
or way of finding out about the person.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:52.350
So we have this detached
and attached knowledge.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.619
Attached knowledge you're actually

00:36:53.619 --> 00:36:56.340
perceiving the person or
talking to them on the phone.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.960
You've got some why of knowing about them.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.220
Usually also provide some
way of interacting with them,

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.833
talking to them, startling them,
giving them a book to read.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.420
And then detached, the kid goes off,

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.930
he could be in Burma or New York or Canada

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:13.790
or he could be in the office
next store, you don't know.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:17.330
But you have this file
about the kid right?

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.340
And why is it useful?

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.540
Because he might come in again

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.630
and then you could talk to him,

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.970
recognize him, so forth and so on.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.900
So in dealing with objects in the world,

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.870
most object in the world we have this

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.483
bifurcation between two
ways of dealing with them.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:35.130
When we're actually adding
knowledge to the thing

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:37.660
because we're in some kind
of connection with them.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.280
And then when we've just got the files.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.760
And this translates into the head.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.610
The buffer is a mental operation.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.750
That's why I got my Harry buffer now.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.240
I'm noticing things about you,

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.770
subtle gray tie, very distinguished dress,

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:56.770
thoughtful expression, good
haircut, so forth and so on.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.340
And then tomorrow, the next day,

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.133
I'll still have this
file, Harry Kreisler file,

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.940
and I will be able to use
it to recognize information

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.300
about you and next time I meet you,

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.233
hopefully, although at my
age it's always touch and go,

00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:15.190
they'll be enough in there
that I can recognize you

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:18.030
and recall our experiences together

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.410
and old times and the way we got

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.780
completely wasted last
night and were arrested.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.483
I don't know if you want
you fans to know about that.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.910
Now what's special about self knowledge,

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:34.290
on my theory, within
it's ordinary framework

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:37.670
is that you have a buffer for yourself

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.530
because you do have ways of
finding out about yourself

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.720
that aren't ways about finding
out about anybody else.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.750
Just like looking
straight ahead is a way of

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.010
finding out about the
person in front of you,

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.490
introspecting is a way of
finding out about yourself.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.740
If I wanna find out about
your hands I look that way.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.000
If I wanna find out about
my hands I look this way.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.020
If I wanted to brush lint off your tie

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.550
I would do something that I won't do

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.170
'cause it would probably embarrass you.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:02.290
If I wanna brush lint off
my tie I go like that.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.087
So we have a buffer for ourselves

00:39:05.087 --> 00:39:07.370
and that's what I call a self notion.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:09.570
That's associated with the word "I".

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.300
But we also have a
detached file of ourselves

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.490
because we do, that's
the thing about living

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.560
in this information rich environment

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.770
that language and plus
all technology gives us.

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:24.080
We have all sorts of ways of
finding out about ourselves

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.140
that are really the same ways

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.890
we find out about other people.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:29.790
When I wanted to find out what time

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:31.050
we were gonna meet in the hotel

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.610
I looked down this sheet of paper

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:34.833
and it said, John Perry and Harry Kreisler

00:39:34.833 --> 00:39:36.640
meet at a certain time.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.530
So I find out by reading my name.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.210
The same way anybody else
might find out when we meet.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.718
So we've got these two,
we've got files on ourselves

00:39:45.718 --> 00:39:49.200
and the files consist of
not just stuff that we get

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.857
in the ordinary way we
find out about ourselves,

00:39:50.857 --> 00:39:52.880
the special ways of finding
out about ourselves,

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.030
but also all the stuff we
find out about ourselves

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.100
in the same way that we
find out about other people.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.410
Now what's special is that
in the case of self knowledge

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.910
you never need to divide them.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.740
There's gonna be a different kid

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.890
sitting in front of me
each hour of the day

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.830
till I work through all my advisees.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:11.300
So I have to distinguish between

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.473
the information I'm getting
through my buffer and the file.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.230
I have to detach.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.517
With yourself your buffer is your file.

00:40:20.517 --> 00:40:22.960
Unless maybe your parents
played a trick on you

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.790
and convinced you you were the

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:26.340
reincarnation of Woodrow Wilson

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.680
and then when you got to be 20
you had to kind of make a...

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.900
But mostly, mostly we get it right.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.433
Mostly we know who we are.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:38.300
So our self knowledge is
very special and unique

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.783
but it's not special and unique

00:40:39.783 --> 00:40:43.880
because of some mysteriously cosmically

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.960
perplexing immaterial immortal self.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.590
It's different because of ways that

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.410
once you have a proper theory of knowledge

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.880
you can see are just a special case

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.970
that comes with identity.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.040
So that's how it's supposed to work.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.826
- So back to Mach on the bus.
- Right.

00:41:02.826 --> 00:41:06.010
- That moment of recognition.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.320
Is he seeing the

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.520
the buffer and the file

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.490
simultaneously and saying "Ah!"?

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:16.820
- Well so his case is kind of special.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.020
So he sees the guy at
the end and he gets his,

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.950
as I would say opens up a buffer.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.090
As far as he knows he's
never seen that guy before.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:24.990
And he says, "Huh, there's a guy."

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.550
And he watches him for a while,

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:28.930
I mean maybe just for a few seconds.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.550
But he's accumulating information
about the person he sees.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:34.913
About the person he's got
information about through vision.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.060
And so for a while there
he's got his self notion.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.010
He's picking up knowledge about himself.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.160
If his stomach grumbles he knows that

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.740
in the way one knows ones
own stomach is rumbling.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.750
I mean, if his glasses are dirty

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.250
he knows that in the way we know

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.130
our own glasses are dirty.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.750
And at the same time he's got
another buffer for that guy

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.880
and then all of a sudden
he realizes, right?

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.110
That these are buffers of the same person.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.473
They need to be merged.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.920
Another example of the same thing

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.000
not involving the self, you're talking to

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.970
someone on the phone
and you're looking out

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:16.063
your window and seeing a
woman in a phone booth.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.647
And it turns out the person you're seeing

00:42:19.647 --> 00:42:21.070
and the person you're
talking to are the same.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:23.460
But you might go quite a
while without realizing that.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.103
You've got two buffers,
the person I'm talking to,

00:42:25.103 --> 00:42:27.900
the person I'm seeing, then
you realize they're the same.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.230
Same with Mach except one
of 'em is the self buffer.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.730
The one where he keeps,
where he stores information

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:34.840
that he picks up in those ways

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.650
that we just know about ourselves.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:41.650
- But is he realize, is this
a new piece of information

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.890
to go into his file, that he's

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.280
the rumple person that
he sees in the mirror?

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.040
- Yes, it is a new piece of information

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.230
and that's an interesting viewpoint

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.990
because that gets at...

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.030
One of the aspects of the problem is

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.597
that kind of information,
"A is the same as B",

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.190
is something that
traditional philosophical

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.300
theories of information
have a problem with.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.580
This goes back to the
problem I mentioned earlier,

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.803
that Frega had about identity senses.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.457
If we think of information as,

00:43:17.457 --> 00:43:18.927
"Well what does the world have to

00:43:18.927 --> 00:43:22.390
"be like for this sentence to be true?"

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.947
Or, "What does the world have to be like

00:43:23.947 --> 00:43:25.200
"for this thought to be true?"

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.807
Then a natural way to do it is you say

00:43:26.807 --> 00:43:28.507
"Well what objects are involved

00:43:28.507 --> 00:43:30.540
"and what do they have to be like?"

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.890
So if I think, "Harry has a great tie."

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.181
What does that thought have to,

00:43:35.181 --> 00:43:36.160
what does the world have to be like

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.050
for that thought to be try?

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:38.690
Well this individual right here

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.670
has to have a great tie.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.390
So that's what you learn.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.160
That's the information.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.160
But how about the difference between,

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.460
Harry has a great tie and
that man has a great tie?

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.020
Well at that level of information

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.360
you can't get at the difference

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.270
'cause you are that man and you are Harry.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:59.120
So you have to back up
and adopt a slightly

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.510
different way of looking
at the information

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:03.540
that I call a reflexive theory,

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.280
which readers can get my wonderful book

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.390
Reference and Reflexivity.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.150
Makes a great Christmas gift,

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.603
you know, small, compact
and read all about.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.100
In other words our
ordinary ways of thinking

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.230
it's suffices to just keep track

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.810
of when people are saying the same thing

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.210
and what people think and what they learn.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.900
Just in terms of the object
they are learning about

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.500
and what they learned about 'em.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:28.230
But in a lot of cases that
fascinate philosophers

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.610
and that you need to get straight to make

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.050
the whole theory work smooth,

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.770
that doesn't quite work and you have

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:34.470
to back off a little bit.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:36.360
That was where Frega's problem came from

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.380
and the problem of self knowledge

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.690
is again an example of that.

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.270
Some of the puzzles about self knowledge

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.470
are really just special
cases of this puzzle

00:44:44.446 --> 00:44:46.750
about how do you represent

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:49.000
when you learn "when A is B".

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.890
If A is B there's just one
thing you're learning about

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:54.710
but it seems like there's
two things involved.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:57.100
And you have to kind of
give up the ordinary,

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.130
as I call it the subject matter level

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.520
of analyzing knowledge in order to

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.870
understand what's going on.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.300
- For a number of years you've

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.460
actually had a radio program

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.360
modeled after Car Talk,
called Philosophy Talk.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.180
- Yeah, now we don't like to say

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.203
it's modeled after Car Talk because--

00:45:13.203 --> 00:45:14.898
- That was a joke I heard yesterday.

00:45:14.898 --> 00:45:16.412
(laughter)

00:45:16.412 --> 00:45:17.760
- No I mean it actually was

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.140
but we don't like to say it because

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.117
program directors say, "Oh
another imitator of Car Talk."

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.387
So now our official story is,

00:45:25.387 --> 00:45:28.940
"No it's modeled after Money
Talk with Bob Brinker."

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:32.170
- I see, well that's a better
comparison in these times.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.120
So what are you trying to do there?

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.450
Are you trying to with your partner--

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:39.410
- Ken Taylor.
- Ken Taylor

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:42.480
from the philosophy department
at Stanford, trying to

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.370
show the utility of philosophy

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.550
for everyday life, bring
philosophy to the masses?

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.280
What's your goal and how are you doing it?

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.990
- Well I would say the goal is two fold.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.890
In the first place we think, I've thought,

00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:00.010
Ken thinks for a long time that

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:03.630
a lot of people are naturally,

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.660
have natural philosophical interests

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.483
and they would enjoy philosophy
if they knew about it.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:15.890
But in American culture
it's somewhat under,

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:17.470
it's low profile.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.850
In other words you can
have a lot of people

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:20.250
that go through college
and learn that they

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.880
like literature and spend their lives

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.570
reading book reviews, reading books

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:27.070
and enjoying not being, not necessarily

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.930
academic professors of literature,

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:30.320
but they enjoy literature.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.821
Same should be with philosophy.

00:46:31.821 --> 00:46:33.830
Philosophy is a wonderful enterprise.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:37.100
It's been going on forever and at least

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.310
a certain percentage of the population

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.240
is gonna be intrigued by
it and they outta have

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.600
this appetite sustained by public radio

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.810
in the same way that people that

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.770
like music and literature do.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:48.550
So that's the first thing.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:49.890
The second thing is that we think

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.740
that the standards of discussion

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:55.050
in philosophy where you
don't deal with sound bites

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.360
but we have a whole hour
to discuss a problem.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.050
First we work out a couple of
concepts between ourselves.

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:04.733
Then we have an expert come
in and we have callers.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:07.200
We don't try to be aggressive.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.013
We don't try to score points.

00:47:10.091 --> 00:47:13.040
We just try to understand what's going on.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.060
We think it's a good model of

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.810
civilized communication
that's somewhat lacking

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.090
in the sphere of
communications these days.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:29.110
Even something as good as PBS still...

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:37.490
Usually when people get
to an issue of principal

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.470
or a philosophical issue or
something that comes down

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.530
to some basic disagreement between

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.417
political philosophies they say,

00:47:44.417 --> 00:47:48.007
"Well you know that just kind of depends

00:47:48.007 --> 00:47:49.510
"on your basic political philosophy."

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.890
And move on as if once you get that far

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.460
you really can't discuss
it intelligently, right?

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.190
Abortion, well you know this gets

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:59.380
down to what you think the human soul is.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.833
Yes, well now reporting from Moscow.

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:04.680
But you can discuss that.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.510
That's open to discussion.

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.630
Where did these ideas
about the human soul,

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:10.870
the embryo, where do they come from?

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:11.968
What are the rights and wrongs?

00:48:11.968 --> 00:48:13.870
Maybe we won't find the answer

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:15.170
maybe we won't convince anyone

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:16.830
but they can be rational discussions

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:17.960
like anything else.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.720
- And what do you think
is the resistance to that

00:48:25.104 --> 00:48:28.660
in terms of not being doing more broadly

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:32.377
for example, that is, "Okay
how should we think about

00:48:32.377 --> 00:48:35.400
"thinking about the issues that
are really important to us?"

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.810
- Well I don't have a full diagnosis.

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.130
I know that we've had a lot of trouble

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:40.990
getting on stations
'cause program directors

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:43.929
just can't believe people
are interested in this.

00:48:43.929 --> 00:48:45.060
On the other hand in the places

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.300
where we are on the radio we
get a huge amount of interest.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:52.500
I mean Ken and I, we're
on Oregon public radio.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.500
So Oregon is probably the state in which,

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.610
is most saturated with philosophy talk.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:00.930
Cause they got about 16
different substations and so on.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:02.980
We were in a cab in Portland once

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.417
talking to each other
in the back of the cab

00:49:05.417 --> 00:49:07.097
and the cabbie turned around and he said,

00:49:07.097 --> 00:49:08.817
"Hey you're the car", I mean,

00:49:08.817 --> 00:49:11.004
"you're the philosophy talk guys."

00:49:11.004 --> 00:49:12.597
(laughter)
Get that outta there.

00:49:12.597 --> 00:49:14.110
"You're the philosophy talk guys."

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:17.120
So there is a public for it.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:20.340
We get, people get our podcasts

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.270
and download our program
and listen to our program.

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.430
We always have plenty of callers

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.610
but there's a certain blindness

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:29.030
on the part of the program directors

00:49:30.875 --> 00:49:32.880
and if you look at institutions like

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.360
the NEAH and so forth, philosophy just

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.913
tends to be, in America underrepresented.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.250
You know, I have various theories.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.980
A lot of it, higher education in America

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.610
originally was based on
the normal tools concept

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:50.810
of basically you're teaching,
you're teaching teachers.

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:51.770
You're training teachers.

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:54.430
And the humanities were
basically english and history.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:58.070
Those were, philosophy came lately.

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:01.280
In Europe where universities
grew more out of

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:06.280
these ancient monetarists
and things like that

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:08.930
philosophy's always
been a bigger presence.

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:11.820
- You in your lecture and in some

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.770
of your writings evince a great wit

00:50:17.068 --> 00:50:20.020
and I'm curious what you
think the roots of that are?

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.360
Is it that as a philosopher you sort of

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.900
think in terms of meta concepts

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:31.390
and that a humorists is
once removed from that

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:34.800
or is it just something that
comes outta your background?

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.630
- Well probably both, I mean my family

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:41.900
always liked humor and also, I don't know,

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.330
there's these various
psychoanalytic interpretations

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:45.740
of people that have to be funny.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.550
You know comedians are
usually terribly unhappy

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:50.120
and looking for acceptance.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.340
I suppose that's all part of the mix

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.800
but I do think you're on to something.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.350
I think there is a kind of a connection

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.010
between philosophical thinking,

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.367
looking for unexpected connections and,

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.920
well take George Carlin,
be a great example

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.860
of somebody who steps back
and looks at an ordinary word

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.587
or ordinary usage and is
like, "That's really amazing.

00:51:11.587 --> 00:51:13.310
"We do things like that."

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:16.970
And a lot of philosophy
consists of the same thing.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:21.740
I have probably the thing I
wrote that has been most read

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.240
is not my incredibly profound analyses

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.500
of the human condition
and the nature of the self

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.513
but my article on procrastination.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.310
I suppose what's unusual about that

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.440
is it's more or less a
defense of procrastination.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.240
Maybe it would take a philosopher to

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:39.760
think of defending procrastination.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.370
- And you do it quite well on a website

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:45.580
created, I believe I read
by your granddaughter.

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:48.430
- Right right,
structuredprocrastinaion.com

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:52.640
- And you're a progressive drawing on the

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.580
democratic line in your family history.

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.980
You're a progressive on procrastination.

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.560
- Yes (laughs).
- Why is that?

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.350
- Well I don't really
recommend procrastination

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.730
to those who don't have a
problem with procrastination.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:08.420
What I really recommend
is if you procrastinate

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:13.420
and feel bad about yourself
maybe you're making a mistake.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.810
Take a careful look at it
and see if you aren't really

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:17.020
a structured procrastinator.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.470
That is if you aren't one of these people,

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:22.077
like I think I am, that get
an enormous amount done--

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:24.186
- While you're procrastinating?

00:52:24.186 --> 00:52:25.019
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:52:25.019 --> 00:52:28.350
- But as a way of not doing
something else, right?

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:30.720
Now that's not a perfect way to be.

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.750
That's not the way Aristotle would want

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.640
the perfectly rational animal to behave.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.320
But for most of us it's
a pretty good compromise.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.740
And then if you have, as I do,

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:43.683
good self deceptive skills.
(laughs)

00:52:43.683 --> 00:52:45.670
Then you can convince yourself

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.290
that you've got this
really important project

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:49.960
that really isn't important

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.600
and then you're home free, right?

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.290
Because as a way of not doing something

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:54.360
that really isn't that important

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.530
you could do all sorts of things

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:59.654
that you will get a lot
of credit for doing.

00:52:59.654 --> 00:53:01.610
- And in fact the great enemy here,

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:03.630
you say in your newest second essay

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:06.540
on procrastination, is perfectionism.

00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:11.060
So it's really trying to live up to

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.340
a picture that you see of yourself

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.080
in the mirror when you got on the bus.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.580
Is that?
- Exactly or you didn't see.

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:21.597
You think, "Ah what a shabby guy that is."

00:53:22.677 --> 00:53:25.340
So of course procrastination,
psychologists

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.180
will tell you, has
various types and roots.

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.610
Some are very serious and you should

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:33.070
just go see a shrink
or something like that.

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:34.671
But I think an enormous number

00:53:34.671 --> 00:53:37.440
of us procrastinate is
our closet perfectness.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:40.690
By that I mean we don't every
really do anything perfectly.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:41.780
I've never done anything perfectly

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.390
in my life, never come close.

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:46.390
So it's seems odd to
call me a perfectionists.

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:51.353
But I always plan on doing
things perfectly, right?

00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:54.557
So I get an email from the Dean,

00:53:54.557 --> 00:53:59.000
"Would you write a report on this case."

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.120
Or some student discipline
case or something.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.970
Or I get a publisher asked me to write

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:07.970
a referee report on the book

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:09.127
and my immediate reaction is,

00:54:09.127 --> 00:54:11.690
"Boy I'm gonna write the best
report that's ever been done."

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:13.127
I'm gonna you know...

00:54:13.127 --> 00:54:16.210
And then of course I set the bar so high

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:18.870
that I procrastinate and don't do it.

00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:20.670
So the perfectionism even though

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:23.780
it never results in doing anything perfect

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.160
results in procrastination
which is a way of

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.240
getting to a point where you can

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.890
give yourself permission to
do a less than perfect job.

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:33.930
Now the course, for most tasks

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:37.520
a less than perfect job is fine right?

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.130
If you're writing a publishers report,

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:41.730
referee report on a book,

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:44.310
there's no reason it
should read like Churchill.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.660
There's no reason it should have

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.520
a scholarship of something that's going

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.870
to be in the Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:53.850
It should be an intelligent report.

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:57.030
And so if you're a
perfectionists you kind of

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.946
start out thinking you're
gonna do the perfect thing

00:54:58.946 --> 00:55:01.820
and then by procrastinating
and suddenly realizing

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.090
you've only got two days to do it,

00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:05.900
or it's two days overdue is more likely,

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.320
that's a way of giving yourself permission

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.470
to do what's probably a
completely adequate piece of work.

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:13.307
So that's something I
think the perfectionist

00:55:13.307 --> 00:55:15.340
can get over with a
little self discipline.

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:19.040
But a little self
discipline may be too much.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.623
- One final question
requiring a brief answer.

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.660
Students out there watching this program

00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.360
whatever they've planned for their future,

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.610
how do you think philosophy,

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:31.277
they should integrate philosophy

00:55:31.277 --> 00:55:33.650
into those plans?

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:35.982
Besides watching your program
or listening to your program?

00:55:35.982 --> 00:55:36.828
- Yeah, besides watching to the program

00:55:36.828 --> 00:55:37.661
or listening to the program.

00:55:37.661 --> 00:55:38.494
Well if they're college students

00:55:38.494 --> 00:55:40.010
they should take a intro
to philosophy course

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:42.620
because who knows, it might be something

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.070
that you really enjoy.

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:46.840
And by the time you get to college

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.380
you take an introductory to piano course

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.630
it's probably to late
to really get too much

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:52.980
into the piano, you might
enjoy it, but philosophy.

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.920
The nice thing about philosophy is that

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.520
you can get into these
problems fairly quickly.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.640
You don't need to take preparatory courses

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.143
for years and years.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.580
If you're going into a professional school

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:09.810
like a law or business or even medicine,

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:12.040
philosophy is a very good minor

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.290
or even a major because it helps

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:17.170
you do well on those tests
that you take to get in

00:56:18.366 --> 00:56:19.650
and the skills of the lawyer

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:21.640
and the skills of the
philosopher are very similar.

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.720
Making the true appear the false

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.220
and the false appear the true.

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:32.830
If you really get stung
by the philosophy bug

00:56:35.104 --> 00:56:38.717
and you wanna get a PHD
in philosophy and thereby

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.591
lessen your lifetime earning
prospects considerably.

00:56:44.591 --> 00:56:46.190
(laughs)

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:48.060
There aren't that many jobs but I must say

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:48.930
if you manage to get one of 'em

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:52.823
it's a wonderful profession,
it couldn't be better.

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:57.170
If you're out there and
you're not a college student

00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:59.500
or you were a college student there's just

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.593
a lot of good philosophy books to read.

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:07.530
When I was a kid I read Will
Durant's Story of Philosophy,

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:08.610
I think it's still a great book.

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:11.780
It's a little dated, it's a
long book, a little pretentious.

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.450
But very good, but the
thing is you can just

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:15.780
plunge right into the classics.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:20.060
Read Plato's Republic or
Descartes Meditations.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.630
Go to your local book store

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:23.000
and in the philosophy
section there will be

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.880
some good used paperbacks
by names you remember

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.708
and you'll find that even
if you read 'em in college

00:57:27.708 --> 00:57:30.300
and hated 'em, with wisdom that

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.520
comes from being a little older

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.619
you may find them quite fascinating.

00:57:33.619 --> 00:57:38.380
- And in the Bay area where
is your radio program heard?

00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:41.970
- We come from KALW the
little station that could

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:45.610
in San Francisco, San
Francisco's oldest FM station

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:48.205
but not it's biggest by a long shot.

00:57:48.205 --> 00:57:49.900
- And when are you on?

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.260
- We're on live 10 o'clock Sunday morning.

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.600
We're on repeat at noon Tuesday

00:57:57.630 --> 00:58:00.720
and you can stream our program from

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.470
from the philosophytalk.org website

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:06.560
and if you wanna spend a little money

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.050
and get a podcast you can listen

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.280
to it while you jog or
whatever, you can do that to.

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.150
So there's no excuse for not
listening to Philosophy Talk.

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:17.460
- Well on that note of public education

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.950
professor Perry, thank you
very much for joining us today.

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:22.140
- Well thanks for having me Harry,

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.010
I enjoyed talking to you thoroughly.

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:25.730
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:27.543
for this Conversation With History.

00:58:30.768 --> 00:58:33.851
(peppy techno music)
