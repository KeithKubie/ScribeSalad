00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.750
c is equal to 5.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.470
We know that a squared +
b squared = c squared.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.676
And we know that a is 3 and b is 4,
and now we just have to solve for c.

00:00:11.676 --> 00:00:17.400
3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, and
9 and 16 together is equal to c squared.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.000
9 + 16 is 25,
which again is equal to c squared.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.380
If we want to find just c,
not c squared,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.370
we have to find the square root
of both sides of the equation.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.350
The square root of c squared is c,
and the square root of 25 equals 5.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.594
So, c equals 5.
