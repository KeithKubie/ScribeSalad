00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.630
From movies to theme parks to all sorts of
merchandise, it’s hard to escape Disney

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.380
and when you are a company as big as they
are, you’re bound to have some rumors circling

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.380
around you.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.370
There’s a lot of crazy stories about Disney
that people have believed as truth for a long

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.880
time – but that’s about to end!

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.000
We are debunking some of the biggest false
Disney facts that people believe in our latest

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
list.

Here are 10 False Disney Facts Adults Always
Thought Were True

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.690
The Magic Kingdom's Space Mountain decapitated
a rider

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.170
If you have been to Disney World, you have
probably been on the Space Mountain ride as

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.690
it is as famous and is it fun.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.340
For years a story has been circling about
a panicked guest who stood up during the ride

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.180
and was decapitated by a low hanging metal
bar.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.280
Thankfully, this is merely an urban legend,
most likely created by adults to try to keep

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.969
their kids from standing up.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.000
Even then, the ride has passengers pretty
securely strapped in so it would be very difficult

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.250
for a rider to stand up.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.580
While this is a crazy story that would definitely
add a dangerous allure to the famed ride,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.000
we are happy that no one actually got hurt!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.650
Walt Disney’s Fortune
This is a very strange rumor surround Walt

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.430
Disney’s remaining fortune and although
it has many variations, they all boil down

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.650
to one idea: Walt Disney left a large sum
of money to the first man to become pregnant.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.640
Some people have claimed that the sum would
be 10 million dollars while others have suggested

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.770
that it was the entire Disney estate.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.070
If this sounds too crazy to be true, that’s
probably because it is as Disney's will and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.490
testament has been well documented online
and makes no mention of a prize for a pregnant

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.490
man.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.920
The breakdown of the will indicates that his
enormous fortune is to be divided between

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.410
his family and the charities that Disney funds.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.840
The Little Mermaid
For years, the Internet has been up in arms

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.570
about the wedding scene from The Little Mermaid
as they claim that the minister is sporting

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.100
a visible erection.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.770
This rumor got so out of hand that one woman
even sued Disney due to the emotional trauma

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.540
she incurred from the experience.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.269
All of this commotion is actually just non
sense as if you look carefully, the offensive

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.510
bulge is actually just the minister's knees
protruding through his cloak.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.760
We can understand how this image could cause
some confusion, but it’s not the dirty moment

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.459
that people have been claiming it is.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.160
Just to be safe, Disney re-edited the scene
to cut out the controversial bulge and put

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.560
a stop to all the false rumors.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.760
Cinderella Castle can be dismantled if a hurricane
is approaching

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.079
This rumor is a strange one as it is believed
by many that in the event of a major hurricane,

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.599
the Magic Kingdom's iconic Cinderella Castle
can be quickly broken down and safely stored

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.599
away.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.030
We don’t really know why this story exists
as dismantling the iconic Cinderella Castle

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.060
would be a major operation and could not be
neatly taken down in an emergency.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.049
The castle took 18 months to construct and
is made up of an enormous amount of steel

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.450
and concrete that would definitely not come
down easily.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.730
While it’s nice to think that this castle
would be preserved under any circumstances,

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.499
there is no way it can be quickly disassembled
like an Ikea bookcase.

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.709
Toy Story Characters
One of the best parts of going to the Disney

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.590
parks is getting to see all your favorite
characters in real life.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.599
There is actually a rumor that If you yell
"Andy's coming!" at Toy Story characters at

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.969
Walt Disney World, they will stop what they
are doing and lie flat on the ground (like

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.349
the toys do in the movie).

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.640
Sadly, this was proved to be false and a Disney
spokesperson explained that although it would

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.470
be a fun trick, the idea of seeing these giant
characters flopping around on the ground isn’t

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.010
something the company wants to promote in
their parks.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.889
However, just because it doesn’t happen
all the time, doesn’t mean some Disney employees

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.209
haven’t had a little fun as there is reportedly
some video evidence of these characters acting

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.129
out the “Andy is coming!” moment.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.099
Tinker Bell Based On Marilyn Monroe
Peter Pan is one of the most famous Disney

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.400
movies of all time and the story of the boy
who never grows up has sparked numerous spinoffs

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400
and reboots.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.689
Peter Pant also introduced us to Tinker Bell,
one of the mischievous characters Disney has

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.689
ever created and she also happens to be at
the center of popular fake rumor.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.549
For years it has been believed that the magical
pixie from Peter Pan was modeled after the

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.720
famous actress Marilyn Monroe, but this is
actually completely untrue.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.700
In fact, Tink was actually modeled after Margaret
Kelly, the actress behind the animated character.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.670
Frozen Walt
For years it has been believed by many that

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.200
Walt Disney was cryogenically frozen after
his death, which is a pretty creepy idea.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.890
The popular myth actually states that Walt
Disney was frozen and stashed underneath the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.700
Pirates Of The Caribbean ride inside the Disney
park, but thankfully this is nothing but an

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.750
old wives tale.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.420
The story of frozen Walt has been proven false
as there is thorough documentation showing

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.740
that Walt was cremated just two days after
his death.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.500
This is a very strange rumor and we have to
wonder who started it and why…Disney conspiracy

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.340
perhaps?!

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.620
The Tower of Terror
The Tower of Terror is one of the best rides

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.000
at Disney World, but there has been a rumor
circling the famed attraction that has made

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.590
it even more terrifying.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.590
"Proof" that the Tower of Terror was really
haunted surfaced in a YouTube video allegedly

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.960
showing a ghost on the ride during an after-hours
maintenance check.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.000
Unfortunately, while this was a cool video,
it doesn’t confirm any paranormal activity.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.940
The video looks more like some dust and reflections,
but we can see how people could be tricked

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.940
by this hoax.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.560
We are guessing that this rumor has only made
the ride more popular and we suspect it may

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.600
have even been a clever marketing ploy created
by Disney itself.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.420
Donald Duck
This rumor is definitely one of the most bizarre

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.760
ones that we have ever heard, but unfortunately,
it is totally phony.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.220
A few years ago there was a story circling
around that the famous Disney duck was completely

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.190
banned in Finland due to the fact that he
wears no pants.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.060
While this rumor is nuts, the real story is
even weirder as it turned out to be a fake

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.370
story that was propagated by the media in
an effort to make the Finnish liberal party

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.950
look crazy and over protective.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.830
We understand that politics can be a game
on manipulation sometimes, but please, please

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:59.370
leave Donald Duck and his wacky antics out
of it!

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.860
Lion King
It’s a well known fact that Disney likes

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.080
to slip some adult jokes and messages into
their films but it turns out that audiences

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.800
may have been tricked into thinking something
in the Lion King was much dirtier than it

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.810
actually is.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.300
For years, people have believed that the word
“SEX” appears on screen made up of dust

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.370
floating in the air, but this is actually
false.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.710
The dust does spell out a word, but that word
is actually “SFX”.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.710
Why?

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.950
Well this is actually a sneaky shout out to
the special effects department that worked

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.950
hard on the film.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.470
We can’t blame people for getting this one
wrong, though, as the two words are admittedly

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:36.530
very similar.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.120
So there you have it, there is our rumor busting
list of 10 False Disney Facts Adults Always

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.120
Thought Were True.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.840
We apologize is we busted anyone’s bubbles
here – but the truth must be told!

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.360

you the most?
