in Piazza here moderate India I would

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490
in Piazza here moderate India I would
 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.250
in Piazza here moderate India I would
like to put forward my question to John

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
like to put forward my question to John
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.940
like to put forward my question to John
matter and the major thing is the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
matter and the major thing is the
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.250
matter and the major thing is the
experiment which was conducted the Large

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
experiment which was conducted the Large
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.109

recently and its results are also

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
recently and its results are also
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.310
recently and its results are also
astonishing my question is whether it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
astonishing my question is whether it
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.839
astonishing my question is whether it
would answer some of town answered

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
would answer some of town answered
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.330
would answer some of town answered
questions in astrophysics that is will

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
questions in astrophysics that is will
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.790
questions in astrophysics that is will
it bring back the question regarding Big

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
it bring back the question regarding Big
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.030
it bring back the question regarding Big
Bang field and this is six thank you hi

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
Bang field and this is six thank you hi
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280
Bang field and this is six thank you hi
Roger the biggest questions that

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290
Roger the biggest questions that
 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.780
Roger the biggest questions that
astronomers have that would be touched

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
astronomers have that would be touched
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.479
astronomers have that would be touched
on by the results from the Large Hadron

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
on by the results from the Large Hadron
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.360
on by the results from the Large Hadron
Collider in France those relate to the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
Collider in France those relate to the
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.459
Collider in France those relate to the
fundamental particles that the universe

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
fundamental particles that the universe
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.010
fundamental particles that the universe
is built of and we have tremendous

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
is built of and we have tremendous
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.840
is built of and we have tremendous
mysteries about these when astronomers

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
mysteries about these when astronomers
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.209
mysteries about these when astronomers
want to understand what was the big bang

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
want to understand what was the big bang
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.750
want to understand what was the big bang
like we have to extrapolate from our

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
like we have to extrapolate from our
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790
like we have to extrapolate from our
experiments way back to conditions that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
experiments way back to conditions that
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680
experiments way back to conditions that
were far more extreme than anything we

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
were far more extreme than anything we
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.189
were far more extreme than anything we
can possibly imagine so when we take

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
can possibly imagine so when we take
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.479
can possibly imagine so when we take
what we think are the properties of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
what we think are the properties of
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.310
what we think are the properties of
protons and electrons and the things

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
protons and electrons and the things
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.960
protons and electrons and the things
that they're made out of quarks and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
that they're made out of quarks and
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.880
that they're made out of quarks and
gluons we have to guess what they would

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
gluons we have to guess what they would
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530
gluons we have to guess what they would
be like at the tremendous pressures and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
be like at the tremendous pressures and
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.120
be like at the tremendous pressures and
temperatures that occurred in the early

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
temperatures that occurred in the early
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.940
temperatures that occurred in the early
universe so the closer we can get to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
universe so the closer we can get to
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649
universe so the closer we can get to
actually measuring those the better off

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
actually measuring those the better off
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.960
actually measuring those the better off
we are so that's the biggest question

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
we are so that's the biggest question
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.080
we are so that's the biggest question
that astronomers hope to get at through

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090
that astronomers hope to get at through
 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.160
that astronomers hope to get at through
understanding the Large Hadron Collider

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
understanding the Large Hadron Collider
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530
understanding the Large Hadron Collider
data what were the particles like in the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
data what were the particles like in the
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.869
data what were the particles like in the
Big Bang
