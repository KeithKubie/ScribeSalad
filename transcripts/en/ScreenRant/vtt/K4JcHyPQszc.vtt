10 Dark Facts You Never Knew About Good Star
Wars Characters (“10 dark facts about good

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.490
star wars characters” may work better since
it’s hard to be secret about the leads and

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.490
the canon isn’t that big yet etc)

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.490
We all love our Star Wars heroes.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.070
From standing up against tyranny to being
all around great individuals who inspire the

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.929
best in us, the heroes are often our favourite
characters.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.570
But even the light can sometimes be caught
in a bit of darkness, which can help humanize

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.619
the of this galaxy heroes.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:36.990
Here are Screenrant’s 10 dark facts you
never knew about star wars characters.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.970
Obi Wan Kenobi
Master to Anakin Skywalker and brief mentor

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.140
to Luke, Obi Wan Kenobi is a fan favorite
Jedi who fought as a General during the Clone

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.140
Wars.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.250
But Obi Wan also had some shady things happening
on the side and some questionable ethics in

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.250
play.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.760
Obi Wan has been caught lying multiple times
to Luke Skywalker as well as bending the truth

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.000
and omitting facts from the young Jedi’s
training.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.929
Also, in Episode III, he ventures to Mustafar
with intent to murder his former apprentice

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.960
instead of trying to bring him back to the
light.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.530
Luke trained in a swamp and was able to do
it, a mentor and a friend with decades of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.869
Jedi knowledge should’ve known better than
to go in with intent to kill.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.049
Yoda
One of the most powerful and wisest of the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.850
Force users, Yoda stands as a beacon for overcoming
the odds, no matter how small you are against

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.850
them.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.990
But even the smartest and strongest of us
all and fears and darkness inside of them

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.159
and it’s no surprise to learn that Yoda’s
darkest fear is actually himself.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.660
In the final season of Clone Wars, Yoda searches
for the answers to everlasting life (or how

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.130
to become a force ghost) and faces ever increasing
trials.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.990
One such trial sees him enter a duel with
the manifestation of his inner dark side.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.880
The darkness points out that Yoda spends his
time at war, surrounded by the decadence of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.539
war and thus, the darkness is free to grow
inside of him.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.130
The only way to be rid of the spectral force
was for Yoda to honestly admit that it did

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.209
indeed reside inside himself.

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.600
Talk about inner conflicts!

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.210
Maz Kanata
Fans came to learn of Maz Kanata in the Force

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.410
Awakens, a small orange alien who was in tune
with the Force and in possession of Anakin’s

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.410
old saber.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.130
However, when she’s not dropping Force 101
on young minds, she’s actually a feared

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.350
pirate queen.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:30.110
Offering credits, work, equipment and connections
to smugglers, Maz is heavily involved in the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.810
criminal underworld and will not think twice
about throwing anyone in jail for breaking

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.500
her house rules.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.810
Han Solo
When he’s not shooting down aliens in cantinas

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.150
(sorry George, that happened), Han Solo was
known for his smuggling skills, being a liar

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.980
and the determination to do anything to get
the score done.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.180
One such move was getting revenge on a crime
lord.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.950
In order to pull the heist, Han illegitimately
married Sana Starros to make the ruse convincing.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.880
However, after the job was done, Han stole
her share of the cut and abandoned her!

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.070
Scurffy looking nerf herder indeed.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.090
Luke Skywalker
Hero of the original trilogy, Luke has had

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.730
a fascinating arc from whiney farm boy to
Jedi Master.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.980
But the road proved challenging for Luke as
he often wrestled with the dark side.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.540
In return of the jedi, donning black robes
and a hood, Luke Skywalker straight up Force

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.870
chokes one of Jabba’s guards at the palace.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:36.540
A move commonly associated with the Sith and
other Dark Side users, Luke seems to balance

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.370
both the darkness and light in him, being
illustrated in the film’s climax when his

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.750
black robes come loose as he parts ways with
his father, revealing the white material underneath.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.070
Anakin Skywalker
The chosen one himself, it’s no secret that

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.210
Anakin has had his fair share of dark moments.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.350
From murdering a village of tusken raiders
to you know, killing younglings, Anakin has

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.080
done his fair share before donning the black
suit.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.210
However, Anakin had a prelude to all his darkness
in the Mortis arc on the Clone Wars television

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.210
show.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.790
In this arc, he meets the Father, Son and
Daughter on the planet Mortis and is ultimately

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.590
given a vision of his dark future.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.989
However, Anakin keeps this vision to himself
and does not bring it up to anyone’s attention,

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.430
forever sealing his downfall.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.901
Mace Windu
As one of the most powerful members on the

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:30.650
Jedi Council, Mace Windu is a force to be
reckoned with when it comes to lightsaber

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.650
combat.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.720
Heck, he technically bested Darth Sidious
in a duel.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.340
But Windu has an ace up his sleeve that most
Jedi don’t have: Windu is able to use both

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.979
the light and dark side of the force, hence
his purple saber.

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.749
In the novel “dark disciple”, Windu even
goes to the extreme as to suggest and implement

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.300
the straight up assassination of Count Dooku,
something that goes against the very code

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.199
he’s sworn to protect.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.189
Chewbacca
We all love Chewie, the furry side kick and

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.159
best friend to Han Solo.

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.669
Just don’t get on his bad side.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.300
Chewie, like most wookies are insanely strong
and no problem using violence against anyone

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.509
who gets in their way.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.069
In fact, in the novelization for the Force
awakens and a deleted scene, Chewie rips out

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.889
Unklar Plutt’s arms from his sockets after
the junker confronted Rey and himself in Maz

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.610
Kanata’s castle.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.699
Ezra Bridger
The protagonist of the popular TV show Rebels,

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.909
Ezra has been portrayed as a boy who is slowly
balancing the light side and the dark.

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.069
However, it was the season 3 premiere that
really surprised fans when Ezra mind controlled

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:39.729
the pilot of an AT-DP walker, forcing him
to shoot down his allies before making the

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.409
pilot walk off a platform while still in the
walker in a terrible act of forced suicide.

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.720
It’s a really dark moment for the show and
character and illustrates just how powerful

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:58.050
the Sith Holocrons can be.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.050
Rey
Many fans fell in love with Rey in the Force

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.960
Awakens, the 2015 sequel to the Return of
the Jedi.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.009
The film was the first time a female character
was the lead and she instantly won over legions

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:16.520
of fans for her determination, personality
and adept skills and, well, just about everything.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.610
But even Rey had a moment of darkness unknown
to most fans.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.539
In the canon novelization, Rey temporarily
embraces the dark side during the duel with

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:24.539
Kylo Ren.

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.300
When on his back in the snow, she hears a
voice in her head encouraging her to kill

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.759
the fallen Jedi.

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.770
Those are our picks for Good Star Wars characters
that have had dark moments.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.979
Do you agree with our list?

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.150
Can you think of any good characters, Canon
or Expanded Universe who had their own moments

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.169
of darkness?

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.289
