but I don't want it to drain my battery
 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.180
but I don't want it to drain my battery
so I noticed that after installing all

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190
so I noticed that after installing all
 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.010
so I noticed that after installing all
of the apps today that my battery life

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020
of the apps today that my battery life
 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.659
of the apps today that my battery life
got to twenty-five percent within about

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669
got to twenty-five percent within about
 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.490
got to twenty-five percent within about
four hours of installing them all

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500
four hours of installing them all
 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.280
four hours of installing them all
so that's a bad sign harder to judge

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290
so that's a bad sign harder to judge
 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.170
so that's a bad sign harder to judge
sort of when i install a bunch of things

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180
sort of when i install a bunch of things
 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.870
sort of when i install a bunch of things
at once but definitely an important

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880
at once but definitely an important
 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.950
at once but definitely an important
thing for anything which is going to

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960
thing for anything which is going to
 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.390
thing for anything which is going to
stay installed on my device is that it

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400
stay installed on my device is that it
 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.470
stay installed on my device is that it
keeps fresh but doesn't drain my battery

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480
keeps fresh but doesn't drain my battery
 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.630

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640
so anything is just a multi hard balance
 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.310
so anything is just a multi hard balance
to strike at it is it is a tricky

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320
to strike at it is it is a tricky
 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.690
to strike at it is it is a tricky
balance and that's that's how you get

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700
balance and that's that's how you get
 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.890
balance and that's that's how you get

the start auto cause it shows you a

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310
the start auto cause it shows you a
 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.700
the start auto cause it shows you a
bunch of apps but at first glance it

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710
bunch of apps but at first glance it
 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.730
bunch of apps but at first glance it
feels like it's so sparse so i guess

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:44.740
feels like it's so sparse so i guess
 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.260
feels like it's so sparse so i guess
isn't it yeah it's basically white

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.270
isn't it yeah it's basically white
 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.540
isn't it yeah it's basically white

if that's the layout that if that's the

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:54.850
if that's the layout that if that's the
 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.240
if that's the layout that if that's the
only one layout that you want to do at

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.250
only one layout that you want to do at
 

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.030

least put some margins on the tooth on

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.040
least put some margins on the tooth on
 

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.370

the two sides yeah feels very very

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:02.380
the two sides yeah feels very very
 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.110
the two sides yeah feels very very
crunchy yeah even better you know

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120
crunchy yeah even better you know
 

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.210
crunchy yeah even better you know
obviously is to implement the two pain

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:06.220
obviously is to implement the two pain

obviously is to implement the two pain
version to pick the tubing layout for a

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:08.830
version to pick the tubing layout for a
 

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.710
version to pick the tubing layout for a
bigger tablet screen size that would

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720
bigger tablet screen size that would
 

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.270
bigger tablet screen size that would
seem like a pretty obvious thing to do

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280
seem like a pretty obvious thing to do
 

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.740
seem like a pretty obvious thing to do
for that like this way you are going to

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:13.750
for that like this way you are going to
 

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.210
for that like this way you are going to
be doing a lot of navigation through

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:15.220
be doing a lot of navigation through
 

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.070
be doing a lot of navigation through
lists of categories and then trying to

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080
lists of categories and then trying to
 

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.780
lists of categories and then trying to
read the articles so having the two pain

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:18.790
read the articles so having the two pain
 

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.070
read the articles so having the two pain
layout really going to simplify that

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080
layout really going to simplify that
 

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.540
layout really going to simplify that
navigation ugly so there are different

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:23.550
navigation ugly so there are different
 

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.180
navigation ugly so there are different

right CNN so yeah there you go all right

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:40.180
right CNN so yeah there you go all right
 

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.460

so it's again the same sort of thing

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:41.470
so it's again the same sort of thing
 

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.810
so it's again the same sort of thing
right we've got this massive amount of

right we've got this massive amount of
 

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.540
right we've got this massive amount of
screen and it's just a lot of white with

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:45.550
screen and it's just a lot of white with
 

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.370

a very small amount of text and loot and
 

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.800

new images at all oops let's go back to

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:52.810
new images at all oops let's go back to
 

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.260

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200
particular article it's a one-line
 

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.680
particular article it's a one-line
headline and if you wanna I guess go

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:01.690
headline and if you wanna I guess go
 

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.530

website or the detail icon but it
 

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.830
website or the detail icon but it
doesn't show you anything so a lot

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:10.840
doesn't show you anything so a lot
 

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.140
doesn't show you anything so a lot
immediately obvious what how this app

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.150
immediately obvious what how this app
 

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.610
immediately obvious what how this app
works and what you're trying to do with

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:14.620
works and what you're trying to do with
 

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.320
works and what you're trying to do with
it which is which makes for an

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.330
it which is which makes for an
 

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.080
it which is which makes for an
interesting sort of challenge it

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.090
interesting sort of challenge it
 

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.210
interesting sort of challenge it
definitely isn't optimized for for

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.220
definitely isn't optimized for for
 

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.580
definitely isn't optimized for for
tablet devices if we switch to the to

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:23.590
tablet devices if we switch to the to
 

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.370
tablet devices if we switch to the to
the phone camera you'll see that it's

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:26.380
the phone camera you'll see that it's
 

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.130
the phone camera you'll see that it's
sort of a better layout if it is even if

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.140
sort of a better layout if it is even if
 

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.220
sort of a better layout if it is even if
not perfect sorry if you could die

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:32.230
not perfect sorry if you could die
 

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.260
not perfect sorry if you could die
switches across there and show the folks

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:34.270
switches across there and show the folks
 

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.870
switches across there and show the folks
at home perfect so you can see it's it's

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880
at home perfect so you can see it's it's
 

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.790
at home perfect so you can see it's it's
basically it's exactly the same layout

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800
basically it's exactly the same layout
 

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.010
basically it's exactly the same layout
it's just that that sort of small

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:41.020
it's just that that sort of small
 

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.890
it's just that that sort of small
paragraph of text here fits in a way

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:43.900
paragraph of text here fits in a way
 

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.810
paragraph of text here fits in a way
that's sort of much more easily readable

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:45.820
that's sort of much more easily readable
 

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.390
that's sort of much more easily readable
so it sort of they get they get that

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:48.400
so it sort of they get they get that
 

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.400
so it sort of they get they get that
right but it's clear that the the layout

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:50.410
right but it's clear that the the layout
 

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.510
right but it's clear that the the layout
here has been designed specifically

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:51.520
here has been designed specifically
 

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.510
here has been designed specifically
through a force more natural right if

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:54.520
through a force more natural right if
 

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.790
through a force more natural right if
that's the only one thing that you can

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800
that's the only one thing that you can
 

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.250
that's the only one thing that you can
do as strongly suggest you know maybe

00:09:59.250 --> 00:09:59.260
do as strongly suggest you know maybe
 

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.020
do as strongly suggest you know maybe
be adding like I what like what I said

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:01.030
be adding like I what like what I said
 

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.730
be adding like I what like what I said
before adding some margin to the left

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:02.740
before adding some margin to the left
 

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.040
before adding some margin to the left
and right that'll make it a bit net why

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.050
and right that'll make it a bit net why
 

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.800
and right that'll make it a bit net why
natural absolutely so let's switch back

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:07.810
natural absolutely so let's switch back
 

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.450
natural absolutely so let's switch back
to the to the tablet campus I know the

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:09.460
to the to the tablet campus I know the
 

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.830
to the to the tablet campus I know the
folks at home prefer the the

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:10.840
folks at home prefer the the
 

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.170
folks at home prefer the the
high-resolution one so let's see if we

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.180
high-resolution one so let's see if we
 

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.150
high-resolution one so let's see if we
exit out and go back in do we have any

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160
exit out and go back in do we have any
 

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.580
exit out and go back in do we have any
latency on the first so open straight

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:17.590
latency on the first so open straight
 

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.900
latency on the first so open straight
back up to where we were before hand

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:18.910
back up to where we were before hand
 

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.820
back up to where we were before hand
it's good is nice and you can see down

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:20.830
it's good is nice and you can see down
 

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.830
it's good is nice and you can see down
the bottom here that it's kicked off a

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:22.840
the bottom here that it's kicked off a
 

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.190
the bottom here that it's kicked off a
synchronization which is which is nice

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200
synchronization which is which is nice
 

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.630
synchronization which is which is nice
too early to judge how well it does in

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640
too early to judge how well it does in
 

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.180
too early to judge how well it does in
terms of a battery life overall but

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:30.190
terms of a battery life overall but
 

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.940
terms of a battery life overall but
certainly it gets the no latency

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:31.950
certainly it gets the no latency
 

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.370
certainly it gets the no latency
solution which is good one thing it

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:35.380
solution which is good one thing it
 

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.310
solution which is good one thing it
doesn't do so you did the the initial

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320
doesn't do so you did the the initial
 

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.110
doesn't do so you did the the initial
initial sign in profile so this was for

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120
initial sign in profile so this was for
 

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.040

at a blank screen i'm going to know why
 

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.300
at a blank screen i'm going to know why
why use trying to simulate i'm going to

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:42.310
why use trying to simulate i'm going to

turn the Wi-Fi off and and see how we do

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.290
turn the Wi-Fi off and and see how we do
 

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.050
turn the Wi-Fi off and and see how we do
when we're offline alright see if we can

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:46.060
when we're offline alright see if we can
 

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.290
when we're offline alright see if we can
read this so we can see I can see on the

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:49.300
read this so we can see I can see on the
 

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.210
read this so we can see I can see on the
content mensita headline oh that's nice

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:51.220
content mensita headline oh that's nice
 

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.070

I mean it's it's a new it's an RSS

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:53.080
I mean it's it's a new it's an RSS
 

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.350
I mean it's it's a new it's an RSS
reader so I wouldn't expect it to to

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360
reader so I wouldn't expect it to to
 

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.000
reader so I wouldn't expect it to to
catch the links but it we can at least

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.010
catch the links but it we can at least
 

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.750
catch the links but it we can at least
go through here and read all of the read

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760
go through here and read all of the read
 

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.370
go through here and read all of the read
all of the text doesn't have the images

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:02.380
all of the text doesn't have the images
 

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.960
all of the text doesn't have the images
again that's probably a reasonable

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:03.970
again that's probably a reasonable
 

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.570
again that's probably a reasonable
compromise so we can go through here

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:06.580
compromise so we can go through here
 

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.120
compromise so we can go through here
find out which articles were interested

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.130

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.369
find out which articles were interested
in then we can star them or

00:12:11.369 --> 00:12:11.379
in then we can star them or
 

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:13.979
in then we can star them or
for future yeah for future reference so

00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:13.989
for future yeah for future reference so
 

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:15.150
for future yeah for future reference so
that's that's interesting so if I click

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.160
that's that's interesting so if I click
 

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.119
that's that's interesting so if I click
here it's actually allowing me to select

00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:18.129
here it's actually allowing me to select

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:21.929
the mode for read read list or studies
that's a little bit counterintuitive I

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:21.939
that's a little bit counterintuitive I
 

00:12:21.939 --> 00:12:23.609
that's a little bit counterintuitive I
would expect if I hit the star here for

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:23.619
would expect if I hit the star here for
 

00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:26.249

of Star it or not you know I think it is

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:28.539
of Star it or not you know I think it is
 

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:30.059
of Star it or not you know I think it is
actually so if i actually hit the star

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:30.069
actually so if i actually hit the star
 

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:31.889
actually so if i actually hit the star
it works its if i hit anywhere else on

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:31.899
it works its if i hit anywhere else on
 

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:34.679
it works its if i hit anywhere else on

it feel a little bit more comfortable
within the app and you can see that up

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.110
within the app and you can see that up
 

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.010
within the app and you can see that up
the top here where you've got your icon

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:38.020
the top here where you've got your icon
 

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.020
the top here where you've got your icon
in the action bar it's that kind of

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.340
in the action bar it's that kind of
level of padding where you just want to

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.930
and it makes things just feel a little
bit more comfortable and also suggest

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:48.940

starred items as I've seen this done a
 

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.070
starred items as I've seen this done a
bunch of different ways and most

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:44.080

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.110
list whether start items are at the top
 

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.960
list whether start items are at the top
of that list and then so you'll click

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:48.970
of that list and then so you'll click
 

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:49.950
of that list and then so you'll click
something in the list and it'll

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:49.960
something in the list and it'll
 

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.390
something in the list and it'll
disappear from where it was and move it

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:51.400
disappear from where it was and move it
 

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.410
disappear from where it was and move it
to the top and that drives me crazy

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:52.420
to the top and that drives me crazy
 

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.450
to the top and that drives me crazy
because it really interferes with your

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560
normal workflow what you've done here is
 

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.990
normal workflow what you've done here is
great because I can start all of these

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000
great because I can start all of these

great because I can start all of these
and then they appear here on my start

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:00.280
and then they appear here on my start
 

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.640

you're doing that instance star you get

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:04.150
you're doing that instance star you get

them I can take them off this list and
 

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.679
them I can take them off this list and
they disappear in that makes sense that

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:10.689
they disappear in that makes sense that

it feels out of place compared to the
rest of the app so i think it makes

00:34:59.520 --> 00:34:59.530
rest of the app so i think it makes
 

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.370

them and I don't think that there's
 

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.730
them and I don't think that there's
anything specific in the design

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:29.740
anything specific in the design
 

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.080

out for an up we were looking at I think

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:49.750
out for an up we were looking at I think
 

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:53.070
out for an up we were looking at I think

works like tabs and we tend to suggest

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:55.480
works like tabs and we tend to suggest
 

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.880
works like tabs and we tend to suggest
that in tabs you should either go for

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:56.890
that in tabs you should either go for
 

00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:00.120
that in tabs you should either go for
just images or just text rather than

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.130
just images or just text rather than
 

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.800
just images or just text rather than
both so in this instance I think just

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:01.810
both so in this instance I think just
 

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:05.099
both so in this instance I think just
just images as long as you can provide

00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:05.109
just images as long as you can provide
 

00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:06.510
just images as long as you can provide
