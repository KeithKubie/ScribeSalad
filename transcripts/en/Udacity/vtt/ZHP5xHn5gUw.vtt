00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So Google Search was a very simple multi-sided market--just two sides.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There were users, and there were payers.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But can the canvas actually work

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
with something more complicated, like in the life sciences?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So here's an example of a business model canvas from a life sciences company

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that was going to provide E. coli cell lines for simplified downstream processing.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And they said, "Oh, our customer segment is segmented in niche marketing."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, in hindsight, after the end of the class, they were the ones

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
who actually went in and said, "Well, yeah, that was kind of a definition of what

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500
a customer segment was," but they didn't really describe who.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
And their value proposition, as even they realized later, was pretty unclear.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And their channels, when they said web sales, trade shows, and direct sales,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you know, in hindsight, looked pretty unrealistic.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And for partners, they just said, "Well, you know, when we look at it now,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
it really kind of looks like a random list of hopefuls."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.500
So let's see how they got from something that started over here--

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.500
which you shouldn't laugh because your first canvas might have looked like this--

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.000
and what happened after they got out of the building.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And so now you could see, instead of segmented and niche market only,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.500
they started to understand, "Oh, maybe the market is somebody in something specific

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.000
by a farmer, by a technology, or food"--still kind of vague,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but they're getting a little better, and then they're still a little vague on their feature set,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
gains and pains, and value proposition.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
They're getting a little more refined about partners.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And then, as they went down, they kind of understood.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
"Oh, we understand what a value proposition is; it's not like

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
what our technology is--it's what gain and pain we're providing."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So simplify protein purification, increase yield, increase throughput, decrease cost.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now we're making a lot more sense, and now, if you look at the customer segments--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.500
oh, now they're actually getting down to very specific groups.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.000
Not yet the people in there, but they're now actually going, "Oh, these are the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
people we should be talking to; and our partners are now also getting specific,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and they're getting some very interesting traction

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
on what potential revenue streams work."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And, if we look at their next rev, the things in red are the changes.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So now they're looking at industrial enzyme manufacturers,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
their key activities are R&amp;D, and production support is their next change.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.500
And then, finally, they now kind of verified--"Yep, these look like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
our customer segments; here are our customer relationships.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
More than likely we'll make money from royalties and commercial licensing, etc."

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And so you could see multiple customer segments, multiple value props,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
multiple revenue streams--this is a somewhat complex multi-sided market.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.500
Just by the way, as a note, some of the most complex are actually in the medical device

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500
business where you have users, payers, hospitals,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
insurance companies, and regulators, etc.,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.000
and each one needs a value proposition; each one needs to--you need to understand

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the revenue model, and so some business model canvases can be quite complex.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now what's interesting, by the way, about this life sciences company is

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.500
here's something that you would think, "Who could I call? I'm just a scientist."

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.000
I mean you might be an entrepreneur building an iOS app,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and at least you could ask your friends.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Who do you ask about, you know, E. coli-based purification platforms?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Well, basically, they decided to go through the Rolodex of all the trade shows,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
all the conferences, and all the people they've met in their careers,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and, instead of physically driving out to them, they used Skype,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
they used phone calls, and they started a cold-calling strategy

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
which set a stage for a conversation.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And they had two or three of their team on the call.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So they would send the message to contact, they'd set an appointment,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
they'd send out a short summary electronically,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
they'd have a conversation, and follow up.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And they also used survey tools; they used LinkedIn and Surveymonkey,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but when we were counting how many contacts they made,

00:04:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we didn't actually count them in their progress.
