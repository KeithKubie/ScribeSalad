00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.770
Robert Buchanan was born in Nova Scotia, Canada,
in 1862.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.940
Together with his wife and young daughter,
he moved to New York City in 1886 to practice

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.940
medicine.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.410
By the summer of 1890, he had divorced his
wife and was “becoming acquainted” with

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.500
a relatively wealthy woman 20 years his senior,
who ran a house of prostitution in Newark,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.500
New Jersey.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.880
Within the year, Anna and Buchanan were married.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.320
The two lived on West 11th Street in New York
City, although Buchanan hid the marriage and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.079
represented to the world that she was just
his housekeeper.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.930
The two fought a lot and by the end of 1891,
she threatened to leave him.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.210
During that winter, Buchanan frequently told
friends that “the old hag” was unbearable,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.010
and that he had to “get rid of her no matter
what it cost.”

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.129
Two years earlier, a medical student, Carlyle
Harris, had been convicted of killing his

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.000
wife with morphine when it was shown that
she had the telltale “pinpointing of the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.100
pupils” that occurs with a morphine overdose.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.300
During February 1892, Buchanan discussed this
case with many acquaintances and frequently

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.410
referred to Harris as a “stupid amateur”
and “bungling fool,” as well as that he

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.400
(Buchanan) knew how to eliminate the tiny
pupils when taking (or giving) morphine.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.480
The day before Anna’s death, Buchanan began
laying his cover story.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.040
He told his friend that she was very sick,
and that he thought she might not survive

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.000
(other eyewitnesses countered this claim and
noted she was quite well).

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.300
On the fateful day, after eating a hearty
breakfast alone (Buchanan always ate at his

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.390
friend’s restaurant), Anna suddenly had
such severe pains in her head that she was

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.530
unable to stand.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.770
A physician, Dr. McIntyre, arrived shortly
after, but upon examination, opined that she

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.340
was suffering from hysteria and prescribed
one teaspoonful of a bromide of sodium every

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.340
two hours.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.600
When he returned at 2 p.m. her symptoms were
worse, so he added two drachms of chloral

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.220
hydrate to the teaspoon she was to take.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.240
Just after 3 p.m., one of Anna’s friends,
Mrs. Brockway, visited and saw Buchanan giving

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.060
Anna two teaspoons of something – a difference
he explained as due to the fact that his spoon

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.360
was smaller than the standard size (a fact
disproven in court).

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.530
After taking the two teaspoons from Buchanan,
she immediately grimaced and then sucked on

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.180
an orange, as if to get rid of a bitter taste.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.540
Within 15 minutes, she fell into a deep sleep
from which she never awoke.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.860
At another point during the day, a nurse noticed
Buchanan bent over Anna, apparently dropping

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.129
something in her eyes.

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.130
When Dr. McIntyre returned that evening with
another physician, they noted the now comatose

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.489
Anna had slow respiration, a rapid pulse,
flushed face, hot and dry skin, and normal

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.209
pupils (the right was slightly dilated).

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.530
Dr. McIntyre and the other physician both
concluded that she had a stroke.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.819
She died the next day.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.680
Right away, Buchanan’s mood improved.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.780
On the day of her death, he told a friend
that “Providence was smiling upon him,”

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.500
and immediately after the funeral, he went
on a pub crawl with his buddies.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.489
Throughout his carousing, Buchanan discussed
how much he had inherited from his wife (by

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.319
all accounts $50,000, or about $1.2 million
today).

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.099
After a few days, Buchanan went back to Nova
Scotia where he quickly (within 3 weeks of

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.620
his wife’s death) remarried his first wife.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.239
Returning to New York, Buchanan discovered
that Ike White, a reporter, had been looking

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.069
into the details of Anna’s death.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.219
After digging up most of the dirt in the case,
Ike was able to heckle the authorities into

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.510
literally digging up Anna and conducting an
autopsy.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.370
“Wonderfully well preserved,” Anna’s
body held evidence of sufficiently large amounts

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.849
of morphine to have done the deed, as well
as evidence of atropine – a drug of the

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.170
belladonna family that dilates pupils and
increases heart rates.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.189
The autopsy also revealed that she had not
suffered a stroke or had any disease that

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:24.459
would account for her death.

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.269
At trial, Buchanan strongly challenged the
prosecution’s scientific evidence, arguing

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.420
that ptomaine, a product of putrefaction,
could be mistaken for morphine and atropine

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.739
in chemical tests.

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.189
To counter this evidence, the prosecution,
through one of its expert witnesses, put on

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.189
its appalling demonstration.

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:43.190
A cat was brought into the courtroom and injected
with a lethal dose of morphine.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.579
As the jury, judge, lawyers and spectators
watched, the cat’s pupils constricted, then

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.870
once drops of atropine were applied, dilated.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.269
The cat, of course, died.

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.189
Nonetheless, the defense was vigorous, and
since the evidence was only circumstantial,

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.980
many court watchers thought Buchanan might
even be acquitted – until he decided to

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.359
take the stand.

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.879
Self-obsessed and whiny, the prosecution trapped
Buchanan in lie after contradiction after

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.359
lie until no one was left with any doubt as
to his guilt.

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:25.890
Dr. Robert Buchanan was executed in the electric
chair in New York’s Sing Sing on July 2,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:34.160
1895.
