00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.580
A problem worthy of attack proves its
worth by fighting back.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.210
And that's what Fermat's last theorem was
doing, it was fighting back.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.600
So we are talking about Fermat's last theorem I
suppose the place to start is with Fermat,

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:14.789
Pierre de Fermat,

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.469
he was a 17th-century
mathematician living and working in

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:20.739
France - not working as a mathematician

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.469
but working as a judge. Every evening he'd go
home - and math was his hobby -

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:27.618
one evening he was looking at an
equation

00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:31.589
which looks a bit like Pythagoras'
equation which I suppose is

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.549
X squared plus Y squared equals Z
squared.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.479
And he was looking for whole number
solutions to that equation, and there are

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.640
lots, you know there's 3 squared plus

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.679
4 squared, 5 squared. So that's a
whole number solution to

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.759
&lt;b&gt;x^2 + y^2 = z^2&lt;/b&gt;.
Now Fermat asked himself the question:

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:52.049
"What if I change this equation so
instead of it being x squared,

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.799
what about if it's x cubed or x to
the fourth power? 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.519
Are there solutions to that equation? So
in general we're talking about

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.150
&lt;b&gt;x^n + y^n = z^n&lt;/b&gt;

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.719
&lt;b&gt;x^n + y^n = z^n&lt;/b&gt;

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:08.929
where &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt; is bigger than 2. Does that
equation

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.280
have any whole number solution?" He
thought about it for a while

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.140
and couldn't find any whole number
solutions, and then he went one step

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.728
further:

00:01:15.728 --> 00:01:18.899
not only could he not find any whole
number solutions,

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.608
he believed he found an argument, he
beleived he found a proof

00:01:22.608 --> 00:01:25.879
that showed without any doubt
whatsoever

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:29.089
there were no whole number solutions. So
this is kinda weird,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.859
because we have one equation
&lt;b&gt;x^2 + y^2 = z^2&lt;/b&gt;

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:36.318
that has not just one solution, it
actually has an infinite number

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.179
of solutions.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.039
And then we have an infinite number of
equations: &lt;b&gt;x^3 + y^3 = z^3&lt;/b&gt;,

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.118
&lt;b&gt;x^4 + y^4 = z^4&lt;/b&gt;,

00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:48.670
an infinite number of equations which
apparently have no solutions.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.920
And Fermat discovered it's proof, and he
wrote

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.310
in the margin of a book he was reading
that evening, called the Arithmetica by Diophantus,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.969
he wrote in the margin in his book, he
wrote: &lt;i&gt;I have a truly marvelous proof

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:04.349
which this margin is too narrow to
contain.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.159
&lt;i&gt;Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet&lt;/i&gt;
in Latin.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.770
In other words: "I know how to prove that
this equation has no solutions,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.719
but I don't have the space to write it
down." And then he drops dead.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:21.199
It very much was a secret proof which he
never wrote down,

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:25.219
and after his death his son, Samuel ClÃ©mant

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:30.229
I think, rediscovered this book which had
this marginal note:

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:34.979
&lt;i&gt;I have a truly marvelous proof -
demonstrationem mirabilem - 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.840
which these margins are too narrow to
contain.&lt;/i&gt; In fact the book is full of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.479
these little annoying notes: "I can prove
this but I gotta go to feed the cat, I can prove

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.859
this but I gotta go and wash my hair."

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.189
So Fermat was quite annoying in this
respect.

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:50.799
So his son published a new version of the
book

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.620
- the Arithmetica by Diophantus - 
the book with all of Fermat's little

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.310
notes printed in the text. And people
would look at these notes,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.370
and they were: "Fermat
said he can prove this, let's try!"

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.379
And one by one people rediscovered the
missing proofs.

00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:10.889
And every case where Fermat said
"I have a proof", he was right, there was a

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:11.539
proof,

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.639
except in this one example here.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.768
Fermat's last theorem is called Fermat's
last theorem because it was the last one that

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.140
anybody could actually find the proof for.
And of course because it's the last one that

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.218
anyone can prove

00:03:24.218 --> 00:03:27.348
it's the most precious one, it's the one
that's the most desirable.

00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:31.389
And the more that people try, the more
they fail, the more wonderful it becomes.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.318
And this goes on for decades, it goes
on for centuries.

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:38.729
Right through to the 20th century were
people desperate

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.828
to rediscover what Fermat's proof might
have been.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.390
[Brady]Is that they have widely-held that he
had done it or had he disclaimed, like

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.627
was he telling the truth? [Singh]I think by the
time we get to 20th century it's quite clear

00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:50.628
 

00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:54.000
that this is an incredibly
complex problem. Its

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.229
simple to jot down in a few scribbles
what the question is, it's easy to

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:59.378
describe the problem.

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:02.518
The proof is clearly profound

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.908
and probably beyond Fermat's reach to
be honest.

00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:11.280
Some people say Fermat was just fooling
around, that it was just a trick,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.640
that he left something in his book that he knew 
would trouble subsequent generations -

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.968
I think that's the least likely.

00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:19.170
Some people say that he did have a
genuine proof

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.550
and it's beautiful, it's elegant and it's
17th century,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.970
and we could kinda rediscover that
proof but we're just not quite clever enough.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.199
I think that's possible but unlikely.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.520
I think the most likely explanation is Fermat

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.689
thought he had a proof. Because he was working
on his own

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.759
and because he didn't show this proof to
anybody else

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.699
nobody could tell him: "Ow, there is a mistake
there, that line 3

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.600
has got something wrong with it." And
that's very likely because we know that

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.550
subsequent generations of mathematicians

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.090
thought they'd found a proof and then
they publish it and people would tear

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:55.429
it apart and find the error.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.709
So what we're looking for is not Fermat's
proof - 

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:03.409
which was probably flawed - but we're
looking for some kind of proof to see

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.411
 

00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:07.669
wheter Fermat was right all along?
It has a happy ending.

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:11.189
And it starts with a ten-year-old child,

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:15.209
a child called Andrew Wiles, who was reading a
book one day -

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:19.388
he's growing up in Cambridge, he wents to
the library, he got a book called &lt;i&gt;The last

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.590
problem&lt;/i&gt; by E.T. Bell.

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:25.750
And the book is all about
Fermat's last theorem.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.060
And little Andrew Wiles, age 10,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.819
decided that he was going to rediscover the
missing proof.

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.460
Because a bright ten-year-old can
understand the problem. A bright ten-year-old

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:38.519
doesn't realize what they're letting
themselves in for, 

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:41.769
but that's another story. And he
tried, he talked about, to the

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:43.560
school teachers about the problem,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.500
he talked to his A-level teachers about the
problem, he goes to university talked to his

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.620
undergraduate lecturers about the problem.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.168
He has a PhD and still this problem is
obsessing him.

00:05:54.168 --> 00:05:58.689
I think he was about in his late 30's by
this time he was a Princeton professor -

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.699
there was something called the
Taniyama-Shimura conjecture which

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.280
I kinda think we don't really
want to get into at the moment -

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:09.859
which had been proposed in the 50's. So a 
conjecture is an idea that

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.379
we don't know whether it's true or not,
but somebody is putting it on the table. Somebody

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.229
proved that there was a link between
these two conjectures.

00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:20.560
It is much as: if you could prove most of
the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.519
you would get Fermat's last theorem for free.
So somehow Fermat's last theorem is embedded in

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.128
this other conjecture.

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:32.270
And Andrew Wiles' childhood passion, his
childhood obsession is reignited

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:36.128
because he thinks the Taniyama-Shimura
conjecture is worth a go.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.379
You know he thinks he can get his teeth
into that. But it's still

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.729
a crazy thing to try and do and so
because it was such an absurd and

00:06:43.728 --> 00:06:43.729
 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.319
ambitious challenge, Wiles didn't tell anybody
about it.

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.729
He worked on in complete secrecy,

00:06:51.728 --> 00:06:56.378
he started not attending committee
meetings, he started going to his office

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:58.509
less and less, he started to

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:01.960
focus on this problem. Once again:

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:05.459
not because it was the Taniyama-Shimura
conjecture but because it would give him

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:08.198
Fermat's last theorem for free.

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:11.590
And for 7 years he worked in complete
secrecy

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:16.049
and at the end of 7 years he
suddenly realized

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.348
that he had Taniyama-Shimura and
if he had Taniyama-Shimura,

00:07:20.348 --> 00:07:25.009
he had a proof of Fermat's last theorem. He went
to Cambridge, he presented his proof on a

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:25.970
black board,

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.319
it was a three-part lecture, the world
cheered, he was the front page of the

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.560
 New York Times, he was

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.839
on CNN he was everywhere. But the
sting in the tale

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:39.060
is that in any mathematical proof you
have to have it checked.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.537
You have to have it refereed and published, and
when he went through the checking process

00:07:43.537 --> 00:07:43.538
 

00:07:43.538 --> 00:07:46.628
somebody found a mistake. Wiles assumed
that he could fix it,

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:51.250
but the more he tried to unravel this
problem the worse it became.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.430
And it became a huge embarrassment, you know
you've been loathed(?) as the greatest

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.800
mathematician of the 20th century,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.228
you are a hero figure and now you have to
admit you made a mistake.

00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:05.219
And it took a whole year, but at the end
of that year

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.220
Andrew Wiles working with a chap(?)
called Richard Taylor

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.139
managed to fix the proof. I think
it's a bit like 

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:15.449
the Terminator film, I often talk about,
you know when you just think you've

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:19.509
slained the monster when you've killed
the Terminator it comes back to life and

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:23.650
you have to fight in one last time.
And somebody, one mathematician I think

00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:24.739
Pete Hines

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.879
once wrote: &lt;i&gt;"A problem worthy of attack

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:32.240
proves its worth by fighting back."&lt;/i&gt; And
that's what Fermat's last theorem was doing,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.799
it was fighting back,

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.598
but Wiles proved that he was too good. And of
course what Wiles proved

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:40.820
is that Fermat was right, this equation

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.740
&lt;b&gt;x^n + y^n = z^n&lt;b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt; bigger than 2,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.879
has no whole number solutions and that's
the end of the story.

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:51.789
[Brady]If you'd like to see a bit more from
this interview with Simon, I've got some

00:08:51.789 --> 00:08:52.849
extra footage,

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.870
I'll put a link in the description. Simon's
also got a book about Fermat's last

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.990
theorem, that's excellent, I recommend that,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.139
links below, and just this week he's got
a new book out -

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:06.819
funny about that - it's all about
mathematics in the Simpsons and I think

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.390
anyone who likes Numberphile is gonna
love this one.

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:12.519
I'll put a link below, but he's also done an
interview with me

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.600
about Fermat's last theorem in the
Simpsons,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.440
which I think you'll all enjoy and I'll put
that on to Numberphile really soon.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.279
But in the meantime, lots of links below
I'll put a link to the Wiles paper,

00:09:24.278 --> 00:09:27.379
a few other bits and pieces that I want
you to see, 

00:09:27.379 --> 00:09:27.950
so have a good look.
