00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.739
I guess T Rump has decided
to become a man of his word

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.441
at the worst possible time
this week.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.142
I just thought he was saying
all that (bleep)

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:10.344
when he was trying
to get elected.

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.845
Then he was gonna be like,
"Ah, (bleep) it.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.247
I'm just gonna coast
for four years."

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.916
I didn't know he was gonna go
into (bleep) turbo mode.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.086
-(laughter) -So he made good on
his insane plan to ban Muslims

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.122
from entering the United States,
and literally everyone hates it.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.824
Why, just look at this tweet
from 2015.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.492
"Calls to ban Muslims

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.295
from entering the U.S. are
offensive and unconstitutional."

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.197
Oh, I wonder
if Trump's gonna come across

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.433
this libtard named, uh...
Mike Pence.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.402
-Whatever.
-(laughter)

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.272
-Americans... Yeah.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.642
Doesn't even sound
like a real name.

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:44.678
Americans came out
by the thousands

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.346
to protest at airports
sending a message

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.649
that no ban will be tolerated,
and also, yes,

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.985
-travel can get worse. Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.888
But nice job, everyone,
for rallying peacefully.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:57.824
Even New York City cab drivers
joined in, showing solidarity

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:00.928
by refusing to take fares
to JFK during the protest.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.763
Now it may pose
a temporary inconvenience,

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.398
but let me ask you something.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.301
If you saw a scene in the movie
where a bunch of cab drivers

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.771
who normally don't give
any (bleep) about anything,

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.774
and you just saw, like,
all of their off-duty lights

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.276
flick on one-by-one
in protest in the city,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.713
-you would bawl
your (bleep) eyes out. -â™ª

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.949
-Watch this.
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:26.220
Come on!
Oh, my God.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:28.188
Yes!

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:30.657
I'm telling you, you know,
you'd be at home alone,

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:32.092
and you'd be on a plane where...

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.694
I don't know why
I cry on planes as lot

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.128
for some reason
when I'm watching movies.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:36.463
But like, we're like,

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.398
"There's still love
in this world!"

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.767
-Like, you would be so touched.
-(laughter)

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.570
The ban is so bad,
even thousand-year-old

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.173
robo villain Dick Cheney came
out against it. Take a look.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.741
-(laughter) "Dick Cheney Thinks
Trump's Muslim Ban is

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.277
'Against Everything
We Stand for.'"

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.813
Guys, people got mad at Uber
for breaking the taxi strike,

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.748
started the hashtag
#DeleteUber.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:55.949
And look. We actually found

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:57.584
that Dick Cheney joined
into that, too.

00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:00.821
-Uh, here's...
-(laughter and groaning)

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.823
You can see up there.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.526
It says, uh, "Do you want
to uninstall?"

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:09.096
(applause and cheering)

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.598
I do imagine that's like what
Steve Bannon's dick looks like.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.701
-I know.
-(laughter and groaning)

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:17.004
That would make sense.
He is cold-blooded.

00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:19.439
However, other apps
did take action

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.275
to show their opposition
to the Muslim ban

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.143
with Lyft pledging
to give a million dollars

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:25.279
-over four years to the ACLU,
Airbnb... -ARDEN MYRIN: Yes.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.882
-Yes, absolutely.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:33.687
Airbnb offering
to house refugees,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.156
and Apple Maps pledging
to get Steve Bannon lost.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.558
-Um...
-(laughter)

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.661
Comedians, how should other apps
make a political statement?

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:43.964
-Moshe Kasher. -Oh, actually
inspired by Airbnb.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.532
Grindr's offering free holes

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.234
for refugees
to stick their dicks into.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.602
-(laughter) -Yeah.
-HARDWICK: Okay. Oh, that's...

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.304
-Wow. -Yeah. It's really cool.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.039
It's really...

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:54.608
-Yeah.
-Uh, on Tinder,

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.910
it is now positive
to swipe left,

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:59.613
but if you swipe right,
you can only date your daughter.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:01.381
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Okay. Points.

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:04.284
Points. Very layered.
Arden Myrin.

00:03:04.318 --> 00:03:06.353
No matter
what address you put in,

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:09.122
Waze is gonna give you
the fastest route to Canada.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:11.325
-(laughter) -HARDWICK:
All right. Yeah, points. -Yeah.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.127
-Points.
-(applause and cheering)

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.599
You know, is the, uh...

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:21.034
I think we're all touched
by immigration in some way.

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:25.138
I think if anyone had wanted to
institute a ban on immigrants,

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:27.941
it should have been the
Native Americans in the 1600s.

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.943
(applause and cheering)

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:33.046
I mean, if we're really
being granular about it.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.148
My mother's grandparents
came here from Italy.

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:37.351
They were not turned away.
They were welcomed.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.653
I'm here, we are all touched
by immigration some way.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:41.688
So I hope
that we find compassion,

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.857
and they we don't just go
on a crazy witch hunt

00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:43.957
that isn't gonna work anyway!
