00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:09.340
why do I always feel like somebody’s WATCHING
MEEEEEEE esp my boss

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.130
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.450
In January 2015, Science magazine declared
“the end of Privacy”.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
From medical records, to location tracking
apps, to your shopping history, your online

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.230
life is no longer just your business.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.780
In fact, it can become your employer's business
too, according to a recent ruling from the

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.760
The European Court of Human Rights.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.909
They declared a firm was well within their
rights to take a peek at an employee’s Yahoo

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.659
Messenger chats that he sent during work hours.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.120
Apparently the firm banned all employees from
using the internet for sending personal messages

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.199
during work hours.

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.949
The company suspected that one employee was
talking about work related matters to people

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.960
outside the company, so they read his messages
and fired him.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.589
And the court ruled they had every right to
do that.

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.659
In response multiple groups across Europe
issued warnings to bosses, saying things like

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.379
"staff who are being snooped on are less productive
and less healthy".

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.429
Which is true.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.000
Increased monitoring and supervision stresses
employees out, according to a study published

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.390
in the International Journal of Human–Computer
Interaction.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.950
So you probably shouldn’t be watching this
video at work.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.600
Because odds are, they’re watching you.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.869
According to a 2007 survey by the American
Management Association and the ePolicy Institute

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.009
two thirds of employers monitor internet connections
and use software to block connections to inappropriate

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.009
websites.

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.340
And 43 percent of employers read workers'
e-mail and even fire people over it.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.470
And it’s perfectly legal in Europe and even
here in the U.S. too.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.549
Though legislation is spotty and is mostly
on a state-by-state basis.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.060
Basically if your employer tells you ahead
of time that your activity will be monitored

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090
on work equipment, they can do it.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.479
In 2010 the Supreme court ruled that’s especially
true for government employees.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.229
But the judges left wiggle room because they
knew technology is changing.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.409
So a future decision might finally decide
the right to privacy at work.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.720
So now that we know it’s legal and common,
how are we being tracked on the internet?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.350
Well your employer probably uses software
and hardware to scan for intruders.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.940
But as much as it looks for threats outside
the company, it looks internally too.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.640
It can scan your data for clues of bad behavior.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.850
Like looking for certain keywords when you
search for things online or reading your outgoing

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.730
email for any company secrets.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.250
But privacy is part of a broader issue of
how we’re tracked online even in our own

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.250
home.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.660
Many sites use cookies, which are text files
websites put on your computer.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.300
And this is actually for your benefit.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.440
Basically they tell the website if you’ve
been there before, what links you might have

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.690
clicked on, that sort of thing.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.800
It helps personalize the website experience
to you.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.180
Like if you’re on a news website reading
about the Oscars, it can show you related

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.420
stories about the golden globes.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.140
So it’s not all bad.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.420
But sometimes it can get a little creepy.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.990
Search engines knows a ton about you.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.920
If you have certain settings turned on, they
can track your location on your smartphone

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.270
and even know every voice command you’ve
said.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.850
Search engines give the information they learn
to advertisers.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.680
See, creepy.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.180
But this results in us being able to use social
networking sites for free.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.670
That’s the tradeoff.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.770
And I won’t even get into what the government
knows about you.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.990
That’s opening a whole other can of worms.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.990
‘Sup NSA!

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.480
But really privacy in the tech driven age
is becoming seen as more of a luxury good,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.090
even though one study published in the journal
Science found that evidence suggests that

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.030
privacy is a universal human need.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.360
And studies show overwhelmingly that people
want more internet privacy.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.230
So while the Supreme Court kicks the can down
the road on the matter of privacy in the workplace,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.480
check your privacy settings in the meantime.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.000
With all the internet knows about you, could
you ever disappear online?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.710
In this digital age, should you have the right
to be forgotten?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:54.460
Testtube News takes a closer look 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:10.150

this episode,
