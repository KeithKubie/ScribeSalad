Well, let's see,
the hill rises by 50 feet and

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.920
goes horizontally by 15 feet, great.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.900
Of course, we could simplify this
because they share a common factor.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.940
Common factor of 5, in fact.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.694
So we could have written this is 10/3.
