00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.920
Ever hear somebody say, “Whiskey makes you
frisky?”

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.569
“Gin makes you sin.”

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.180
“Wine makes you divine.”

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.110
“Tequila makes you fight everybody.”

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.190
Do different liquors really have different
effects?

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.849
Hello!

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.140
Julian here for DNews from YouTube Space LA.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.140
It’s one of those longstanding “facts”
everyone knows about alcohol: different liquors

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.580
make you act differently.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.820
Give someone a gin and tonic and you’re
in for a long night of red-faced tear-fueled

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.820
soul searching.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.090
Give that same person tequila and they’re
Macho Man Randy Savage, oh yeah!

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.430
But is it… y’know… true?

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.270
Does one liquor have that special something
in it that turns on rage mode that others

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.270
lack?

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.040
According to science, drumroll please….

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.040
No.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.040
Nope.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.100
There’s no reason vodka or gin or tequila
or whiskey or wine or beer or absynth should

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.390
make you behave differently provided you’re
drinking the same amount of alcohol.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.350
Alcohol and liquor are often used synonymously
but alcohol is just a molecule in liquors

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.730
and it doesn’t change from one booze to
the next.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.690
They all use yeast in the fermentation process,
and once the yeast process sugar for energy,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.120
their waste product is that familiar maker
of nights and ruiner of mornings: ethanol.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.240
Yes, alcohol is the same compound added to
gasoline to make it more explosive.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.900
Just a reminder that the same chemicals or
molecules can have multiple applications.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.800
*cough* anti-vaxxers *cough*

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.370
But clearly different liquors taste differently,
do any of those flavors affect behavior?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.260
There’s no scientific data to back that
up.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.230
Darker liquors have more congeners in them
that make hangovers worse, but there’s nothing

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.030
that points to them affecting the pre-hangover
stage.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.520
In fact a study from 1970 monitored 8 men.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.010
4 of them drank bourbon for 9 days and then
switched to vodka for another 9, while the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.440
other 4 started on a 86 proof liquor that
was mixed with caramel and then switched to

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.440
bourbon.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.190
Regardless of the liquor or congeners added,
they all behaved the same; starting off more

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.890
sociable, and then becoming more depressed
and hostile as they continued to drink.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.320
But then how do you explain all these anecdotes
of people who say, “Oh I can’t have whiskey,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.060
last time I had whiskey I robbed a zoo?”

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.020
It’s probably all in your head.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.530
People on alcohol are suggestible.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.440
In fact, they’re even suggestible when they
just think they’ve been drinking.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.440
A 2003 study gave some participants vodka
and others flat tonic water labeled as vodka,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.810
and both of them were just as easily mislead
when asked to remember an event.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.060
And yes, there was a control who were told
they drank flat tonic water.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.680
They did much better on the test.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.290
So really the effect liquor has on you is
linked to its reputation or situation: tequila

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.980
is claimed to make people rowdy, so when people
drink it they’re probably looking to get

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.630
rowdy and then they, unsurprisingly, get rowdy.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.510
Champagne is often drunk at festive occasions,
so it’s more likely to put people in a bubbly

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.510
mood.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.060
Likewise if you’re in a bad mood and you
start drinking any liquor, you’re gonna

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.280
have a bad time.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.571
It could be linked to past experiences too;
if you had a great night and happened to be

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:43.330
drinking vodka, you’ll likely opt for vodka
as your booze of choice.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.440
Familiarity with the drink is important too,
in a 1997 study one group of people were given

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.990
beer, another group was given a blue peppermint
concoction with the same alcohol content as

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.880
beer, and people on the peppermint reported
themselves as drunker while performing worse

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.770
on cognitive and motor tasks.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.569
It’s really just a placebo effect, or more
accurately, a nocebo effect, which is like

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.460
a placebo effect, but with a negative spin
to it.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.790
So if you’ve been blaming one liquor or
another for bad decisions or bad behavior,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.890
it’s not the alcohol’s fault, it’s just
you.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.520
So different alcohols don’t actually make
you different kinds of drunk, but they definitely

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.540
affect where you fall on the hungover spectrum.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.540
Anthony explains why down here.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.140
Check the description if you’re on your
mobile.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.530
Alcohol is a big, huge, multi-sided topic
and there are likely many myths you’re curious

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.530
about.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.601
If you want us to cover one, let us know in
the comments.

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:32.680
And a friendly reminder: if you choose to
drink, be safe and smart about it.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.030
I’ll see you next time on DNews.
