my name is Mei my question is how big is

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480
my name is Mei my question is how big is

hi Mei so you asked how big a space how

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189
hi Mei so you asked how big a space how
 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.680
hi Mei so you asked how big a space how
big is the universe well we don't truly

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690
big is the universe well we don't truly
 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.180
big is the universe well we don't truly
know what we know is that the space that

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190
know what we know is that the space that
 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.040
know what we know is that the space that
we can observe which is really the only

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050
we can observe which is really the only
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.750
we can observe which is really the only
thing we can sensibly talk about is

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760
thing we can sensibly talk about is
 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.980
thing we can sensibly talk about is
about thirteen point five billion

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
about thirteen point five billion
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.110
about thirteen point five billion
light-years in size and and that radius

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
light-years in size and and that radius
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.990
light-years in size and and that radius
that size of the universe is getting

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000
that size of the universe is getting
 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.520
that size of the universe is getting
bigger and bigger every day and that's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
bigger and bigger every day and that's
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.529
bigger and bigger every day and that's
consistent that's based on our

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
consistent that's based on our
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.040
consistent that's based on our
understanding that the universe started

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
understanding that the universe started
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.500
understanding that the universe started
out in the very small region that has

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
out in the very small region that has
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.139
out in the very small region that has
been expanding initially very rapidly

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
been expanding initially very rapidly
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.500
been expanding initially very rapidly
and steadily now for billions of years

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
and steadily now for billions of years
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.380
and steadily now for billions of years
and we have only had there for thirteen

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
and we have only had there for thirteen
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.240
and we have only had there for thirteen
and a half billion years to wait to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
and a half billion years to wait to
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.630
and a half billion years to wait to
accumulate light from distant parts of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
accumulate light from distant parts of
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.600
accumulate light from distant parts of
the universe so we can only see as far

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
the universe so we can only see as far
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.289
the universe so we can only see as far
as light could have traveled in thirteen

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
as light could have traveled in thirteen
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.429
as light could have traveled in thirteen
point five billion years the universe is

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
point five billion years the universe is
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.830
point five billion years the universe is
continuing to expand in fact it seems to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
continuing to expand in fact it seems to
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.649
continuing to expand in fact it seems to
have an accelerated expansion so a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
have an accelerated expansion so a
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.140
have an accelerated expansion so a
billion years from now we will have be

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
billion years from now we will have be
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.420
billion years from now we will have be
we will be able to see out the distances

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
we will be able to see out the distances
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.420
we will be able to see out the distances
of fourteen and a half billion light

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
of fourteen and a half billion light
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.120
of fourteen and a half billion light
years away for all we know that

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
years away for all we know that
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.270
years away for all we know that
expansion could continue forever and the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
expansion could continue forever and the
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.480
expansion could continue forever and the
size of the universe that we can observe

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
size of the universe that we can observe
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.480
size of the universe that we can observe
will grow indefinitely and therefore in

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
will grow indefinitely and therefore in
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.429
will grow indefinitely and therefore in
some sense the visible universe

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
some sense the visible universe
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.149
some sense the visible universe
ultimately will be arbitrarily big or

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
ultimately will be arbitrarily big or
 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.740
ultimately will be arbitrarily big or
infinite in size it's conceivable there

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
infinite in size it's conceivable there
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.569
infinite in size it's conceivable there
are mathematically that that expansion

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
are mathematically that that expansion
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.160
are mathematically that that expansion
will stop and we will at some point not

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
will stop and we will at some point not
 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.479
will stop and we will at some point not
the universe will

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489
the universe will
 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.300
the universe will
stop expanding and we'll be a well we

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310
stop expanding and we'll be a well we
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.520
stop expanding and we'll be a well we
would what we call technically a closed

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530
would what we call technically a closed
 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.220
would what we call technically a closed
universe in which which would be finite

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
universe in which which would be finite
 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.770
universe in which which would be finite
in size but the indications at the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780
in size but the indications at the
 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.800
in size but the indications at the
moment are that that's not the case and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
moment are that that's not the case and
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.250
moment are that that's not the case and
that it is infinite that doesn't mean

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
that it is infinite that doesn't mean
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.729
that it is infinite that doesn't mean
that it is at the moment we can see

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739
that it is at the moment we can see
 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.970
that it is at the moment we can see
infinitely far away we can't because it

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980
infinitely far away we can't because it
 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.860
infinitely far away we can't because it
takes a finite amount of time for light

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870
takes a finite amount of time for light
 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.850
takes a finite amount of time for light
to get here and we've only had thirteen

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860
to get here and we've only had thirteen
 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.270

point five billion years or so since the
 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.699
point five billion years or so since the
beginning whatever that is and we don't

beginning whatever that is and we don't

understand it for light to propagate to

understand it for light to propagate to

understand it for light to propagate to
us
