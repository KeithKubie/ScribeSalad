00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's the scenario I have in mind. We have three mixers.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
At each stage, we validate 1/5 of the votes, and we have to audit the last one.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We don't have another mixer here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We need some designated output auditor that receives these outputs

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as well as these and audits the last one.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That's our three-step mix net. At the end of this, some votes are revealed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The question is if an eavesdropper, who can observe messages along all these channels

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and observe all of them, can determine which voter cast this vote.
