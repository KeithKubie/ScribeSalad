00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.580
I felt excruciating pain.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.440
Then I blacked out.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.317
Then my brother said,
"I can't feel my feet,"

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:18.118
and I blacked out.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.725
I heard the stewardess
coming and I blacked out.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:39.072
I'm a huge Harry Potter fan
and my wife surprised

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.641
me with a trip to
the local owl preserve.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:51.618
I remember I was wearing
my Ron Weasley wig and robe.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.454
I stopped to make a pee-pee
behind a tree

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.956
and that's when
I first heard them.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:57.791
"Hoo-hoo."

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:02.429
"Hoo-hoo."

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.309
My brother and I were
floating in a life raft.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.879
We looked around
and we just saw endless ocean

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.948
and we knew
we were alone.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:25.885
We tried to calm each other down
by singing "The Sweater Song."

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.954
I looked at my brother
and I said,

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.290
"My God, I don't
think anyone is coming."

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.166
The first thing I noticed
as I got on the plane

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:46.306
was that they weren't using
zoned seating and I'm platinum.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:49.843
I should be on there before
those other people.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:50.944
I should be
boarding zone one.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.085
The owls had begun
to circle around me.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.321
At first, I thought
it was magical.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.056
Then they attacked.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:06.159
Their beaks were
like razorblades.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.928
I screamed out for help,
but nobody came.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.199
They said my bag
was too big

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:16.069
and they made me check it
like an animal,

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:19.172
which means I had
to hold my MacBook Air,

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:24.310
my Kindle Fire and
my iPad all in my lap,

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:28.681
and then I remembered
I forgot something.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:29.516
My headphones.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:35.021
My brother said there
was only one way to survive.

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:37.123
We had to drink each
other's pee.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.694
My brother stood over me,
but the boat was rocky

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:45.532
and most of his pee went
directly into my eyes and hair.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:49.102
He started laughing
and I got mad.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.439
At the time,
I didn't realize that it'd

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.208
be the last time I'd ever
hear my brother laugh.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.317
Then they announced
the in-flight movie.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.320
"Zookeeper,"
with Kevin James.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:15.862
When I woke up, I saw the
owls were kind of laying around.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:23.336
And they looked
sort of sleepy and full.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:33.079
That's when I realized,
my arms were gone.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:36.783
The owls had eaten
my arms.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.823
And then I pretty much knew
that no one was coming for me.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.857
I'm sorry.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:45.658
I'm sorry.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.097
And I see the ranger shack.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.699
All the rangers are
standing outside

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.000
and they see me
and they're like,

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.935
"Dude, where's your arms?"

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.605
And I'm like, "The owls ate
them, I didn't even care,

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.640
'cause I was just so happy."

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:04.010
So I'm trying to get
into "Zookeeper,"

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:09.215
'cause I'm a good sport and
I order a glass of chardonnay.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:14.387
And in a 9/11-like twist,
they didn't have any.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:15.221
They offered...

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:20.593
...they offered me pinot.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.233
I said, "I don't want
pinot, " I said,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.302
"Please just
give me chardonnay,

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:35.375
I know you guys have it, I know
it's back there.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.044
I'm platinum, like,
I'm ( bleep ) platinum."

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.985
I endured because my brother
peed in my mouth.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:48.955
I endured because
the owls filled up

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:53.860
on arms and didn't save
any room for legs.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:58.998
I endured because I wanted
to bang my married ex

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.334
and I did
and he's divorced now.

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:04.971
Thank you.
