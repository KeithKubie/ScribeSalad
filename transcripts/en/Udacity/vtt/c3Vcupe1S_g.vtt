00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.480
As always, we start by changing division to multiplication, we multiply by the

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.879
reciprocal of the second fraction. I'm multiplying these binomials together, so

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:14.067
I want to make sure that I use parentheses. I have x plus 5 and 5 plus x. If I

00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:17.902
think back, I can remember that these two are actually identical, they're the

00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:22.390
same factor. So, we can simplify those or cancel those to make one. This leaves

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.804
me with 5 minus x in my numerator and x minus 5 in my denominator. And here we

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:32.357
have opposite polynomials. The 5's are opposite in sign as are the x's. We know

00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:38.093
opposite polynomials really reduce to negative 1. So negative 1 is our final

00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:38.973
answer.
