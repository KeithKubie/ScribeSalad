00:00:07.303 --> 00:00:10.144
Reaching heights of over 100 meters,

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:16.457
Californian sequoias tower over Earth’s 
other estimated 60,000 tree species.

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:19.262
Growing in the misty Sierra Nevada 
mountains,

00:00:19.262 --> 00:00:23.822
their massive trunks support the 
tallest known trees in the world.

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:27.386
But even these behemoths seem 
to have their limits.

00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:32.653
No sequoia on record has been able 
to grow taller than 130 meters –

00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:36.289
and many researchers say these 
trees won’t beat that cap

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.254
even if they live for thousands of 
years to come.

00:00:39.254 --> 00:00:43.809
So what exactly is stopping these trees 
from growing taller, forever?

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.241
It all comes down to sap.

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:47.800
In order for trees to grow,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.964
they need to bring sugars obtained 
from photosynthesis

00:00:50.964 --> 00:00:55.368
and nutrients brought in through the root 
system to wherever growth is happening.

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:58.233
And just like blood circulates in 
the human body,

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:02.794
trees are designed to circulate two kinds 
of sap throughout their bodies –

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:06.750
carrying all the substances a 
tree’s cells need to live.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.082
The first is phloem sap.

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:12.667
Containing the sugars generated in 
leaves during photosynthesis,

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.394
phloem sap is thick, like honey,

00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:20.327
and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue 
to distribute sugar throughout the tree.

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:21.658
By the end of its journey,

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:25.061
the phloem sap has thinned 
into a watery substance,

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:27.552
pooling at the base of the tree.

00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:31.789
Right beside the phloem is the tree’s 
other tissue type: the xylem.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.471
This tissue is packed with nutrients and 
ions like calcium, potassium, and iron,

00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:40.155
which the tree has absorbed 
through its roots.

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:41.666
Here at the tree’s base,

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.958
there are more of these particles in 
one tissue than the other,

00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.774
so the water from the phloem sap is 
absorbed into the xylem

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:50.865
to correct the balance.

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:53.707
This process, called osmotic movement,

00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:56.306
creates nutrient-rich xylem sap,

00:01:56.306 --> 00:02:00.585
which will then travel up the trunk to 
spread those nutrients through the tree.

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:04.504
But this journey faces a formidable 
obstacle: gravity.

00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:09.529
To accomplish this herculean task, 
the xylem relies on three forces:

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.766
transpiration, capillary action, 
and root pressure.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:19.086
As part of photosynthesis, leaves open 
and close pores called stomata.

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:23.866
These openings allow oxygen and carbon 
dioxide in and out of the leaf,

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:28.109
but they also create an opening through 
which water evaporates.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.926
This evaporation, called transpiration,

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:36.476
creates negative pressure in the xylem, 
pulling watery xylem sap up the tree.

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:42.025
This pull is aided by a fundamental 
property of water called capillary action.

00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:43.431
In narrow tubes,

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:45.618
the attraction between water molecules

00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:50.828
and the adhesive forces between the water 
and its environment can beat out gravity.

00:02:50.828 --> 00:02:54.528
This capillary motion is in full effect 
in xylem filaments

00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:56.772
thinner than human hair.

00:02:56.772 --> 00:02:59.460
And where these two forces pull the sap,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.383
the osmotic movement at the tree’s 
base creates root pressure,

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.233
pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:09.563
Together these forces launch sap 
to dizzying heights,

00:03:09.563 --> 00:03:13.658
distributing nutrients, and growing new 
leaves to photosynthesize –

00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:15.864
far above the tree’s roots.

00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:18.499
But despite these sophisticated systems,

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.560
every centimeter is a fight 
against gravity.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.719
As trees grow taller and taller,

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.757
the supply of these vital fluids 
begins to dwindle.

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:27.990
At a certain height,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.220
trees can no longer afford the lost water 
that evaporates during photosynthesis.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.781
And without the photosynthesis needed 
to support additional growth,

00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:41.324
the tree instead turns its resources 
towards existing branches.

00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:45.101
This model, known as the “hydraulic 
limitation hypothesis,”

00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.240
is currently our best explanation for why 
trees have limited heights,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.864
even in perfect growing conditions.

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.557
And using this model alongside 
growth rates

00:03:54.557 --> 00:03:57.320
and known needs for nutrients 
and photosynthesis,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.436
researchers have been able to propose 
height limits for specific species.

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:03.502
So far these limits have held up –

00:04:03.502 --> 00:04:08.614
even the world’s tallest tree still falls 
about fifteen meters below the cap.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:12.678
Researchers are still investigating the 
possible explanations for this limit,

00:04:12.678 --> 00:04:16.797
and there may not be one universal 
reason why trees stop growing.

00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:18.132
But until we learn more,

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:21.368
the height of trees is yet another
way that gravity,

00:04:21.368 --> 00:04:25.208
literally, shapes life on Earth.
