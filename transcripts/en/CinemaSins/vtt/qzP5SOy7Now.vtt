00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:07.790
Dude, what is with the Easy Buttons?

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.690
I thought you were gonna get, like, the receptionist
bell, so we could do the dings like from the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.690
sins videos.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.690
I looked man.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.910
I don't know where to find those things.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.470
I don't know what store sells those.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.590
We can't debate movies and keep score using
an easy button.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.960
That's beyond lame.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.110
People will think we're stupid.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.230
Well this is the best I could do, okay, so
do you wanna do it, or complain about it?

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.230
Okay.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.119
Okay, so let's talk about The Hobbit.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.119
Let's talk about the Hobbit.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.119
The Hobbit sucks!

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:34.790
Why does The Hobbit suck?

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.239
The Hobbit sucks because of all the goofy
sh*t.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.239
Goofy sh*t?

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.910
The snot, the body noises, the wacky f*cking
brown wizard.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.199
This movie is silly as f*ck.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.780
Okay, I will grant you that there are some
moments in the movie that are a little bit

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.780
silly.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.780
"That was easy."

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.780
Point for me.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.780
Okay.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.780
My turn.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.780
The Gollum scene.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.030
Let's hear you say something bad about the
Gollum scene.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.739
Even an idiot like you has to know how awesome
that scene was.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.089
Let's hear you say it was bad.

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.499
I wanna hear it.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:02.499
Come on.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:03.570
Come on.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.519
I can't argue that.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.519
I can't.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:07.519
"That was easy."

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:08.519
Exactly.

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:09.519
Thank you.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:10.519
You happy now?

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:11.519
Yeah, I'm happy now.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:12.519
The dishes song.

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:13.759
The dishes song is in the book!

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:14.909
No, no.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.460
No movie that takes a tiny ass book and splits
it out into three movies and then fills it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.310
with all kinds of filler sh*t that wasn't
actually there?

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.080
That movie doesn't get to claim 'It was in
the book' when I criticize.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.550
That movie has left the book behind a long
time ago.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.390
Another problem with the dishes song is this.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.420
I cannot believe that didn't break.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.420
Exactly!

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.659
There's no way those dwarfs could have done
that without breaking all the dishes.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.920
"That was easy."

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.920
It's dwarves.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.920
What?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.920
It's dwarves, not dorfs.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.119
"That was easy."

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.329
That's not even a point about the movie.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.329
I don't care.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.689
I score a point every time you're a moron.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.460
Now let's talk about the action, because it
was awesome.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.460
No it isn't!

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.619
The action is kid-friendly.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.619
It's stupid.

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.540
It's like a dumbed-down version of what Middle
Earth action ought to be.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.540
And that's stupid.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.540
"That was easy."

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.540
You can't just score a point without any debate.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.540
Yes I can.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.540
No you can't.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.770
And I just did.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.400
What are you gonna do about it?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.399
I guess I'm gonna sit here and--
Alright the other problem is the bloat.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.399
The what?

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.399
The bloat.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.399
The bloat?

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:15.069
This movie has so much unnecessary scenery,
this movie has so many unnecessary characters.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.069
It's ridiculous.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.280
To prove my point, I brought somebody else
to help us, to discuss it.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.500
You brought somebody else?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.040
Geez, dude you know I freakin' hate this guy.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.069
Why do you have to bring this guy?

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.099
We don't need him to debate movies.

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.590
He doesn't add anything.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.650
Exactly!

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.900
Tell me this isn't exactly how you felt when
Frodo showed up and did nothing.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.030
Tell me this isn't exactly how you felt when
Elrond and Galadriel, the masters of boredom,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.459
had a 15 minute conference with Gandalf.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.909
Tell me this isn't exactly how you felt when
the mother f*cker shows up on a sled drawn

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.260
by rabbits!

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.910
If I agree with you will you tell him to go?

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.910
Yeah.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.910
Get rid of him?

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.019
Alright the rabbits are stupid.

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.720
The rabbits are dumb.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.739
"That was easy."

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.940
Alright, so get rid of him.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.960
He's not that bad, really.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.240
I mean, he's a little slow, but--
We made a deal.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.880
He sure is friendly.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.830
We made a deal, you said you were gonna get
rid of him.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.909
We did.

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.680
But have you ever tried getting rid of this
guy?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.670
It's next to impossible.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.790
Then why did you even invite him over in the
first place.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.909
Can you at least tell him to stop staring
at me like that.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:22.909
Hey!

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.019
You're bothering him!

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.019
Can I come in?

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:25.020
Hello?
