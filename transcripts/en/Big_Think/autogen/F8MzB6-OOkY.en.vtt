buy dollars which tends to raise the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140
buy dollars which tends to raise the
 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.649
buy dollars which tends to raise the
price of the dollar and reduce the price

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659
price of the dollar and reduce the price

of the yuan which effectively reduces
 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.859
of the yuan which effectively reduces
the price of their exports so it's a

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869
the price of their exports so it's a
 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.200
the price of their exports so it's a
kind of a subsidy to their exports so

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210
kind of a subsidy to their exports so
 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.240
kind of a subsidy to their exports so
they can intervene to keep the dollars

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250
they can intervene to keep the dollars
 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.019
they can intervene to keep the dollars
strong which then accelerates

their exports into the US market

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530
 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.760
it allows them and effectively to over

it allows them and effectively to over
 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.510
it allows them and effectively to over
produce and to over export we

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520
produce and to over export we
 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.910

as long as the world will accept dollars

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
as long as the world will accept dollars
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.880
as long as the world will accept dollars
deficits really don't matter to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890
deficits really don't matter to
 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.130

of paper with presidential pictures so
 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.729
of paper with presidential pictures so
it allows us to be irresponsible it

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739
it allows us to be irresponsible it
 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.780
it allows us to be irresponsible it
allows us to over-consume overspend and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790
allows us to over-consume overspend and
 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.970
allows us to over-consume overspend and
over borrow and as a result kind of both

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980
over borrow and as a result kind of both
 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.910
over borrow and as a result kind of both
we and our trading partners are acting

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920
we and our trading partners are acting
 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.030
we and our trading partners are acting
irresponsibly and that means the system

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040
irresponsibly and that means the system
 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.850
irresponsibly and that means the system
is not sustainable and we just saw in

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860
is not sustainable and we just saw in
 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.059
is not sustainable and we just saw in
this crisis one element of what can

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069
this crisis one element of what can
 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.500
this crisis one element of what can
happen when the system becomes

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510
happen when the system becomes
 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.080
happen when the system becomes
unsustainable and as I said earlier we

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090
unsustainable and as I said earlier we
 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.420
unsustainable and as I said earlier we
haven't really fixed up so it's still

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430
haven't really fixed up so it's still
 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.509
haven't really fixed up so it's still
unsustainable and what can happen is

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519
unsustainable and what can happen is
 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.080
unsustainable and what can happen is
that we could get into a situation in

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090
that we could get into a situation in
 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.150
that we could get into a situation in
which other countries just say hey you

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160
which other countries just say hey you
 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.470
which other countries just say hey you
know we can't keep taking all these

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480
know we can't keep taking all these

we're just choking on dollars here we'd
 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.530
we're just choking on dollars here we'd
rather be paid in a combination maybe

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540
rather be paid in a combination maybe
 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.380

countries with large dollar holdings are

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359
countries with large dollar holdings are
 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.990
countries with large dollar holdings are
trying to diversify so China is buying

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000
trying to diversify so China is buying

agricultural land in Africa or oil wells

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660
agricultural land in Africa or oil wells
 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.509
agricultural land in Africa or oil wells
in other parts of the world and other

countries are investing in commodities
 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.750
countries are investing in commodities
but they're trying quietly to kind of

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760
but they're trying quietly to kind of
 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.610
but they're trying quietly to kind of
get away from the dollar so the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620
get away from the dollar so the
 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.289
get away from the dollar so the
long-term prospect here is that at some

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299
long-term prospect here is that at some
 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.110
long-term prospect here is that at some
point the dollar is likely to devalue

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120
point the dollar is likely to devalue
 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.719
point the dollar is likely to devalue
and the living standard of Americans

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729
and the living standard of Americans
 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.390
and the living standard of Americans
we're living above our means right now

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400
we're living above our means right now
 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.469
we're living above our means right now
we're living beyond

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479
we're living beyond
 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.200
we're living beyond
and so the living standard of Americans

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210
and so the living standard of Americans
 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.139
and so the living standard of Americans
is likely to decline
