JENNA: So today, we're very
lucky to be joined with Janet

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.680
Fletcher, food writer and chef.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.180
She's going to speak
to us about how

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.530
to make yogurt from scratch.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.450
And then we're going to have a
delicious carrot-cumin yogurt

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.310
salad.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.560
JANET FLETCHER: Thanks, Jenna.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.904
Yeah, I think this is
really a great fit with what

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:18.070
Google is trying to do here.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.260
Because yogurt is a
really wholesome food.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.660
And it's never more wholesome
and fresh and natural

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.447
than when you make it yourself.

00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:28.780
I think one of the reasons I
wrote the book about yogurt

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.450
was because I wanted
to steer people

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.160
away from what I consider
the bad choices, really,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.970
at the supermarket.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.490
There are so many
yogurts out there.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.525
And a lot of them are
really not very wholesome.

00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:39.820
They're more like pudding.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.278
They're loaded with
a lot of sugar.

00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:42.790
They're really
more like desserts.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.800
And I thought if I
could steer people first

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.930
to some better choices
at the supermarket

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.070
and then maybe gradually get
them to making yogurt at home,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.310
they really have
made a much more--

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.090
they're making much better
choices for their diet.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.210
How many of you have
made yogurt at home?

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.590
OK, not very many.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.800
Any of you who make it at
home make it regularly?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.470
OK, great.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.970
Great.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.887
Well, I'm really glad.

00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:10.136
Because that means there are
a lot of you who haven't.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.670
So I'm going to be able to show
you something that, I hope,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.970
you're going to get
hooked on like I am.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.480
I'm never without
yogurt in my fridge.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.750
And it's so easy.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.722
Yogurt is really
just cultured milk.

00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:24.430
And we're going to
start with whole milk.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.530
This is a Straus milk,
the organic Straus

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.180
milk from West Marin.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.990
So I like it because
it's organic.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.440
I like it because it's local.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.670
And I really like it
because it's whole milk.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.100
I really am a big
advocate for-- this looks

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.230
like a delicate operation here.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.930
JENNA: Flawless.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.370
JANET FLETCHER: --for
whole fat dairy products.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.526
So we have a quart of milk here.

00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:52.270
Now, I'm going to do
a couple of things

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.970
with this yogurt recipe that
you won't see in other books,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.914
probably, or other
online recipes.

00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:01.330
I have a couple of approaches
that are a little different.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.950
And here's the first one, I
add a little nonfat dry milk.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.880
I'm going to add 2 tablespoons
of nonfat dried milk-- instant

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.139
nonfat dry milk-- to
every quart of yogurt.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.450
This recipe is very scalable.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.410
I could make a half gallon of
yogurt or a gallon of yogurt.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.130
And the reason I
add this dry milk

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.160
is because it's going to
give me a thicker yogurt.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.540
The dry milk is just
protein, no fat.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.100
Protein and some
lactose, some milk sugar.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.760
And it's the protein
that makes yogurt thick.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.480
So by enhancing
the protein, I am

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.030
going to make a thicker yogurt.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.620
So let's get this going.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.155
I'm going to put
it on about medium.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.560
And because it's
instant dry milk,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.970
it'll just whisk right in.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.410
You can also get non-instant.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.000
But you really have to
whisk it quite a bit.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.290
This will whisk in.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.300
And so I'm basically
adding more protein.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.120
And I'm going to
get a thicker yogurt

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.690
and I want to say a firmer set.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.600
You know how some yogurts
are really very fragile

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.530
and some are thicker
and sturdier?

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.560
This nonfat dry milk is
going to help give us

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.240
a thicker and more stable set.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.190
And--

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.745
JANET FLETCHER: Pardon me?

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:27.310
AUDIENCE: Would it work
with a whey protein powder?

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.560
JANET FLETCHER: It would
work with whey protein.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.870
Yeah, I don't know why not.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.640
I don't know why not.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.730
I haven't tried it.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.720
I just buy the instant dry
milk powder at the supermarket.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.050
All I'm trying to do is
bring out the protein.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.480
So the other thing I do--
typically, a lot of recipes

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.960
are going to tell you
to heat it to 180.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.570
I'm going to heat it higher.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.420
I'm going to heat
it to 190, 195.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.950
And then I'm going to hold
it there for 10 minutes.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.017
And the reason that
I do that-- first

00:04:05.017 --> 00:04:07.600
of all, the reason that people
heat the milk to begin with-- I

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.183
mean, I started with
pasteurized milk.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:10.690
Why do you have to heat it?

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.430
I'm heating it to get
rid of any bacteria that

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.880
might compete with my culture.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.010
So I'm basically
re-pasteurizing it.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.850
Because milk that's
been in the carton,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.890
it could've been contaminated
after pasteurization.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.292
It's just a safety measure
to bring the milk up

00:04:27.292 --> 00:04:29.250
to a high temperature to
kill any bacteria that

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.124
might compete with your
culture, the bacteria

00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:32.300
that you want to grow.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.020
But by bringing it
up to 190 or 195

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.420
and then holding it
there for 10 minutes,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.610
I'm doing a couple of things.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.710
I'm concentrating the
milk a little bit.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.250
Because, you'll see, there's
a lot of evaporation.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.460
But most importantly,
I'm denaturing

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.045
one of the whey proteins--
the lactoglobulin.

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:54.900
And by the heat and that
10 minutes at 190 or 195

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.420
denatures the whey
protein lactoglobulin.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.450
And so then that
whey protein can

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.790
get caught up in the yogurt.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.560
And I'm going to get, again, a
thicker and more stable yogurt.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.490
These are two
techniques-- the dry milk

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.440
and the extra heating--
that really work.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.330
You don't have to do them.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.822
You're still going
to get yogurt.

00:05:14.822 --> 00:05:17.030
But you're going to get a
more fragile yogurt and one

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.070
that's not quite as thick.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.320
So I think they really help
produce the kind of yogurt

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.720
that I like, which
is thick and creamy.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.970
You can use any kind
of milk for yogurt.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.019
You can use nonfat,
low fat, full fat.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.060
I advocate full fat not
only because it gives you

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.830
more mouth feel
and more pleasure,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.410
but because, really, when
you think about it, if you're

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.860
going to use a nonfat
milk to make your yogurt,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.010
you are saving so few calories.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.140
A lot of the recipes
in the book have

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.870
maybe a cup of yogurt in them.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.960
And they serve four people.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.210
So on a per serving
basis, the difference

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.520
between using a nonfat
yogurt and a full fat yogurt

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.290
is about 20 calories.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.340
And the flavor and texture
difference is noticeable.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.369
So I really advocate
the whole milk yogurt.

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:10.160
Everything's going to
taste better with it.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.180
All the recipes will work with
low fat yogurt in the book.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.760
But they're going to taste a
lot better with full fat yogurt.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.560
What do you use when
you make your yogurt?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.780
JANET FLETCHER: And it failed?

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.800
OK, well, after
today you won't fail.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.290
Yogurt really is a
no-fail procedure

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.400
if you pay attention
to a few things.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.620
What is yogurt, after all?

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.160
It's cultured milk.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.660
It's milk that we add
a selected culture to

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.660
in order to ferment the
milk sugar, the lactose.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.500
These bacterial cultures
love the lactose.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.910
They're going to eat it
up and create lactic acid.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.957
And the lactic acid is
going to lower the pH.

00:06:51.957 --> 00:06:53.290
It's going to raise the acidity.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.081
And that's going to
cause our fermentation.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.350
It's a lot like making
cheese, except the bacteria

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.550
are different.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.050
And when you think about it,
yogurt, the first yogurt,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.900
certainly, was just
a spontaneous thing.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.850
It just happened with
the ambient bacteria

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.980
and some shepherd's milk.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.360
And over time,
over centuries, we

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.030
figured out what
bacteria do the best

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.286
job, which ones are reliable
and give the best flavor.

00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:19.410
So today-- I'm just going
to check the temperature.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.620
I want to bring it up to 190.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.370
This is called a Thermapen.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.620
You can just use any kind
of instant-read thermometer.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.055
But this is like the Mercedes
of instant-read thermometers.

00:07:28.055 --> 00:07:28.679
And it's great.

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:29.700
Do you have one, Deedee?

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.215
I love--

00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:31.131
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.840
JANET FLETCHER: Yeah,
you want a Thermapen.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.390
So we're at about 165.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.482
So we've got a ways to go.

00:07:40.482 --> 00:07:41.940
It's going to be
almost to boiling.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.570
So it's going to give us
a lot of foam on the top.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.270
The original yogurt
was just milk

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.510
that fermented from
the ambient bacteria.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.860
But now we choose the
bacteria that we want to add.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.740
And all yogurt, by FDA
definition-- or maybe

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.740
it's the USDA that
regulates those things.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.319
The federal
definition for yogurt,

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:10.110
there are two bacteria
that it has to have.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.600
One would be the
Lactobacillus bulgaricus.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.627
And the other is
Streptococcus thermophilus.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:16.210
But if you look at
a carton of yogurt,

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.260
you're going to see, probably,
some other Latin on there,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.250
some other bacteria listed.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.760
And those are there
for probiotic benefit.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.760
Things like Lactobacillus
acidophilus, that's not there

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.000
to really culture the milk.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.640
It's there for the
probiotic benefit.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.940
So when you're
making yogurt, you

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:46.102
have to have-- you can
use three different things

00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:46.810
for your culture.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.570
You can use your
own homemade yogurt

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.550
from the batch you
just made last week.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.340
You can use a
store-bought yogurt.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.870
Or you can use a freeze-dried
culture you can find online.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.916
And in some cheese
making supply shops,

00:08:59.916 --> 00:09:02.540
there are freeze-dried cultures,
which are kind of nice to use.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.415
Because you can just
put them in the freezer.

00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:05.710
And they keep forever.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.140
But I usually use
either a couple

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.530
of tablespoons from my
last batch of yogurt

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.360
or just a freshly opened
container of yogurt.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.566
Let's see where we are.

00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:15.890
We are getting real close.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.590
We're at 190.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:23.060
So at this point, I'm going
to turn it down to low.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.020
On my home stove, I
just turn it to low

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.280
and leave it for 10 minutes.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.610
And again, that's to
denature this whey protein.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.200
And then we will cool
it really quickly.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.010
So I'm going to
need an ice bath.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.610
Because what we could
do once it reaches

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.220
that-- can somebody
just let me know

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.990
when 10 minutes have passed?

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.490
OK.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.630
At that point, I could just
put it aside and cool it down

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.840
naturally to my
culturing temperature.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.910
But I'm going to try to
speed things up and do it

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.760
in an ice bath.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.390
And if I just put it
aside, it would take, oh,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.172
45 minutes, probably,
to come down

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:04.380
to the culturing temperature.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.830
In an ice bath, it
takes three minutes.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.880
So the culturing temperature
is the temperature

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.990
that the bacteria like.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.850
Everything is about
keeping the bacteria happy.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.440
Because they're our labor force.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.310
They're what's going to make
the fermentation happen.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.550
And they like a little
heat, but not too much.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.070
Too much heat will kill them.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.540
Too cold, they won't
work fast enough.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.980
So the target
range for your milk

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:42.310
when you add the bacteria
is about 108 to 118.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.360
If you go above
118, you'll probably

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.890
kill your bacteria culture.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.210
Below 108 or 105,
and the culture

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.450
really gets off to
a sluggish start.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.820
So we don't want that to happen.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.910
So after I put it
in the ice bath,

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.520
I'm going to monitor it and try
to get it at that 108 to 118

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.020
range.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.210
And that's when we'll
add our culture.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:09.610
In the meantime, I'm going
to make a very quick yogurt

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.250
dish for you.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.040
One of the reasons that I
wrote the book, in addition

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.080
to trying to steer
people to better choices

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.060
and teach them how
to make their own,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.590
was that I wanted to
invite people to experience

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.200
the savory side of yogurt.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.936
How many of you eat yogurt?

00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:31.435
Let me ask that.

00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:32.440
OK, a lot of you.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.000
I'm going to guess that most of
you eat yogurt for breakfast.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.980
Or you have it with honey or
fruit or sugar, brown sugar,

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.990
in a sweet way.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.550
You tend to have it as
a sweet, as a breakfast

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.850
or as a sweet snack.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.480
There are so many wonderful
savory ways to enjoy yogurt.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.260
And I've learned about
them not from growing up

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.780
with them, but from,
as a food writer,

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.000
exploring other cultures--
Indian, especially in North

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.010
India-- major yogurt territory--
the Middle East, the Balkans,

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:08.990
Greece, and Turkey.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:14.130
These are all places where
yogurt is always on the menu,

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.340
always on the table.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.420
And yogurt can really
help introduce you

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.700
to some of these other cultures.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.820
So this is a savory dish.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.052
This is a salad.

00:12:26.052 --> 00:12:28.010
that I'm going to make
with a little olive oil.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.990
I'm going to just heat these
carrots, grated carrots, that I

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.620
grated on this coarse
side of the box

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.800
grater, these coarse holes.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.212
That's what I used to
grate the peeled carrots.

00:12:41.212 --> 00:12:42.630
You can grate them ahead.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.260
And I'm just going to switch
them in this hot olive oil.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.690
I want the pan to be pretty hot.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.220
And I'm not trying
to fully cook them.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.800
I just want to wilt
them until they

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.882
lose some of their crispness.

00:13:03.882 --> 00:13:04.840
I'm going to salt them.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:14.240
And I'm going to toss
them just until they

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.010
lose a little crispness.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.100
And then I'm going to put them
into some flavored yogurt.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.430
So what I'm going
to put them into

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:32.820
is a mix of yogurt,
garlic, and toasted cumin--

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.040
just some whole milk
yogurt-- it doesn't

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.290
have to be Greek
yogurt-- yogurt that I've

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.020
added some chopped garlic
to and some toasted cumin.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.890
And let's see.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.385
If we have time, I'll show you
how I do the toasted cumin.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.680
So just a couple
minutes does it.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.400
I can smell that wonderful
smell of the carrots coming up.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.700
And I'm going to turn
it off now and just

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:04.920
let it sit in that pan.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.015
And we will toast
some cumin quickly.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.970
All spices are so much
better when they're toasted.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.850
This is just cumin
straight out of the jar.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.030
And if you toast it, you have
a totally different experience.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.600
Suddenly, you have cumin.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.940
You have the smell of
Mexico, the smell of India.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.930
It's nothing until you toast it.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.960
And you do it just in a
dry skillet-- no olive oil,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.810
nothing.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.780
And so I take it probably
farther than a lot of people.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.620
I like it to get really
almost dark brown.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.560
And then I'm going to
pound it in a mortar.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.690
If you have a spice grinder
or a dedicated coffee grinder

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.190
or even a coffee
grinder that you're

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.830
willing to really
clean out well,

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.282
then you can use your cumin.

00:14:52.282 --> 00:14:54.240
You don't want your coffee
smelling like cumin.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.950
So it's good to have
a dedicated grinder.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.507
I'm a real believer in
doing stuff by hand.

00:14:59.507 --> 00:15:01.340
So I have a whole mortar
collection at home.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.600
I just love the pounding.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.126
JANET FLETCHER: I'm starting
with the seeds, yeah.

00:15:08.126 --> 00:15:11.000
You could do store-bought,
ground cumin.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.430
But the point is really
to start with the seeds.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:18.310
The seeds almost never go
stale in your spice drawer.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.980
The powder, once it's ground,
it has a very short life

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.900
before it loses its aroma, like
a matter of a couple of months,

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.370
really, before you lose a lot.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.450
Whereas the seeds you
can keep for a year.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.690
So I always buy my spices
whole and then toast them.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.480
I'm already getting
some aroma up here.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.810
And then we'll
grind them and we'll

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:47.810
add it to-- this is just
some plain whole milk yogurt.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.190
OK, I can smell it.

00:16:03.616 --> 00:16:04.990
And I'm going to
add some garlic.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.347
Do we have a microplane?

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.360
I'm going to grate my garlic.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.440
Thank you.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.550
This is a microplane.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.810
I can't live without this now.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.040
And I'm going to stop that.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.540
I might go a little
further at home.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.030
But I'm just going
to stop that for now.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:33.260
And I'm going to grate
some garlic into here.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.382
If you drop the
garlic, no big deal.

00:16:35.382 --> 00:16:36.840
Just reach in there
and pick it up.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:49.000
And I'm going to whisk
in a little bit of salt.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.770
Even though I put some
salt in my carrots,

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.510
I know I'll need a
little more there.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.850
Thank you.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:59.110
And I'm going to pound
that-- let's put this out

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.907
of the way for now.

00:17:00.907 --> 00:17:02.115
I'm going to pound the cumin.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.990
If you're going to buy
a mortar, buy a big one.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.329
You can always do a small
job in a big mortar.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.079
But you can't do a big
job in a small one.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.300
So buy more capacity than
you think you might need.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.770
Asian markets have
a wonderful mortar.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.930
It's a mortar that's very
much used in the Thai kitchen.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.540
And it's kind of like
this, but a little bigger.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.530
And they're very inexpensive.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.490
And you'll have it for life.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.370
So see how quickly
that ground up?

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:54.440
And I'm now going to
put that into my yogurt.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.820
And my carrots are hot.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.410
I don't want to add anything
really hot to the yogurt

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.280
because I might break it.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.170
But I think they've
probably cooled off

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.250
enough now that I can add them.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.270
But yogurt's not
like sour cream.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.896
You can't subject
it to direct heat.

00:18:09.896 --> 00:18:11.520
You have to kind of
temper it by adding

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.520
something that's warm to it
to bring it up to temperature.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.391
So we've got salt, garlic,
and toasted cumin in here.

00:18:20.391 --> 00:18:21.890
And now I'm going
to add my carrots.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:41.610
And probably wouldn't have hurt
to cool them a little bit more.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.370
But I don't think
we're going to break.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:49.940
And I'm going to add
the herb of choice

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.290
You could use dill if you like.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.300
We're going to
use some cilantro.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.490
You could use mint.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:56.960
You could use just
parsley if you

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.790
don't like any of those others.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.550
But I like cilantro in here.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:13.920
And I'm just going to chop
some cilantro and put that in.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.350
And then do we have a nice
plate we can put it on?

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.060
Thank you.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.750
She's one step ahead of me.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:26.030
A little lemon juice,
usually, I add to taste.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.530
Thank you.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.921
I'm going to chop
some cilantro here.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:32.420
OK.

00:19:37.356 --> 00:19:38.839
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:38.839 --> 00:19:39.630
JANET FLETCHER: OK.

00:19:42.485 --> 00:19:44.721
[BEEPING]

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.280
Is that telling me
something, that buzzer?

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.780
JENNA: It's the
timer for the stove.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.230
JANET FLETCHER: So is that
the 10 minutes for our yogurt?

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.497
OK.

00:19:53.497 --> 00:19:54.580
Oh, that's what you meant.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.310
OK.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.810
All right.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.330
So I'm going to turn that
off or just move it aside.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.340
Because we don't need
to cook it any more.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.440
And we'll get this, hold it in.

00:20:09.064 --> 00:20:11.430
As I said, you can
use another herb

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.595
if you prefer if you're
not a cilantro person.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.840
I've also made this
salad with beets.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.610
It's delicious with
beets-- cooked beets.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.984
I don't usually do the beets
sauteed on top of the stove.

00:20:26.984 --> 00:20:28.700
I just roast them
and then grate them

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.051
and fold them into the yogurt.

00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:33.550
The wonderful thing you start
to notice when you play around

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.320
with yogurt and look
at yogurt recipes

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.270
is that there's such
a yogurt trail that

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.750
extends from where
yogurt originated

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.420
in Central Asia, like
Afghanistan and Iran and then--

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.530
well, from Afghanistan into
Iran, then down into India

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.770
it traveled.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.440
And then it traveled
west to the Balkans.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.620
And in all these places, they
make a lot of the same dishes.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.900
They just vary the seasoning.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.960
So for example, an
Indian would probably

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.020
recognize this is very similar
to a raita, a yogurt salad

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:07.560
in India.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.670
It usually has maybe a little
more yogurt and less vegetable.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.360
This is a Turkish salad.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.560
But in India,
you're going to have

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.440
more yogurt and less vegetable.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.620
But that would be a
raita, or a yogurt salad.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.920
In Greece-- tzatziki,
the cucumber

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.880
salad that they make
in much the same way.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.780
So same salad, same
concept, but so

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.090
many variations on it that
are really fun to discover.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.830
So now with our
yogurt, we've cooked it

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.410
for 10 minutes at 190.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:48.996
Now I'm going to put it in
this ice bath over here.

00:21:48.996 --> 00:21:50.940
We don't need quite
this much ice.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.070
OK.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.257
And we'll see how fast this is.

00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:01.840
I don't think it's
going to-- it's not

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.964
going to take five minutes.

00:22:02.964 --> 00:22:05.900
My guess is more
like three minutes

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.320
to bring it down to--
what did I say, 108?

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.360
But I usually go
115 when I culture.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.140
So let's clean up a little bit.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.180
Normally, at home, I
wouldn't have anything else

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.513
going on when I'm making yogurt.

00:22:22.513 --> 00:22:25.170
Because you want to
keep pretty clean.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.040
You don't want to get any
other bacteria involved

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.050
other than the
ones that you want.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:35.840
So you should have clean
jars, clean towels,

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.970
clean implements of all kinds.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.194
This is what I'm
going to incubate in.

00:22:44.194 --> 00:22:45.610
You could incubate
it in anything.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.630
You could incubate it in a bowl.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.250
You don't have to have a jar.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:54.090
Some people use just
preserving jars, mason jars.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.680
But a bowl is fine.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.160
JENNA: Do you sanitize your
jars the way you would for--

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.785
JANET FLETCHER: Yeah,
I do, absolutely.

00:23:00.785 --> 00:23:03.010
I wash them with
hot, soapy water.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.320
And then often, I'll just
keep hot water in them

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.840
until I'm ready to fill
them so that they stay warm.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.700
Because now we let
it get down to 115.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.280
But then after we
add the culture,

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.750
we really want to baby it.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.120
We want to keep it warm.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.160
You have to keep that
culture about 105 to 115

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.300
to keep the yogurt-- to
keep it working for you.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.480
JENNA: For how long?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.120
JANET FLETCHER:
Until it sets, which

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:33.785
can be anywhere from
three hours to 12 hours.

00:23:33.785 --> 00:23:35.950
It depends how
active your culture

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:39.380
is, how warm you're keeping it.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.760
This clicked off on me.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.440
Let me just shut it down.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.490
And then it will
come right back up.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.740
Do you have that proofer
box that I can show people?

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.200
You need nothing to
make yogurt at home.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.614
You don't need this.

00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:56.280
In the old days, the
grandmas would just

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.910
put the milk on
their wrists and see.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.872
And they knew whether
it was warm enough.

00:24:01.872 --> 00:24:03.830
And they could judge
whether it was warm enough

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.660
to add their culture.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:10.210
But this makes it a lot
more precise, a thermometer.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.150
And you don't need
anything special

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.280
for your incubating environment.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.110
A lot of people will do it in
an oven with the pilot light on.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.470
I do it sometimes just
on my kitchen island.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.490
I'll put a blanket down.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.640
And I'll put blankets
around the jars.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.500
I'm trying to keep it
at that 105 to 115,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.660
anyway you can come
up with to do it.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.400
Some people put it
in a picnic cooler

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.270
that they've put maybe
some warm water in.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:44.540
So they just put it in a
warm spot in their house.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.810
And just check to
make sure you're

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:51.160
keeping it in that
incubation zone.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.030
OK.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:59.560
We are already down to--
we're down there to 108.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.240
So that didn't take
long in the ice bath.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.350
And now I'm ready
to add my culture.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.810
And as we said-- oh, I got a
little parsley in my culture.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.350
Does somebody have a
plastic spoon maybe?

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.620
I've got a little
cilantro my culture.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.390
JENNA: So Janet, if
you're down to 108,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.270
are you concerned with
bringing it back up?

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.061
JANET FLETCHER: No.

00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:20.130
If you do go too
low, not a problem.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.530
Just put it back on the stove.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:27.880
until you get it back
to that 108 to 118 zone.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.850
So this is, as I
said, we could use--

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.630
this is store-bought yogurt.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.900
But it could've been yogurt
from a previous batch.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.670
I'm just going to thin
it out a little bit.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:48.880
It would be nice to have--
we'll see if I can do it

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.910
with this little whisk.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.900
It would be nice to have
a bigger glass bowl.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.180
JANET FLETCHER: Yeah,
that'll work if it's cleans.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.270
OK, yeah.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.300
So I'm going to put
my culture in here.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.830
And I'm going to add some of
the warm milk to the culture

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:11.080
just to temper it and
thin it out a little bit.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.510
And then we'll whisk
it back in to the milk.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.110
I'm just trying to
warm it up gently

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:28.671
and thin it out so it will
mix well with the milk.

00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:31.490
And now I'll put it
back into the milk

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.880
that I know is not too
hot, make sure it's

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.250
well-distributed with my whisk.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.350
And that's your culturing.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.410
That's all that culturing is,
is adding that bacteria that

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:45.580
are in the yogurt.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.350
So if you're going to use a
store-bought yogurt to culture,

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.350
you have to make sure that
it says on the package,

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.760
contains live, active cultures.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.189
Otherwise, you
can't make yogurt.

00:26:56.189 --> 00:26:58.480
And believe it or not, there
are some yogurts out there

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.650
that do not have
live, active cultures.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.014
They tend to be the
mass market brands.

00:27:04.014 --> 00:27:06.180
And the reason they don't
have live, active cultures

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.030
is because they pasteurized
the yogurt after they made it.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.930
to give it shelf stability.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.050
You don't want that.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:13.960
It's not going to make yogurt.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.070
And it doesn't have
any probiotic benefit.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.470
That's one of the reasons
for eating yogurt.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.260
So be sure you look
at the container

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.490
and look for that phrase,
live, active cultures.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.230
And then you know you're
getting some probiotic benefit.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:29.960
And you can use it
to make your own.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.806
So more culture isn't better.

00:27:32.806 --> 00:27:34.180
A lot of people
might think that.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.290
That was 2 tablespoons of
yogurt per quart of milk.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.320
More culture isn't going
to culture it faster.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.790
And it's not going to
give you a thicker yogurt.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.330
In fact, it can
work against you.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:49.570
Because it can
overwhelm the bacteria.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.355
There may not be enough
bacteria for all the sugar.

00:27:53.355 --> 00:27:55.450
Or, excuse me, the other
way around-- enough sugar

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:56.720
for all the bacteria.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.920
So I'm just going to start off.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.200
I'm only doing this slowly
so I don't make a mess.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.120
But once I get it
about halfway in there,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.470
I will just pour it in.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:15.450
And at this point comes
what's our fermentation phase,

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.925
culturing phase.

00:28:16.925 --> 00:28:19.050
And that's when we really
want to make sure that we

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:26.990
are keeping it around 105, 115.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:30.900
And I'll show you this
device that I use at home

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.020
and have come to love.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.580
You're going to want
to have a lid on it.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.780
And so at this
point, I would either

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.530
put it on my kitchen
island with towels over it,

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:43.340
towels around it.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.170
It's like a heap of blankets
on my kitchen counter.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.080
And after about four
hours, I'll come check it.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.170
And you don't want to move
it while it's fermenting.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.960
It doesn't want to be jostled.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.260
So if I think, well, it's been
four hours, maybe it's done,

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.570
I'll come undo my blankets.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.730
And I'll undo the clamps.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.870
And I just jostle
it a little bit.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:07.700
And I'm looking to see whether
it's like a baked custard.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:12.410
I don't want it
to be still soupy.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.620
It needs to be set
like a custard.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.200
And I find on my kitchen
counter about four hours.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.020
But with this
device, which I only

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.530
learned about when I was
researching my book--

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.960
and I was reading people
online describing it.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.660
And it sounded kind of cool.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.030
So I contacted the company.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.680
And they sent me a loaner.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.540
And I'm very happy that they
haven't asked for their loaner

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.140
back.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.250
Because I love this thing.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.420
It started out as
a bread proofer.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.770
That's how they invented it.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.500
The name of the company
is Brod &amp;Taylor.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.320
I think it's a very small
appliance manufacturer.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.330
And they invented it to
proof bread for home bakers.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.000
But somebody along the line
decided to try it for yogurt.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.640
And it works great for yogurt.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.720
It's an electric device.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.303
And the thing that's
so great about it

00:29:58.303 --> 00:30:00.286
compared to a lot of
electric yogurt makers

00:30:00.286 --> 00:30:02.160
is that it has a thermostat
that you can set.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.400
So I can dial it to 108 degrees,
which is where I do yogurt.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.630
It makes yogurt in three hours--
totally steady, 108 degrees.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.690
My husband uses it for
his bread at 80 degrees.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.900
I crank it up for my yogurt.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.440
And then it collapses down.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.360
The sides come down.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.190
And it folds up.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.620
And it's easy to store.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.160
So it's absolutely
not essential.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.071
But it's a nice tool
to have if you're

00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:28.320
going to make a lot of yogurt.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.520
Because it makes it
so easy and reliably.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.450
You never have to worry
about whether you're

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:33.730
keeping it warm enough.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.310
But there are just lots of ways
you can keep the yogurt warm

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.680
at home that I've heard about.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.610
Some people use an
electric heating pad.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.900
Some people use a crock pot.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.774
They'll actually warm
their milk in the crock

00:30:45.774 --> 00:30:49.840
pot for their yogurt and
then not use their yogurt

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.630
for their incubation-- use the
crock pot for their incubation,

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.930
as well.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:57.070
But I'm a big fan of just
the blanket method if I'm not

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.770
going to use this device.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:02.660
So after, say, four
hours, you check it.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.730
You find that it's set.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.240
If it's not set,
just keep going.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.340
Put your blankets back.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.960
Or put it back in your
oven with the pilot light.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.680
Keep going.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.304
Check it in another hour.

00:31:11.304 --> 00:31:12.720
When you've decided
that it's set,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.930
then it needs to go
into the refrigerator.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.240
It's kind of tempting
to scoop into it.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.980
But I think it's much better
if it sets up in the fridge

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.920
and really gets its
nice firmness to it

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.520
before you try to use it.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.640
Then if you want to make
Greek yogurt-- super easy.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.860
After you've chilled it down,
then you need to strain it.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.180
That's all Greek yogurt is.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.900
It's just regular
yogurt that's been

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.820
strained to make it thicker.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.500
So you would take a
colander or a sieve

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.500
and line it with-- a lot
of people use cheese cloth,

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.717
like a double or triple
thickness of cheese cloth.

00:31:45.717 --> 00:31:47.050
Oh, I forgot to bring my Plyban.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.675
But I have this
material that I mention

00:31:48.675 --> 00:31:50.250
in the book called Plyban.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.130
You get it from cheese
making supply companies.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.020
It's a woven nylon, I think.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:01.520
And compared to cheese cloth,
it lasts virtually forever.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.690
Cheese cloth you can reuse
maybe two or three times.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.660
The Plyban-- I've had a piece
of Plyban for three years now.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.750
And I'm still using it.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:13.020
You can wash it, clean
it, and reuse it.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.110
So it's a great liner for
your sieve or colander.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.830
You dump your yogurt
into that, set it

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.460
over a bowl in the refrigerator.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.550
I usually put a
plate on top just so

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.330
that it doesn't absorb
any refrigerator smells.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.770
And within an hour,
you have Greek yogurt.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:33.850
You've drained out enough whey
to have a nice, thick yogurt

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.360
that is comparable to what
you would buy as Greek yogurt.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.170
And that brings up another
reason to make yogurt at home--

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.390
you save a lot of money.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.720
A quart of milk becomes
a quart of yogurt.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.967
And if you look at the
price of a quart of milk

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:50.550
versus the price of
a quart of yogurt,

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.830
you're going to realize
that you're saving a lot.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.155
So if you get in the habit
of eating a lot of yogurt

00:32:55.155 --> 00:32:56.780
or cooking with a
lot of yogurt, you're

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.770
going to save a lot
by making your own.

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:05.030
But also, you can make
it with a type of milk

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.000
you like, with organic
milk if you like.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.160
And even better, when
you're ready to eat it,

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.100
you can sweeten
it to your taste.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.910
You can put the fresh
fruit into it, instead

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.810
of the processed fruit that
the commercial producers use.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.220
So you're in control.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.820
And you're going to just have
a much more wholesome and tasty

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.580
product.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.670
And just another
point to make is

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:30.540
that if you're going to use a
store-bought yogurt to culture,

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.190
use a yogurt that you love.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.750
Play the field and
find the yogurt

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.320
that you like their texture,
you like their flavor.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.620
Some are tangier than others.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.590
Some are mellower than others.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.400
That flavor's going to
transfer to your yogurt because

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.260
of the bacteria that they used.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.127
So I really like
the Straus yogurt,

00:33:47.127 --> 00:33:48.210
the Straus organic yogurt.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.450
It's very mellow.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.661
It's not super tangy.

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:53.160
And so if I'm going to use a
store-bought yogurt to culture,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.130
I'll use the Straus.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:57.970
It gives me a more
mellow result.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.884
I know you have questions.

00:33:59.884 --> 00:34:01.300
AUDIENCE: So with
homemade yogurt,

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.084
how long can you keep
it in the fridge?

00:34:03.084 --> 00:34:05.500
Because us being at Google we
eat a lot of our meals here.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.272
And I tend to have a lot of food
that tends to sit in my fridge

00:34:08.272 --> 00:34:09.730
for longer than it
probably should.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.767
So what is a good estimate
of how long it can sit?

00:34:12.767 --> 00:34:14.350
JANET FLETCHER: The
thing about yogurt

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.630
is that it's a way
of preserving milk.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.739
That's, I think, why it
was so valued historically.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.409
Because milk didn't last.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.449
Yogurt lasts longer.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.710
Greek yogurt, or drained
yogurt, lasts even longer.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:32.154
It's like a dry, hard cheese
lasts longer than a moist one

00:34:32.154 --> 00:34:33.820
because you've got
some of the whey out.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.120
So a thick yogurt
that you've drained

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.820
is going to last
a little longer.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.190
I would say just a plain yogurt,
like this is going to make,

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.520
would last, oh, at
least a couple of weeks.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.620
And it's not going to go "bad."

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.870
It's not going to
get fuzzy mold on it.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:51.530
It's going to start to taste
really tangy, just probably

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.360
more tangy than you like.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.080
But if you take that extra step
of draining some of the whey

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.650
out for about an hour, I
would say even three weeks

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:06.030
without any change to it that
you're going to perceive.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:09.060
So I make two of
these at a time.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.940
But this is just a quart.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.330
You know, a cup of milk and a
cup of yogurt for breakfast,

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:20.000
you're done in four days.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.716
AUDIENCE: What are your thoughts
on the electric yogurt makers

00:35:22.716 --> 00:35:24.840
that just hold the constant
temperature, as opposed

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.670
to this one, where you can vary?

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.130
JANET FLETCHER: Yeah,
they're very useful.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.520
That's how I started many
years ago making yogurt, was

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:38.190
when the little five-cup
yogurt makers-- there

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.060
are five cups in them, but the
cups don't even hold a cup.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.190
They're like six ounces,
or even less-- 5 ounces.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.420
So you're not making a whole
lot of yogurt at a time.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.320
But they're reliable.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.034
Like this device, they
determined what that culturing

00:35:52.034 --> 00:35:52.950
temperature should be.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.676
And they hold it steady.

00:35:54.676 --> 00:35:56.300
This one's just a
little more versatile

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.355
because you can use it
for things besides yogurt

00:35:58.355 --> 00:36:00.750
and because I know
I like that 108.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:05.020
That, for me, is my
magic hot button.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.360
And with most of
the yogurt makers,

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.110
you don't have that
capability of setting

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.401
the temperature where you want.

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:11.540
They've preset it.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.350
But to me, the biggest drawback
is they don't make very much.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:19.060
But yeah, if it's something
that gets you going,

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.240
it's a good investment.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.540
There are yogurt makers
out there for $35.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.974
This is probably $135.

00:36:26.974 --> 00:36:27.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.990
JANET FLETCHER: Yeah, great
question about the whey.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.220
This yogurt has
everything in it.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.180
The whey comes
about when I strain

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.240
it to make Greek yogurt
or a thicker yogurt.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.440
The whey is what drains
out through the bottom

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.380
through that cheese
cloth or Plyban.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.560
And it actually still does
have some nutrition in it.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.890
A lot of people will
drink it like buttermilk.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.020
It's tangy.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.960
It's kind of like a thin kiefer.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.085
So it's tangy and tart.

00:36:55.085 --> 00:36:58.100
But it is a very
healthy beverage.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.670
Other people put it in soups
to add some more protein

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.860
and nutrition, instead
of just adding water

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.450
to a soup or a broth.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:10.450
I've used it as a
marinade for meats.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.380
Because it still has
some milk sugar in it,

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.030
it's going to give
you more coloring,

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.240
like on a chicken
or a lamb roast.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.710
To use it for your
marinade, you're

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.330
going to get a browner result.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:24.890
And I've also heard that it's
a great hair conditioner.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:27.370
But I have yet to try that.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.680
The old timers will never
throw away the whey.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.940
They use it, usually,
as a beverage.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.620
This salad that you're
having, the carrot salad,

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.920
it's a nice little
kind of mezze.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.860
If you're serving Middle
Eastern appetizers,

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:47.040
add some feta cheese,
add some Kalamata olives,

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.620
maybe just some crisp
cucumbers and some pita bread

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.990
or a flat bread.

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.010
It's fun to kind of
roll up in a lavash.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.410
It's just a nice first course.

00:37:56.410 --> 00:38:00.110
Or you can have it as a side
dish with lamb or with chicken

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:05.230
or with just some rice as
part of a meatless meal.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.470
And think about the variations.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.280
There are lots of
variations in the book.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.690
You can use grated
zucchini, instead of

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.710
the carrots, the grated,
cooked beets that I mentioned.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.850
You can use golden beets.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.600
That's really pretty.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.487
And I do one with radishes,
just grated radishes.

00:38:22.487 --> 00:38:24.320
I don't know if you've
seen those watermelon

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.260
radishes that some of the stores
have now that are pink inside.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:32.130
That makes a beautiful sort of
[INAUDIBLE] yogurt salad, just

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.510
the grated watermelon radishes,
a little bit of garlic,

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.550
a little parsley.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:38.890
Really simple
salads with yogurt.

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.329
And also in the book,
I would encourage you,

00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:42.870
for those of you
who bought the book,

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.440
to look at some of the soups.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.880
There are not only
some cold soups

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.460
that you can make in the
blender in about five minutes,

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.170
but there are some wonderful
hot soups where you whisk yogurt

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:57.390
into like a base of chick peas
and chicken broth and pasta.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:02.470
And it just gives a nice, creamy
richness and tang at the end.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.810
So just so many savory
ways to use yogurt.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.484
But I hope you'll explore.

00:39:07.484 --> 00:39:09.750
AUDIENCE: If I could just
switch topics for a second--

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.290
I know you write a column
for "The Chronicle."

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.690
And you've written
about 500 books.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:20.080
[LAUGHS] And I know that you
do a lot of food testing, too.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.070
I'm curious if you--
just looking ahead

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.250
into the future in the
next 10, 15 years--

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:26.620
have a sense of just
some interesting food

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.430
trends you see coming up?

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:31.610
JANET FLETCHER: Well, I
think the DIY trend is huge.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:33.340
And I hope it lasts.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.110
I think it will.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:37.620
Because I think once
you've made things yourself

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:41.550
like yogurt at home or
jam at home or pickles,

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.320
you realize how much better
it is than what you can buy.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.800
And it's such a
satisfying thing.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.440
So I think this concept of the
homemade will stay with us.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:57.960
Certainly, I think the locavore
movement is staying with us.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.460
I think it's
enlightened a lot of us

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.520
about how important it is
to preserve small farms,

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.100
to support small
farms in our vicinity,

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.671
to have a low carbon
footprint, and to eat locally.

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:08.920
And we're lucky in California.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.160
Because there's no sacrifice
involved in eating locally.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.290
It's so easy to do.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.492
Gardening has become
huge in recent years.

00:40:18.492 --> 00:40:20.950
And I hope that that's going
to stick with a lot of people.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.570
I'm a certified master gardener.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:29.360
I'm a great advocate for
just the satisfaction

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.170
of gardening at home.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:32.910
You can garden in containers.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.820
You can grow an amazing amount
of vegetables in containers,

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.270
even just some herbs.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.880
It's such a pleasure to go
out and harvest your own herbs

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.170
from a container on
your patio or your deck.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:48.460
But I do think that home
gardening, home vegetable

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.430
gardening, is going to be with
us in a big way in the future.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.874
Because a lot of people
are concerned about what

00:40:55.874 --> 00:40:57.040
they buy at the supermarket.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.123
They're concerned about
what they feed their kids.

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:03.550
And the way to allay that
concern is to grow it yourself.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.680
JENNA: Liv, did you
have a question?

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.220
AUDIENCE: Hi, Janet.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:15.130
Two questions-- do you do yogurt
with goat milk, other milks?

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.320
Maybe some people here
may be interested even

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.142
in soy milk and coconut.

00:41:20.142 --> 00:41:21.600
And the second
question is, then do

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.320
you take your yogurt beyond
the Greek yogurt phase

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.640
and make yogurt cheese
and other dairy products?

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.330
JANET FLETCHER: Great question.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:32.015
Yeah, actually, the
picture on the cover

00:41:32.015 --> 00:41:36.590
is a yogurt cheese, which is
just straining it further.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.260
As I said, for about
an hour, you're

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.360
going to get Greek yogurt.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.240
If you go for, say, 24
hours in the refrigerator,

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.740
you're going to get
something that's

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.190
spreadable like a chevre,
like fresh chevre.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.080
And that's what some
people call yogurt cheese.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.130
In the Middle East,
it's called labneh.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.960
And that will keep
for a month or more

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.560
because you've
taken more whey out.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.786
So you can put herbs on top
of that or fold them in.

00:42:01.786 --> 00:42:03.160
You can put toasted
pumpkin seeds

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.320
or toasted sesame seeds
on top, a little olive

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.350
oil, some garlic.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.170
It makes a great cheese spread.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.980
So yeah, I love yogurt cheese.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.330
And as far as different
types of milk,

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.610
you can certainly use
goat's milk, sheep's milk

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:19.710
if you're lucky enough to
get any, or cow's milk.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.700
Soy milk I've never played with.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.170
And I don't see
how it would work.

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.880
Because the bacteria
that you use to culture

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.730
milk are going
after the lactose.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.350
And soy milk doesn't
have any lactose.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.540
So I don't know.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.640
You might have to find some
other way to culture it.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.350
But goat's milk is going to
work great with the method

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.570
that I describe.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.560
The only difference
is that goat's milk,

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.090
the structure of
it is different.

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.400
And it's more fragile.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.820
It makes a more fragile curd.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.260
So I really would encourage
you to use the dry milk

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.930
technique with goat's milk.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.017
In fact, you'll see--
here's another little thing

00:42:55.017 --> 00:42:55.850
I want to point out.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.429
When you look at a
yogurt container,

00:42:58.429 --> 00:43:00.720
not only do you want to have
the live, active cultures,

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.010
but the thing I avoid is
any of the stabilizers.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:10.490
A lot of them have carrageenan,
gelatin, tapioca starch,

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.850
cornstarch, all of
which are food-safe.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:14.840
They're fine.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.040
But they give the
yogurt a texture

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.580
that's not what I would
consider authentic.

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:23.250
They make it more pudding-like
or more stiff and jelly-like.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.500
So I always look
for a yogurt that

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.760
doesn't have any of these
stabilizers-- the starches

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.090
or gelatin-- in them.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:32.810
They're getting harder to find.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:37.270
But Straus, for example, does
make a plain, whole milk yogurt

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.094
without any stabilizers.

00:43:39.094 --> 00:43:41.010
But if you're going to
buy goat's milk yogurt,

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.800
it's almost certainly going
to have a stabilizer in it

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.650
because the goat's
milk is so fragile.

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:48.052
They just have to do
it, or it won't travel.

00:43:48.052 --> 00:43:50.910
But goat's milk
makes great yogurt.

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:53.820
And I know a lot of people
who can't tolerate cow's milk

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.860
will find the goat's
milk very digestible.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.440
A lot of people who
are lactose intolerant

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.500
find that they can enjoy
yogurt, whereas they

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.602
can't tolerate milk.

00:44:05.602 --> 00:44:07.810
They can tolerate yogurt
because even though it still

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:11.330
has some lactose, it tends
to have less typically.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:15.570
So that's something-- if you're
lactose intolerant or have

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.590
friends who are,
try a little yogurt

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:21.630
and see if you can digest that.

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.610
JENNA: Well, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:24.110
JANET FLETCHER: Thank you.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:24.985
It's been a pleasure.

00:44:24.985 --> 00:44:25.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.160
Thank you.
