MICHAEL BRENNER: We're delighted
to have Jody Adams from Rialto

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:23.280
here-- who we should clap--
with her assistant, Katherine.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.080
And Jody and Katherine are
going to talk in a minute,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.780
but first you have to listen
to me for five minutes.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.810
So Jody and Katherine are going
to talk about fermentation.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.100
But first, let me just give you
a very brief science background.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.860
So the question is, what do all
of these foods have in common?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.410
So all of them have been
produced with the help of bugs.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.590
So you might not like bugs.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.006
You might think bugs are
disgusting, but without bugs, you

00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.800
would have none of the food to
Jody is going to talk about today,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.360
and you would have none of
the foods on the last slide.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.860
So here are some pictures of bugs, just
so it's clear what we're talking about.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.920
So bugs, lactic acid,
bacteria, baker's yeast.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.420
This is aspergillus oryzae,
which is another bug.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.870
And these bugs are the things
that make your food taste good.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.350
I think that's one of the
themes of tonight's lecture.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.010
So bugs are used for
three different things.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.020
For preservation.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.686
They're very important for preservation.

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:22.840
They're very important for
flavor intensification.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.270
And they're also important
for intoxication.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.730
And the way that works
is very important.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.200
So these are bugs, and what
they do is they eat things.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.310
It's just like us.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.867
Sugars, proteins, lipids, and alcohol.

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:36.450
They eat them.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.991
And then what they do is they
convert them into other things.

00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:42.100
Acids, ethanol gas, flavors, aromas.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.080
So bugs turn big molecules
into little molecules.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.450
And in doing that, the little molecules
are the things both taste good,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.810
and oftentimes bugs do this
because they're basically

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.470
warfare agents to kill other bugs.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.060
So for example, Brewer's yeast, which
is the thing that makes alcohol,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.405
the yeast basically
converts sugar into alcohol.

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:07.330
And it does that because
bacteria, it turns out,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.150
don't like to live in alcohol.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.200
So we actually have a homework problem
that we gave our class this week--

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.140
which we won't make you solve, but which
is a fun homework problem-- which is,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.530
suppose you take grape juice, which has
a certain concentration of sugar in it.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.784
Please calculate the alcohol
concentration in the ensuing wine

00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:24.450
after the fermentation reaction is done.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.730
You can calculate it because it's
just converting sugar into ethanol.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.840
So here's cheese.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.860
Does everybody like cheese?

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.050
Does everybody eat the rind cheese?

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.170
So does anybody know what the rind is?

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.850
So the rind is what's called a biofilm.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.450
So this is bacterial sludge.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.860
There's a scientist that works across
the street, named Rachel Dutton, who

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.480
did the following amazing experiment.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.860
She went and got cheese from all over
the world, and she took this biofilm

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.980
and she took DNA sequences of the
microbes that were in the biofilm

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.810
to discover what was in there.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.717
That's Rachel.

00:03:02.717 --> 00:03:04.300
And that's Ben, who works with Rachel.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.704
And they're holding cheese.

00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:09.870
What they discovered-- I'm going to
show you a plot, which is much too busy,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.203
but it's an amazing plot anyway.

00:03:11.203 --> 00:03:14.370
So this is a plot of colors,
and every one of these columns

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.660
is a different cheese.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.100
And the different colors correspond
to different species of bacteria.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.140
Or microbes, actually.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.160
They could be fungi.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.760
So the amazing thing is that every kind
of cheese has its own mixture of bugs.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.920
It's not just one bug.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.840
It's a lot of different bugs.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.006
And the tastes that are
made come from all the bugs.

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:31.650
And good luck.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.250
You can't go to the
store and order the bugs.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.340
That's the whole problem.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.730
So if you want to make
the cheese, you have

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.521
to find the right place where they
happen to have that kind of bug.

00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:40.320
This is my simple way
of thinking about it.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.460
And then you need to leave it there.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.050
If you're lucky, it'll make the cheese.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.980
And it's just amazing.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.200
I mean, who knew you were
eating all these bugs?

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.084
OK, so now the other point I want
to make, and then I'll shut up,

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:54.250
is that it turns out that in cooking--
if you think about where else to bugs

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.250
appear in food, the other place
they appear is when things rot.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.810
And cooking is actually
not so far from rotting.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.410
So I have to end with an equation.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.400
So OK here you go.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.930
So why are there so many bugs?

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.030
So here's the reason.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.620
Imagine we're talking about people.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.280
So everybody knows that
what happens to one person

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.880
is that every person divides
and makes two people.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.140
And then of course, the
older person dies off.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.910
And then the second people die.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.230
And then they make four people.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.320
And then they die and then
they make eight people.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.720
And that's how life goes, right?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.678
I mean, there are minor
variations around that.

00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:27.100
But that's basically what happens.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.240
So if you count the number
of people as a function

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.990
of the number of generations, then
there's this wonderful formula.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.590
The number of people at
time t is 2 to the n,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.130
where n is the generation number.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.890
Where n is just the time
that's elapsed, divided

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.170
by the time for every generation.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.340
And that's our equation.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.570
So you all have to clap.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.330
And the thing is, this equation
explains a lot about everything

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.439
that you're going to hear, and
about everything that I just said,

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.480
for the following reason.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.880
Actually, forget that slide.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.850
So here's the thing.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.670
So we divide.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.850
Humans divide, I don't
know, every 30 years.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.860
Something like that.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.804
I mean on average.

00:05:02.804 --> 00:05:04.720
I don't know what the
number is at the moment.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.309
So it turns out that salmonella
divides every 20 minutes.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.350
That's pretty much the
fastest a cell can divide.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.490
Salmonella, E. coli,
It's about 20 minutes.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.100
So in 12 hours, that's 720 minutes.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.220
So that corresponds to 720
divided by 20 generations.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.950
And so that corresponds
to 10 to the 10 bugs.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.260
12 hours.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.000
If you have a cookie on the
counter, one salmonella.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.990
Come back.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.751
10 to 10 bugs.

00:05:29.751 --> 00:05:30.500
So then you worry.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.110
Do you have to worry about this?

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.660
So it turns out that every bug weighs
about 10 to the minus 10 grams.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.800
So this is about 7 grams of bugs.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.210
That's a lot of bugs.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.270
And that's only after 12 hours.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.840
So if you wait 24 hours, it turns
out you have 10 to the 21 bugs.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.700
Just keep going.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.270
And that corresponds
to 10 to the 11 grams

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.680
of bugs, which is the weight of
about a large number of cars.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.130
So with that, I would like to turn
it over to Jody and Katherine.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.046
JODY ADAMS: Thank you.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.021
Well, it's always been my dream
to teach a class at Harvard.

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:12.520
Not really.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.019
But anyway.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.860
I come from an academic family
and, I ended up as a cook.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.830
So coming back to academia
is an interesting route.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.160
But I'm thrilled to be here, and I
hope that we entertain you and give you

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.380
some good information and
teach you a few recipes.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.890
I'm going to start with
fermentation is your friend.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.420
I think that we have,
certainly in the past 20 years,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:49.650
become really nervous about foods that
have microbes associated with them.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.349
Because we think that we can
actually separate the two,

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:53.390
which of course we can't.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.160
Fermented food, for us as
chefs, there's this scary thing

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.892
that happened when we were
told that cured hams from Italy

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:09.600
weren't going to be
allowed to come here.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.474
Unpasteurized cheese wasn't going
to be able to come to this country,

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.510
because they were so
terrified of microbes.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.970
And we know that
microbes are our friends,

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.470
and that fermentation is our friend.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.970
It's a lot more than rotting food.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.910
From a chef's perspective,
fermentation is all about flavor.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.560
My early memories of fermentation
are traveling in Europe

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.980
when I was in my early 20s, and going to
every market, living in youth hostels,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.610
and carrying around bags of fruit.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.400
And I was determined to try
as many things as I could.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.230
I didn't know I was
going to become a chef,

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.460
but I was certainly interested in food.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.860
And I'd get back to the youth
hostel and it was August

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.879
and they would be bubbling.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:56.920
And they were fermenting.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.280
And I'd throw them away.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.650
Fast forward to one of the
early holidays my husband

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.620
and I, when we were first married,
we didn't have a lot of money.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.100
We decided we would make something.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:13.710
By that time I was a cook, and we
would make apple butter for everybody.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.500
We bought really expensive Calvados.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.280
We spent hours making this apple butter.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:24.630
We had little labels made with
everybody's-- not only their name,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.930
but a caricature of
them on these labels.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.560
And we bottled the apple butter.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:37.330
And we got calls a week later
from everybody saying, it's alive!

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.720
So it was fermenting.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.289
So they threw it away.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.800
But anyway, what I know
about fermentation now

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.600
is that fermentation is flavor.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.680
The reason that it's
important for a chef

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.750
is that we are in the business of
creating a Proustian experience,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.980
and that is flavor plus emotion.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.600
Because flavor plus emotion
is going to give you a memory.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.040
Emotion, for us, is hospitality.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.120
That's what we do in restaurants.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.460
To make you feel like you're the
most important person in the universe

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.410
and we love you and you're
part of our community.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:26.500
And flavor is what we strive for, in
delicious food with balanced flavors

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.760
that will help create a good memory.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.080
So the memories for us
equal repeat customers.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.900
Repeat customers equal dollars.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.880
And those dollars allow me to go
back to Italy and find more flavors.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.930
So flavor is really, really important.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.640
And what's interesting for me about
fermentation starts with flavor.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.370
And then when I was asked to teach
this, as I started reading about it

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.550
and reading about the science
and the other benefits

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.540
to fermentation-- I
mean, we all know there's

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.290
the buzz going around about
probiotics in our internal flora,

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.080
and all kinds of interesting
things that people

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:12.240
are doing to try and reverse the
sterilization of our internal flora.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.330
So as Mike was saying,
in fermentation, there

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.190
are actors which are the good microbes.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.720
I mean, they could be good or bad, but
we're going to focus on the good ones.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.760
There's an action, which is their
consumption of carbohydrates,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.740
for the most part.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.500
And the outcome for them is energy.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.500
They have to eat.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.180
And they eat to reproduce.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.580
To become that 10 to
the bazillionth number.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:45.420
But for us, what's
beneficial is the acid.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.180
The alcohol, and carbon
dioxide and other things,

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:54.120
which are flavor and
texture, preservation,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.550
and then third, health benefits.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.250
And so we start with flavor.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.350
The next thing that's
important to us the chefs

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.110
is preservation, because
we can hold things.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.610
And the last is health.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.080
And the other thing in there is, of
course, that Michael pointed out,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.319
was alcohol but I was focused on food.

00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:16.610
I have a little bit of history.

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:21.320
It's a brief outline,
but it was the things

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.650
that struck me as being interesting.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.340
Of course, we know fermentation has
been around since the beginning of time.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:32.870
It was first recorded 7,000 to
6,000 BCE in Neolithic China,

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:40.260
both in fermented rice as an
alcoholic beverage, but also in milk.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.820
It was in 1837 that
yeast was identified.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.410
In 1840, that bacteria was identified.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.060
And not long after that Louis
Pasteur connected yeast and alcohol

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.270
fermentation, believing
that the yeast was

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.360
a vital force that caused fermentation.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.029
That it wasn't something that
was happening in the food itself,

00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:01.320
but there was this vital force.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.700
And then a couple years later, he
showed that bacteria soured milk.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.810
And of course, we know
about pasteurization,

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.220
and it was named after
him, and all that.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.520
But there was another
guy named Eduard Buchner,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.530
who separated the
enzymatic part of the yeast

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.320
and identified that as the catalyst.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.170
So it wasn't the yeast as a whole but
that but the enzyme as a catalyst.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.720
And is that the zymose?

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.540
Does anybody know?

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.560
Zymaze?

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.060
No?

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.559
No.

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:34.320
Good.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.300
Well, Pasteur is known
as the first zymologist,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.050
but I couldn't figure
out what that meant.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:47.820
and then Edward Buchner won the Nobel
Prize for his work on fermentation.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.420
Yogurt, of course, fermented milk.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.450
Been around forever.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.870
Been around all over Europe.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:59.280
But it was first brought to this
country in 1910 as a health food,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.000
and for digestion.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.410
In 1920s, there was prohibition
of fermented beverages.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.680
Now you think about that.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.050
I mean, it's going to happen.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.050
It's been happening since
the beginning of time.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.690
To try and prohibit that just
seems, at this point, crazy.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:20.500
In 1948, the first antibacterial
soap was introduced.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.690
It was Dial.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:29.810
In the 1950s, antibacterial soaps
started to be used in hospitals.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:34.760
And then in the '90s, there was the
antibacterial craze domestically

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.630
in households, which to me
was a really scary time.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.910
And I think that we're shifting
that wave a little bit.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.450
And for sure, in my world,
fermentation is back.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:55.790
I was asked by a young guy
last year at some food event

00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:00.020
whether or not I had a
fermentation program at Rialto.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.170
I hadn't actually heard
of a fermentation program.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.570
I didn't know that was something
I was supposed to have.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.210
But it is what young chefs
are really interested in.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:13.480
Of all of the trendy paths
that they can go down,

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.160
I think that this is one
that is really compelling.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.890
Really interesting scientifically.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.310
Really interesting in
terms of the role it

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:27.170
can play environmentally, and also
in terms of internal health, as well.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.665
Both internal and external
health of our bodies.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.890
So fermentation is
anaerobic, for the most part.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.590
It's the metabolism or the
digestive process of microorganisms.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.440
Yeast and bacteria are the ones
that we're going to focus on.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.920
Yeast actually starts with an aerobic
fermentation, and then shifts.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.260
But we're going to ignore
the oxygen in that.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.170
Why do they do it?

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.350
As I said before, they do it for energy.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.220
They do it to eat.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.790
How?

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:03.350
They find carbohydrates, gobble them up,
and excrete alcohol, acids, and gases.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:08.410
So their excretions are what we like.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.590
And for us, again, it's flavor in
beer, pickles, yogurt, bread, cheese,

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.230
prosciutto.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.600
Who are the microbes?

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.840
Yeast is a single-cell fungus.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.810
Bacteria a single-cell microbe.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.460
And from what I understand,
and I'm not a scientist,

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:30.550
the lactobacilli hangs out with
bread, yogurt, and pickles.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.092
Or in vegetable fermentation.

00:15:32.092 --> 00:15:34.550
And those are the three things
I'm going to show you today.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.770
Fermentation in bread.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.900
Fermentation in milk and yogurt.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.470
And fermentation in pickles.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.820
So some fermented foods that you know.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.370
Yogurt, cheese, preserved lemons.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:58.080
Garum, which is a fermented fish sauce.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.370
Prosciutto, dry sausages, bread,
cultured butter, wine, beer,

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:08.470
hard cider, sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles,
kombucha, coffee, chocolate, olives,

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.030
miso.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:14.430
And then two of the most
disgusting fermented foods ever.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.530
I've had both of them.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:22.090
And one of them is hakarl, which
is Icelandic fermented shark.

00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:27.430
It's a particular kind
of shark, and it has

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:33.050
a very high uric acid and
another bacteria on it

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.730
that has to be squelched.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.980
And so it's buried in sand.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.730
And it just kind of rots there
for 6 to 12 weeks, and ferments.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:46.180
It drains out the fluids,
and that is hung and dried.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.020
Has anybody ever had this?

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.936
It's harsh.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.340
It really is.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.700
It smells like rotting food.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.800
It's really ammoniated and
not terribly pleasant to eat.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.250
But if you're presented with it,
you absolutely have to eat it.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.930
If you don't, you're a wimp.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.450
You would only have it, I think, in
Iceland or a Nordic country like that.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.310
And it would be
insulting for you not to.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:20.310
So if you go on, particularly, if you
go on a trip with a group of people

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.619
who are visiting a country
like Iceland and you're

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.770
being toured around, for sure you're
going to be asked to try this.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.040
So just be prepared.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.330
But it's followed up with an aquavit
that has a licoricey kind of flavor

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.980
to it.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.900
And then you're done.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.890
In my family, we there was something
called a no thank you helping.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.150
At every meal, you had to try what
was presented in front of you.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.510
My mother only cooked one
meal, so you had to try.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.482
And even if you hated liver three
weeks ago, you still have to try it.

00:17:51.482 --> 00:17:52.940
It's called a no thank you helping.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.920
So that's what this is.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.140
The other rotting food
that's kind of gross

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:06.270
is Sardinian pecorino cheese that
goes through two-stage fermentation.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.200
The first one is microbial.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.580
And then the second stage is
actually the larvae of sheep flies.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.800
They're little, tiny flies that land.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:21.610
The cheese is cut open and they're
invited to come in and land and lay

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:22.480
their little eggs.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.965
And the larvae eat up the cheese and
make this kind of soft, gooey stuff.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.842
So there it is.

00:18:32.842 --> 00:18:34.050
My husband took this picture.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.120
We were in Sardinia in
the beginning of October.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.960
And you can actually see, with
this picture, what's happening,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.990
I think with microbes.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.710
You know, the microbes work the
same way that these larvae do.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:53.190
So it's actually quite delicious,
if you like a strong cheese.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.830
It's sort of like a Gorgonzola.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.870
It's kind of soft.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:03.360
And you just have to get over the bugs.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.360
And I said that to my husband,
and he said, "They are not bugs."

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.140
Anyway, it's delicious.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.140
But it's also very acquired.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.070
And it is kind of ammoniated as well.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:21.090
So we're going to shift from
larva and cheese to bread.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.990
And I'm going to make a
loaf of bread, and you

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.480
are going to try bread in three stages.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.760
Katherine works in our
pastry department at Rialto.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.760
And she made three
different batches of bread.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.285
One she started on Friday.

00:19:40.285 --> 00:19:41.410
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: Friday.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:42.980
And then Saturday.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.060
And then yesterday.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.080
JODY ADAMS: Yesterday.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.630
So the bread fermented.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.880
It's the same recipe.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.010
It was all baked this morning, but
it's three different fermentations.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:56.800
So the flavor in bread comes from
yeast, water, flour and salt.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.960
That's all that's in there.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.630
It has a tiny bit of
molasses in it, actually,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.734
but it doesn't necessarily
certainly have to have it.

00:20:04.734 --> 00:20:07.275
It's dependent on those things,
plus times, plus temperature.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.850
The water is mixed with the yeast.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.770
The yeast is hydrated.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:20.840
And then that hydrated
yeast, the enzymes work

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:26.200
on some rogue sugars, apparently,
that are floating around

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.550
in flour from milling.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:34.280
There's some damaged cells that sort of
kick-start the whole enzymatic process.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:41.030
So we need the big starch
molecules, that are big and knotted,

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:50.760
to be broken down so that the yeast
can actually eat them and produce

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.620
alcohol and carbon dioxide.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.680
So the yeast, as I said,
the enzymes break down

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.710
these big molecules to
glucose and fructose,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.910
producing alcohol and carbon dioxide.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:07.910
And then if you allow the bread to
go through a further fermentation--

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:13.160
so the ones that were fermented from
Friday, then some bacteria come in

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.070
and they start eating
up the maltose and it

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:22.790
goes through this second
fermentation that produces

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.180
acids that give sourdough its flavor.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.990
And that acidic content in a bread
will help preserve the bread,

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.460
so sourdough breads have a longer
shelf life than ones that aren't sour.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.960
So I'm going to stop all
that talking for a minute.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.055
We need just a little bit of yeast.

00:21:40.055 --> 00:21:40.930
Like that much yeast?

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.971
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: Yeah.

00:21:41.971 --> 00:21:45.140
It's two teaspoons to this recipe,
but we're just going to eyeball that.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.970
JODY ADAMS: Oh, did I
put the recipe-- there.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.970
Two teaspoons of yeast.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.140
A couple of tablespoons of molasses.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.750
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: That's
strictly for flavor.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:06.802
JODY ADAMS: And it can
kick-start the yeast.

00:22:06.802 --> 00:22:07.760
But it's not necessary.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.005
And then we have about
two and a quarter--

00:22:14.005 --> 00:22:15.880
KATHERINE BURCHMAN:
That's two and a quarter.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.212
JODY ADAMS: Two and a quarter
pounds of white flour.

00:22:21.212 --> 00:22:22.920
KATHERINE BURCHMAN:
We want half of that.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.420
JODY ADAMS: And this is whole wheat.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.080
And then we have a couple
tablespoons of salt.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:31.826
Very scientific.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.820
So you can do this,
of course, in a mixer.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:47.870
But I think that if you're
making bread at home,

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:56.753
the satisfaction of kneading
dough is really worthwhile.

00:23:00.201 --> 00:23:02.450
And I'm going to get this
started and then, of course,

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:03.533
turn it over to Katherine.

00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:07.610
KATHERINE BURCHMAN:
When it gets too messy.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.660
JODY ADAMS: When it gets really hard.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:16.090
So what we're doing is, the yeast
is going to be distributed in here.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.300
You don't really have
to proof the yeast,

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.310
unless you think you've had the yeast
for 100 years and it's completely dead.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:29.030
Proofing the yeast is re-hydrating
it, bringing it back to life,

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.330
and proving that it's alive
because it bubbles up.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.980
But you don't really need to do that.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:42.970
What happens with bread is
that-- right now, what I'm doing

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.060
is developing the gluten.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:51.860
The gluten is the protein
that are forming strings,

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:57.190
so that when the dough
rises, it has a structure.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:03.550
And if you are making a pie crust,
you don't want to develop the gluten.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.520
You wouldn't do this.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.728
You wouldn't knead the dough.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.910
There are some doughs that
don't need to be kneaded,

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:23.270
and that's because in fact, just
the action of the yeast fermenting

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.960
gets the gluten going.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:32.050
There's enough activity, actually,
that the gluten will develop that way.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:36.190
But they tend to be a softer dough.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.650
And we want this to have some structure.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:43.365
So when you're kneading dough,
see, you can get your exercise.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:51.560
As long as you're using your core.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.880
But this is really fun to do.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.860
Honestly.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:06.850
We spend so much time saving time
so we can go to the gym and do this.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.365
Why not make a really
beautiful batch of bread?

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.660
OK, go at it, Katherine.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.940
I already went to the gym today.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.390
KATHERINE BURCHMAN:
You're really strong.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:30.584
JODY ADAMS: Well, you have to stand
with your Pilates stance, like this.

00:25:30.584 --> 00:25:31.375
Like you're boxing.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:40.350
So we're going to let that-- actually,
my hands are covered with gluten.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.660
But isn't it exciting to know
that what we're doing here

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.830
is developing this gluten?

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.105
So we're setting it up for success.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:00.980
So as the yeast is giving off all that
carbon dioxide, and most of the alcohol

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.120
is going to go off into the air.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.800
But the carbon dioxide is coming
up, and the gluten strands

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.290
are holding it all together, so
you have this beautiful structure.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:16.300
If they break, if you over-proof a
dough, you end up with a cottony bread.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.350
You know how Wonder
Bread is really cottony?

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.540
It's because it's way over-proofed.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:28.970
If you want a dough that has a nice,
even structure and also great flavor,

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.260
you don't want to use a lot of
east and you want a slow rise.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.420
So what we do at Rialto,
actually, is add ice to the dough.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:41.210
So instead of three
cups of water, we would

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.690
have used-- this is actually wrong.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.885
This is supposed to be pounds of flour.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.430
But that's not 10 minutes.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.388
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: OK.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.040
You got it.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:05.795
JODY ADAMS: So we're going to put it in
a bowl, and put in a little bit of oil.

00:27:05.795 --> 00:27:11.880
The oil it just helps it slither up
the sides of the pan as it rises.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.690
It also, if you will roll the ball
in the oil, and it will protect--

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:20.640
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: Also,
if you're going to cover it,

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.290
if you have oil on the
top and as it rises,

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:29.120
it won't stick when you're taking the
cover off, which is super annoying.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.680
JODY ADAMS: And it
won't dry out, either.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.820
Then what we recommend
you do is actually

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:41.150
make a line where the dough started,
if you're a first-time bread baker.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.280
You put the dough and you cover it.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.210
You let it rise.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:49.930
It can take an hour, if you put it
in a warm place, it's going to rise.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:53.180
You're going to have a dough that
doesn't have very much character.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.190
It's going to be a fairly sweet
dough, because the yeast will not

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.120
have gone into the second
fermentation, which

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:05.320
is with the maltose producing the acid.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:13.110
It will have broken down the starch
molecules of the flour into sugars.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:16.680
So you'll still have
some sugar in there.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.370
Once it rises, it'll look like that.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.490
You can see all the bubbles in there.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.100
That's the carbon dioxide coming up.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.000
And that's the right amount.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.830
You don't want it to go much more, or
as I said, it's going to be cottony.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.907
Then you dump it out onto the counter,
and you make a beautiful bread.

00:28:36.907 --> 00:28:38.490
We're not going to have time for that.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.430
But we are going to let
this rise while we talk.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:48.340
We also, at Rialto and also at Trade,
we let our doughs rise overnight

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.786
in the refrigerator.

00:28:49.786 --> 00:28:51.660
Makes a much more
interesting flavored dough.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.810
And sometimes let them go for two days.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:59.290
And then you have a happy daughter.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.120
She's 18 and she's in
Paris right now, and she

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.380
would hate me if she knew I do that.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.550
I couldn't resist.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:13.640
So you have, on your plate,
three different breads.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:19.405
You want to start with the
one-- where are our students?

00:29:19.405 --> 00:29:22.280
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: I think they
said the red or the yellow toothpick

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.980
is from Friday's batch of dough.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.240
JODY ADAMS: So you want
to start with the one that

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.157
doesn't have a toothpick in it.

00:29:31.157 --> 00:29:32.490
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: Yesterday's?

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.300
JODY ADAMS: Yesterday's.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.210
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: No toothpick.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:34.650
JODY ADAMS: No toothpick.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.020
KATHERINE BURCHMAN:
Saturday is blue or green.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.100
And then Friday is yellow or red.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.090
JODY ADAMS: OK.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:45.015
So go none, and then blue or green.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.120
Oh, god, let's write on the blackboard!

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.730
Zero is Sunday.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.720
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: Green
or blue is Saturday.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.442
JODY ADAMS: Green or blue is Saturday.

00:30:03.442 --> 00:30:05.650
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: And then
red or yellow is Friday.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:10.550
JODY ADAMS: Red or yellow is Friday.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.172
OK.

00:30:12.172 --> 00:30:14.130
I think you want to start
with the sweeter one,

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:20.710
and then go to the one
that has more flavor.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:21.920
Pretty interesting, huh?

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.320
You don't always want to
make a sourdough bread.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:34.410
If you're making a Danish pastry
that has a lot of butter in it,

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:39.380
you don't want it necessarily
to have a lot of sour in it.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.010
There are other ways of flavoring
bread, other than fermentation.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:48.350
You can change the
liquid that you're using.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.900
Milk.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.360
You can add milk to make it richer.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.902
You can add cider.

00:30:52.902 --> 00:30:53.860
You can add buttermilk.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.200
Buttermilk's a favorite.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.380
You can add fats to it, which
will make a softer dough.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.770
Oils or butters, because
they're going to cut the gluten.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.360
They're going to soften the gluten.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.310
You can add other
sugars and more sugars.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.740
You can add eggs that
will enrich the dough.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.510
Different kinds of grain.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.755
Rye, corn, buckwheat.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.575
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: We use a bulgar.

00:31:21.575 --> 00:31:21.890
JODY ADAMS: Cracked wheat.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:22.390
Bulgar.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.410
Sprouted grains, nuts and
seeds, herbs and spices,

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:31.400
dried fruits, cheese, vegetables,
chopped vegetables, vegetables puree.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.590
You can use a vegetable puree as a base.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.000
But those are going to ferment.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.970
Just anything sweet you add is going to
add to the fermentation of the bread.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:41.700
And meat.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.853
Was that interesting?

00:31:47.853 --> 00:31:48.436
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:31:51.141 --> 00:31:53.140
JODY ADAMS: I'm used to
teaching like 20 people,

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.600
and we have a nice dialogue going.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.270
OK, so I didn't finish this process.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:02.580
So the enzymes in yeast act on
the glucose and the fructose,

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.285
producing the alcohol
and carbon dioxide.

00:32:05.285 --> 00:32:06.410
Then we have the sourdough.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:17.305
And then the heat the oven works with
the acid in the alcohol as it rises.

00:32:17.305 --> 00:32:21.920
It's called-- what's that called?

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.660
Because it will continue
to rise in the oven.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.340
Oven spring.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.680
That's right. thank you.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.630
Oven spring.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.620
And it produces esters.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:37.850
So the alcohol and the acid come
together and produce esters.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:42.190
And that's where you get the
nice, fabulous aroma of bread.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:51.170
And it's that aroma that induces
feelings of warmth and memory

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.460
and bring people back.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:59.660
OK, so now I'm going to make yogurt.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.735
So we'll move over here.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.320
So that was yeast fermentation.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:13.115
And now we're going to talk
about milk fermentation.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.210
Yogurt is the easiest
thing in the world to make.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.740
And it is so good for you.

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:34.130
So now you're getting a taste of milk.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:35.830
Milk.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.962
Start with milk.

00:33:37.962 --> 00:33:39.295
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: Here you go.

00:33:39.295 --> 00:33:42.140
Here are your starters.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.890
JODY ADAMS: So we're going to bring
the milk up to about 180 degrees.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:52.240
That 180 degrees denatures
the proteins, which

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:58.660
helps with the physical structure
of the yogurt down the road.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.010
So you don't end up with curds.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.640
You just end up with a solid mass.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.650
Can you go see, do they
have the big jar of yogurt?

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:21.429
Once it's at 185 degrees,
you let it cool to about 115.

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:27.440
And then you can mix in either
yogurt or a yogurt culture.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.469
And I just discovered this.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:32.010
I know I'm not supposed to advertise.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:37.739
But this company online, their
cultures don't have anything in them

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:41.190
except organic milk and live cultures.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:46.380
Some other ones have other kinds
of sugars that they've added,

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.830
but this is just that.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:35:04.660
And this amount of yogurt will help
turn 42 ounces of milk into yogurt.

00:35:10.469 --> 00:35:12.260
KATHERINE BURCHMAN:
Did you need a big jar?

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.805
JODY ADAMS: No, I wanted to show-- is
there a big jar of yogurt back there?

00:35:14.805 --> 00:35:15.690
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: I don't think so.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.118
They're spooning it out right now.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.760
JODY ADAMS: Yogurt is
incredibly forgiving.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.880
I had to make a huge batch
of yogurt last night,

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.520
and I once I got it into
the jars, I thought,

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.770
I don't have my groovy little-- this
is a groovy little yogurt maker.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:41.310
I didn't have anything like this
for this much jars this size.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:48.040
So I just put it in the
oven at about 110 degrees.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.830
I kept checking it, and it
actually stayed in there overnight.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.540
It was a very slow
fermentation overnight.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:07.530
So what's happening is the bacteria
are eating the sugars and the milk.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.220
The lactose in the milk.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.540
And producing lactic acid.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:17.030
And because the sugars are eating
that lactose, well, a bunch of things

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.530
happen.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:21.600
One of them is you get this
great acidic flavor of yogurt.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:27.470
You also have a milk product that
now has tons of good microbes in it.

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:30.310
It's a very good, healthy
thing for you to eat.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:35.150
And the third is that it's
pre-digested the lactose.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:39.880
So people who have any
kind of lactose problems

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:47.210
are able to eat yogurt much more
easily than they can fresh milk.

00:36:51.639 --> 00:36:53.805
That's going to take forever
to turn to 180 degrees.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.810
Fermentation does take
some time and preparation.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:08.030
Once you've mixed the yogurt or
the starter into the warm milk,

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.570
then you put it into jars.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:13.420
You put it into a place that has a
temperature of about 110 degrees,

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.900
and you let it incubate.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.700
It takes at least five hours.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.960
I like to leave it longer.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:23.010
Sometimes, even in these little jars,
I'll let it go in for nine hours.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.770
You get a more interesting
flavored yogurt.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.610
It's a little more acidic.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:33.290
And then you just put the tops
on, and put it in the fridge.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:39.290
And of course it lasts a really
long time, because it's fermented.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:47.230
And this company sells these-- not this
company, but anyway-- sells the tops,

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.062
and you can put the date on it .

00:37:49.062 --> 00:37:51.520
You turn the little knob and
it tells you what the date is.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.122
So you keep track of
how old your yogurt is.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.021
The other kinds of fermented
milks that are also delicious.

00:38:11.021 --> 00:38:11.520
Yogurt.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.020
Kefir.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:19.430
Kefir actually has, I
believe yeast in it, as well.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:24.570
It's more complicated culture.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.830
Clabber, which is a kind of
a cheesy kind of a thing.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:33.530
And then skyr, which is another
Icelandic sort of yogurt that

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:36.270
apparently now is quite
solid, but originally was

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:40.270
more of a more liquid kind of a drink.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:44.650
And they're all slightly different
in what the bacterias are

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:51.170
that cause them to ferment.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:56.340
But originally, probably, somebody
was carrying milk around in a bag

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:00.990
and there were microbes and bacteria in
the bag, and the yogurt just happened.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.859
Any questions?

00:39:09.859 --> 00:39:14.219
AUDIENCE: Does yogurt have alcohol
[INAUDIBLE] fermentation [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:15.760
JODY ADAMS: Does yogurt have alcohol?

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.470
I don't believe so.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:23.110
Unless there was a yeast that was
introduced to it, I don't believe so.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:24.956
But I don't know.

00:39:24.956 --> 00:39:26.846
Does anybody know?

00:39:26.846 --> 00:39:30.337
I don't know that these
bacteria produce alcohol.

00:39:30.337 --> 00:39:30.836
No.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:45.980
I'm going to come back to
that once the milk is done.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:51.120
But in the mean time, I'm
going to make pickles.

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.740
Or did you try your yogurt yet?

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.757
Or did you just have milk?

00:39:54.757 --> 00:39:55.340
Just had milk.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.350
OK.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.020
Yogurt's coming.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:19.940
Yogurt is also not something that you
have to eat with fruit in the bottom.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:28.060
It's really delicious to
just eat it by itself,

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.040
if you have a really good yogurt.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.850
And I would highly recommend
that when you're buying yogurt,

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.760
you look at the package.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:42.460
And if there's any additives, if there
is anything other than yogurt culture

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.180
and milk, I would stay away from them.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.557
There's really no reason.

00:40:47.557 --> 00:40:48.057
Yes?

00:40:48.057 --> 00:40:49.035
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:57.970
JODY ADAMS: The way to thicken it is by
using-- this is actually a Greek yogurt

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:02.135
culture that I have here,
that I haven't actually tried.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:11.170
And it calls for heating it to
a slightly lower temperature.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.970
So I'm not sure what
will happen with this.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.010
But the way to make Greek yogurt
is to put it in cheesecloth.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.447
It's getting rid of the whey.

00:41:18.447 --> 00:41:19.530
That's how it's thickened.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:21.790
Don't add a thickener.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:25.240
A lot of these Greek yogurts,
they've added something to it

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.810
to thicken the yogurt, and
it's not a Greek yogurt.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.600
And if you're going to eat
yogurt, eat whole milk yogurt.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.890
We're allowed to eat fat now.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.724
It's good for you.

00:41:36.724 --> 00:41:37.390
It's satisfying.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:47.620
We use yogurt a lot, as a
condiment, as an additive,

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:53.765
as a balance to lots of
different kinds of dishes.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:02.150
Let's say you have a rich
butternut squash soup,

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:03.980
and it's sweet because
of butternut squash,

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.640
and you want something
to balance the sweetness.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.140
Then you add some acid to it.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.120
And the acid in this
case would be yogurt.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.057
Really refreshing.

00:42:12.057 --> 00:42:12.765
Really delicious.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:26.650
If you think about adding-- you take
a bowl of yogurt and put in raisins,

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:29.440
and you put in granola
that's laden with sugar,

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.930
and then you add some nuts and
honey, and blah, blah, blah.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.140
You're putting all this
sweet stuff into yogurt.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.570
Think about doing the same thing,
but use savory ingredients.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.060
Use tomatoes and cucumbers.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.140
Put some garlic in there.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.660
Put some nuts in there.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:47.580
It's a really delicious base.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.220
Yogurt!

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:48.969
Here comes yogurt.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.920
So this was made with a traditional
culture, whatever that means.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.600
But these bacteria like the heat.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.440
That's why we heat the milk.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.700
Not just to denature
the protein, but also

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.320
to provide an environment
that the bacteria like.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.420
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: It's heating up.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.129
I can see the steam.

00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:20.920
JODY ADAMS: It needs
to be almost bubbling.

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:33.208
OK, let's do pickles.

00:43:33.208 --> 00:43:34.999
KATHERINE BURCHMAN:
Want me to take it out?

00:43:34.999 --> 00:43:35.707
JODY ADAMS: Yeah.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:51.130
So now, while we're waiting for our
yogurt-- and this won't take very long.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:05.140
OK, so we have taken cucumbers
and removed the ends from them.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:07.540
Apparently, they start
rotting from the outside in.

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.330
So you want to take those ends off.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:10.370
We soaked them in water.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.560
We're going to put them in here.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.060
You want to put them in a clean jar.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.530
I know we're adding grape
leaves to make them crispy.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:46.485
Because the tannins in the grape
leaves help keep the cucumbers crispy.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:54.232
And I don't know why that is either.

00:44:54.232 --> 00:44:56.315
And then we're going to
throw in some peppercorns.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.520
You can put dill in here.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.900
And you can put all kinds of flavorings.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:10.360
And these are pickles, and
these are fermented pickles.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.590
The pickles that you get that
are preserved under vinegar

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:16.590
are not fermented pickles.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.340
They're still pickles.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:22.220
And the vinegar's fermented,
but they're not fermented.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:27.080
What happens here is the
naturally occurring bacteria

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:33.300
on the outside of the
cucumbers --without oxygen,

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.460
because we're going to pour
the water over them-- start

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.580
to eat the naturally occurring sugars
on the outside of the cucumber,

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.850
and they ferment.

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.710
And they give off acid and gas.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.210
And you leave the top off,
particularly in the beginning,

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:54.600
to allow the carbon dioxide
to go out, otherwise

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.080
you end up with my apple
butter that explodes.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:05.750
But the acid stays here with the
cucumbers, and it sours them.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:13.710
And initially they're kind of salty, but
then the salt is balanced by the acid.

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:19.485
So we're giving you now
a cucumber and a pickle.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.440
I like these because they don't
have very many seeds in them.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.120
I like smaller ones.

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.360
Yeah, these are sort of
like the Persian ones.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.312
Do we have more?

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.100
So they would fit better into this jar.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:48.270
In a bigger jar, you can just drop them.

00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:53.605
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:00.080
JODY ADAMS: Possibly, but I wash them.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:07.360
But it seems to work.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:14.240
I would bet that the bacteria on the
cucumber beats out the other ones.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.710
Should I go faster?

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:16.740
MICHAEL BRENNER: No, I wasn't
trying to speed you up.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.070
We just have microphones
if anyone wants questions.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:19.800
JODY ADAMS: Am I getting boring?

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.425
MICHAEL BRENNER: No, you're not boring.

00:47:21.425 --> 00:47:23.180
No, this is great.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:32.870
JODY ADAMS: So the other thing you
want to do is when you're doing this,

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:36.660
you want to put something on top
that's going to hold all of the--

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.090
is my pickle jar back there?

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.040
Or no.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.200
You need to put something on top to
hold the cucumbers under the water

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.570
so that they don't interact with oxygen.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.880
My guess would be that, about your
question about the grape leaves,

00:47:52.880 --> 00:48:00.950
is that the bacteria in the
pickles that produces so much acid

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.240
is making the environment not
a place for other bacteria.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:14.390
I mean, that's why it's
a method of preservation.

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.725
There are all kinds of other bacteria.

00:48:25.848 --> 00:48:30.550
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: It's at 140.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.820
JODY ADAMS: These are the
cucumbers that we used.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.591
And some of them are even
smaller, as you can see.

00:48:36.591 --> 00:48:38.715
These are nice, little ones
without a lot of seeds.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.255
So in here, we have these weights.

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:02.862
Can you see this?

00:49:02.862 --> 00:49:03.362
No.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:13.840
It's turned a little bit cloudy.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.875
This is about two weeks.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.825
And these cucumbers
were a little smaller.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:30.590
You can see, though.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.590
They look like real pickles, right?

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:34.450
Pretty cool.

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:36.430
It's so easy.

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:40.090
You're going to want to start your own
fermentation program in your house.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:51.340
OK, we're going to cheat a little bit,
because I'm going to finish this up.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.360
You can see the difference in
the color and what happens.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.200
And clearly, that's acid.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:02.570
And all that is salt, peppercorns,
and garlic, and water.

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:06.196
It's all the acid from the fermentation.

00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:19.780
We used up all our bowls, didn't we?

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:26.740
Here, I'm going to use this.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:41.960
So I'm going to put my yogurt in here.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.260
Add a little bit of milk.

00:51:15.214 --> 00:51:18.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:21.494
JODY ADAMS: To temper it a little bit.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.850
It's to temper it, to
even out the temperature.

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:28.470
This milk is way too hot.

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:30.380
You can see it's curdling.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:39.709
I should have let it cool
down before I did that.

00:52:39.709 --> 00:52:42.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.445
JODY ADAMS: No.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.490
I was going to point this out.

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.800
This was kind of obvious.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.860
If anybody could see that was happening.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:57.010
So I will tell you what you do when this
happens, because I've done this before.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:53:00.720
I'm going to have a yogurt
that is slightly curdled.

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.840
And so you put in a cheesecloth and
you drain it, and you have cheese.

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.910
And you don't tell anybody that
you screwed up your yogurt.

00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:11.175
KATHERINE BURCHMAN: It's true.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.260
JODY ADAMS: So temperature and
time, obviously, are very important.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.740
But this little gizmo, if you
want to make your own yogurt,

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:30.700
if you want to start being super healthy
and without being obnoxious about it,

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:34.610
just in a good way, with great flavor.

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:38.270
This is a really good
little machine to have.

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:39.490
Can you see it?

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.110
So you have a whole
fermentation program right here.

00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:48.000
Without even trying.

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:57.030
I think the pickles are so exciting.

00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:01.680
And I remember, when I was a
kid, there was a sandwich shop

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:06.200
and it was actually-- does everybody
know who Wiley Dufresne is?

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:11.590
So his father had a sandwich shop called
Joe's in Providence, where I grew up.

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:14.890
He went to RISD and he opened up first
a sandwich shop called Joe's, and

00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:18.430
a restaurant called Joe's upstairs,
which was a very cool place.

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:22.490
And in the middle of the
sandwich shop was a barrel.

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:24.970
And in the barrel were pickles.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:27.050
And in my memories,
they were just floating.

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:29.610
I don't think we stuck our hands in.

00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:33.030
But I remember they must have the
plastic top on them, or something.

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.910
Because I can't imagine that
you just kind of walked in

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:37.180
and looked at the pickles.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:39.610
But they were just
floating around in there.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:43.320
And that's what they were, is this.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.700
Did anybody go to Joe's?

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:47.408
Did you go to Joe's?

00:54:47.408 --> 00:54:48.490
It's Jeff's now.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:49.860
It's not nearly as good.

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:50.615
It's really dirty.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:04.780
I hope I didn't screw
up the pickles too.

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.120
No, you keep it at 70 degrees.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:06.620
OK.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:13.570
As I said, for the pickles, there's
naturally occurring bacteria

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:15.260
on the outside of the pickles.

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.340
They interact with the sugars.

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:22.720
They like being in a salt brine
at a certain temperature, which

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.450
is about 70 degrees.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:26.320
And they will start fermenting.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:30.280
And what everybody says, when
you're reading about them,

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.610
is taste, taste, taste.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:38.180
And when they get to a point that
you like, put them in the fridge.

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.930
Keep a cover over them.

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:43.840
You want to cover them up completely,
because they're fermenting

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:49.610
and there's gas coming off, and they
could pop the top off something.

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:51.430
Put a cheesecloth over the top.

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:52.910
Just put them on your counter.

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:54.530
Don't put them in direct sunlight.

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:57.280
And just let them hang out.

00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:03.970
You want them to be in something with
a fairly wide top, not super narrow,

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:08.490
because they pretty much guarantee
they're going to develop mold.

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:11.300
And you just skim that mold off.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.860
And be diligent about that.

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.570
I had two going at the same time.

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:18.490
I had this one and I had another
one that was more this size,

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:22.050
and I ignored the small one, and
the mold got into the pickle flavor.

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.590
So I had to dump them out.

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:27.740
But the other, this one,
I just kept skimming.

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:30.680
Are you eating pickles?

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.010
Did you like the pickles?

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:34.990
You wouldn't say no anyway.

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:36.910
You could say no once I leave.

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:38.260
Yes?

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.010
How long?

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:42.860
They took about 10 days before
I put them in the fridge.

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:51.030
And that salt solution
was three tablespoons

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:59.070
per quart, which is, I
think, about 5% solution.

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:03.057
You can work with a lower
salt solution if you want,

00:57:03.057 --> 00:57:04.640
if you don't want them quite as salty.

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.575
It'll take longer.

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:14.179
So fermentation is preservation.

00:57:14.179 --> 00:57:15.470
That's what we've talked about.

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:17.029
We've talked about flavor.

00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:18.570
The flavor of those pickles is great.

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:20.610
We add pickles to everything.

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:23.380
We add them as accents, garnishes.

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:25.700
Think about adding olives and capers.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.900
All of those things that
have big, bold flavors.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:35.590
That's what give food
its depth, and it's

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:38.800
what gives food it's
memory quality for you.

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.380
You're going to remember that
pickle much longer than you're

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.760
going to remember the cucumber.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.240
And it's going to stay-- the
flavor's going to stay in your mouth

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.280
much longer than a cucumber.

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.590
So it's important to have
those kinds of flavors in food.

00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:56.860
And if you don't have them,
then food is really boring.

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.510
Fermenting is also,
obviously, about preservation

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:13.640
and preserving milk with yogurt,
cucumbers to pickles, and bread.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.380
Sourdough bread .

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:19.140
It's also very healthy.

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:24.990
As we talked about in sourdoughs,
the pre-digested culture--

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:28.530
oh, no, we didn't talk about this,
but the pre-digested culture of bread

00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:34.070
reduces the presence of gluten,
making it easier for us to digest.

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:40.450
So because the bacteria
has started breaking down,

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:43.070
more of the sugars in
the gluten, it's easier

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:46.570
to digest than a non-sourdough bread.

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:51.340
It also lasts longer.

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.930
Yogurt, is the same thing
is true, as I talked about.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:57.740
And pickles, there are also
good things that happen,

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.147
like vitamin B, that come into play.

00:59:03.547 --> 00:59:05.880
Fermentation is also a really
good thing for the planet.

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:11.550
I met a woman the other day who
is the CEO of a company that has,

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:14.340
she called them, anaerobic digesters.

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:19.490
And they're these huge
machines to collect waste.

00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:20.800
Organic waste.

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:26.300
And they're digested, and it produces
methane gas that's used as fuel

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:29.470
and produces fertilizer.

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:36.880
And this is the kind of process that we
should be supporting and looking for,

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.960
because we need different
kinds of energy.

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:46.090
So I think we need to
stop the war on microbes.

00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:49.260
Stop sanitizing so much.

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.490
We are microbes.

00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:54.950
We are covered with them, inside and
out, and we need to remain that way.

00:59:54.950 --> 01:00:04.030
They provide a protection against
bad microbes who want to attack us.

01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:11.030
And without them, we're vulnerable
to colds, infections, and allergies.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:15.097
I think allergies is a big one that
people are really interested in.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.530
So when I started as
a cook 30 years ago,

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:28.740
flavor was something that
we found in big fats, lots

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:32.240
of meat, butter and cream.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:41.590
And over the years, as I've aged
and my interest in food has shifted,

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:44.070
I've become much more
interested in foods that have

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:46.680
big flavors coming from somewhere else.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:53.430
In this case, with fermented foods
that really makes food, as I said,

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:55.200
much, much more interesting.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.700
Much more fun to play with.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:02.595
And really fun to watch what
fermentation is doing in our kitchens.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.510
Look for flavor.

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:11.990
Look for it in the right places,
where it really makes a difference,

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:15.450
and brings memories,
and makes you feel good,

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:20.400
and you can be
experimental and have fun.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.950
Thank you.
