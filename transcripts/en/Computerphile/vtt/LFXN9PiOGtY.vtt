00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
almost always by the time the image gets
to a monitor it will be an RGB format

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.680
because that's the format that the
monitors use so color spaces are a way

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.960
of representing the colors in an image
in a different way and a lot of high

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.470
definition video uses ycbcr on the other
hand

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.390
by the time the colors get to a printer
it'll be in CMYK format because that's

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.840
and format printers understand and
that's the color of their links RGB

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.399
stands to make green and blue and apart
from being the format we talked about in

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.300
velocity videos

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.840
it's also format used by monitors so if
you want to show you something on the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.590
screen has been basically put into RGB
format that's how much red we got how

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.770
much proof we got and how much green if
we got when you added colors together

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.860
you get different colors and indeed when
you had all the colors together you get

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.710
white with you take away all the colors
you get black

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.250
that's different - let's say the way
that printers work where if you had /

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.219
colors together you get black because
you can keep adding colors in with your

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.140
inks you eventually get black

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.789
so if we draw a RGB diagram here
so if this is red and this is green and

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.110
this is blue and halfway between blue
and red will be magenta between blue

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.670
and green is cyan and between red and
green is yellow and then between all

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.140
three is white and then outside of these
you've obviously got black so you can

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.780
create any color you like on your
monitor

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.909
by varying the different amounts of
these three colors so on printers

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.170
it works like differently so C and Y
and then k is black but we don't tend to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.220
have K as part of this color will use it
to just create black effects because it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.740
works better half way between C and M is
blue and then halfway between C and why

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.180
we've got green and then between magenta
and yellow we've got red and in the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.290
middle of all of them

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.399
unlike RGB we've got black here so we're
gonna put k for black because we've

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.509
already got blue

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.009
so this works in a completely different
way to RGB so it's additive so the more

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.600
dies we add the darker everything gets
and then we use cage actually just print

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.009
in black if we want to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.570
so even though it is not separate round
circle on your diagram

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.490
k you would have a at four yeah because
in practice what you might find is that

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.440
if you try and add my and see together
to get black in principle it works but

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.770
you'll end up of a kind of money .
browning which is just not as good as

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.830
just printing in black and you're
wasting a lot of taylor doing that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.500
so who so just put it in black and the
last color space pen look at is ycbcr

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.940
variants about commonly used in TV
broadcasting so for example power users

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.450
use that color space NTSA using a
similar color space but slightly

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.100
different and a lot of high definition
video uses ycbcr what we try to do with

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.570
ycbcr is separate the luminosity of
enemies so the intensity of each pixel

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.410
from the actual color and by doing that
we can do all kinds of clever things by

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.709
down something the color and things will
get onto when we talk a little bit about

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.489
JP

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.220
this is a picture i took of a flower ok
and this is currently an RGB form and if

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.660
we want to split this into ycbcr what we
need to do is take away the gray scale

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.910
and and the color and separate them

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.769
this is just the luminosity component so
this is just Y and that essentially is a

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.000
gray scale version of the image how
blight is each pixel and then we've also

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.120
got the CB and CR components so CB
represents the kind of the chrominance

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.040
the blueness of an image

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.560
so in this case some of the flower in
the middle is blue in the background is

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.519
kind of blue

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.360
but the actual flower is quite yellow
and then the CR is the redness chrome

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.140
its value

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.620
so how many is it and you can see it's
actually pretty red and the background

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.850
is not going to bed at all

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.060
so you mentioned it on so blue what
we're seeing it was great in yellow

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.860
what i've done here is i've set the
university over the image to be flat at

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.959
zero and by doing that the images in
flight and in dark and we're just only

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.970
seeing both CB and CR

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.329
so let me do a little bit of writing it
down so you can see it better

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.739
ok where we would normally have RGB
instead we have ycbcr so this is written

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:58.459
this way

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.239
there's lots of variations on how you
like this so we usually use this prime

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.280
symbol after the Y to represent the RGB
was gamma corrected but we won't worry

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.880
too much about that for all intents and
purposes this is the luminosity and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.109
these are the chrominance values and
this luminosity goes between not and

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.250
255 just like RGB

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:27.610
the CB and CR our positions on a sort of
a square and they go for - 127 to 128 in

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.920
my mind is wandering 28 - 127

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.470
ok so that's four CB and CR and so what
we essentially have is a cube like this

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:43.480
where our Y goes in this direction and this
is black down here and this is white and

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:51.600
then our CB and CR in these directions so
this will be C our missiles ECB and

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.060
right in the center where both of these
values are 0 is gray and are gray scale

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.720
line is right down the center of this
cube and then up this direction will get

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.560
more red and then less and less red down
in this direction and off in this

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.760
direction will get more blue and down
we'll go less and less blue you see less

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.970
and less clearly more yellow in this
case yes although we call it blueness

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.480
actually also in this direction for less
blue it is in a sense the more yellow it

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.410
is similar with red the less reddit is
in general the more green it is but

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.900
these colors only start to look
realistic once you put them both back

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.979
together again and then combine them
with the luminosity component so it's in

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.830
three different color spaces and sort of
roughly have it work

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.640
while he's one of them so in general if
you had a choice you would use RGB

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.680
because it's widely supported

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.550
it's what ends up needing to be output
to a computer monitor so graphics cards

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.790
talking RGB most of the time if you're
going to print anything you're going to

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.520
have to produce into turning to CMYK
most of the print drivers will do this

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.450
for you so you don't need to worry about
that if you go into windows or any other

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.470
operating system and you print an RGB
image it will convert it to CMYK for you

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.890
and that will tell the printer how much
ink it needs to use two different colors

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:03.820
you would generally use ycbcr if you're
doing any kind of TV broadcasting

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.490
so if you're actually sending a stream
of data to someone's television

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.820
you need to worry about how much
compression you have about data because

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.910
it's quite important and ycbcr lets you
do very clever techniques by down

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.590
sampling the color components but not
down sampling the luminous component and

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.750
people won't really notice and we'll
talk about that when we talk about jpeg a

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.560
jpeg

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.790
in fact i should say it is fundamental
to how jpeg works is down sampling of

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.790
color components

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.820
we'd like to

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.150
thanks for harrys.com for sponsoring this
computer file video there a subscription

products that deliver them right to your
door

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.510
I've been using house products for a
while now they've recently sent me this

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.600
chrome razor which is really really cool

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.860
all the products are really really
nicely packaged I've also been using the

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.760
phone shave gel on this aftershave
lotion and if you've got skin that's not

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.870

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.530
so thanks once again to harry's for
sponsoring this computer file video

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.860
jpg works by downsizing the color
components and using other techniques as

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:23.430
well

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.060
the majority of video compression
methods will do the same thing

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.970
so you're being compressed right now
well I certainly am yes
