00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.000
Do you have complex advertising
needs like automated account

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.390
management and reporting
but don't want the overhead

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.310
of manual maintenance?

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.040
I'm Xerxes, a developer
advocate at Google.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.630
And I want you to understand
how the AdWords API may

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.090
help you to increase
your operating

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.240
efficiency and your return
on advertising investment.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.160
This video series is designed to
help you get going with the API

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.340
starting from the
very beginning.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.650
So, let's get down to it.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.720
With the AdWords
API, you can build

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.800
software that manages accounts
from the customer level

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.140
down to the keyword level.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.020
The API can do almost everything
that the average web site

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.541
does, but programmatically.

00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:52.040
Some types of companies that
have benefited from the AdWords

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.800
API are advertising agencies,
SEM companies, and big brands

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.590
managing multiple AdWords
accounts with needs

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.489
beyond what is possible within
the AdWords web interface.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.880
There's an entire suite
of applications and tools

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.100
around AdWords.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.080
So how do you know if the
API is the right route

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.970
for your organization to take?

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.670
This matrix summarizes
the available approaches.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.380
Whether you have dedicated
engineering resources, or none

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.980
at all, we have the
right tool for you.

to have a closer look

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.700
and decide which approach
is best for your business.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.170
In short, the
AdWords API is used

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.650
by companies that are looking to
build custom account management

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.280
and reporting
automation beyond what

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.150
is offered by the AdWords
web interface, AdWords words

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.010
editor, and AdWords scripts.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.950
The API allows ad words
to be deeply integrated

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.470
with your own systems,
thereby removing

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.190
the need for human intervention,
increasing your efficiency,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.030
and automating AdWords logic
based on your business needs.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.900
A few common use cases are
custom reporting, ad management

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.310
based on inventory,
bid management

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.780
based on business data,
and other synchronizations

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.860
with your internal systems.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.630
So let's take each
use case in detail.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.660
The AdWords API allows you
to programmatically retrieve

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.140
report data and store it
in your own databases.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.320
You could then create
custom dashboards

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.400
for monitoring the performance
of accounts, including

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.830
fine-grained details such
as per keyword statistics.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.430
Powerful segmentation
and filtering options

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.800
allow you to slice and dice
data without extra client side

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.910
logic.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.210
With the AdWords
API, your software

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.060
can pause and add when
stock is depleted,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.290
then unpause when stock
becomes available.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.050
So visitors to your site will
never be taken to a page only

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.590
to find that an advertised
item is of stock.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.410
No more wondering if your
ad budget is well spent.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.070
And you'll see
conversion rates climb.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.250
The AdWords API allows you to
incorporate your own business

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.820
data into bid decisions.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.910
For example, you
could adjust bids

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.750
based on your inventory,
cost changes, or sales.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.720
Some clients use the API
to integrate information

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.000
from AdWords with their
internal systems such as billing

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.450
or conversion tracking.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.890
For instance, they may
want offline access

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.600
to data such as campaign and ad
group listings, or performance

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.480
statistics, such as
impressions, clicks, cost, click

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.590
through rate, et cetera.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.920
They may also want to
programmatically create

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.750
AdWords accounts
for their clients

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.530
based on data from a CRM system.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.270
So the API can do a
lot of powerful stuff.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.990
But it should be noted
that using the API

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.790
is a serious commitment.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.080
Several versions are released
in [? sunset ?] each year.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.040
So before deciding to
develop with the API,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.950
ensure that you have the
engineering resources

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.840
and that you have a
business need that

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.740
is not met by the AdWords
website or AdWords scripts.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.760
If you think that
the API is the best

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.580
route for your organization,
keep watching the videos

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.830
in this series to build
your very first AdWords API

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.120
application.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.870
If you'd like to brush
up on AdWords words

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.390
basics before continuing,
here's a useful resource.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.550
Thanks for watching.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.700
I hope to see you
