00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.538
- This woman goes "Hey Tom,
you are in the emergency room

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:08.942 align:start position:0%
and you overdosed." And they're
like "what did you take?"

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.212 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, I write,
'Heroine.' And they go

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:15.181
"Are you serious?"
And, I write, "Jk."

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.518
(intense dubstep music)

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.501 align:start position:0%
- [Ari Shaffir] Welcome to
'This Is Not Happening' presents

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.503
one crazy night. So,
this is what we do.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.304 align:start size:94% position:6%
We're a bunch of
comedians. We tell stories

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.407
about a similar subject. So,
this is just one crazy night.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:42.542
- Give it up for
my friend and yours

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.378 align:start size:94% position:6%
Mr. Tom Segura everybody!
Let him hear it!

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.614
(cheering)

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.153 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Thanks, Ari Shaffir,
everybody. Let him hear it.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:57.257
Ari Shaffir. (applause)

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.625
Alright.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.959
Let's go back to

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.529
1997. Holy shit.

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:09.069
Fuck. That time flies. And,
I'm a freshman in college.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.140 align:start size:97% position:3%
And, Thanksgiving. Remember
Thanksgiving everybody?

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.642
(laughter)

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.378
That's the first time that
you go, usually, back home.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.680
That's your first break
in your freshman year.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.950 align:start size:97% position:3%
And, it's a big deal,
because it's also like a mini

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.554
class reunion, because it's the
first time you see everybody

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.723
you used to go to school
with everyday. You're back.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.625 align:start size:97% position:3%
Your first few months.
And, everybody's recapping.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.360
And the big thing
is the next day.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.030 align:start size:97% position:3%
The day after Thanksgiving.
Everybody gets together

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.732
and parties their
fucking balls off

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.470 align:start size:94% position:6%
while acting like they're
a new person. Right

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.372 align:start size:84% position:16%
I start off, I find
the guy, one of

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.375 align:start size:97% position:3%
the guys that didn't go to
school, and he's like "I'm the

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.845
new drug supplier." And,
I'm like "I remember you

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.682
from math." (laughter) And
uh, he asks me what I want

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.785
and I'm like "What do
you got?" And, he goes

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.255
"I have ecstasy."
And, I go "Yeah!"

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.823
"Everyone says that's
fun, let's try it!"

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.291
(laughter)

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.995
And I start taking it, and,
oh! I forgot to mention.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:12.832 align:start size:97% position:3%
Before I went to college,
senior year, I got really into

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:16.436
a drug that was making its way
especially through the south,

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:20.440
through Florida, called GHB.
And, I'm sure, I don't know

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.677 align:start size:97% position:3%
if you know what it is, it's
gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.247
your body naturally produces it.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.782 align:start size:84% position:16%
Sometimes, there are
some places where

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:32.218 align:start size:97% position:3%
they regulate it as an
anesthetic. But, basically,

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:35.755 align:start size:97% position:3%
when you get it, somebody made
it in a bathtub (laughter)

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:38.758 align:start size:94% position:6%
and that's the good
stuff, alright? (laughter)

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:42.028
And they sell it to you, and
they get it in a water bottle.

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:44.631
They also call it the
date rape drug, I, no

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.367
I didn't do that. I gave
it to myself all the time,

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:50.236
(laughter)

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:53.406 align:start size:84% position:16%
it does have an
amazing effect on sex.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:58.444
on masturbating, let's be
honest. On masturbating

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:02.682 align:start size:97% position:3%
Uh, I really had some crazy
masturbation seminars.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.918
(laughter)

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.087
As a senior, and then I
passed out, and I'm like

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:10.390
"Who jerked me off?" And then
I'm like, "oh yeah, it was me"

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.225
(laughter)

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:13.059
So...

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:15.328
anyways...

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:19.432 align:start size:84% position:16%
Okay, so I get the
ecstasy into my system

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:22.035 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then, I take it, I'd never
taken it, so as soon as I'd

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.337
taken it, I go like "Hey, man...

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.372 align:start position:0%
Fuckin'...I don't feel
anything." He's like, "You just

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:30.743
took it man, like, give it a
minute, alright?" "Alright."

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:33.146 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, I'm hanging out at this
party, we're at a party

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.681
everyone's together, and then
we're going to go to a bar

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:37.250
and at the end of the house
party on the way to the bar

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.819 align:start size:84% position:16%
I go "Hey man, I
don't feel anything."

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.790
So he goes "Alright, when we
get to the bar, come find me

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.327 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I have GHB." So I'm
like "Okay." So, I find him

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.729 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he's like "Alright,
let's go the car." And that's

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.233
always the big move when you
go to the car, you're like

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.135
ah, this is where dreams
come true, in the car.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.837
(laughter)

00:03:57.837 --> 00:04:01.107
Drug dealers cars, where it
all lives, so I'm expecting

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:05.378 align:start size:97% position:3%
what I know, which is a
water bottle, and then a dose

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.748
is the cap. So all you do, is
you pour the water into the

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.183
cap, and you drink it like that,

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:12.385 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it takes like ocean
water, like sea water, right?

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:15.822 align:start size:94% position:6%
salt water, and then, it's
immediate. GHB, if it's

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:18.958
good stuff, it's like, we
used to call it perma-grin.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.861
Cause you'd be like
(inebriated sounds)

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.229
And if someone's
like "Fuck you!"

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.265 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're like "(happy
inebriated sounds)" (laughter)

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.834 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, I'm like "Alright,
where is it?"

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:31.938 align:start position:0%
And he goes "It's right there!"
and he has a gallon jug.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.373
Right?

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.642 align:start size:94% position:6%
And, I'm like "Wow,
that's not a water bottle"

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.977 align:start size:97% position:3%
And he's like "Yeah, I haven't
even put it into the water

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:39.646
bottles yet. That's
the full thing."

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:42.749
And it's a full gallon. Now if
you think about a full gallon

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.152
you know that A) the cap is
much different, it's flatter

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:49.889
you're not gonna, and it's
also heavier, so I don't know

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.026
how to pour it, so he's
like "Just take a shot!"

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:57.797 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I'm like
"Alright!" (laughter)

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.366
So I put it up and then I go

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:04.203
in my mind, oh shit,
I have like nine shots

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:06.806
in my mouth right
now. (laughter)

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:10.209 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, the options are:
do I spit it back

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:11.978
into (laughter)

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.080
the main jug, which I feel like

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.615
he's gonna be not cool with

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:19.252
that, you know? Being that
he's a drug dealer and all.

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:22.322 align:start size:94% position:6%
(laughter) the other
thing would be spit it out

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.825 align:start size:94% position:6%
on the ground, and I don't
wanna be rude, right?

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.728
So, I just go like (grunts)

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.496
(laughter)

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:31.998
And, I'm like

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:35.101
"Holy fuckin' shit, I have
taken way too much GHB."

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.771 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now, I'm leaving out the
point that you're not

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:41.808
supposed to mix GHB and alcohol.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.843
It is potentially fatal.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.779
You may have known this,
if you didn't, it can be.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.817
At this point, I am on 13 or
14 drinks (audience exclaims)

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:54.687
and it's liquor, you know,
vodka drinks, and I'm just

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:58.624 align:start size:97% position:3%
pounding 'em, I get the nine
shots into me, and then I

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:02.061 align:start size:97% position:3%
walk back into the bar, and
I'm like "What's up everybah?"

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:05.331 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like, I'm fuckin' (laughter).
They're like "Where does

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.133
all this personality come from?"

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.535
"Ah, it's just natural man."

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.204
And then, I sat down

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.673
I remember sitting down

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:16.609 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then a girlfriend
came, and she sat on my lap

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:19.412
and then lights out like I
just don't remember anything

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:22.014 align:start size:84% position:16%
like I went to
sleep. All I remember

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:26.185 align:start size:97% position:3%
is that I wake up, and I'm
looking at lights on a ceiling

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:31.524
right? I'm just like "Oh,
shit, is this heaven?"

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:34.861
And, then I see a woman

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.996 align:start size:81% position:19%
come in the frame,
right? Because

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:38.531
I'm laying on my
back. I can't talk.

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:42.168
I can't move my arms. And
this woman goes, "Hey Tom,

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:46.172
you are in the Emergency
Room, and you overdosed

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:49.909
on drugs and now you're
coming out of a coma."

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.779 align:start size:88% position:13%
And, I'm just like
"(unintelligible
sounds of affirmation)"

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.447
(laughter)

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.916
Like processing it, but the
process literally was just

00:06:56.916 --> 00:07:00.620
eyes closed, like "Ah,
shit" and my only thought

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.356
was like "I hope nobody
knows." That's the only

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:05.024
thing I'm thinking. (laughter)

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:08.227
I hope nobody knows. And
then I open my eyes again

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:10.997 align:start size:81% position:19%
and my parents
come in the frame.

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:17.703 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I'm like "Ah, everybody
knows." (laughter)

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:21.207 align:start position:0%
And they look so, just like
"We thought you were a good kid

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.977
what the fuck?" So, I'd
never been in trouble

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:28.281 align:start size:94% position:6%
They won't let your arm
out cause I would pull out

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.116 align:start size:97% position:3%
the tubes. I have a tube for
breathing, I have another

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:33.920
tube that's pumping liquid
charcoal into my stomach

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.922 align:start position:0%
because that makes the chemicals
of the drugs come together

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:39.192
and then you also can't
digest it, so you vomit.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:40.760 align:start size:81% position:19%
Which is what they
want you to do.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.329 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, as I'm like (embarrassed
whimpers), I'm also like

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:45.898
(retching sounds) and
throwing up, right?

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.099
(laughter)

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:51.504 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, they give me a piece
of paper and a pen,

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:54.640
but I can't really
write normally, cause
I'm strapped down,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.010
but I can kinda chicken
scratch, and they're like

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.446
"What did you take?" Cause
they're tryna figure out

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.948
they don't even
know what I took.

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.616
So I write "Heroin."

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.420
And they go, "Are you serious?!"

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.788
And I write, "Jk"

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:11.057
(laughter)

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:17.129
They're not like "Good one!"
They're like "What the fuck,

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.998
are you joking right now?"

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.933
(raucous laughter)

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:21.767
So

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:29.609 align:start size:88% position:13%
then, the kid in me, I'm
looking at my parents

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:33.145
and I'm so worried about
them. I write on the paper

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.448
I go "Are you mad at me?"

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:37.149
- [Audience Member] Awww.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:38.618
And my parents, at that moment

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:42.522
my dad reads it and goes "No,
buddy, just disappointed."

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.790
(laughter)

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:50.396
Can you save that for when
I'm breathing on my own? Like

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:56.802 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, I'm in that emergency
room, I get moved to critical

00:08:56.802 --> 00:09:00.339
then ICU, and in the ICU, a
doctor comes in who I hadn't

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:03.009
seen yet. And, I'm later told

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:05.845
this is the doctor, they
tell me, this is the doctor

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:08.714 align:start size:97% position:3%
that saved your life. So,
I'm sitting there in the bed

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:11.050
and he comes in, and he goes

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.186
"Are you in a band?"

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:15.388
(laughter)

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.890 align:start size:81% position:19%
And I was like
"What, man? What?"

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.959
And he goes "Are you in a band?"

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:23.296
And I was like "No, I'm
not in a fuckin' band."

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:25.565
And he goes, "Well you had
enough in you to take down

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.634 align:start size:97% position:3%
two drum players and a
bass player man" (laughter)

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:31.637
And, I'm like "You, now, with
the fuckin' jokes? Really?"

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:35.474
(laughter) And he goes
"What did you take?"

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.777
And I go, I don't know
"I took a couple pills"

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:41.547
I told him honestly,
"I had some drinks

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:42.782
And, I took, uh

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.383
you know, some GHB

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:47.820
probably enough for
a whole lot of people

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.889
(laughter)

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.458
And he goes, "What
about the heroine?"

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:55.027 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I go "nah, I was
just joking." And he goes

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.363 align:start size:84% position:16%
"No, you have heroine
in your system."

00:09:57.363 --> 00:09:59.832 align:start size:81% position:19%
And I was like
"(laughs) really?"

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:02.835 align:start size:97% position:3%
And he's like "Yeah, you have
heroine, you have cocaine

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:06.906 align:start size:97% position:3%
you have PCP, you also have
the same chemicals that are in

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:09.976
um, cleaners, like
some of the, like the

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.744 align:start size:84% position:16%
super duty cleaners."
And I'm like

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:15.581
"What the fuck, man?" And he
goes "Where'd you get your GHB

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:18.618
from?" And I go "one of my
buddies from high school."

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.386 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's like "yeah, he's a good
friend. He gave you some

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:24.056
fuckin' WD40 to put
in your system."

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:27.159
So, I, you know, eventually

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.594
get to breathe on my own

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:30.129
and all this shit

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.131
and then he comes back, and
they're like "You know, the

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.834
doctor" the nurse tells me
"the doctor that saved you

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:38.337
wants to talk to you."
And, I'm like "Alright."

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:41.173 align:start size:84% position:16%
And, I ask him,
"how did I survive?"

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:44.343
And he was like, "honestly...

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:45.344
cause you're fat (laughter)

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:47.113
like you're pretty fat."

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:49.382
(laughter)

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.655
I was like "What, man?"

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.289
(laughter continues)

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:59.358 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he goes "I mean,
a smaller person

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:01.927
would definitely, like a
120 pound person would die

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:05.398
halfway through this. This
is just one of the only times

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:09.035 align:start size:94% position:6%
where it's good to be
fat, right now" and that's

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:12.405 align:start position:0%
yeah, that's why I still haven't
lost the weight, you guys.

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:14.006
(laughter, cheering)

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:17.510
(upbeat electronic music)

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.482 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The best part is
when he called you fat.

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:27.353
Tom Segura everybody, keep
it going for Tom Segura.
