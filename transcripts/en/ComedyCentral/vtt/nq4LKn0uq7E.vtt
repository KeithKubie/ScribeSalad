It really was more a--

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.806
- When I was 16,

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:16.142
I wanted to be
a fashion designer,

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:20.480
in case you didn't get
that impression already.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.416
But I wrote a letter
to a company

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.618
that was actually
based in Japan

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.620
called Comme des Garcons.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.156
And I want to work
for this company,

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.458
and I was 16, so I figured
that what you do

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:36.595
is you write a letter to Japan,
and then they hire you.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.197
And they actually wrote back

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.167
through their New York offices
and said,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.836
"If you really want
to work here,

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.304
"in two more years
when you're 18,

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:47.973
write back and we'll
see what we can do."

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:49.809
So I waited two years
and then wrote back

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:51.511
and then said, "Yeah, I still
want to work there."

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:54.013
So then I moved to New York,
and I was given a job

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:57.816
in the basement office
of Comme des Garcons

00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:59.184
on Wooster Street.

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:00.520
[scattered cheers and applause]

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.654
And, uh...

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:04.491
was fired two months later.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:11.564
For stealing
and other petty offenses.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:15.067
When I was fired,
I was crying quite a bit,

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:19.906
which the woman in charge
asked me not to do.

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:24.244
And I decided that I wasn't
meant to do fashion.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:27.914
So, at that time,
I was living in the living room

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.749
of two folks from Michigan
who I didn't know really

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.052
and looking through
the want ads every day

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.421
in the back of
the "Village Voice"

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:39.992
and came across a job
for a musician.

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:42.495
I thought, huh, I've never
thought about doing that.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.997
Now, I had taken piano lessons
and played piano

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:47.867
and made music,
but that to me was like reading.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.535
I never really thought--

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:51.270
you know, once you learn
how to talk,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.205
you don't necessarily
become professional,

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.107
unless you're gonna be
a stand-up comedian

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.909
or something like that.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.577
[sighs]

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.680
Anyway, so--

00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:04.750
This is easier than I thought,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.287
'cause that wasn't even
supposed to be a joke.

00:03:11.623 --> 00:03:13.426
So I thought,
well, at the worst-case,

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.228
I mean, the job paid
$700 a week,

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.429
which was more money than
I'd ever imagined

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.431
you could really make
doing anything.

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:22.635
It was a lot more than I was
getting paid at the internship

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:26.071
at the fashion place,
so I said, "Okay, I'll try it."

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.907
Now, I figured,
having never auditioned

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:30.109
for a musical job before,

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.311
that I would go in
and I would have a meeting

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.580
and they would give me
songs to learn

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.983
and we would talk
about the band.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.617
I'd only been
in high school bands

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:40.587
and things like that,
and we did have original songs,

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:43.990
but I think we once learned
someone else's song

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.558
and played it very poorly,

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.626
and it took about two
or three months of practice

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:49.963
before we got it, and then
we never played it again.

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:51.331
Went back to
the original songs,

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.133
'cause no one
could judge those.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.669
So I dressed up as most
professional musicians

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.673
did at the time,
which I envisioned to be

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:04.510
a sport coat with
the sleeves rolled up,

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.345
and I got myself psyched up

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:09.849
and really tried to use the
power of visualization,

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.852
which I'd just been learning
about at that time,

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:16.189
that you could kind of picture
how things would go.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.624
I learned actually
doing piano recitals

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.826
to picture
the recital going well,

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:23.262
and then when it goes
terribly wrong and you mess up,

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:26.698
much like the way I feel
now on this stage,

00:04:26.698 --> 00:04:28.701
you'll at least be able
to compare it

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.937
and really realize
how poorly it's going

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.540
compared to what
you visualized.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.210
So, uh, I visualized that
I would get to sit in a room,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.179
maybe with a piano--
kinda like I imagined

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.780
it would be like
a ballet studio for some reason

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.049
with mirrors along one side
and a railing.

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:45.651
And this nice gentleman

00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:47.386
who was gonna give me
the stack of songs to learn,

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:49.488
"Come back in two weeks.
We'll review.

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:51.890
We'll go over this,
as much time as you need."

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.160
And I make my way down there
on the subway,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.694
you know, all by myself.

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:57.863
I didn't have any friends
really at that time.

00:04:57.863 --> 00:04:59.565
I had two roommates
that I was irritating,

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.033
but I don't think
they would have

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:02.734
considered themselves
my friends.

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:06.472
And then found my way
to this place,

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.674
which was in
Greenwich Village.

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:12.044
It said on the sign--
it said "Cafe Wha?"

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:15.081
in kind of bold colors.

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:16.749
And I really didn't like
the name.

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.718
And I thought, "That doesn't--
this is not a--

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:21.587
this is a bad omen."

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:24.257
So I listened to a deeper
voice that said go in,

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.392
and I went inside
and went down some stairs.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:28.327
There was actually
a very nice women there,

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:32.098
that I explained
I'm answering this ad.

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:35.935
And she had
a slight look of concern

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.170
mixed with fear.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.838
And she seemed to say,

00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:41.707
"Okay, well, you know what,
come over here,

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.508
"and you can take a seat
in the back,

00:05:43.508 --> 00:05:45.111
and I'll go tell the manager
you're here."

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:46.679
And I thought,
"This is great.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.347
He'll pull me into his office
and we'll talk."

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:50.282
In the meantime,
it was a packed house.

00:05:50.282 --> 00:05:51.884
It was very much like this.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:55.687
In fact, I haven't felt as much
like I did that night

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.456
until this night.

00:05:57.456 --> 00:05:58.757
And I really mean that.

00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:01.460
I mean, my heart is racing
so much so

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.696
that if I just sit still,

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:09.268
I just could be--
seem to pulse.

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:12.637
It's a very intense feeling.

00:06:12.637 --> 00:06:14.874
And so it was a packed house.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.742
It was a live music club.

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:18.977
And it was a very
boisterous audience.

00:06:18.977 --> 00:06:21.413
Standing room only.
People were singing along.

00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:25.417
I cannot exaggerate
how fantastic the band was

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:26.485
that was playing.

00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:27.820
I mean, world-class.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.988
And again,
it was really in a place

00:06:29.988 --> 00:06:32.658
really about
this exact size,

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:36.828
uh, in the most eerie
of ways.

00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:39.331
There were a lot of mirrors,
much like this,

00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:41.000
and helped make the room

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.604
somehow seem more claustrophobic
in a strange way.

00:06:45.604 --> 00:06:48.507
And I found the one
only person seat

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:50.642
for this whole club.

00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:52.311
Sat down, ordered a Sprite.

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:55.347
And just waited for her
to come and tell me

00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:56.515
when the manager was ready.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:58.150
So I'm watching this band,

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.487
and then this gentleman who had
been more like the sideman

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.589
stepped up
and took over the mic,

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.856
speaking with the audience.

00:07:04.856 --> 00:07:07.259
And it was very strange
for me at this time

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:08.627
to watch this guy.

00:07:08.627 --> 00:07:11.864
I was just fascinated
by his confidence,

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:13.332
because in my eyes

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.768
he had absolutely no reason
to be confident.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.803
He looked like the friends
I had in high school

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:22.375
that were really into
computer repair,

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:26.378
which was a higher lever
of computer enthusiast.

00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:29.448
And was playing
a Fender Stratocaster guitar

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:31.884
with the strap
at that height,

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:34.019
that certain height
that just doesn't seem like

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:38.857
it can't possibly
make it easier to play.

00:07:38.857 --> 00:07:40.893
So I'm watching this guy
command the crowd,

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:45.497
and I'm really amazed by his
almost overconfidence.

00:07:45.497 --> 00:07:47.233
It turns out, of course,
he's the host,

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.502
and actually he's the manager.
He's the manager.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.504
How amazing is this
that the manager of the club

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.905
is playing in their
world-class band?

00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:55.741
So he's bantering
with the audience,

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:58.410
he's talking about how great
everyone has been so far,

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.878
what an amazing lineup--

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:02.582
"And I understand
that there's a young man

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.416
"somewhere
in this audience tonight

00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:06.352
"that's gonna come up
on stage here

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.588
and audition for us."

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.861
And the first thought was:

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:20.432
shoot, someone else
is gonna get this gig.

00:08:20.432 --> 00:08:22.100
This other kid.
This other guy.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.504
And I'm not even gonna get
a chance.

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:26.938
And then he asked again

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:30.108
if the young man would
please show himself.

00:08:30.108 --> 00:08:34.880
And that's when I realized
it was me.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.783
And, uh...

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:40.453
I just realized,
I could sit there

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:41.887
and not acknowledge myself

00:08:41.887 --> 00:08:43.555
and wait until
they passed over,

00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:45.791
'cause he did want
to keep the show moving,

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:48.627
or, um, I could go up there.

00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:52.898
And at that time,
that really surpassed

00:08:52.898 --> 00:08:58.070
any asking out a girl
for the first time.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.639
It certainly surpassed having
been fired from that job.

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:05.044
I could tell this was
the most underwhelming

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:08.980
overwhelming thing
that was about to happen.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.483
And I was about to actually
just cop out,

00:09:11.483 --> 00:09:12.785
'cause it was gonna be--

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:16.222
you know, it wasn't
gonna go well.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.958
It was a living nightmare.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:23.162
And there was a very clear
voice in my head.

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.663
It wasn't my voice.

00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:25.997
It's kinda like the voice

00:09:25.997 --> 00:09:28.434
that when you're reading
a book silently.

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:30.936
It's just this voice that
doesn't actually have a sound,

00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:32.671
of course.

00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:34.840
But somehow it's saying
these words to you.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.343
So I don't really understand
how exactly that works.

00:09:38.343 --> 00:09:41.614
So who--

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:44.116
whose voice that is,

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:45.684
but it's right--
it's very intimate.

00:09:45.684 --> 00:09:47.186
You can't--
can't shut it out,

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:49.455
and it said, "This is what
you're supposed to do."

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:50.689
So I said okay.

00:09:50.689 --> 00:09:53.359
So I got up
and went on the stage,

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:56.595
and as soon as I stood up,

00:09:56.595 --> 00:10:01.467
there was one of those
prison spotlights,

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.502
and so then
I couldn't see anything,

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:05.204
except that I was
very lit up.

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:09.141
And right away,
the host's face just sank,

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:11.710
'cause he saw
that I was 18 years old

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.514
and probably gonna be
really amazing

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.650
or really, really bad.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.554
And I managed to be both,
I think.

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:24.656
I walked up and I kinda
scooted through the stage.

00:10:24.656 --> 00:10:26.057
It was very crowded.
Once you get up there,

00:10:26.057 --> 00:10:28.360
you realize that everyone's
kinda overlapped

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.561
on top of each other.

00:10:29.561 --> 00:10:31.730
And the keyboard player
specifically

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.400
was not happy about me

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.835
taking over his, at least,

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:42.508
three racks of
triple-tiered keyboards,

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:44.310
and then a whole nother
triple tier,

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:49.481
and then the ones that
you can't play behind you.

00:10:49.481 --> 00:10:52.685
That's always been--
you know, I can play one barely.

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.719
So this idea of nine was--

00:10:54.719 --> 00:10:56.822
again, I just
was very intimidated.

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.490
And all the while
this is happening,

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.891
I can't believe
that it's happening,

00:10:59.891 --> 00:11:03.094
and I still think about
just fleeing.

00:11:03.094 --> 00:11:05.230
And I'll try to run through
this part quick

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.600
because it's just very painful
to think about.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.737
So the host is here,
and he says--he says,

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:14.740
"Okay,
so what do you got for us?"

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.942
And I--you know,
my mouth was so dry.

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:19.111
It was like all the moisture
had gone to my--

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:22.447
the palms of my hand
and behind my knees.

00:11:22.447 --> 00:11:28.120
I could barely speak,
and the mic was way too loud.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.189
I said, "I didn't think
it was gonna be like this."

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:33.091
And before I could even
finish uttering that,

00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:35.861
the whole crowd--
the tension, it just--

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:37.796
they were having the greatest
night of their lives,

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:41.100
and it was just cut off.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.568
They were witnessing
a nightmare.

00:11:43.568 --> 00:11:45.370
It wasn't even a train wreck.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.806
It really was more, uh--

00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:52.211
it was like
an existential shattering

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.580
of a human soul.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.782
And this guy hosting
realized that,

00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:01.987
and he says,
"Okay, well, let's go all-in."

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:04.156
He said, "Well, how could
you come to a thing

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:05.724
"and not have
anything prepared?

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:07.226
What song can you play?"

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:08.894
I said, "I don't know--"
I really was thinking

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:11.763
maybe I would play scales
or something backstage.

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:13.466
I didn't have the nerve
to say that.

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:17.636
I said, "I didn't think
it was gonna be like this.

00:12:19.738 --> 00:12:22.675
On every level."

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:25.343
He said, "Well, name a song
that you can play."

00:12:25.343 --> 00:12:28.480
And this is the part that I
almost wasn't gonna tell you.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.184
'Cause it's just--
out of all the songs--

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:33.518
some that I would know,

00:12:33.518 --> 00:12:34.820
like "Happy Birthday"
or something.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.189
I could've played that.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:39.191
A song I've never played,
still don't know how to play,

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.795
haven't even tried to play,
especially after this.

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:44.997
Hadn't heard it
earlier that day.

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:47.099
Had no particular
relationship to the song,

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.501
no special memories
about the song.

00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:53.038
I said "Rocket Man"
by Elton John.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:02.313
And at that point, I almost
felt like looking back now

00:13:02.313 --> 00:13:03.648
the voice in my head was like,

00:13:03.648 --> 00:13:05.016
"What--where--
where did that come--

00:13:05.016 --> 00:13:06.651
"What the hell are you doing?

00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:10.122
That's not how
this is supposed to go."

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:11.690
So he said,
"Okay, 'Rocket Man!'"

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.059
And then all of a sudden,
it dawned on me

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.194
that this band
knew every song.

00:13:16.194 --> 00:13:17.396
They knew "Rocket Man."

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:18.564
They had it memorized.

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:20.165
No one gave them
the sheet music.

00:13:20.165 --> 00:13:22.167
They--I could have
called out any song,

00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:24.870
they'd go, "Okay,
one, two, three, four."

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:31.243
Pachelbel's "Canon in C."

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:34.647
"Mary--" ugh.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.748
So they kick into it

00:13:36.748 --> 00:13:38.316
and it sounds
just like the album

00:13:38.316 --> 00:13:43.022
except that there's no
piano playing.

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:44.757
And I say,
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:46.258
What key is it in?"

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:47.926
You know, I normally
have the music,

00:13:47.926 --> 00:13:50.362
and even then
I need a lot of practice.

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:52.231
He said, "Well, it's
on the same key as the album."

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.999
I said, "Well, I don't know
what key's that in."

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.500
And then I think
some of the other band

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.768
was starting to get irritated.

00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:58.737
It was starting
to make them look bad.

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.272
And then, uh--

00:14:00.272 --> 00:14:02.207
So he said, "What key
do you want to play it in?"

00:14:02.207 --> 00:14:04.243
And I said,
"C. C major."

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:06.845
But the problem is--
if you're even slightly familiar

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:08.680
with "Rocket Man,"
whatever key you start in,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.750
within the first few seconds,
it's changing and modulating

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.385
and moving
to about 18 different keys.

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:17.289
It's probably one
of the more complicated songs

00:14:17.289 --> 00:14:20.692
to try to just fake
your way through.

00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:22.360
And I faked my way through it

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.297
by turning the volume down
on the keyboard.

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:28.700
One of the great things about
keyboards versus real pianos.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:34.306
Just turn that down
and have a ball.

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:37.109
And then I realized I didn't
know all the words,

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:40.045
so he said, "I'll feed you
the words one line as we go."

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:43.048
I mean, and at this point,
my face was so red and hot.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.150
The way it feels right now.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.753
When your ears are so hot
that they hurt

00:14:48.753 --> 00:14:50.388
without even being touched.

00:14:50.388 --> 00:14:54.126
You can leave a thumbprint
on your cheek.

00:14:58.263 --> 00:15:00.965
But eventually, I got
to the line where he says--

00:15:00.965 --> 00:15:03.135
where it's, "And I think it's
gonna be a long, long time."

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:06.305
Which was the one line
I really did know.

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:09.174
So I was excited,
and as I started to sing that,

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:11.176
he said, "And I think
it's gonna be a long, long time

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:14.680
till you ever perform
at Cafe Wha? again."

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.448
[audience awws]

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:18.150
And in part, I was relieved,
of course, like--

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:23.021
"Good, let me get out of here.
Gee whiz."

00:15:23.021 --> 00:15:26.191
And at that moment,
the crowd kind of--

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:29.128
it was just so bad,
something had to give.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:30.862
'Cause he wasn't
letting up on me,

00:15:30.862 --> 00:15:32.197
and I don't blame him.

00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:33.999
But someone yelled,
"Hey, let him finish."

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.533
Or, "Let the"--you know,
"You're doing great, kid!"

00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:40.338
And-and the feeling
that some other person

00:15:40.338 --> 00:15:42.941
that I didn't know
that had no reason to--

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:44.510
they cared about me.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.545
They were shouting for me.

00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:49.481
And, like, a whole sea change--
the whole vibe changed to,

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.883
"Come on, you can do it!"
Like an underdog.

00:15:51.883 --> 00:15:53.485
But the thing--
I really couldn't do it,

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:56.054
so it wasn't like
I won the game

00:15:56.054 --> 00:16:00.058
or scored this three-pointer
and brought it all home.

00:16:00.058 --> 00:16:02.294
Finished the song
very, very badly,

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:04.063
left the stage,
but there was still

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:10.068
something kind of
satisfying about it, I guess.

00:16:10.068 --> 00:16:13.405
The bass player,
he put his hand on my shoulder

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:16.241
and said,
"It's gonna be okay."

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:20.812
Sorta like, you know, "You're
gonna live through this."

00:16:20.812 --> 00:16:22.380
And I walked down
the stairs,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.049
and I went back,
and then, you know,

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.717
very slowly walked out.

00:16:25.717 --> 00:16:30.255
But the feeling was that if I
could not make it through that,

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:35.660
I could not make it
through anything.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.362
[cheers and applause]
