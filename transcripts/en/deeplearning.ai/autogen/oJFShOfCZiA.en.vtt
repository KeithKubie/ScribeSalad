how y'all sure I'm really guy you could

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790
how y'all sure I'm really guy you could
 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.269
how y'all sure I'm really guy you could
join us yesterday I'm very glad to you

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279
join us yesterday I'm very glad to you
 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:07.660
join us yesterday I'm very glad to you
know

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670
know
 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.209
know
today you're not just saved researcher

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219
today you're not just saved researcher
 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.009
today you're not just saved researcher
or engineer in deep learning you've

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019
or engineer in deep learning you've
 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.020
or engineer in deep learning you've
become one of the institution's and one

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030
become one of the institution's and one
 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.019
become one of the institution's and one
of the icons of deep learning but really

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029
of the icons of deep learning but really
 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.269
of the icons of deep learning but really
like to hear the story of how it started

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279
like to hear the story of how it started
 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.089
like to hear the story of how it started
so how did you end up you know getting

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099
so how did you end up you know getting
 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.950
so how did you end up you know getting
into deep learning and then pursuing

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960
into deep learning and then pursuing
 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.249
into deep learning and then pursuing
this journey right well actually it

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259
this journey right well actually it
 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.260
this journey right well actually it
started when I was a kid

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270
started when I was a kid
 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.030
started when I was a kid
adolescent reading a lot of science

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040
adolescent reading a lot of science
 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.980
adolescent reading a lot of science
fiction like I guess many of us and when

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990
fiction like I guess many of us and when
 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.180
fiction like I guess many of us and when
I started my graduate studies in 1985 I

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190
I started my graduate studies in 1985 I
 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.360
I started my graduate studies in 1985 I
started reading you know led papers and

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370
started reading you know led papers and
 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.880
started reading you know led papers and
and that's where I got all excited and

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890
and that's where I got all excited and
 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.220
and that's where I got all excited and
it became really a passion and and

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230
it became really a passion and and
 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.260
it became really a passion and and
actually what was that like in what mid

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270
actually what was that like in what mid
 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.450
actually what was that like in what mid
eighties right 1985 reading these papers

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460
eighties right 1985 reading these papers
 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:02.170
eighties right 1985 reading these papers
do you remember yeah it was well you

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180
do you remember yeah it was well you
 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.389
do you remember yeah it was well you
know coming from the courses I had taken

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399
know coming from the courses I had taken
 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.570
know coming from the courses I had taken
in classical ai with expert systems and

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580
in classical ai with expert systems and
 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.880
in classical ai with expert systems and
suddenly discovering that there was all

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890
suddenly discovering that there was all
 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.610
suddenly discovering that there was all
this world of thinking about how humans

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620
this world of thinking about how humans
 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.050
this world of thinking about how humans
might be learning and human intelligence

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060
might be learning and human intelligence
 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.940
might be learning and human intelligence
and how we might draw connections

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950
and how we might draw connections
 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.670
and how we might draw connections
between that and and artificial

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680
between that and and artificial
 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.280
between that and and artificial
intelligence and computers that was

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290
intelligence and computers that was
 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.830
intelligence and computers that was
really exciting for me when I discovered

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840
really exciting for me when I discovered
 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.840
really exciting for me when I discovered
this literature and I started reading

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850
this literature and I started reading
 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.880
this literature and I started reading
the connectionists of course so the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890
the connectionists of course so the
 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.550
the connectionists of course so the
papers from geoff hinton real art and so

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560
papers from geoff hinton real art and so
 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.170
papers from geoff hinton real art and so
on and I worked on recurrent Nets I

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180
on and I worked on recurrent Nets I
 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.780
on and I worked on recurrent Nets I
worked on speech recognition I worked on

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790
worked on speech recognition I worked on
 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.320
worked on speech recognition I worked on
hmmso graphical models and then quickly

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330
hmmso graphical models and then quickly
 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.340
hmmso graphical models and then quickly
moved to AT&amp;T Bell Labs and MIT where I

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350
moved to AT&amp;T Bell Labs and MIT where I
 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.830
moved to AT&amp;T Bell Labs and MIT where I
did postdocs and that's where I

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840
did postdocs and that's where I
 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.530
did postdocs and that's where I
discovered some of the issues with the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540
discovered some of the issues with the
 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.149
discovered some of the issues with the
long term dependencies with training

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159
long term dependencies with training
 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.350
long term dependencies with training
neural nets and then shortly after I got

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360
neural nets and then shortly after I got
 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.920
neural nets and then shortly after I got
recruited

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930
recruited
 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.969
recruited
udm back in Montreal where I had spent

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979
udm back in Montreal where I had spent
 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.390
udm back in Montreal where I had spent
most of my child I know lessons years um

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400
most of my child I know lessons years um
 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.520
most of my child I know lessons years um
you know and so as someone who's been

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530
you know and so as someone who's been
 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.489
you know and so as someone who's been
there for the last several decades and

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:12.499
there for the last several decades and
 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.769
there for the last several decades and
seen you know seeing it also he's seen a

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:14.779
seen you know seeing it also he's seen a
 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:15.860
seen you know seeing it also he's seen a
lot of it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
lot of it
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.170
lot of it
um tell me about how you're thinking

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
um tell me about how you're thinking
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.580
um tell me about how you're thinking
about deep learning about neural

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
about deep learning about neural
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.410
about deep learning about neural
networks has evolved over this over this

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
networks has evolved over this over this
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.899
networks has evolved over this over this
time we start with experiments with

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909
time we start with experiments with
 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.240
time we start with experiments with
intuitions and and theory sort of comes

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250
intuitions and and theory sort of comes
 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.280
intuitions and and theory sort of comes
later and we now understand a lot better

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
later and we now understand a lot better
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.009
later and we now understand a lot better
for example why backdrop is working so

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019
for example why backdrop is working so
 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.569
for example why backdrop is working so
well why depth is so important and and

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579
well why depth is so important and and
 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.940
well why depth is so important and and
you know these kinds of notions we we

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
you know these kinds of notions we we
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.339
you know these kinds of notions we we
didn't have any solid justification for

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349
didn't have any solid justification for
 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.039
didn't have any solid justification for
in those days when when we started

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049
in those days when when we started
 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.649
in those days when when we started
working on deep nets in the early 2000s

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659
working on deep nets in the early 2000s
 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.600
working on deep nets in the early 2000s
we had the intuition that we made a lot

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610
we had the intuition that we made a lot
 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.130
we had the intuition that we made a lot
of sense that a deeper network should be

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140
of sense that a deeper network should be
 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.289
of sense that a deeper network should be
more powerful and we didn't know how to

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299
more powerful and we didn't know how to
 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.789
more powerful and we didn't know how to
you know take that and prove it and of

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799
you know take that and prove it and of
 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.259
you know take that and prove it and of
course our experiments initially didn't

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269
course our experiments initially didn't
 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.949
course our experiments initially didn't
work and actually well there were the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959
work and actually well there were the
 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.599
work and actually well there were the
most important things that you think

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609
most important things that you think
 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.089
most important things that you think
turned out to be right and what were the

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099
turned out to be right and what were the
 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.680
turned out to be right and what were the
biggest surprises of what turns out to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690
biggest surprises of what turns out to
 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.750
biggest surprises of what turns out to
be wrong you know compared to what we

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760
be wrong you know compared to what we
 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.800
be wrong you know compared to what we
knew thirty years ago

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810
knew thirty years ago
 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.940
knew thirty years ago
oh sure so one of the biggest mistake I

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
oh sure so one of the biggest mistake I
 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.660
oh sure so one of the biggest mistake I
made was to think that like everyone

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670
made was to think that like everyone
 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.030
made was to think that like everyone
else in the 90s thought you needed

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040
else in the 90s thought you needed
 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.780
else in the 90s thought you needed
smooth nonlinearities in order to for

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790
smooth nonlinearities in order to for
 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.849
smooth nonlinearities in order to for
backprop to work because I thought that

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859
backprop to work because I thought that
 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.839
backprop to work because I thought that
you know if if we had something like

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849
you know if if we had something like
 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.520
you know if if we had something like
rectifying non-linearity's where you

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530
rectifying non-linearity's where you
 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.220
rectifying non-linearity's where you
have a flat part that it would be really

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230
have a flat part that it would be really
 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.449
have a flat part that it would be really
hard to train because the derivative

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459
hard to train because the derivative
 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.479
hard to train because the derivative
would be zero in so many places and when

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489
would be zero in so many places and when
 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.240
would be zero in so many places and when
we started experimented with

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250
we started experimented with
 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.580
we started experimented with
experimenting with relu with deepness in

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
experimenting with relu with deepness in
 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.960
experimenting with relu with deepness in
around 2010 you know III was obsessed

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
around 2010 you know III was obsessed
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.699
around 2010 you know III was obsessed
with the idea that oh we should be

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709
with the idea that oh we should be
 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.309
with the idea that oh we should be
careful about whether neurons won't

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319
careful about whether neurons won't
 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.220
careful about whether neurons won't
saturate too much on the zero part but

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230
saturate too much on the zero part but
 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.960
saturate too much on the zero part but
in the end it turned out that actually

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970
in the end it turned out that actually
 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.420
in the end it turned out that actually
the relu was working a lot better than

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430
the relu was working a lot better than
 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.849
the relu was working a lot better than
the sigmoids and attached and that was a

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859
the sigmoids and attached and that was a
 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.180
the sigmoids and attached and that was a
big surprise we did this exploring this

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190
big surprise we did this exploring this
 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.369
big surprise we did this exploring this
because of the biological connection

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379
because of the biological connection
 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.470
because of the biological connection
actually not because we thought that it

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480
actually not because we thought that it
 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.180
actually not because we thought that it
would be easier to optimize but it

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190
would be easier to optimize but it
 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.680
would be easier to optimize but it
turned out work better

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690
turned out work better
 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.240
turned out work better
whereas I thought it would be harder to

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
whereas I thought it would be harder to
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.750
whereas I thought it would be harder to
drink so let me ask you what is the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760
drink so let me ask you what is the
 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.879
drink so let me ask you what is the
relationship between deep learning and

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889
relationship between deep learning and
 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.740
relationship between deep learning and
the brain there's the obvious answer but

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750
the brain there's the obvious answer but
 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.700
the brain there's the obvious answer but
I'm curious was your answer to that ah

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710
I'm curious was your answer to that ah
 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:32.089
I'm curious was your answer to that ah
well the initial insight that really got

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099
well the initial insight that really got
 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.700
well the initial insight that really got
me excited with neural nets was this

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710
me excited with neural nets was this
 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.649
me excited with neural nets was this
idea from the connectionists that

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659
idea from the connectionists that
 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.149
idea from the connectionists that
information is distributed across the

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159
information is distributed across the
 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.779
information is distributed across the
activation of many neurons rather than

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789
activation of many neurons rather than
 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.370
activation of many neurons rather than
being represented by and sort of the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380
being represented by and sort of the
 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.170
being represented by and sort of the
grandmother cells that were calling it

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180
grandmother cells that were calling it
 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.890
grandmother cells that were calling it
were a symbolic representation that was

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900
were a symbolic representation that was
 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.469
were a symbolic representation that was
the traditional view in classical yet

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479
the traditional view in classical yet
 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.230
the traditional view in classical yet
right and I still believe this is a

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240
right and I still believe this is a
 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.760
right and I still believe this is a
really important thing and I see people

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770
really important thing and I see people
 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.589
really important thing and I see people
we just discovering the importance of

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599
we just discovering the importance of
 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.730
we just discovering the importance of
that even even though recently so so

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740
that even even though recently so so
 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.159
that even even though recently so so
that's that was really a foundation the

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169
that's that was really a foundation the
 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.459
that's that was really a foundation the
death thing is something that came later

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469
death thing is something that came later
 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:14.300
death thing is something that came later
in the thousands it wasn't something I

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310
in the thousands it wasn't something I
 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.740
in the thousands it wasn't something I
was thinking about it and I nice for

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750
was thinking about it and I nice for
 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.950
was thinking about it and I nice for
sure for example I remember you build a

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960
sure for example I remember you build a
 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.339

embeddings very very early on then

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029
embeddings very very early on then
 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.240

that's right yeah that's that's one of

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250
that's right yeah that's that's one of
 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.920
that's right yeah that's that's one of
the things that I got really excited

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930
the things that I got really excited
 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.100
the things that I got really excited
about in the late 90s was actually my

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110
about in the late 90s was actually my
 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.890
about in the late 90s was actually my
brother Sonny and I worked on the idea

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900
brother Sonny and I worked on the idea
 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.019
brother Sonny and I worked on the idea
that we could use neon Nets to tackle

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029
that we could use neon Nets to tackle
 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:40.820
that we could use neon Nets to tackle
the curse of dimensionality which was

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830
the curse of dimensionality which was
 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.040
the curse of dimensionality which was
believed to be one of the central issues

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050
believed to be one of the central issues
 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.820
believed to be one of the central issues
with statistical learning and the fact

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830
with statistical learning and the fact
 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.180
with statistical learning and the fact
that we could have these representations

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190
that we could have these representations
 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.490
that we could have these representations
could be used to represent joint

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500
could be used to represent joint
 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.790
could be used to represent joint
distributions over many random variables

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800
distributions over many random variables
 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.500

in a very efficient way and it turned

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510
in a very efficient way and it turned
 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.390
in a very efficient way and it turned
out to work quite well and then I

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400
out to work quite well and then I
 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.790
out to work quite well and then I
extended this to joint solutions over

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800
extended this to joint solutions over
 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.469
extended this to joint solutions over
sequences of words and this is how the

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479
sequences of words and this is how the
 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.180
sequences of words and this is how the
word embeddings were born because I

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190
word embeddings were born because I
 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.540
word embeddings were born because I
thought oh you know this will allow

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550
thought oh you know this will allow
 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.820
thought oh you know this will allow
analyzation across words that have

enough then there's the story I
 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.170
enough then there's the story I
mentioned about curse with emission

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180

attention mechanisms you can now handle

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:17.210
attention mechanisms you can now handle
 

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.170
attention mechanisms you can now handle
any kind of data structure and this is

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:20.180
any kind of data structure and this is
 

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.870
any kind of data structure and this is
this is really opening up interesting

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:22.880
this is really opening up interesting
 

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.900
this is really opening up interesting
avenues direction of actually connecting

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:25.910
avenues direction of actually connecting
 

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.310
avenues direction of actually connecting
to biology one thing that I've been

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:27.320
to biology one thing that I've been
 

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.659
to biology one thing that I've been
working on in the last couple of years

00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:28.669
working on in the last couple of years
 

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:33.310
working on in the last couple of years
is how could we come up with something

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320
is how could we come up with something
 

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.769
is how could we come up with something
like backprop but that brains could

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:35.779
like backprop but that brains could
 

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:37.930
like backprop but that brains could
implement and we have a few papers in

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:37.940
implement and we have a few papers in
 

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.670
implement and we have a few papers in
that direction that seems to be

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680
that direction that seems to be
 

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.130
that direction that seems to be
interesting for the

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:42.140
interesting for the
 

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.860
interesting for the
signs people and then we're continuing

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:44.870
signs people and then we're continuing
 

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.100
signs people and then we're continuing
in that direction of course one of the

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:48.110
in that direction of course one of the
 

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.780
in that direction of course one of the
topics that I know you've been thinking

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:49.790
topics that I know you've been thinking
 

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.670
topics that I know you've been thinking
all about is the relationship between

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680
all about is the relationship between
 

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.580
all about is the relationship between
deep learning and the brain can you tell

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:54.590
deep learning and the brain can you tell
 

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.220
deep learning and the brain can you tell
us a bit more about that the biological

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:57.230
us a bit more about that the biological
 

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.570
us a bit more about that the biological
thing is something I've been thinking

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:58.580
thing is something I've been thinking
 

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.460
thing is something I've been thinking
about for fara well actually and and and

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.470
about for fara well actually and and and
 

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.940
about for fara well actually and and and
and having a lot of I would say they

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:06.950
and having a lot of I would say they
 

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.390
and having a lot of I would say they
dreamin about because it's it's like I

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:10.400
dreamin about because it's it's like I
 

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.600
dreamin about because it's it's like I
think a bit like a puzzle so we have

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:13.610
think a bit like a puzzle so we have
 

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.580
think a bit like a puzzle so we have
these pieces of evidence from what we

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:15.590
these pieces of evidence from what we
 

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.350
these pieces of evidence from what we
know from the brain and from learning in

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360
know from the brain and from learning in
 

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.180
know from the brain and from learning in
the brain like spike timing-dependent

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:19.190
the brain like spike timing-dependent
 

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.410
the brain like spike timing-dependent
plasticity and and on the other hand we

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:23.420
plasticity and and on the other hand we
 

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.590
plasticity and and on the other hand we
have all these concepts from machine

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600
have all these concepts from machine
 

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.490
have all these concepts from machine
learning the idea of globally training

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:30.500
learning the idea of globally training
 

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.410
learning the idea of globally training
the whole system with respect to an

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:32.420
the whole system with respect to an
 

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.360
the whole system with respect to an
objective function and the idea of

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:34.370
objective function and the idea of
 

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.370
objective function and the idea of
backprop and i know and what does

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:36.380
backprop and i know and what does
 

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.400
backprop and i know and what does
backprop mean like what does credit

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:39.410
backprop mean like what does credit
 

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.450
backprop mean like what does credit
assignment really mean when I started

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:43.460
assignment really mean when I started
 

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.610
assignment really mean when I started
thinking about how brains could do

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:45.620
thinking about how brains could do
 

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.410
thinking about how brains could do
something like back profits it you know

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:47.420
something like back profits it you know
 

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.720
something like back profits it you know
prompted me to think about well maybe

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:49.730
prompted me to think about well maybe
 

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.580
prompted me to think about well maybe
there's like some more general concepts

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:51.590
there's like some more general concepts
 

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.140
there's like some more general concepts
behind back prop which make it so

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:53.150
behind back prop which make it so
 

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.490
behind back prop which make it so
efficient which allow us to to be

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:57.500
efficient which allow us to to be
 

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.930
efficient which allow us to to be
efficient with backdrop maybe there's a

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:58.940
efficient with backdrop maybe there's a
 

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.680
efficient with backdrop maybe there's a
larger family of ways to the credit

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:02.690
larger family of ways to the credit
 

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.720
larger family of ways to the credit
assignment and that connects to

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:04.730
assignment and that connects to
 

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.280
assignment and that connects to
questions that people in reinforcement

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.290
questions that people in reinforcement
 

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.930
questions that people in reinforcement
learning have been asking so it's

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:07.940
learning have been asking so it's
 

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.650
learning have been asking so it's
interesting how sometimes asking a

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:11.660
interesting how sometimes asking a
 

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.650
interesting how sometimes asking a
simple question leads you to thinking

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:14.660
simple question leads you to thinking
 

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.380
simple question leads you to thinking
about so many different things and and

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:17.390
about so many different things and and
 

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.160
about so many different things and and
forces you to think about so many

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:21.170
forces you to think about so many
 

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.210
forces you to think about so many
elements that you'd like to bring

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:22.220
elements that you'd like to bring
 

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.000
elements that you'd like to bring
together like a big puzzle so this has

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.010
together like a big puzzle so this has
 

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.250
together like a big puzzle so this has
gone for a number of years I need to say

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:27.260
gone for a number of years I need to say
 

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.580
gone for a number of years I need to say
that this whole endeavor like many of

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:30.590
that this whole endeavor like many of
 

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.710
that this whole endeavor like many of
the ones that have followed has been

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720
the ones that have followed has been
 

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.450
the ones that have followed has been
highly inspired by Jeff Hinton's

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:34.460
highly inspired by Jeff Hinton's
 

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.780
highly inspired by Jeff Hinton's
thoughts so in particular he gave this

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:37.790
thoughts so in particular he gave this
 

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:44.680
thoughts so in particular he gave this
talk in 2007 I think the first deep

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:44.690
talk in 2007 I think the first deep
 

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.490
talk in 2007 I think the first deep
learning workshop on what he thought was

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:48.500
learning workshop on what he thought was
 

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:54.090
learning workshop on what he thought was
the way that the brain is working how

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:54.100
the way that the brain is working how
 

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.180
the way that the brain is working how
temporal

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:56.190
temporal
 

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.370
temporal
kind of temporal code could be used for

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380
kind of temporal code could be used for
 

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.530
kind of temporal code could be used for
potentially to make some of the job of

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540
potentially to make some of the job of
 

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.720
potentially to make some of the job of
not prob and and that you know led to a

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:02.730
not prob and and that you know led to a
 

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.340
not prob and and that you know led to a
lot of the ideas that I've explored in

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:04.350
lot of the ideas that I've explored in
 

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.440
lot of the ideas that I've explored in
recent years with this yeah so it's kind

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:09.450
recent years with this yeah so it's kind
 

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.460
recent years with this yeah so it's kind
of an interesting story that has been

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:13.470
of an interesting story that has been
 

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.090
of an interesting story that has been
running for a decade now basically one

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100
running for a decade now basically one
 

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.160
running for a decade now basically one
of the topics I've heard you speak about

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.170
of the topics I've heard you speak about
 

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.500
of the topics I've heard you speak about
multiple times as well is unsupervised

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:21.510
multiple times as well is unsupervised
 

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.930
multiple times as well is unsupervised
learning yeah can you share your

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940
learning yeah can you share your
 

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.660
learning yeah can you share your
perspective on that yes yes

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:26.670
perspective on that yes yes
 

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.670
perspective on that yes yes
so unsupervised learning is really

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680
so unsupervised learning is really
 

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.170
so unsupervised learning is really
important right now

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180
important right now
 

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.600
important right now
our industrial systems are based on

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:32.610
our industrial systems are based on
 

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.880
our industrial systems are based on
supervised learning which essentially

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:34.890
supervised learning which essentially
 

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.890
supervised learning which essentially
requires humans to define what the

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:36.900
requires humans to define what the
 

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.960
requires humans to define what the
important concepts are for the problem

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:38.970
important concepts are for the problem
 

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.740
important concepts are for the problem
and to label those concepts and the data

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:41.750
and to label those concepts and the data
 

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.710
and to label those concepts and the data
and you know we build all these amazing

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720
and you know we build all these amazing
 

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.950
and you know we build all these amazing
toys and services and systems using this

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:48.960
toys and services and systems using this
 

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.580
toys and services and systems using this
but humans are able to do much more they

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:52.590
but humans are able to do much more they
 

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.730
but humans are able to do much more they
are able to explore and discover new

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740
are able to explore and discover new
 

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.670
are able to explore and discover new
concepts by observation and interaction

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680
concepts by observation and interaction
 

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.750
concepts by observation and interaction
with the world a two-year-old is able to

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760
with the world a two-year-old is able to
 

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.360
with the world a two-year-old is able to
understand intuitive physics in other

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:05.370
understand intuitive physics in other
 

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.280
understand intuitive physics in other
words she understands gravity she

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.290
words she understands gravity she
 

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.270
words she understands gravity she
understands pressure he understands

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:10.280
understands pressure he understands
 

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.600

she understands liquid solids and of

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:14.490
she understands liquid solids and of
 

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.370
she understands liquid solids and of
course her parents never told her about

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:16.380
course her parents never told her about
 

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.770
course her parents never told her about
any of these stuff right so how did you

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:18.780
any of these stuff right so how did you
 

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.310
any of these stuff right so how did you
figure it out so that's the kind of

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320
figure it out so that's the kind of
 

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.260
figure it out so that's the kind of
question that unsupervised learning is

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:24.270
question that unsupervised learning is
 

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:28.280
question that unsupervised learning is
trying to answer it's not just about we

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:28.290
trying to answer it's not just about we
 

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.380
trying to answer it's not just about we
have labels or we don't have labels it's

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.390
have labels or we don't have labels it's
 

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.500
have labels or we don't have labels it's
about actually building a construction a

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:33.510
about actually building a construction a
 

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.600
about actually building a construction a
mental construction that explains how

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:35.610
mental construction that explains how
 

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.450
mental construction that explains how
the world works by by observation and

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:38.460
the world works by by observation and
 

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.320
the world works by by observation and
more recently I've been combining the

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:42.330
more recently I've been combining the
 

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.000
more recently I've been combining the
ideas and as premised learning with the

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.010
ideas and as premised learning with the
 

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.800
ideas and as premised learning with the
ideas and reinforcement learning because

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:45.810
ideas and reinforcement learning because
 

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.060
ideas and reinforcement learning because
I believe that there's a very strong

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.070
I believe that there's a very strong
 

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.140
I believe that there's a very strong
indication about the important

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:51.150
indication about the important
 

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.900
indication about the important
underlying concepts that we're trying to

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:53.910
underlying concepts that we're trying to
 

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.270
underlying concepts that we're trying to
disentangle we're trying to separate

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:56.280
disentangle we're trying to separate
 

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.990
disentangle we're trying to separate
from each other that a human or machine

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000
from each other that a human or machine

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:02.610
can get by interacting with the book by
 

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.030
can get by interacting with the book by
by exploring the world and trying things

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040
by exploring the world and trying things
 

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.600
by exploring the world and trying things
and trying to control things

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:08.610
and trying to control things
 

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.300
and trying to control things
so these these are I think tightly

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:11.310
so these these are I think tightly
 

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.950
so these these are I think tightly
coupled to the original ideas of

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:12.960
coupled to the original ideas of
 

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.660
coupled to the original ideas of

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:14.670
premised wedding so my take on lands
 

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:19.100
premised wedding so my take on lands
provides learning 15 years ago when we

Cynthia rpms and so on was very focused

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:24.840
Cynthia rpms and so on was very focused
 

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.210
Cynthia rpms and so on was very focused
on the idea of learning good

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220
on the idea of learning good
 

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.710
on the idea of learning good
representations and I still think this

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720
representations and I still think this
 

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.700
representations and I still think this
is a central question but the the thing

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:31.710
is a central question but the the thing
 

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.560
is a central question but the the thing
we don't know is how and what is a good

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:33.570
we don't know is how and what is a good
 

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.460
we don't know is how and what is a good
representation how do we figure out a an

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:37.470
representation how do we figure out a an
 

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.920
representation how do we figure out a an
objective function for example so we've

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:39.930
objective function for example so we've
 

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.600
objective function for example so we've
tried many things over the years and

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:41.610
tried many things over the years and
 

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.310
tried many things over the years and
that's actually one of the cool things

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320
that's actually one of the cool things
 

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.690
that's actually one of the cool things
about its provides learning research

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700
about its provides learning research
 

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.580
about its provides learning research
that there are so many different ideas

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:46.590
that there are so many different ideas
 

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.670
that there are so many different ideas
different ways that this problem can be

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680
different ways that this problem can be
 

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.310
different ways that this problem can be
attacked and then that's just maybe

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320
attacked and then that's just maybe
 

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.780

know next year that's completely

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:55.590
know next year that's completely
 

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.680
know next year that's completely
different and and and maybe the brain is

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:57.690
different and and and maybe the brain is
 

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:58.850
different and and and maybe the brain is
using something else completely

00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860
using something else completely
 

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.090
using something else completely
different so it's it's not incremental

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.100
different so it's it's not incremental
 

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.760
different so it's it's not incremental

points learning so of course it's

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.050
points learning so of course it's
 

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.470
points learning so of course it's
challenging but at the same time there's

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480
challenging but at the same time there's
 

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.800

you know it leaves open why and feel
 

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.780
you know it leaves open why and feel
full of possibilities which is what you

know researchers really love at least

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.200
know researchers really love at least
 

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.670

that's something that appeals to me so

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680
that's something that appeals to me so
 

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.680
that's something that appeals to me so
you know today there's so much going on

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:30.690
you know today there's so much going on
 

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.210
you know today there's so much going on
in deep learning and I think we've

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220
in deep learning and I think we've
 

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.280
in deep learning and I think we've
passed the point where it's possible for

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:34.290
passed the point where it's possible for
 

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.020
passed the point where it's possible for

learning paper being published so I'm

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060
learning paper being published so I'm
 

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.910
learning paper being published so I'm
curious what a deep journey today

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920
curious what a deep journey today
 

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.620
curious what a deep journey today
excites you then though huh so I'm I'm

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:45.630
excites you then though huh so I'm I'm
 

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.840
excites you then though huh so I'm I'm
very ambitious and I feel like the

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:47.850
very ambitious and I feel like the
 

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.000
very ambitious and I feel like the
current state of science of deep

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.010
current state of science of deep

learning is far from anything we're

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620
learning is far from anything we're
 

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.670
learning is far from anything we're
applying it to see it and I have the

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680
applying it to see it and I have the
 

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.440
applying it to see it and I have the
impression that our systems right now

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:57.450
impression that our systems right now
 

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.920
impression that our systems right now
make mistakes that suggests the kind of

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:00.930
make mistakes that suggests the kind of
 

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.690
make mistakes that suggests the kind of
mistakes that suggest that they have a

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:02.700
mistakes that suggest that they have a
 

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.180
mistakes that suggest that they have a
very superficial understanding of the

very superficial understanding of the
 

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.670
very superficial understanding of the
world so what excites me the most now is

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680
world so what excites me the most now is
 

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.350
world so what excites me the most now is
sort of direction of research where

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360
sort of direction of research where
 

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.420
sort of direction of research where
we're not trying to build systems I'm

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:14.430
we're not trying to build systems I'm
 

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.890
we're not trying to build systems I'm
gonna do something useful we're just

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:15.900
gonna do something useful we're just
 

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.970
gonna do something useful we're just
going back to principles about how can a

going back to principles about how can a
 

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.429
going back to principles about how can a

observe the world interact with the

00:15:23.469 --> 00:15:23.479
observe the world interact with the
 

00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:25.689
observe the world interact with the
world and discover how that world works

00:15:25.689 --> 00:15:25.699
world and discover how that world works
 

00:15:25.699 --> 00:15:27.939
world and discover how that world works
even if that world is simple something

00:15:27.939 --> 00:15:27.949
even if that world is simple something
 

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:29.739
even if that world is simple something
that we can program is a kind of video

00:15:29.739 --> 00:15:29.749
that we can program is a kind of video
 

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:32.229
that we can program is a kind of video
game we don't know how to do that well

00:15:32.229 --> 00:15:32.239
game we don't know how to do that well
 

00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:34.659
game we don't know how to do that well
and that's cool because I don't have to

00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:34.669
and that's cool because I don't have to
 

00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:36.369
and that's cool because I don't have to
compete with Google and Facebook and

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:36.379
compete with Google and Facebook and
 

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:39.729
compete with Google and Facebook and
Baidu and so on right because this is a

00:15:39.729 --> 00:15:39.739
Baidu and so on right because this is a
 

00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:42.460
Baidu and so on right because this is a
kind of basic research that can be done

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:42.470
kind of basic research that can be done
 

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.259
kind of basic research that can be done
by anyone in their Garret and could

00:15:44.259 --> 00:15:44.269
by anyone in their Garret and could
 

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:45.009
by anyone in their Garret and could
change the world

00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:45.019
change the world
 

00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:48.369
change the world
so there are many of course many

00:15:48.369 --> 00:15:48.379
so there are many of course many
 

00:15:48.379 --> 00:15:50.799
so there are many of course many
directions to attack this but I see a

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:50.809
directions to attack this but I see a
 

00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:53.619
directions to attack this but I see a
lot of the fruitful interactions between

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:53.629
lot of the fruitful interactions between
 

00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:55.029
lot of the fruitful interactions between
ideas and deep learning and

00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:55.039
ideas and deep learning and
 

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:56.229
ideas and deep learning and
reinforcement learning being really

00:15:56.229 --> 00:15:56.239
reinforcement learning being really
 

00:15:56.239 --> 00:16:00.099
reinforcement learning being really
important there and you know I'm really

00:16:00.099 --> 00:16:00.109
important there and you know I'm really
 

00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:02.139
important there and you know I'm really
excited that the progress in this

00:16:02.139 --> 00:16:02.149
excited that the progress in this
 

00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:04.710
excited that the progress in this
direction could have a huge impact on

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720
direction could have a huge impact on
 

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.089
direction could have a huge impact on
practical applications actually because

00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:07.099
practical applications actually because
 

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.469
practical applications actually because
if you look at some of the big

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:08.479
if you look at some of the big
 

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:10.629
if you look at some of the big
challenges that we have in applications

00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639
challenges that we have in applications
 

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:13.379
challenges that we have in applications

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:13.389
like how we deal with new domains or
 

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:15.429
like how we deal with new domains or
categories on which we have too few

00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:15.439
categories on which we have too few
 

00:16:15.439 --> 00:16:19.029
categories on which we have too few
examples and in cases where humans are

00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:19.039
examples and in cases where humans are
 

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:20.769
examples and in cases where humans are
very good at solving those problems so

00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:20.779
very good at solving those problems so
 

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:23.439
very good at solving those problems so
these transfer learning and joys Asian

00:16:23.439 --> 00:16:23.449
these transfer learning and joys Asian
 

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:28.629
these transfer learning and joys Asian
issues they would become much easier to

00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639
issues they would become much easier to
 

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:31.299
issues they would become much easier to
tackle if we have systems that had a

00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:31.309
tackle if we have systems that had a
 

00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:33.309
tackle if we have systems that had a
better understanding of how the world

00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319
better understanding of how the world
 

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:35.319
better understanding of how the world
works a deeper understanding right what

00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:35.329
works a deeper understanding right what
 

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:36.999
works a deeper understanding right what
is actually going on what are the causes

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:37.009
is actually going on what are the causes
 

00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:40.989
is actually going on what are the causes
of what I'm seeing and and how could I

00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:40.999
of what I'm seeing and and how could I
 

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:43.029
of what I'm seeing and and how could I
you know influence what I'm saying by my

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:43.039
you know influence what I'm saying by my
 

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:46.749
you know influence what I'm saying by my
actions so these these are the kinds of

00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759
actions so these these are the kinds of
 

00:16:46.759 --> 00:16:48.909
actions so these these are the kinds of
questions and really excited about these

00:16:48.909 --> 00:16:48.919
questions and really excited about these
 

00:16:48.919 --> 00:16:53.409
questions and really excited about these
days and I think they connect also the

00:16:53.409 --> 00:16:53.419
days and I think they connect also the
 

00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:55.869
days and I think they connect also the
deep learning research that has evolved

00:16:55.869 --> 00:16:55.879
deep learning research that has evolved
 

00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:59.769
deep learning research that has evolved
for the last couple of decades with even

00:16:59.769 --> 00:16:59.779
for the last couple of decades with even
 

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:01.329
for the last couple of decades with even
all the questions in the eye because a

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:01.339
all the questions in the eye because a
 

00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:04.480
all the questions in the eye because a
lot of the sisters success in deep

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:04.490
lot of the sisters success in deep
 

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.720
lot of the sisters success in deep
learning has been with perception so

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:07.730
learning has been with perception so
 

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.730
learning has been with perception so
what's left right what's left is sort of

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:09.740
what's left right what's left is sort of
 

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.379
what's left right what's left is sort of
high-level cognition which is about

00:17:11.379 --> 00:17:11.389
high-level cognition which is about
 

00:17:11.389 --> 00:17:14.169
high-level cognition which is about
understanding at an abstract level how

00:17:14.169 --> 00:17:14.179
understanding at an abstract level how
 

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:15.999
understanding at an abstract level how
things work so we our program of

00:17:15.999 --> 00:17:16.009
things work so we our program of
 

00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:17.710
things work so we our program of
understanding high-level abstractions I

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720
understanding high-level abstractions I
 

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.769
understanding high-level abstractions I
think has you know not reached those

00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:20.779
think has you know not reached those
 

00:17:20.779 --> 00:17:22.269
think has you know not reached those
high levels of abstractions and so we

00:17:22.269 --> 00:17:22.279
high levels of abstractions and so we
 

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:24.309
high levels of abstractions and so we
have to get there we have to think about

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319
have to get there we have to think about
 

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.610
have to get there we have to think about
reasoning about sequential processing of

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:27.620
reasoning about sequential processing of
 

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.560
reasoning about sequential processing of
information we have to think of how

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:29.570
information we have to think of how
 

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.379
information we have to think of how
causality works and and how machines can

00:17:32.379 --> 00:17:32.389
causality works and and how machines can
 

00:17:32.389 --> 00:17:34.490
causality works and and how machines can
discover all these things by themselves

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500
discover all these things by themselves
 

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.560
discover all these things by themselves
essentially guided by humans but as much

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:36.570
essentially guided by humans but as much
 

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.620
essentially guided by humans but as much
as possible in an autonomous way and it

sounds like from I love what you said

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220
sounds like from I love what you said
 

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.060
sounds like from I love what you said
that you're a fan of research approaches

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:44.070
that you're a fan of research approaches
 

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.880
that you're a fan of research approaches
where you experiment on you know I'm

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:46.890
where you experiment on you know I'm
 

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.980
where you experiment on you know I'm
going to use the term toy problem not in

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:48.990
going to use the term toy problem not in
 

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.420
going to use the term toy problem not in
the disparaging right but on the small

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:50.430
the disparaging right but on the small
 

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.460
the disparaging right but on the small
problem and you're optimistic that that

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:52.470
problem and you're optimistic that that
 

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.790
problem and you're optimistic that that
transfers to bigger problems later yes

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:55.800
transfers to bigger problems later yes
 

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.720
transfers to bigger problems later yes
yes yes and I mean it transfers in in a

00:17:59.720 --> 00:17:59.730
yes yes and I mean it transfers in in a
 

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.910
yes yes and I mean it transfers in in a
meta way right of course we're gonna

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:01.920
meta way right of course we're gonna
 

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.440
meta way right of course we're gonna
have to do some work to escape a lab and

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:05.450
have to do some work to escape a lab and
 

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.260
have to do some work to escape a lab and
address those problems but my main

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:09.270
address those problems but my main
 

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.910
address those problems but my main
motivation for going for those toy

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:10.920
motivation for going for those toy
 

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.130
motivation for going for those toy
problems is that we can understand

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140
problems is that we can understand
 

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.180
problems is that we can understand
better our failures and we can reduce

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:17.190
better our failures and we can reduce
 

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.040
better our failures and we can reduce
use the problem to something we can

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.050
use the problem to something we can
 

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.920
use the problem to something we can
intuitively sort of manipulate and

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:23.930
intuitively sort of manipulate and
 

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.840
intuitively sort of manipulate and
understand more easily so sort of

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:26.850
understand more easily so sort of
 

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.730
understand more easily so sort of
classical divide and conquer you know

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740
classical divide and conquer you know
 

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.320
classical divide and conquer you know
science approach and also I think

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:32.330
science approach and also I think
 

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.400
science approach and also I think
something people don't think about

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:34.410
something people don't think about
 

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.460
something people don't think about
enough is the cycle the research cycle

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:37.470
enough is the cycle the research cycle
 

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.200
enough is the cycle the research cycle
can be much faster right so if I can do

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:39.210
can be much faster right so if I can do
 

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.510
can be much faster right so if I can do
an experiment in in a few hours

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520
an experiment in in a few hours
 

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.270
an experiment in in a few hours
I can I can progress much faster if if I

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280
I can I can progress much faster if if I
 

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.190
I can I can progress much faster if if I
have to try a huge model that's trying

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200
have to try a huge model that's trying
 

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.560
have to try a huge model that's trying
to capture the whole common sense and

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:48.570
to capture the whole common sense and
 

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.870
to capture the whole common sense and
you know everything in the general

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880
you know everything in the general
 

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.400
you know everything in the general
knowledge which will eventually we'll do

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:54.410
knowledge which will eventually we'll do
 

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.080
knowledge which will eventually we'll do
is just that each experiment just takes

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.090
is just that each experiment just takes
 

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.640
is just that each experiment just takes
too much time with current hardware

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:58.650
too much time with current hardware
 

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.350
too much time with current hardware
so while of our hardware friends are

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360
so while of our hardware friends are
 

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.550
so while of our hardware friends are
building machines they're gonna be a

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:01.560
building machines they're gonna be a
 

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.220
building machines they're gonna be a
thousand or million times faster I'm

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:04.230
thousand or million times faster I'm
 

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:09.320
thousand or million times faster I'm
doing those toy experiments you know I

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:09.330
doing those toy experiments you know I
 

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.770
doing those toy experiments you know I
shall also just speak about the signs of

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780
shall also just speak about the signs of
 

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.750
shall also just speak about the signs of
deep learning it's not just as a

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760
deep learning it's not just as a
 

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.910
deep learning it's not just as a
engineering discipline but doing more

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:16.920
engineering discipline but doing more
 

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.410
engineering discipline but doing more
work to understand what's really going

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:18.420
work to understand what's really going
 

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.100
work to understand what's really going
on

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:19.110
on
 

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.160

do you share your thoughts on that you

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:22.170
do you share your thoughts on that you
 

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.520
do you share your thoughts on that you
know absolutely I fear that a lot of the

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:25.530
know absolutely I fear that a lot of the
 

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.890
know absolutely I fear that a lot of the
work that they're doing is sort of like

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:26.900
work that they're doing is sort of like
 

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.360
work that they're doing is sort of like
blind people trying to find their way

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:29.370
blind people trying to find their way
 

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:34.220
blind people trying to find their way
and you know you can get a lot of luck

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:34.230
and you know you can get a lot of luck
 

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.440
and you know you can get a lot of luck
and and find interesting things that way

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:36.450
and and find interesting things that way
 

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.410
and and find interesting things that way
but but really if we sort of stop a

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:39.420
but but really if we sort of stop a
 

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.050
but but really if we sort of stop a
little bit and I'm trying to understand

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:42.060
little bit and I'm trying to understand
 

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.419
little bit and I'm trying to understand
what we're doing in in a way that's

00:19:44.419 --> 00:19:44.429
what we're doing in in a way that's
 

00:19:44.429 --> 00:19:46.730
what we're doing in in a way that's
transferable because because we go down

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740
transferable because because we go down
 

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.170
transferable because because we go down

not like of course I like math and so on
 

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.250
not like of course I like math and so on
but but I don't think that we need that

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:57.260
but but I don't think that we need that
 

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.960
but but I don't think that we need that
everything be formalized mathematically

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:58.970
everything be formalized mathematically
 

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.240
everything be formalized mathematically
but be formalized logically in other

you know this should work with it this

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120
you know this should work with it this
 

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.440
you know this should work with it this

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:08.450
makes sense this is the most important
 

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.200
makes sense this is the most important
aspect and then math you know allows us

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.210
aspect and then math you know allows us
 

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.320
aspect and then math you know allows us
to make that stronger and tighter but

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:14.330
to make that stronger and tighter but
 

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.120
to make that stronger and tighter but
but really it's more about understanding

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.130
but really it's more about understanding
 

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.850
but really it's more about understanding
and it's about also doing our research

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:20.860
and it's about also doing our research
 

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.190

allow us to understand better the

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:36.770
allow us to understand better the
 

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.230
allow us to understand better the

things we don't understand yet so we can

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.090
things we don't understand yet so we can
 

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.970

maybe design experiments whose goal is

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:51.980
maybe design experiments whose goal is
 

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.740
maybe design experiments whose goal is
not to have like a better all of them

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:53.750
not to have like a better all of them
 

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.720
not to have like a better all of them
but just to understand better the

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:55.730
but just to understand better the
 

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.870
but just to understand better the
algorithms we currently have or you know

00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880

why what circumstances make particular
 

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.430
why what circumstances make particular
algorithm work better and then why I

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440
algorithm work better and then why I
 

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.140
algorithm work better and then why I
mean it's the Y that really matters

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:05.150
mean it's the Y that really matters
 

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:06.910
mean it's the Y that really matters
that's what science is about it's why

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:06.920
that's what science is about it's why
 

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.340
that's what science is about it's why
right today there are a lot of people

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:09.350
right today there are a lot of people
 

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.020
right today there are a lot of people
that want to enter the fuse and I'm sure

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.030

you've answered there's a lot in

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320
you've answered there's a lot in
 

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.650
you've answered there's a lot in
one-on-one settings but you know with

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:14.660
one-on-one settings but you know with
 

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.090

what advice would you have for people

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.020
what advice would you have for people
 

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.930
what advice would you have for people
that want to get into AR again there's a

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:19.940
that want to get into AR again there's a
 

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.660

deep learning and so so first of all

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:22.670
deep learning and so so first of all
 

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.280
deep learning and so so first of all
there are different motivations that

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:24.290
there are different motivations that
 

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.540
there are different motivations that
different things you could do you know

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:27.550
different things you could do you know
 

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.770
different things you could do you know
what you need to become a deep learning

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:29.780
what you need to become a deep learning
 

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.990
what you need to become a deep learning
researcher may not be the same as if you

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000
researcher may not be the same as if you
 

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.480
researcher may not be the same as if you
want to be an engineer who's going to

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:34.490
want to be an engineer who's going to
 

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.390
want to be an engineer who's going to
use deep learning to build products

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400
use deep learning to build products
 

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.140
use deep learning to build products
there's a different level of

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:38.150
there's a different level of
 

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.580
there's a different level of
understanding that's needed in both

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:39.590
understanding that's needed in both
 

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:43.920
understanding that's needed in both
cases but but in any case in both cases

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:43.930
 
 

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:49.810
 
practice practice so to really master a

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:49.820
practice practice so to really master a
 

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.670
practice practice so to really master a
subject like deep learning you of course

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:51.680
subject like deep learning you of course
 

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.280
subject like deep learning you of course
you have to read a lot you have to

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:54.290
you have to read a lot you have to
 

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.290
you have to read a lot you have to
practice so programming the things

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:56.300
practice so programming the things

very often I

00:21:59.490 --> 00:21:59.500
very often I
 

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.140
very often I
you know I interview students who have

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.150
you know I interview students who have
 

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.540
you know I interview students who have
used software and these days there's so

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:03.550
used software and these days there's so
 

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.430

somebody knows so good software around

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440
somebody knows so good software around
 

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.410
somebody knows so good software around
that you can just you know plug and play

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:07.420
that you can just you know plug and play
 

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.910
that you can just you know plug and play
and understand nothing of what you're

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:08.920
and understand nothing of what you're
 

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.070
and understand nothing of what you're
doing or it's such a superficial level

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080
doing or it's such a superficial level
 

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.650
doing or it's such a superficial level
that then it becomes hard to figure out

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:13.660
that then it becomes hard to figure out
 

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.000
that then it becomes hard to figure out
when it doesn't work and what's going

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.010
when it doesn't work and what's going
 

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.610
when it doesn't work and what's going
wrong so actually trying to implement

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:17.620
wrong so actually trying to implement
 

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.410
wrong so actually trying to implement
things yourself even if it's inefficient

things yourself even if it's inefficient
 

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.760
things yourself even if it's inefficient
but just to make sure you really

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:20.770
but just to make sure you really
 

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.890
but just to make sure you really
understand what is going on is really

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:22.900
understand what is going on is really
 

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.180

useful and and you know 20 No so that

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:27.190
useful and and you know 20 No so that
 

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.800

don't just use one of the program

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:28.810
don't just use one of the program
 

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.240
don't just use one of the program
framework so you can do everything in a

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:30.250
framework so you can do everything in a
 

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.500
framework so you can do everything in a
few lines of code but you don't really

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:31.510
few lines of code but you don't really
 

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.900
few lines of code but you don't really
know what what just happen right exactly

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:33.910
know what what just happen right exactly
 

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.780
know what what just happen right exactly
exactly and and I would say even more

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:36.790
exactly and and I would say even more
 

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.430

than that trying to derive the thing

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:38.440
than that trying to derive the thing

if you can so that really helps but you
 

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.010
if you can so that really helps but you
know I mean the usual things you have to

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:47.020
know I mean the usual things you have to
 

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.160
know I mean the usual things you have to
do like reading looking at other

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.170
do like reading looking at other
 

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.560

doing a lot of experiment making sure

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:55.540
doing a lot of experiment making sure
 

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.420
doing a lot of experiment making sure
you understand everything you do so I

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:57.430
you understand everything you do so I
 

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.430
you understand everything you do so I
mean especially for the science part of

00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440
mean especially for the science part of
 

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.020

it trying to ask why am I doing this why

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.030
it trying to ask why am I doing this why
 

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.000
it trying to ask why am I doing this why
are people doing this and maybe the

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.010
are people doing this and maybe the
 

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.000
are people doing this and maybe the
answer is is somewhere in the book and

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.010
answer is is somewhere in the book and
 

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.970
answer is is somewhere in the book and
you have to read more but it's even

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:11.980
you have to read more but it's even
 

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.410
you have to read more but it's even
better if you can actually figure it out

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:13.420
better if you can actually figure it out
 

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.670
better if you can actually figure it out
by yourself and and in fact of the

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.310
conferences but but if you really want
to go for a lot of good papers just with

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320
to go for a lot of good papers just with
 

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.800
to go for a lot of good papers just with
the last few I see a lot of proceedings

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:55.810
the last few I see a lot of proceedings
 

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.960
the last few I see a lot of proceedings
and that will give you a really good

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:57.970
and that will give you a really good
 

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.340
and that will give you a really good
view of the field any other thoughts

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:02.350
view of the field any other thoughts
 

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.470
view of the field any other thoughts
that when people ask you for advice you

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480
that when people ask you for advice you
 

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.720
that when people ask you for advice you
know how does someone write become good

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:06.730
know how does someone write become good
 

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:11.600
know how does someone write become good
at deep learning well

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:11.610
 
 

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.000
 
it depends on where you come from don't

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.010
it depends on where you come from don't
 

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.270
it depends on where you come from don't
be afraid by the math just you know just

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:18.280
be afraid by the math just you know just
 

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.880
be afraid by the math just you know just
develop the intuitions and then the math

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:20.890
develop the intuitions and then the math
 

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.830
develop the intuitions and then the math
become really easier to understand once

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840
become really easier to understand once
 

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.050
become really easier to understand once
once you get the hang of what's going on

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:25.060
once you get the hang of what's going on
 

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.830
once you get the hang of what's going on
at the intuitive level and one good news

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840
at the intuitive level and one good news
 

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.410
at the intuitive level and one good news
is that you don't need five years of PhD

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:31.420
is that you don't need five years of PhD
 

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.690
is that you don't need five years of PhD
to become proficient at deep planning

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:33.700
to become proficient at deep planning
 

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.640
to become proficient at deep planning
you can actually learn pretty quickly if

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:35.650
you can actually learn pretty quickly if
 

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.190
you can actually learn pretty quickly if
you have a a good background in computer

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200
you have a a good background in computer
 

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.710
you have a a good background in computer
science and math you can you can learn

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720
science and math you can you can learn
 

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.970
science and math you can you can learn
enough to use it and build things and

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:44.980
enough to use it and build things and
 

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.940
enough to use it and build things and
and start research experiments in just a

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:47.950
and start research experiments in just a
 

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.530
and start research experiments in just a
few months you know something like six

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:49.540
few months you know something like six
 

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.730
few months you know something like six
months for people with the right

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:50.740
months for people with the right
 

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.700
months for people with the right
training may maybe they don't know

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:53.710
training may maybe they don't know
 

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.380
training may maybe they don't know
anything about machine learning but if

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:55.390
anything about machine learning but if
 

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.640
anything about machine learning but if
they're good in math and computer

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:56.650
they're good in math and computer
 

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.460
they're good in math and computer
science it can be very fast and of

00:24:59.460 --> 00:24:59.470
science it can be very fast and of
 

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:00.960
science it can be very fast and of
course so that means you need to have

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:00.970
course so that means you need to have
 

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.370
course so that means you need to have
the right training in math computer

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:02.380
the right training in math computer
 

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.430
the right training in math computer
