1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,040
Today,

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,040
we are going to do something different
from what's happened so far in that we

3
00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:09,680
are going to study the
dynamics of more than one body.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,380
Or you might say,
look,

5
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:17,381
we already did this last week when I
studied the solar system where there are

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,820
planners moving around the sun.
So that makes up these two bodies,

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:21,740
the sign in the planet,

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,590
but actually the son was not doing
anything interesting in our analysis.

9
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:30,470
Son Just stood there as the source of
the gravitational force is a planet that

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,220
did all the orbiting and that
was a problem in two dimensions.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,780
But I've only one body.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,060
So now we're going to enlarge over
domain to more than one body or being

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,433
Newton's laws.

14
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,470
So let me start with the
simplest possible case.

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,120
Two bodies and I will again started
simplest case of they're moving in one

16
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:56,300
dimension.
Then we'll put in more.

17
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,980
So here is the one dimensional world
in these bodies are going to move

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,330
and this is my origin.
X equals zero.

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,930
And I'm going to imagine one point mass
and one located at x one other point.

20
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,710
Bass m two located at x two.

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,483
Oh

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:30,951
No.

23
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:35,300
We know everything that is to know about
these masses from the likes of Newton,

24
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:36,290
which I'm going to write down.

25
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,210
The first mass obeys does equation
m the two x one over d t square.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,460
That's Mia, right? But I'm going to write
this in a notation that's more succinct.

27
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,670
Um, prior to writing the second
day they would have this fashion.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to write it as follows.
M One x one with two dots in it.

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,780
The two dots telling you is to
derivatives. If there's one daughters,

30
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,850
one day they would have
$3 to three data centers.

31
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,550
Of course at some point there's
notation becomes unwieldy,

32
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,170
but you never deal with more than two
derivatives. So this works. This is Amy,

33
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,150
so don't forget the docs, okay?
This is not some foreign alphabet.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,820
every.is it did have it.

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,750
You should remember that when I do the
subsequent manipulation, that's Amy.

36
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,960
And that's equal to force on body one.

37
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,200
No,
look at the body one.

38
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:37,201
And ask what are the forces acting on it
that it could be the whole universe but

39
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,490
we going to divide that into two parts.

40
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,180
The first part is going to be the force
on body one due to body to which I'm

41
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:49,420
going to denote by f one
two f southern rotation.

42
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,450
You and I agree that's the forest in
one duty to then that's the force on one

43
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:58,990
due to the external world.
E stands for external.

44
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,190
That means everything outside these two
do universe as many bodies I have to

45
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:08,191
speak these two guys they're wanting to
and the force on one is some of it's due

46
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,700
to too and some of what
to do to everything else.

47
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,370
Similarly,

48
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,370
I have another equation and two x two
double.is the fourth son to do do one plus

49
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:29,120
the force on to due to the outside world.
What do you mean by outside world?

50
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,320
Maybe these two guys have an extra some
planet and the planet is way over to the

51
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:36,620
right. It's pulling all of them towards
the planet with some gravitational force,

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,260
so everything else is called external
like one and two for example.

53
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,760
Are connected by a spring.
The spring is not that important.

54
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,670
It's a way of transmitting force
from one body to the other.

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,780
If you're compress the spring and let
it go, these two masters at white bread,

56
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,600
back and forth under the influence
of the other person's force.

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,610
That's an example of f one two
and a half to one for example,

58
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,880
the spring is compressed at this
incident is trying to push them out.

59
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,480
That means really one is trying to push
to outwards that way too is trying to

60
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,370
push one to the left this way.

61
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,030
That's an example of f
one two and half to one.

62
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,260
The external force could be due to
something extraneous to these two bodies.

63
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,060
So one example is the
surface of the earth.

64
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,050
I take these two masters
connected by a sprain.

65
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,440
There is mass one and here's my stew.
I squashed the spring.

66
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,790
If there is no gravity,
they would just go vibrating up and down,

67
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,160
but let them fall under
the field of gravity.

68
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,830
So they're also experiencing the mg due
to gravity so they will both fall down

69
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:47,420
and also oscillate relate to each other.
They're all described by this equation.

70
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,510
This will be the spring force
transmitted from one to two.

71
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,740
This would be the force of gravity article
could be electric force at any other

72
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:56,420
force to to anything else.
I'm not interested.

73
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,140
Now here's the interesting
manipulation we are going to perform.

74
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,910
We're going to add the two things on
the lefthand side and equate them to

75
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:06,320
whatever they get on the right hand side.

76
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Then I get m one x one double.plus m
two x two double doc and that's going to

77
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:20,540
be,
I'm going to write it in a particular way.

78
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,130
If one external plus F to
external plus f one two f two one

79
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,580
I think you have some idea
where I'm headed now, so what's,

80
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,110
what's the next thing we could say?
Yes,

81
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,930
yes, because that's the third law of
new whatever the underlying force,

82
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,920
gravity spring,

83
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:51,660
anything forced on one [inaudible] to
enforce them to do two one will cancel and

84
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:56,190
everything I get today, the whole lecture
is mainly about this one simple result,

85
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,970
this cancellation.
Then this whole thing.

86
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,110
I'm going to write this ethics journal
meaning the total external force.

87
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,910
On this two body system.

88
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,950
So I have this peculiarity question.

89
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm going to rewrite it in a way that
brings it to the form in which is most

90
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:22,320
useful.
I'm going to introduce a new guy,

91
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,600
capital x,
as you know,

92
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:29,601
that's called the center
of mass coordinate and it's
defined as m one x one plus

93
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:35,190
m two x two divided by capital m.

94
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,430
Capital m is just the total
mass and one plus empty.

95
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,690
If I do that,
this is a definition,

96
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,740
then we can write the
secret mission as follows.

97
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,410
I would write it and then we can take
over time seeing that it is correct.

98
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,950
So this is really the big equation.

99
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,840
Yeah.

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,650
What did you guys try to
fill in the blanks in your
head? This is really correct.

101
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,350
On the lefthand side,
I have capital m times x double doc,

102
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,740
so I have really m one plus m two

103
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,040
times x double dot. If you
take the double door, this guy,

104
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,430
it's an one x one double.plus m to
extrude double dot divided by m one plus m

105
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:33,070
two
so the left hand side is indeed this.

106
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,360
That's all I want you to check.

107
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,680
So take this expression divided by the
total mass and multiply by the total mass.

108
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:39,671
Well,

109
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:43,330
the multiplying by the turtle masters
here and when divided by the total mass

110
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,330
you get the second didn't it threw
off the center of mass coordinate.

111
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,130
So what have I done?

112
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,240
I have introduced a fictitious entity,

113
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,000
the center of mass central
Mass USA location, capital x,

114
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,510
some grant of a weighted average
of x one and x two by weighted,

115
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,470
I mean if I'm on an m, two would equal
then capitol and bill be two, two,

116
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:15,780
two times at mass and you'd just get x
one plus x two over to central mass would

117
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:18,390
sit right in between,
but if m one is heavier,

118
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,930
it'd be tilted towards and
one of inclusive vehicle
be tilted towards them too.

119
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,080
It's a way to sum that gives a certain
coordinate that is nothing present at

120
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:30,690
that location.
There's nobody there.

121
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,270
All the stuff they did here or that
the central mass is the location of a

122
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
mathematical entity.
It's not a physical entity.

123
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,240
If you go there and say
watch are the central mass,

124
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,770
you typically won't find anything

125
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,130
and it behaves like a body.
After all,

126
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:48,000
if you just said,

127
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,810
I've learned Newton's laws and I walk into
this room and I say this, I won't say,

128
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:55,770
well this guy's talking about a body
of mass capital m undergoing some

129
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:57,420
acceleration due to the force

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,960
for the center of mass is a body whose
mass seems to be the total mass at these

131
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,334
two particles.

132
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,570
Who's acceleration is controlled
by the same as Newton's law,

133
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,120
but the right hand side contains only
the external forces. This is the key.

134
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,290
All the internal forces have canceled
out and what remains to the external

135
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:25,590
force. Now your fraternity
started even got three bodies.

136
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:29,490
You can do a similar manipulation and
again you'll have f one two and half to

137
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:33,120
three and have three or two and so on.
They will all canceled and walk through.

138
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:36,870
The man will be a similar thing,
but this is the total external force.

139
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,420
So if I can say this in words,

140
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:44,990
what we have learned is that the
advantage of introducing a quantity called

141
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:49,991
center of mass is that it responds only
to the total force and doesn't care

142
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:54,110
about internal forces.
So I give you an example.

143
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,210
So he had a some at a plane,
right?

144
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:03,200
It's in flight and a couple of guys that
are having a fight punching each other

145
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,870
and so on. The rest of the
passenger says enough is enough.

146
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:10,520
And to throw them out there just
floating around affecting each other's

147
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:14,810
dynamics. And of course this person
will feel a forced you to that person.

148
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:17,030
That person would feel of
course you to this person.

149
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,450
But what I'm telling you is the center
of mass is going to drop like a rock.

150
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,230
It's going to accelerate
with the forest MGH.

151
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,610
I'm just going to accelerate with Ge.

152
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,410
So at one point that this person may be
having the upper hand and maybe hear the

153
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:32,540
other person may be down here,
but follow the central mass,

154
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,730
you find there's simply
falls under gravity.

155
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,350
So the mutual forces do not affect
the dynamics of the center of mass

156
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,200
art.
For example.

157
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,150
Suppose at some point this person blows
the other one up into say to Samurai

158
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,200
that make it simple,
cuts them up in two pieces.

159
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,100
So let me got three bodies now,
first protagonist and the other two.

160
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,920
Now unfortunately somewhat decimated.

161
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,510
Now you can take these three bodies,
find their center of mass.

162
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,390
It'll be the same thing.
It'll just keep falling down.

163
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,200
So even though the system is
becoming more and more complicated,

164
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,260
you cannot change the dynamics
of the center of mass.

165
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,300
It responds only to the external force.

166
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,260
If this fight was taking place in
outer space, but there's no gravity,

167
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,130
then as this fight continues and people
are flying in parts of laying everywhere,

168
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,420
central mass, we'll just be in one
location not doing anything. Yes,

169
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,970
no, that's what I'm saying.
Center of mass. If it changes,

170
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,070
it can certainly, no one says the
central mass cannot accelerate.

171
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,840
It can accelerate due to external forces.
But if there were no external forces,

172
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,870
then the center of mass will behave like
a particular with no force for the not

173
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,661
moving to begin with.

174
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:51,560
It won't move later or if it is moving
to begin with that he maintain a constant

175
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:55,480
velocity.
So here's another example.

176
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,930
Now you can obviously generalize
this to more than one dimension.

177
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,440
If you're living in two dimensions,
you will introduce an x coordinate,

178
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,910
introduce a white coordinate,

179
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,270
and then you will have the center of
mass as m r double dot equal to f and r

180
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,620
would be m one odd one plus m two r two
divided by the total mass r one and r

181
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:25,720
two are just the location.

182
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,030
Now been two dimensions of
these two masses. So here,

183
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:32,980
the same one here,
the m too,

184
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,850
and the center of mass you can check
will be somebody in between the line

185
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,580
joining the two points,
but it'll now be a vector.

186
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,920
So here's another example.
So you'll take a complicated object.

187
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:47,510
It's got masters and there's God springs.

188
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:49,640
It's connected with thread
and chains and everything.

189
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,500
You throw the whole mess into the air.

190
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,580
All the different parts of it are
juggling and doing complicated movements.

191
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,800
But if you follow the center of mass,
in other words,

192
00:12:57,801 --> 00:13:02,240
that every instant you take the m one
odd one plus m two r two plus MTR three

193
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,630
and so on,
divided by the total mass that coordinate,

194
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,920
would it simply be following the
parabolic path of a body curving under the

195
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:10,754
gravity?

196
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,100
Yeah.

197
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,700
If at some point this complicated
object fragments into two chunks,

198
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,450
one with land he had in one would
land there, but at every incident,

199
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:20,680
if you follow the center of mass,

200
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,710
it'll go as if nothing happened and it
will land here in central mass that's not

201
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:30,520
cared about internal forces
but only about external forces.

202
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,480
That's the main point and it was designed
in such a way that external forces

203
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,980
canceled in those dynamics.

204
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,590
So everything I'm going to do today is
to take that equation and mixed doubles

205
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:46,591
dot equalsF or m r double dot equal f
in vector form and did you is all the

206
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:50,260
consequence? No. First of all,

207
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:53,590
you should realize that if you've
got several bodies, say three bodies,

208
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,390
then I would define the
center of mass to be m I x.

209
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,810
I divided but some or what am I?
This is the shorthand.

210
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,190
I'm going to write it only once,

211
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,350
but you should know about the notation
means if there's eye from one to three it

212
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:13,351
really means m one x one plus m two x
two m three x three divided by m one plus

213
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:22,150
m two lesson three. This summation
is a notation mathematicians,

214
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:26,260
they've introduced where the index, I
will go over the range from one to three.

215
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,700
Every term you let, I take three
different values and they do the song.

216
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,340
An exercise I've given to you guys
to pursue at home is the following.

217
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,150
If I got three bodies, one, two, and three

218
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,620
defined the center of mass,
you can either go to this formula,

219
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,180
do all the next ones and add them up,
or do you also have the following options?

220
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,310
You can pick any two of them, say
the first two, but get the third one.

221
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,800
Take these to find their center of mass.

222
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,980
Let's call it x one and to add with that
total mass m one two which just just m

223
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:08,141
one plus m two trade these two for a new
fictitious object and put that here and

224
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:14,270
forget these two, but on that one point,
the deposit, the massive, these two,

225
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,900
now you take the center of mass of
this object with the third object,

226
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,810
by the same weighting process,
m three x three pluses,

227
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:26,540
m one two x one two
divided by the total mass.

228
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,580
You will get the same answer as here.

229
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,480
What I'm telling you is if you've got
many bodies and you want the center of

230
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:37,750
mass of all of them,
you can take a subset of them,

231
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,570
replace them by their center of mass,

232
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,860
namely all that mass sitting at the
center of Mass d plus the other half by

233
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,600
their massive ego,
that center of mass.

234
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:51,310
And finally find the center of mass
of these two centers of mass properly

235
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:53,980
weighted and that will
give you this result.

236
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,790
Okay. So, uh,

237
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,930
before I explain that equation
and find all the consequences,

238
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,560
we have to get used to finding central
of mass for a variety of things.

239
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,360
As long as they give you a 10 masses
are countable number of masses,

240
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,880
we just got to plug it in here. It's
a very trivial exercise. Thanks.

241
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:21,881
Become more interesting if I give you
not a set of discrete masses with this

242
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:23,670
great locations.

243
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,380
[inaudible] namely countable set up passes
where they give you a rod like this.

244
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,090
This is a rod of mass m and l and I
say where does his center of mass?

245
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,230
So we have to adapt the definition
that we have for this problem.

246
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,150
So what definition, what should I do?
Well this is my origin of coordinators.

247
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
You've had a set of masses but definite
locations. I know how to do it,

248
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:51,650
but this is a continual,

249
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,860
the trick then is to say I take a distance
x from the left hand and I cut myself

250
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:04,240
a very thin sliver of thickness dx.

251
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,283
Yeah.

252
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,370
That sliver has got a certain mass

253
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,900
and I argue is that a definite distance
x from the court in its origin they

254
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:20,120
finish speaking, you will say, what
do you mean by definitely distance?

255
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,460
It's got a wit the x. So one part of it
is it x? The other part is of x plus Dex.

256
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,060
So it doesn't have a definite coordinate.
What if the x is going to zero?

257
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,530
This argument will eventually be invalid.
So dx goes to zero.

258
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,390
That's delivered Hasad
definitely location,

259
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,300
which is just the x
coordinate of where I put it.

260
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,700
So to find the center of mass,

261
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,780
which is consists of multiplying
every mass base location and adding,

262
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,890
let me first find how much mass
is sitting here. Let me it Delta,

263
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,490
how much massive sitting there.
But I do the following,

264
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,770
I take the total mass and divide
by l last the mass per unit length

265
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,550
and this fellow has a wit the DX.

266
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,000
So the massive this little
slivers and Wilbert Ldx.

267
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,543
Yeah.

268
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,550
Therefore the center of mass that I want
his phone by taking this sliver of that

269
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:22,300
mass multiplying by its coordinate
and summing over all the slivers,

270
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,630
which is what we do by the
integral from zero to l.

271
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,420
Then I should divide by the total mass,
which is just an,

272
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,220
you can see now if you
do this calculation,

273
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,610
I get one over l the Nigga integral x
Dx from zero to l and that's going to be

274
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:46,170
elsewhere over too.
So if you do that you'll get allover to,

275
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,060
I'm not doing every step in the calculus
because at this point we should be able

276
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,040
to do this without every detail.

277
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,210
So the center of mass of this Rod,

278
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,090
that's nobody's price is
right in the mid point,

279
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,200
but it's assumed that the rod is uniform,
but it's like a baseball bat.

280
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,540
They could at one end and tender
at the other end. Of course,

281
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:13,400
no one is saying that, but we have assumed
the mass per unit length, namely Ammo.

282
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,890
Is this a fixed number?
I'm over l and then this is the answer,

283
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,590
but there are other ways to get this
result without doing all the work.

284
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,653
Okay?

285
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,650
So we would like to learn that other
methods because it'll save you a lot of

286
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:28,484
time.

287
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,360
It must be clear to most people that the
center of mass of these writers at the

288
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,320
center. But how do we argue that?
How do you make it official?

289
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,690
You could do the integrity,
you will get the answer,

290
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:43,160
but I want to short circuit the integral
and here's the trick is not going to

291
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:46,760
work for arbitrary bodies. If I give
you some freezy object like this,

292
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:49,520
you cannot do anything.
But this is a very symmetric object.

293
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,190
You can sort of tell
if I take the midpoint,

294
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,220
that is as much stuff to the
right as to the left in some way.

295
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:58,520
You want to make that argument
Pharma and you do the following.

296
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,740
Suppose I have a bunch of masses and
the object is really not even regular.

297
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,320
This general coordinates,

298
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,690
if I replaced every x bar minus x,
okay,

299
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,800
so I'd actually change this Arctic.
So this is really, it looks like this.

300
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:16,670
Here's the object

301
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:23,170
supposedly plays every x bar minus x
that's reflecting the body or on this axis

302
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,940
it will look like this.

303
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,520
It'd be getting to the right instead of
the left. So don't go by my diagrams.

304
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,570
You know what I'm trying to do.

305
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:35,180
I'm trying to draw the middle
remained of this object the other way.

306
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,850
Then I think it's clear to everybody.

307
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,850
If I do that x one go to minor sex
because then there's averaging am I excise

308
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:46,880
some load all the masses.
If every x goes to minus x center of mass,

309
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:51,881
we'll go to minus x but not take
this rod and transport every party.

310
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,680
Room two is negative coordinate and
you take that guy and put it here.

311
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,950
The Rod looks the same
is it all looks the same.

312
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:02,420
The central mass miss look the same.

313
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,460
That means minus sex has to be equal to
exit itself and the only answer this x

314
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:11,900
equal to zero.
So without doing any detailed calculation,

315
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,710
you argued that the answer is
x equal to zero. To do this.

316
00:21:15,711 --> 00:21:19,760
Of course you must cleverly pick your
coordinates so that the symmetry of the

317
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:20,690
body is evidence.

318
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,550
If it took the body like this and
you took a reflection on this point,

319
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,700
it goes into the body. Flipped over.
There is not much you can say about it.

320
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,710
So what do you really want to do is to
pick a point of reflection so that upon

321
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:37,040
reflection the body looks the same.
The body looks the same.

322
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,300
The answer must be the same,

323
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,120
but they will argue the answer
must be minus of itself.

324
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,440
That's for the answer to zero.

325
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,220
This is how the central of massive
symmetric bodies can be fun.

326
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,250
So we know the answer for this Rod.
Suppose they give you not a 10 rod,

327
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,230
but eh, Radha non zero with we
want to know it's center of mass.

328
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,500
We're not going to do any more work.
Now by symmetry,

329
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,100
I can argue that this has to be the
center of mass because I can take uh,

330
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:13,030
every point here and turn it into the
point that by changing y two minus y

331
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,550
therefore capital,
why it will become minus capital wine.

332
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,040
But the body looks the
same after this mapping.

333
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,630
So capital way zero and similarly capitol
x's, you don't that the center of mass.

334
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,860
Now what if I give you this object?

335
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,783
Okay.

336
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,850
Nobody wanted to try that.

337
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,853
Yeah.

338
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,590
What do you guys like to try this?
Yes.

339
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:51,300
Can you tell me where the
central mass should be? Yeah,

340
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,700
no, no. The guy in front of you. Yes.

341
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,533
Objects.

342
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,180
Okay. Is that what your answer was?
Okay, so the correct answer is the place,

343
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:22,110
this mass by all efforts, mass,
whatever it is, sitting here,

344
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,310
they play this one by all of its mass
sitting here. Then forget the math,

345
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,380
the big bodies to be placed in by points.

346
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,610
Then you just got two masters located here
and you can find the weighted average.

347
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,260
It may be somewhere there.

348
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,993
Okay,

349
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,920
now let's take one more object then
I'm pretty much done with finding these

350
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:47,960
centers of mass.
The object I'm going to pick,

351
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,650
you see a triangle that looks like this.

352
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,450
It's supposed to be symmetric even
though I've drawn it this way,

353
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,930
that is B and that is B,
and that distance is h.

354
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,520
Let the mass B m
we had,

355
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:07,120
it's the center of mass.
This optic,

356
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,740
again by symmetry.

357
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,120
You can tell that the white coordinator
at the center of mass must lie on this

358
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:18,150
line because if I think
take y two minus Y,

359
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,070
it maps onto itself so it looks the same
but it's supposed to reverse capital

360
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:26,790
capitol. Why? Therefore why is
minus Y in that photo is zero,

361
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,580
so it's evidently lying
somewhere on this line.

362
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,480
I cannot do further calculations of this
type by saying where it is on the line

363
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:40,950
because it is no longer a symmetry in
the x direction is symmetric in the wild

364
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,850
andro flipping why,
but I cannot say take x two minus x.

365
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,780
In fact, if I take extra minus
x, this one looks like this.

366
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,340
It doesn't map into itself,
but I can pick any point here.

367
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,950
If I take extra minus sex,
the object looks different.

368
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,690
It looks like that object and relating
one object to another object is not what

369
00:25:00,691 --> 00:25:01,290
I'm trying to do.

370
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,860
I want to relate it to the same
object that cannot be done for x.

371
00:25:04,861 --> 00:25:08,250
It can be done for y for x.
You got to do some honest work.

372
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,150
The honest work we will do
then is to take this thing,

373
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:18,110
take a strip here with location x and
with the DX and the height of that strip

374
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:23,070
here is why,

375
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,810
why of course babies with X.
Yeah,

376
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,100
so I'm going to argue that to find
the center of mass of this triangle,

377
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:34,190
I can divide it into vertical
strips with tech paddle,

378
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:39,210
do each other and find the central mass
by adding the weighted average of all

379
00:25:39,781 --> 00:25:43,830
these things. For that, I need to know
what's the mass of the shaded region,

380
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,510
so let's call it delta. In the mass
of the shaded region is the mass,

381
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:54,890
but you're in an area. I'd find the
area later on in terms of B and h,

382
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:59,780
but this is mass media in India, but then
I need to know the area of this trip.

383
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,100
I'm going to give the answer,
but because I don't have time to probe it,

384
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:08,360
but you should think about what the answer
for the area of the shaded region is.

385
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,100
It's got a height to why and
has got the width, the x,

386
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,400
it's not quite a rectangle
because the edgers lately tapered,

387
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,470
but when Delta is goes to zero,
it's going to look like a rectangle.

388
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,330
So the idea is to why delta x,

389
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,670
but I don't want to write everything
in terms of why I wanted to write it in

390
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,700
terms of x.
Then I do similar triangles.

391
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,150
Similar triangles tells me that
why Overby is x over at h Emily,

392
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:44,081
that triangle come back to that triangle
tells me why divided by B is x divided

393
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:46,554
by age.

394
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,980
Therefore the y here can be
replaced by the x over age.

395
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So that is the mass of the sliver here
and are centered is obviously here.

396
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,590
So that is a mass there.

397
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,750
There's somebody else that I've got to
do the weighted average of all of them to

398
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,190
remember.
I don't just integrate this over x,

399
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,610
let me just give me the mass of the body.

400
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,630
I should multiplied by a further
x and then do the integral.

401
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,140
So what I really wanted to do to find
the center of mass ex used to take that

402
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:27,720
mass. I got am over a,

403
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,690
that is a tool that's an age

404
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
that is a B Benson,

405
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:39,290
x from there and another x because you
have to multiply this by the x coordinate

406
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,320
of this thing because that's the
coordinator of the central mass of this

407
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,040
that our two x's.
That's what he got to remember.

408
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,300
So that should be
integrated from zero to age.

409
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,860
That'll give me h cubed
over three so I get to em,

410
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,580
the Eh h h cubed over three.

411
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,790
Now you know what?
There's one more thing we have to do.

412
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,850
We must replace the area of the triangle
by one half base times altitude,

413
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,840
which is Bah. Well, I also forgot to do,

414
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:22,620
I did everything by the mass because the
center of mass is this weighted average

415
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,290
divided by the total math.

416
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:28,740
So I got a divided by one
over there like claim.

417
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,420
If you do this and cancel everything,

418
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,140
you will get the answer of two thirds age.

419
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,720
Okay.
So not surprisingly,

420
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,410
the center of mass of this is
not halfway to the other end,

421
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:49,680
but two thirds of the way because it's
top heavy, the side of it, the heavier,

422
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,130
this is the level of calculus you
should be able to do in this course.

423
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,750
We are able to take some body,

424
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,980
slice it up in some fashion and find
the location of the center of mass.

425
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,700
You come by and symmetry arguments with
actual calculation for this liver by

426
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:12,330
symmetry. You know the central mass is
at the center. You don't waste your time,

427
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,860
but then when you add these guys,
there is no further cemetery you can use.

428
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:18,390
You have to do the actual work.

429
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,520
So what have I done so far?

430
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,730
What I've done is point out to you that
when you work with extended bodies are

431
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:33,030
more than one body.
We can now treat the entire body,

432
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,850
replace the body by single
point for certain purposes.

433
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,720
The single point that's called the
center of mass. When am I attend?

434
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,160
All the mass contemplated
the center of mass.

435
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,670
So you have created a brand new entity,
which is fictitious.

436
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,890
It doesn't mask with a total mass.

437
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,360
It has a location equal to
the center of mass and it,

438
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:56,470
it moves in response to the total force
and is not aware of internal forces.

439
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,350
And that's what we want to explore it.

440
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,220
I already gave you a clue as to what
the implications are, but let me,

441
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,950
let me now take a thorough
analysis of this basic equation

442
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,990
and r w.
Dot.

443
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,610
Equals F.
We just got to analyze the consequence.

444
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,840
So there are several cases
you can consider. Case one

445
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,910
is f external,
not equal disease.

446
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:40,340
So this is a two bodies subject to
mutual forest and to an outside force.

447
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,170
The simplest example, I wanted to
give it to you, but I'll repeat it.

448
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,270
We're not going to do
this in great detail.

449
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,570
We all know if I had a point
mass like this, it will do that.

450
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,690
What I'm not telling you is for take
a complex body made up 20,000 parts,

451
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,210
all connected with each other,
pushing and pulling.

452
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,030
If you flipped that crazy
tongue thing in the air,

453
00:31:00,031 --> 00:31:03,030
it'll do all kinds of directions
and juggling as it moves around.

454
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,870
But if you fall in it's center of mass,
it's center of mass of followers,

455
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,640
simply a parabola because the
external force on it is just mg.

456
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,770
So it will be m r double dot equals m
g and that's just motion with constant

457
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:20,950
acceleration in the way that action
and it just a predictable problem.

458
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:22,460
Okay.

459
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,200
And I had repeat once more for emphasis
that if this object broke into two

460
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:32,120
objects, typically what will happen is
one will fly there and one will land here.

461
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,910
But in every instance if you
found their center of mass,

462
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:38,120
you will find it proceeds as if
nothing happened. For example,

463
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:42,140
if you have an explosive device that blows
them apart, the pieces are all flying.

464
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,150
But that is coming from one part of the
piece pushing and another part of the

465
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:47,540
piece.

466
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,280
But that those forces that have no
interest with as far as the external force

467
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:54,770
score say distilled gravity. So the
central of massive continue traveling

468
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,350
beyond that, I'm not going to
do too much with this thing.

469
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,280
So let me now go to case to

470
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,723
case too.

471
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,950
If you want case to a is
f external equal to zero.

472
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,710
What does mean if f external is zero,
that means this is zero.

473
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,830
That miss m r double doctor zero.

474
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:28,040
That means m R.
Dot.

475
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,480
Is a constant because it's not changing.

476
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,480
Who is this? Mr? What does it stand for?

477
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,000
Well,
it looks like the following.

478
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:49,090
If you take a single particle
of mass m and velocity X.

479
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,680
Dot. We use the symbol of p maybe haven't
ever used it before in the course and

480
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,730
that's called the momentum.

481
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,793
Yeah,

482
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,310
we'll let them hold the body is this
peculiar combination of mass and velocity.

483
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,210
In fact,
in terms of momentum,

484
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:13,810
they may write Newton's law instead of
saying it's m Dvdt it just m a you can

485
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:20,330
also write it as d by Dt of envy because
MSA constantly and you can take it

486
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,740
inside the dead averted and
that we can write as the PBT

487
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,940
sometimes instead of
saying forces buy stamps,

488
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:33,170
acceleration people often say forces
the rate of change and momentum.

489
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,570
Today, there is a momentum of a body
is changing, is the applied force,

490
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,070
so you've have not introduced to the
notion of momentum well here at this,

491
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,290
so if you think about it that way,

492
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,700
this looks like the momentum of the center
of mass and we are told the momentum

493
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:53,240
of the central mass does not change
if there are no external forces,

494
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,180
but the momentum of the
central of massive buddy,

495
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,350
simple interpretation in terms of the
parts that make up the center of mass.

496
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,000
Let's see what it is. Let's
go back here. Remember,

497
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,040
let me just take two bodies
and you will get the idea.

498
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,700
It's m one plus m two historical m
and let's take just one dimension.

499
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,180
When there's an x
one.plus m two x two dot.

500
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,240
They might've been in one plus
m two that is what an x.is

501
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,440
the m one plus m two cancels here and
you find this is just p one plus p to

502
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:39,230
let's use the symbol capital p for
momentum or the center of mass.

503
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,180
The momentum of the center of mass is the
some of the momentum of the two parts.

504
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,990
But what you're learning is,
so let me write it one more time.

505
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:51,090
If FX journalists equal to zero,

506
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:56,930
then p one plus p two
an art change with time.

507
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,700
This is a very,
very basic and fundamental property

508
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,860
and it's in fact one another result
that survives all the revolutions of

509
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:13,830
relativity and quantum mechanics.
Well,

510
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,470
what I've said for two
bodies as true for 10 bodies,

511
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,720
you just do the summation over more terms.

512
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,390
So let me say in words what I'm saying.

513
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,610
Take a collection of bodies or to give
an instance. Everything is moving.

514
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,320
It's got his own velocity and its own
momentum. Add up all the momentum.

515
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,870
If you the one dimension, just add
the numbers, different true dimension.

516
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:34,710
Add the vectors.

517
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,540
You get a total momentum that total
momentum does not change if there is no

518
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,910
outside forces acting on.

519
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,320
So a classic example is two
people are standing on ice.

520
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:52,490
That total momentum is zero to begin with
and the ice is capable of incapable of

521
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:56,670
any force along the plane. It's going to
support you vertically against gravity,

522
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,100
but if it friction list,
it cannot do anything in the plane,

523
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,640
then the claim is that if you and I
are standing and be pushed against each

524
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:03,990
other and be fly apart,

525
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,500
my momentum has to be exactly the opposite
of your momentum because initially

526
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,130
you're split.
Mine was zero.

527
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,300
That cannot change because I don't wake
so forced to save two particles push

528
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:19,710
against each other. They can only
do so without changing the tone.

529
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,760
Okay,
so p one plus B two does not change.

530
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,440
And here's another context in which is
important support that is a mass and one

531
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:36,190
going with some velocity be one and
here's the second mass him to going with

532
00:36:36,231 --> 00:36:40,820
some velocity be too.
They collide when they collide.

533
00:36:40,821 --> 00:36:41,960
All kinds of things can happen.

534
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:44,900
I mean in one may bump his head
on that and come backwards.

535
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,350
Audit could be heavy object that pushes
everything in the forward direction.

536
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,970
At the end of the day,

537
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,800
you will have some m one
going with the new velocity.

538
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:58,820
Be One frame and m to going
with a new philosophy.

539
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:03,821
We to prime and what I'm telling you is
that m one v One plus M Two v two will

540
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,980
be equal to m one v one prime.

541
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:11,570
Let's aim two three to
prime your net collision.

542
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,770
Of course,

543
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:17,000
one block exerts a force on the other
block and the other block exerts an

544
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,380
opposite force on this block.

545
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,700
That's the reason why even though
individually that momentum could be very

546
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:26,510
different. Finally, the momentum
will add up to the same total.

547
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,380
Here's a simple example.

548
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:34,410
You can show that if this mass and
that mass at equal and say this one has

549
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:39,640
addressed, that will come
soon. Here's this. You can
show under certain conditions,

550
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,150
this one will come to rest in. This
will start moving with the speed of the,

551
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,910
the target will move with
the speed or the projectile.

552
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,720
So moment of individual
objects have changed.

553
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,630
One was moving before this nonmoving,
one was at rest. It's moving,

554
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,060
but when you add up the
total doesn't change.

555
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,060
And this is called the law
of conservation of momentum,

556
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,470
so that's so important. I'm just going
to write it down here one more time

557
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,800
and the basic result is if
external forces are zero,

558
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,230
then p one [inaudible] p two last B three
and so on before would be p one prime

559
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,170
list B, two prime, less
beat, three prime and so on.

560
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,820
We had this means before and that means
after and what's it Ben is before when

561
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:42,520
it's after pick any two times
in the life of these particles.

562
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,710
It's like law of conservation of energy,

563
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:48,910
but we said e one equals z to that
one and booster for before and after.

564
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,930
Well here we cannot use one and two for
before and after because one and two and

565
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,430
three are labeling particles.

566
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,450
So the before quantities
or written without a prime.

567
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:03,550
The African studies are written with
a prime. Everybody followed this.

568
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,921
Pretty important.

569
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:10,180
You follow the statement and follow the
conditions under which it's balance that

570
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,810
cannot be external forces. For example
in the collision of these two masses,

571
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,780
if the restriction between
the blocks in the table,

572
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,110
you can imagine they collide and
they both come to rest after awhile.

573
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:25,020
What are generally that moment of finally
they don't? What happened? Well, he had,

574
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,200
you have an explanation,

575
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,050
namely the force of friction was
an external force acting on them.

576
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,300
What I'm saying is that the only force in
the block is the one due to each other.

577
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,430
Then the total moment and will not change.

578
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:43,350
So the case that I consider to a was
external force equals zero but center of

579
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:48,850
mass was moving
because it had a momentum.

580
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,580
Then the claim is that
momentum will not change.

581
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,010
I'm coming to the last case,
which is if you want case to be,

582
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,733
yes,

583
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,610
external forces are zero,
a center of mass

584
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,770
was zero.
Other words center of mass was addressed.

585
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,203
Okay.

586
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,260
Do you find this different
cases complicated than,

587
00:40:18,261 --> 00:40:20,390
I don't mind telling you one more time.

588
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,150
The center of mass behaves
like a single object.

589
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,720
Responding to the external force
is clear to the external forces.

590
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,170
Nonzero central mass will
accelerate external forces.

591
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:33,870
Zero central mass will not
accelerate their cases. One and two,

592
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,610
two and two B are the following.
If it does not accelerate,

593
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:42,200
Isabella city will not change.
So then you have the two cases.

594
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,730
It had a velocity which had
maintained audit, had no velocity,

595
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,440
in which case it does not even move.

596
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:54,310
See if you apply f equals m a to a body
and there is no forces you cannot see

597
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:57,580
the body will be rest, go to the
body, will maintain the velocity.

598
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,920
So if it had a velocity would go at
the velocity. If it was addressed,

599
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:03,800
a little remain at rest.
Same goes for the center of mass.

600
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,850
If the center of mass was moving,
it'll preserve his momentum.

601
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,780
That really means the sum of the
moment of the individual pieces will be

602
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:12,614
preserved.

603
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:17,330
If it was addressed since the external
forces zero it will remain at rest.

604
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,690
So I want to look at the
consequence of this one.

605
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,680
I could have done them in either order.

606
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,420
I can take the case whether there's no
external force, there is no motion art.

607
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,470
I can this.
I chose to do it the opposite way,

608
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,100
but it took the most complicated
case, but external forces, not zero.

609
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,260
Then I took the case where it is zero,

610
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:39,770
but the central mass was moving to
begin with and therefore it has to keep

611
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:42,440
moving no matter what.
And the simplest cases,

612
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:47,330
central mass was at rest then is not
moving now and it will never move.

613
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,710
So let me give an example of
where the idea comes into play.

614
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:57,050
We looked at the planetary
motion of the sun and the earth

615
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,560
and I said the earth goes around the sun.

616
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:06,430
So let's look at it a little later that
year and the only force between the

617
00:42:06,831 --> 00:42:09,170
earth and the sun is a
mutual forcer gravitation.

618
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,010
Now my question to you is,

619
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:21,150
is this picture of the sun sitting here
and the earth moving around acceptable

620
00:42:21,151 --> 00:42:24,030
or not? In view of what I've said, yes.

621
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,913
Neutral.

622
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,290
Yeah,
but that's the answer to the problem.

623
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,950
But what is wrong if I just say
the son remains here in the earth,

624
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,270
goes in a circle,
which is what we accepted last night.

625
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,873
Okay,

626
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,230
that's certainly, that's one way.
Do you understand what he said?

627
00:42:43,231 --> 00:42:45,450
He said the momentum of
the sun is not changing.

628
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,920
The momentum of the earth is changing.
So the total momentum is changing,

629
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,280
but total momentum cannot change.
So that's not acceptable.

630
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,720
But in terms of center of mass,
you can say something else. Yes,

631
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,910
it's moves. Maybe you can tell me,
you cannot point out from that,

632
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:05,490
but tell me which way
you think it's moving.

633
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:07,830
Yeah,

634
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,810
right in the beginning it's somewhere
here. A little later there's dead lifts.

635
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,990
There's the central mass would do this
if the picture that I gave you last time

636
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:19,110
was actually correct.
So a son,

637
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:23,250
a finite mass staying at
and a planet orbit thing,

638
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:28,260
an owner that is simply not acceptable
because the center of mass is moving

639
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,770
without external forces
that's not allowed. Artists,

640
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:35,580
he said the momentum is constantly
changing. This guy has no momentum.

641
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,000
That gets a momentum that points this
way now and points that we later.

642
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,530
But look what I've said here.

643
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,120
Take one and two to be the earth and the
sun doesn't add up with the same number.

644
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,590
So we sort of know what
the answer should be.

645
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,510
We know that the thing that cannot move,
it's not the sun and it's not the earth,

646
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,780
it's the center of mass. That's
what cannot move. If it does,

647
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:03,510
an elite was addressed, it'll remain
addressed. So the center of mass,

648
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,200
if it cannot move, so let's start
off the sun here. Start out.

649
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:11,880
The earth here joined them.
The central mass is some bad here.

650
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,320
Actually the sun is so much
more massive than the earth.

651
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,950
The central mass lights inside the sun.

652
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,660
But I'm taking another solar system where
the sun is a lot bigger than the earth,

653
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:23,970
but not as big as an iPad world.

654
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,810
So I can show the central
mass here that cannot move.

655
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,140
So what that means is a little later,

656
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,380
the planet is here and I wanted
to keep the center there.

657
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,240
The Sun has to be here and somewhat
later when the planners, they're,

658
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:40,260
the sun has to be here.

659
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:46,830
So what will happen is the sun will go
around on a circle of smaller radius,

660
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,620
the planet, and go around on
a circle of a bigger radius.

661
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,320
Always around the center of mass,

662
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:56,640
so you've got this picture and I was
like a Dumbbell, asymmetric big guy here,

663
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,040
smaller here,
fixed that and turn it.

664
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,440
You get a trajectory for the sun and
you get it radically for the earth on a

665
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:06,660
bigger circle.
Centered remains fixed

666
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,210
so you feel played. Loss of gravity.
I've given you a homework problem.

667
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,450
You've got to be careful of the board.

668
00:45:14,451 --> 00:45:17,080
One thing when I played
the law of gravity,

669
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:22,450
you may apply to the earth for example.
Then you will say the center portal,

670
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,800
centripetal acceleration,
NV squared over r is the force of gravity.

671
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,750
When you do that calculation,

672
00:45:28,751 --> 00:45:33,751
be careful be is the velocity of the
planet and when you do the MV squared over

673
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:37,780
r, the r you put will be the distance to
the center of mass from where you are.

674
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,810
That'd be the NV squared over R,

675
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,000
but when you create that
to the force of gravity,

676
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,840
it a g m one m two over r squared for
that are it is the actual distance from

677
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:54,040
the earth to the sun that you should
keep because the force of gravity is a

678
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,720
function of the distance
between the planets,

679
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,000
not between the planet
and the center of mass.

680
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:03,100
The actual force on the earth is really
coming not from here but on the other

681
00:46:03,101 --> 00:46:04,840
side of this where the sun is.

682
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,880
But luckily at every instance the sun
is constantly pulling it towards the

683
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:13,270
center of the circle.
So very clever solution.

684
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,310
Planet moves around a circle.

685
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:20,200
It doesn't acceleration to where to center
and somebody is providing the force,

686
00:46:20,201 --> 00:46:23,890
but there's somebody who's not at the
center but always on the other side of the

687
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:26,710
line joining you to the center.
So you still experience a force.

688
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,280
They were the center under the action
of that forest. You can show it,

689
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:34,660
we'll have a circular orbit and you can
take some time calculating now relation

690
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:36,820
between time period
and radius and whatnot.

691
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,910
So this is called the two body problem.

692
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,640
So this is one example.
Where do you realize, hey,
central mass, if we follow it,

693
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,600
it cannot be moving and therefore the
actual motion of planners and more

694
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:55,560
complicated than we thought.
Okay,

695
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:58,740
then that is a whole slew of problems.
One can do

696
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,430
that.
The center of mass is not moving.

697
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:04,800
So I'll just give you a couple
of examples. Then I will stop,

698
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,490
but I won't do the numbers.
Here's one example.

699
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,360
That is a carriage that contains a horse
and the hardest is on this far end.

700
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,530
And as they tell us to do,
uh, we won't draw the hearts.

701
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,560
We just say it's the point mass m and
the railway carriage is the big mass,

702
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,930
capital m and let's say the left
hand of the railway carriage is here.

703
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,420
You cannot see the horse.
Yeah.

704
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,440
Horses inside the hearts decides to know
is that I've tired of sitting on this

705
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:44,840
side of this room.
I'm going to the other side.

706
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,380
The hardest goes to the other side.
First of all,

707
00:47:48,381 --> 00:47:51,110
you will know something's
going on without looking in.

708
00:47:51,111 --> 00:47:54,440
Because when the hardest moves to the
left, the cat, it has to move to the right

709
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,180
first. Convince yourself that
it has to move somewhere.

710
00:47:59,181 --> 00:48:03,620
Because originally the center of mass
between these two objects, that one,

711
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:08,270
and that one is something in between.
Somewhere here if the heart scan,

712
00:48:08,271 --> 00:48:11,660
but that side central mass is
now the average of those two,

713
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,440
which is some bad over there in central
mass is moved and that's not allowed.

714
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,270
Central mass cannot move.

715
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,170
So if the separate off mass
originally on that line,

716
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,730
it has to remain in that line.

717
00:48:22,731 --> 00:48:26,810
So what will happen in the end
is that the horse will come here,

718
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,690
the center of the carriage will be that,

719
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:30,620
but the central mass would
come out the same way.

720
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,200
So typical problem you guys will be
expected to solve. We look like this,

721
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,440
given all these masters and
given the length of the carriage,

722
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,380
find out how much the caddied moves.

723
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,130
So you think you can do that? Uh, give
some numbers and plug in the things.

724
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,800
For example,
this guy is that at a distance,

725
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:57,790
l over to this.
The hardest is that it listens.

726
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,300
L make this your origin or coordinate.

727
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,360
Take the weighted average of those two
and get the x coordinate at the center of

728
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,194
mass.

729
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,170
You don't have to worry
about the why because there's
nothing happening in the y.

730
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:13,780
So the x coordinate of that and that'll
be somewhere here at the end of the day.

731
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,970
Let us see it as more
than unknown distance d,

732
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:20,620
which is what you're trying to calculate.
Recompute the center of mass.

733
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,443
When you do that,

734
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,170
you remember that the center of the
carriage is Ello were two plus d from this

735
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,820
origin,
the heart system,

736
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:31,030
the distance d from the origin
equally the centers of mass,

737
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:35,710
and you will get an equation that the
only unknown will be d and You solve for

738
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:37,600
the and you'd tell you,
we'll tell you how much it moves.

739
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,470
Anybody have a question about
how you attack this problem?

740
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,900
Find the center of mass before,

741
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:51,380
find a central mass after equate them
and that linear equation we'll have one

742
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:55,350
unknown, which is the d by which the
candidates more than you can solve for.

743
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,570
Okay,
here's another problem

744
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,180
that's uh,

745
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,390
here. This is, sure. And here is a boat.

746
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,383
Yes.

747
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,250
Right? Maybe I'm sure the
board like a board. Here it is.

748
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,430
Okay.
That's the book.

749
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,560
No,
you are here.

750
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,500
So the board has a certain mass,

751
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:30,530
which we can pretend this concentrated
there you have a little mass m and the

752
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:32,570
board is at a distance,

753
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:38,080
say d from the shore and you are at a
certain distance x from the edge of the

754
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:45,770
boat and you want to get out.
Okay, you want to go to shore.

755
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,320
So what do you do?
So if you're superman or superwoman,

756
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:54,860
you just take off and you land where
you want. What supplies do you have?

757
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:56,690
Limited jumping capabilities,

758
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,490
very natural that you want to come as far
to the left as possible. And then John,

759
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:08,030
suppose it is true that d we just say
three meters is the maximum you can

760
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:11,620
possibly jump, but as you cannot
jump the plastics. So you said,

761
00:51:11,621 --> 00:51:14,510
let me go to the end then I'm safe
because I can jump the distance.

762
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:17,450
D and again we know
that's not going to be,

763
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,420
it's not going to work because when
you move, look, it's very simple.

764
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,970
If you move and nobody else moves,

765
00:51:25,971 --> 00:51:30,020
we got a problem because if you found
the center of mass with one location for

766
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:33,680
you and you change your location and
nothing has changed the central mass,

767
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:36,700
we'll change it. That's not allowed here.

768
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,150
I'm assuming that I know how to
sort of force this in real life.

769
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:40,790
The water will exert horizontal force,

770
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:45,170
but there's an ignored in this
calculation that no horizontal forces,

771
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:47,090
if you move,
everything else has to move.

772
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:52,091
So what'll happen is that when you
move the board would a move from there,

773
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,530
maybe somewhere over to the right leg.
This,

774
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,880
you are certainly at
the edge of the board,

775
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:04,080
but the board has moved a little extra
distance delta and you have to find the

776
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:07,850
delta.
You find it by the same trick.

777
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,010
Find the center of mass
of you and the board.

778
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,440
Preferably with this as the origin.

779
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,540
You can use any origin
you want for central mass.

780
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:20,510
It's not going that is not
going according to anybody,

781
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,130
but it's convenient to pick the shortest,
your origin point,

782
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:29,140
the way that some of your location in
your mass port location and boards mass at

783
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:29,721
the end of the day,

784
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:34,190
put yourself on the left end of the boat
and let's say it does more the distance

785
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,980
delta. So the deal distance
now is deep plus delta.

786
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,590
That's what you are.

787
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:44,090
That was l over two is where the center
of the borders find the new center of

788
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:48,950
mass and he quit them and you will find
how much the board would a mode and that

789
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:51,560
means you have to jump a distance deeply.
Plus Delta.

790
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,500
Everybody followed that. That's another
example of its central Madison move.

791
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:03,910
Now let's ask what happens next.
So you leap in the air. Okay,

792
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:08,830
I got add barn. What do you think
is happening when you add barn?

793
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,350
Yes. Go ahead. What's happening? The book.

794
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:15,303
Sure.

795
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,350
It'll be moving. And why do you
say it? And we'll be moving?

796
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,700
Yeah,
cause the center of a mess.

797
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,910
There's one way to say that central mass
cannot move if you move to the left,

798
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,430
the border moved to the right.
That's equivalent way to say that.

799
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,153
Yes,

800
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,090
right. Momentum cannot change. Originally
momentum. Oh zero nobody was moving.

801
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,710
If suddenly you're moving, the board
has to move the other way. Of course,

802
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:43,620
it doesn't move at the same
velocity or the same speed.

803
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,450
Most of the same momentum.

804
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:51,190
So the big game of the both types of
small B of the board will equal your small

805
00:53:51,191 --> 00:53:55,950
lamp times your Big v. Other words,
you, let's say move with the big speed.

806
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,820
The board moves with the smallest speed
than these two numbers in magnitude

807
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:02,680
would be equal. So they feel, you know,

808
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,720
going on one of the big cruise
ships you dump on the short,

809
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:08,100
you're not going to notice the
movement of the shape of the ship.

810
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,210
But it technically speaking, it
does move the other way. Okay,

811
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:15,090
you have to add a barn. Okay.
Then in a few seconds later,

812
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,970
you collapsed on the shore. You're
right there. What's happening? The boat.

813
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,150
Is it going to stop now
your momentum is zero.

814
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,363
Yes,

815
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:30,763
yes.

816
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,881
Everybody agree?

817
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:34,850
I will repeat that answer but you
should all have figured this out.

818
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,990
The board will not stop just because
you hit the shore. Okay? Bought it.

819
00:54:38,991 --> 00:54:41,810
Keep moving because there's no force
on the board is going to keep moving.

820
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,920
The question is how come I suddenly
have momentum in my system when I had no

821
00:54:45,921 --> 00:54:49,970
more met them before? It's because the
ethics journal has now come into play.

822
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,570
Previously it was just you and the
boat and you couldn't change your total

823
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:54,404
momentum,

824
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,860
but the ground is not pushing you as
obviously pushing you to the right because

825
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:01,790
you were flying to the left and you
were stopped. So your combine system,

826
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:05,570
you end up board have right word forced
acting for the time it took to stop you.

827
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:08,750
It's that momentum that
scattered by the boat.

828
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,180
Better way to say this is you and the
board exchange Momenta you pushed the

829
00:55:14,181 --> 00:55:14,691
board of the right,

830
00:55:14,691 --> 00:55:18,320
you move to the left and your momentum
is killed by the shore. The board,

831
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,680
no reason to change.
It keeps going so you can calculate.

832
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,200
Can you calculate how
fast the board is moving?

833
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,000
Yeah. Anybody telling me how to
calculate how fast the board is moving?

834
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,830
Uh, but I am. I am on the
shore now fallen on the shore.

835
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:45,480
I'm asking you how fast
the boat is moving.

836
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,863
Cool.

837
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,030
Right? I think the, I think
I just got the right answer.

838
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,660
If I only told you that I
jumped and landed on the shore,

839
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,390
that's not enough to predict
how fast the boat is moving.

840
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,050
But if I told you my
velocity when I was airborne,

841
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,880
then of course I know my momentum and you
can find the board momentum and that's

842
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:11,160
the velocity it will retain forever.

843
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,360
So you need more information than
simply saying I jumped to the shore.

844
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,080
It depends with what velocity I left
the boat and landed on the ground.

845
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:22,980
If I leave really hard, the boat
will go really fast. The opposite.

846
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:25,720
Okay,

847
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:30,460
okay, that's the end of this family
have a central mass problems,

848
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:36,220
so I'm going to do a
another class of problems.

849
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,030
This in said rocket,

850
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:44,410
I just going to did I have the rocket
equation rockets something everybody

851
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:46,570
understand but it's a little
more complicated than you think.

852
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,920
Everyone knows you blow up a balloon,
you let it go, the balloon goes one way.

853
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,070
The ad goes the other way.
Action and reaction to an equal.

854
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,650
Even lay people know that.
Odd.

855
00:56:56,651 --> 00:57:01,651
If you stand on a frozen lake and you
take a gun and you fire something but then

856
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:06,100
the bullet goes one way and you go
the opposite way again because of

857
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:07,120
conservation of momentum.

858
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,920
The rocket is a little more subtle and
I just want to mention a few aspects of

859
00:57:11,921 --> 00:57:14,470
it. I don't want to go into the
rocket problem in any detail.

860
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,560
It's good for you to know
how these things have done.

861
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:22,270
Here's the rocket whose mass at this
instant, this m was. The velocity is v.

862
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,183
Right now

863
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,900
what rockets do is the emit gases and
the gases have certain exhaust velocity.

864
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:37,060
That velocity is called the zero in
magnitude is pointing away from the rocket

865
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:42,340
and it has a fixed value relative with
the rocket not related to the ground.

866
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,670
If you're writing with the rocket and
you look at the fumes coming out to the

867
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:46,270
back,

868
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:51,100
they will be leaving you at that
speed be not a short time later.

869
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,340
What happens short time later,

870
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:01,110
the rocket has a mass m
minus Delta because it's lost
some of its own body mass

871
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:06,430
in the form of exhaust fumes,
exhaust fumes.

872
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:11,690
I'm just showing them as a blob here and
the rockets velocity and now is not B

873
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:13,090
but B plus Delta v

874
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:18,070
and what's the velocity of the fumes?
Here is where you gotta be careful.

875
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,560
Your velocity was V at that instant.

876
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,670
The last year of the rocket fuel with
the to the ground is B minus v zero.

877
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,700
That's the part you got to understand.

878
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,830
Rocket has the smaller mass and bigger
velocity. Everyone understands that. What?

879
00:58:34,831 --> 00:58:39,831
What's the momentum of the gas
leaving the rocket if the Mass Delta,

880
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:42,900
but what does its velocity?

881
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:47,670
Its velocity with the specter of the
rocket is pointing the left at Vizio,

882
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,480
but the rocket itself is going
to the right at speed. B.

883
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,490
Speed of seen from the
ground will be B minus vizio.

884
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,720
So the law of conservation of momentum,

885
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:02,930
we'd say m times V is equal to

886
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:09,550
m minus Delta Times v Plus Delta v

887
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:15,920
Let's Delta Times v Minus v zero.

888
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:20,380
This is momentum before
and momentum after equal.

889
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,530
So you open up this bracket,
you get

890
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:31,040
sideways letters better be uniform.
This is MV than Minus v dealt,

891
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:36,041
I don't want to call it Delta v I want
to call it v Delta Plus Am Delta v

892
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:39,990
Minus Delta planes,

893
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:45,010
Delta B plus Delta v Minus Delta Times
v Zero I want to call it be Zero Delta

894
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,000
please. And I want to put the belt
on the right is you may get confused.

895
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,330
Delta usually stands for the change
of something so I don't want,

896
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,230
that's not what I mean.

897
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,400
So you can sell this MV
and you cancel this Mv.

898
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:03,530
You cancel this v Delta
and that's be delta.

899
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:08,690
This one you ignore because it's the
product of two infinite decimals.

900
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:12,410
One is the amount of gas in a
small time, Delta t, others infant.

901
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:14,960
As much change in velocity,
we keep things with a linear.

902
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,720
This then you get the results m times
Delta v is equal to v Zero Times Delta.

903
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,133
Okay,

904
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:35,170
so I'm going to write it as Delta v over
B zero is equal to Delta over there.

905
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,290
This is the relation between the
change in the velocity of the rocket,

906
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,320
the velocity of the exhaust
gas as seen by the rocket.

907
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:53,280
The I'm on emitted in the small time
divided by the mass at that instance,

908
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,560
but what in in the sense of calculus,

909
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:02,320
what is the change in the mass of the
rocket? If Amazon mass of the rocket,

910
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,750
what would you call this?
A change the mass of the rocket

911
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,360
in this short time.

912
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:09,933
Okay.

913
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:14,640
Yup. Yup. No, no, no.
In terms of the symbol,

914
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:18,620
see at what's the change in the
mass of the rocket is Delta,

915
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:21,020
but he's really speaking minus Delta.

916
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,650
If you keep track of this sign they
change in the variable is really negative

917
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,350
and Delta here at Stanford
a positive number.

918
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:32,480
So if you remember that you
would write this minus d m o m.

919
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,610
Well the rest is simple mathematics.
I don't want to do this.

920
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:43,510
When if you integrate this
side and integrate that I
and you know DM over amis a

921
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:45,990
logarithm,
you will find the results

922
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,240
and you would find that is out that the
V at any time is the final going to be

923
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:56,430
initial plus.

924
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,330
Maybe I might've saw
do this integral here.

925
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:06,290
This integral will be the final might
minus v initial over v zero will be the

926
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:12,480
log of an initial over m final

927
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,140
so you will find the final,

928
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:21,660
he's v an issue plus v zero
log an initial what am fine,

929
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:24,781
I'm doing,

930
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:29,550
it's rather fast because I'm not that
interested in following this equation any

931
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:32,670
further. It's not a key question like
what I've been talking about now.

932
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:37,560
Yeah,

933
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,100
so this is a show you how we can apply
the law of conservation of momentum.

934
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:45,030
I'm not going to hold you responsible
in any great detail for the derivation,

935
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:48,630
but that is a formula that tells you the
velocity of the rocket at any instant.

936
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,880
If you knew the mass at that incident.

937
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,563
Yeah,

938
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:00,030
the rocket will pick up speed and it's
mass and keep going down and the log of

939
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:04,650
the mass before to the mass after Times
v not is the change in the velocity of

940
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:07,890
the rocket.
Okay,

941
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:12,750
so I have to give you some more
ammunition to do your homework problems.

942
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,940
I'm going to discuss the
last and final topic,

943
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,010
which is the subject of collisions.

944
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:21,660
So we are going to take the
collision of two bodies,

945
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:27,950
one body other than body m
One v one m two feet too.

946
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:32,610
They collide at the end of the day.

947
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,710
You're going to have the same two
bodies moving, get some velocities.

948
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:41,260
The one frame B, two prime. I would
go list to find the final velocities.

949
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,590
That's a goal of physics.

950
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:48,090
I tell you what's happening now I'm asking
you what's happening later. So here,

951
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:48,750
here's one.

952
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:51,780
There are two conditions you need because
you're trying to find two unknowns,

953
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:58,080
right? If you want to. Onwards I need two
innovations. One equation always true,

954
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,460
so let me write that down.
Always drew,

955
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,920
always true is the condition
that the momentum before

956
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:13,600
is the momentum after and One v one
prime plus aim two feet to prime.

957
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:22,320
You need a second equation to solve for
the two unknowns and that's where there

958
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:26,400
are two extreme cases. What are which
I can give you the second equation.

959
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,170
The one extreme case is
called totally inelastic

960
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:38,520
in a totally inelastic coalition.
The two masses stick together.

961
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:44,740
That means to be one frame and Vitu
prime but not too unknown for a single

962
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:45,760
unknown v Prime.

963
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:53,390
Then it's been easy to solve for the
momentum because they stick together and

964
01:04:53,391 --> 01:04:56,710
move as a unit so you can right here.

965
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,760
That is equal to m one m
two times that the prime,

966
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:08,190
so you get v Prime is m One v one plus
M Two v two or and m one plus m two

967
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,110
that's a simple case boot.

968
01:05:17,111 --> 01:05:20,770
Things hit stick together and
we'll wear the common speed.

969
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,830
The common speech should be so that the
total momentum like grease what you have

970
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:27,040
before.
That's called total inelastic.

971
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,850
Other category is called totally elastic.

972
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:32,623
Yeah.

973
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,750
In a totally elastic collision,
Kennedy energy is conserved

974
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,730
that you can write as a following
relation involving quadratic things.

975
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:51,790
M One v one square plus one half and two
we have two square is equal to one half

976
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,300
m one B one Prime Square.

977
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,230
There's one half m to be two prime square.

978
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:03,881
You can,

979
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:08,570
it turns out juggle this equation and
that equation and solve for v one prime

980
01:06:08,571 --> 01:06:09,404
and B to cry.

981
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,223
Okay,

982
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,810
well I'll tell you what the answer is.
I don't expect you to keep solving it.

983
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:23,470
The answer is that the one prime is equal
to m one minus m two over m one plus m

984
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:30,650
two Times v One plus two m two four.

985
01:06:30,651 --> 01:06:34,360
What am one was him to be
too, Lisa? No great secrets.

986
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:37,910
You will find them in any textbook
if you cannot follow my handwriting.

987
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,710
It running out of time.
Yes.

988
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:44,950
What you should be understanding now
is that better formula for the final

989
01:06:45,171 --> 01:06:49,360
velocity when the coalition historically
elastic or totally inelastic.

990
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:53,570
If the total inelastic, it's what I
wrote there be one prime miss something.

991
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:56,210
Totally elastic.
You have a formula like this one,

992
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:01,370
so here you just to be placed everywhere
you saw an m one you put a name to

993
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,610
2:00 AM 1:01 AM 1:00 AM to be one.

994
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,520
Don't waste too much time writings.

995
01:07:14,521 --> 01:07:17,460
I think you can go home and fill in
the blanks. It's in all the books.

996
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:21,540
What you carry in your head is there's
enough data to solve this because I will

997
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:22,680
tell you the two bodies,

998
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:25,410
I'll tell you [inaudible] I
tell you the initial velocities,

999
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,380
plugging the numbers, you
get the final, the last.

1000
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:33,630
Remember this elastic inelastic coalition.
This is in one dimension.

1001
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,050
Now I'll give you a typical problem.

1002
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:41,580
Where do you have to be very careful in
using the law of conservation of energy?

1003
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:46,140
You cannot use the law of conservation
of energy in an inelastic collisions.

1004
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:46,861
In fact,

1005
01:07:46,861 --> 01:07:51,590
they ask you to check if two bodies
take two bodies identical with opposite

1006
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:54,900
velocities, total
momentum, a zero they slam,

1007
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:59,490
they sit together as a lump.
They got no kinetic energy in the end.

1008
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,460
In the end. At the beginning
they had both had kinetic energy.

1009
01:08:02,461 --> 01:08:07,350
So kinetic energy is not conserved in a
totally in Alaska collusion in elastic

1010
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:12,000
collision. It is. So here is an example
that tells you how to do this carefully.

1011
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:15,080
Yes.
So this is called the belly dick.

1012
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:19,430
So if you have a Bistol,
you matter of fact that a pistol,

1013
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:23,000
the bullets coming out of the pistol at
certain speed and you want to tell the

1014
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:24,960
customer what the speed is.
How do you find it?

1015
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:29,480
Well nowadays we can measure these things
phenomenally well with all kinds of

1016
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:33,710
fancy techniques down to 10 to the
minus 10 seconds. In the old days,

1017
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:37,880
this is the trick people had. You go and
hang a chunk of wood from the ceiling

1018
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:44,540
and then you find the bullets with some
Speed v zero and you know its mass.

1019
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:45,374
Exactly.

1020
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:50,850
The bullet comes ramps into this chunk.

1021
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:54,440
So I cannot draw one more picture.
So you guys imagine though,

1022
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,070
will it is embedded in this.

1023
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,940
I think you also know intuitively
the minutes is embedded.

1024
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:04,350
The whole thing sets in motion.
Now you could put this on a table.

1025
01:09:04,351 --> 01:09:07,290
Forget all the road. If you can find
the speed of the entire combination,

1026
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,550
then by using conservation of momentum,
you can find out the speed of the bullet,

1027
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:15,210
but that's hard to measure.
People have a much cleverer than idea.

1028
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:19,710
You just ram into this thing. This is like
a pendulum, so the pendulum raises up.

1029
01:09:19,711 --> 01:09:23,820
Now put a certain maximum height
that you can easily measure

1030
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:28,710
and from that maximum height you can
calculate the speed of the bullet.

1031
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,850
So I'm going to conclude by telling you
what equations you're allowed to use the

1032
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:37,430
two stages to be.
Pay attention and then we're done.

1033
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:42,170
In the first coalition when
the bullet Ram into this block,

1034
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,650
you cannot use law of conservation
of energy. In other words,

1035
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,090
you might be naive and say,
look, I don't care about what,

1036
01:09:49,091 --> 01:09:51,200
what happened in between.
Finally,

1037
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,970
I got a certain energy m plus M Times v
Times eight that's my potential energy.

1038
01:09:55,971 --> 01:10:00,260
No kinetic. Initially I had
minus one half m zero square.

1039
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,400
I equate these two guys and I found zero.
That will be wrong.

1040
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,900
That's wrong because you cannot use the
law of conservation of energy in this

1041
01:10:08,901 --> 01:10:09,734
process.

1042
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:14,510
When I tell you that is a
totally inelastic collision
in the middle because what

1043
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:16,820
will happen to some energy will
go into heating up the block.

1044
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:19,370
It might even cats fired if
the boiler's going too fast,

1045
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:24,290
but you can use the law of conservation
of momentum momentum all the time in the

1046
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:29,291
first coalition to did use that m plus m
times some intermediate velocity is the

1047
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,030
incoming momentum.

1048
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:37,400
You understand that from that you can
find the Velocity v with which this

1049
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:42,350
composite thing, block and bullet, we'll
start moving. Once it start moving,

1050
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:45,440
it's like a pendulum with
initial momentum or energy,

1051
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,940
it can climb up to the top and convert
the potential to candidate candidate

1052
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:53,120
candidate. The potential. There is
no loss of energy in that process.

1053
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,410
Therefore,

1054
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:59,410
if you extract this velocity and
took one half m plus m times,

1055
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:05,060
this is the last new square. You may
in fact equate that the impalas MGH,

1056
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,860
so let me summarize this last result.
In every collision,

1057
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:18,030
no matter what momentum is conserved,
energy may or may not be,

1058
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:20,010
and if it gives you a problem like this,

1059
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,360
where in that some funny business going
on with this, not energy conserving,

1060
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,270
don't use energy conservation
from start to finish,

1061
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:31,320
you use momentum conservation.
Find the speed of the composite object.

1062
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,890
This is what you got understanding.
You'd had this not this equation.

1063
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:39,390
When can I use conservation of mechanical
energy when Kenny not bullet driving

1064
01:11:39,391 --> 01:11:42,720
into a chunk of wood? You better. No, you
cannot use conservation of Kennedy, Ghana,

1065
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,160
but once the combination is going up,
trading candidate for the potential,

1066
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:47,580
you can.
