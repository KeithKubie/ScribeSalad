GO, EAGLE ONE.

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.975
BOBBY? GREAT.
WHAT'S HIS LOCATION?

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.743
- HE'S HIDING OUT
IN BODEAN'S TRAILER.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.145
GET IN THERE QUICK AND PLANT
THAT HOMING DEVICE ON HIM.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:17.851
[guns click]

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:18.986
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.054
OH, ARE YOU MY NEW
BOBBY DOUBLE?

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.490
- UH, YEAH.
I-I'M YOUR BOBBY DOUBLE.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.158
- DAMN, I AIN'T THAT FAT
AND UGLY.

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.994
- YEAH. YEAH, YOU ARE, BOBBY.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.696
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
HE'S A DEAD RINGER.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.001
GET HIM DRESSED, BOYS.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.403
- OOH!

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.038
- WOW, YOU LOOK PERFECT.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.908
ALMOST TOO PERFECT,
WHICH RAISES A QUESTION.

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:45.245
HOW AM I GONNA KNOW
WHICH ONE OF US IS THE REAL ME?

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.548
- OH, I GOT AN IDEA.

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.483
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THIS BLINKY THING

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.817
AND PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET?

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.786
THAT WAY YOU KNOW
WHICH ONE OF US IS YOU.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.054
- DAMN, YOU'RE SMART.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:56.590
BUT WHAT IF YOU HAVE
THE BLINKY THING

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.458
AND I DON'T HAVE
THE BLINKY THING?

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:01.061
- THEN I GUESS THAT I'M YOU
AND YOU'RE ME.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:01.128
- YOU JUST BLEW MY MIND.
