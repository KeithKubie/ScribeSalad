00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.740
In today's video,
we're going to be showing you

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.900
how to build the ultimate picnic table.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.220
Not only is it weather proof,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.160
but it also has a built-in cooler,
cup holders, and condiment trays.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.100

[Music]

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.020
[Music]

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.820
Here's the supplies we're going to
need to get started on this picnic table.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.960
We've got five boards
of composite deck material.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.220
This is sort of like MDF,
if it were made out of plastic.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.920
It's textured to look like wood,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.060
is extremely durable,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.100
and is pretty much
completely weatherproof.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.720
Each of the boards
I have is 8 feet long,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.189
and they are the same
width as a 2x6 board

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.630
after it's been planed down.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.050
I've got five 2x4's
that are 8 feet long,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.780
and I have two 1x4's
that are 8 feet long.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.080
We have some regular
2 and 1/2 inch screws,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.420
some 1 and 1/2 inch screws,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.260
and some 2 and 1/2 inch deck screws,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.400
which are specifically designed
to work with this composite material.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.100
I also have a scrap piece of board
that's one quarter of an inch thick,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.180
and that will be used for
spacing out our other boards.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.680
To help with the structural
integrity of this build,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.120
we've also got some
3 and 1/2 inch bolts,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.460
and the washers and nuts
that fit onto those.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.860
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.100
The general design is
a straightforward picnic table,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.780
but we're making some improvements.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.500
The tabletop and benches will be
made from weatherproof decking boards.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.460
Added supports under
the table will hold a plastic tub

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.720
that acts as a drink cooler,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.640
and we'll add closable cup holders,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.360
and two small removable
baskets to hold condiments.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.220
Let's start by cutting
all of the major pieces

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.820
that we're going to
need for this bench.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.140
First up is our composite board,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.360
and we need nine pieces
that are 4 feet long.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.660
These boards are almost
exactly 8 feet long,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.920
but they have enough extra that
we'll probably do a little bit of trimming.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880
[Music]

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.360
There are several pieces that
we need to cut out of our 2x4's.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.659
The first is the legs,

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.560
and for that, we need four
pieces that are 29 inches long.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.180
[Music]

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.280
For the support pieces
that run parallel to the ground,

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.289
and hold up the benches,

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.520
we'll need to cut two pieces
that are 51 and 1/2 inches long.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.620
[Music]

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.659
We need two pieces
that are 28 inches long,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.620
and those will hold together
the top surface of our table.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.320
Finally, we need one piece
that will run crosswise,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.399
and that will act
as a lateral support.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.060
That needs to be 37 inches long.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.120
[Music]

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.420
With all of our pieces cut,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.620
we now need to start
getting ready to assemble.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.740
The first pieces
were going to need

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.340
are five of the composite boards,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.860
and our two 28 inch 2x4's.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.440
These two 28 inch pieces
will work as supports

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.780
for the five slats that
are the very top of the table.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.320
To avoid cutting and scraping knees
while sitting down at the table,

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.629
we want to modify
the two side supports

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.730
by cutting some 45 degree
angles into the ends of them.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.849
After adding the cuts,
our two supports will end up

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.540
almost trapezoid shaped.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.980
Although I'm not going to try
and make the cut come all the way

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.500
to the exact corner.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.660
To add a little bit
of strength to it,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.040
we're going to have
our cut end right about here,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.489
leaving maybe a third,
quarter of an inch,

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.859
about a centimeter at the bottom.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.120
So we'll have a cut,
something like that.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:02.780
[Music]

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.080
We're going to be attaching
the five composite planks

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.740
into these 2x4's using
screws going down from the top.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.060
So we now need to line them up,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.359
just in the right spot

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.719
on top of these beams,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.180
and spaced out just
the right amount.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.880
We want this support to be
4 inches in from the end of our board.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.420
Our scrap of 1/4 inch board
is going to be cut up,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.109
and we're gonna
use that as spacers,

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.300
to make sure that the slats are
evenly spread out across our table.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:38.260
[Music]

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.740
We'll start by securing
one board on this end,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.980
and then making sure
everything is pressed together,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.540
spaced out just right.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.320
Secure the other
board on the other end,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.540
and then secure two
of them in the middle.

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.880
For the moment, we'll leave
the very center board unsecured.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.849
[Music]

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.640
Alright.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.900
[Music]

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.200
With the four Corners attached,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.939
we're now going to move
to the second boards in.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.060
For the moment, we're not
going to attach our center board

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.799
because we still need
to alter it a little bit,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.180
as we build the cooler
that goes into this table.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.240
Although we don't want to
screw the center board down yet,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.480
we do want to pre-drill the screw holes.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.720
[Music]

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.500
The reason we didn't
screw down the center board

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.780
is because we're going to be
putting a cooler into this picnic table.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.639
We need to cut a slot
into this top center board

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.270
that will allow us to
access the cooler down below.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.380
What we're using for our cooler
is this plastic planters trough

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.480
that I got at Home Depot
for about 8 bucks.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.660
This planter box is
25 and 3/4 of an inch long,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.760
and approximately 5
and 3/4 of an inch wide.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.720
This size of planter box works very well

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.229
because it's with
is almost identical

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.470
to the space between two of
these boards if one is removed.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.410
We now want to cut
the length of board

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.060
out of the center of this one
that matches the length of our planter.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.860
Some quick math shows
that we should come in

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.820
11 and 1/8 of an inch from either side.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.340
[Music]

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.620
With our center board cut,
we can now replace the spacers,

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.700
and use a couple of screws
to hold the end pieces where they belong.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.260
[Music]

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.500
These end pieces are pretty
sturdy just as they are,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.880
but they are going to get a little bit
of additional reinforcements from below.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.479
We need to add some
supports on the bottom

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.970
that will hold the
center top board in place,

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.140
as well as holding our trough
right where we want it for our drinks.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.880
We'll set up two
pieces of our 1x4 board,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.260
one on each end.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.870
That's what's going
to support our center board

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.020
when it's covering the cooler.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.860
We'll take a piece
that's just the right length,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.040
and make it overlap the gap
by about 1/2 of an inch.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.600
Let's cut two
pieces of our 1x4 board

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.460
that are 12 and 7/8 of an inch long.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.740
[Music]

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.180
We're using that length
because we should be able

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.120
to fit two additional pieces
of our board right on the edges,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.050
and have it all lined up with the hole.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.870
At this point, we don't want
to use our decks screws

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.870
because if we did,

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.960
they would just stab
the top of our table.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.980
That's a terrible table.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.420
Tables shouldn't stab you.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.720
These 1 and 1/2 inch screws
should be the perfect length.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.680
[Music]

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.040
Our cooler will be able
to slide into place.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.080
So, the two sides will
have supports, as well as the back.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.220
To do that, we need three pieces
that are 24 and 1/4 inches long,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.440
and four pieces that
are 5 and 1/2 inches long.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.820
[Music]

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.620
While it may not
be totally necessary,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.580
just to give ourselves
some cleaner edges,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.680
let's trim off the excess from these 1x4's.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.940
[Music]

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.260
We're using 2 and 1/2 inch screws,
which should be long enough

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.169
to reach all the way
through these three boards,

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.980
and just barely into
the composite board below.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.620
To be sure this bottom piece is
well secured to the surface of our table,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.900
we'll use a few of the short screws on
here before we attach the other two pieces.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:11.060
[Music]

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.140
Our cooler trough can now
easily slide in and out of place,

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.040
and is held on quite
stably on three sides.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.260
The top of our table is constructed.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.539
We have a removable center panel
that allows us access down into the cooler,

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.040
which slides in and out of place
for easy draining and washing.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.540
So now, it's time to turn
this table top into a full table.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.040
The next step is to add some legs.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.340
Four of them in fact.

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:36.069
I find that's a good
number for picnic tables.

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:39.720
So, it's time to grab
the four 29 inch pieces of 2x4.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.940
These four legs will
go on at an angle

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.000
attached to the cross pieces
that run the width of our table.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.020
Right now though, they don't
sit very flush up against anything,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.740
so we want to cut all
of the ends at 30 degrees.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.540
When we cut these cross pieces,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.060
we made them both pointing
up in the same direction,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.920
giving us a sort of trapezoid shape.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.220
With the legs, we'll switch it up,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.480
and all of the angles
will go the same direction,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.140
giving us more of a parallelogram.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.460
This time, we are going
to aim for the very corner

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.620
rather than going
up about a centimeter.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.780
These legs will be installed

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:12.460
so that the outside
corner of one angle

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.700
lines up with the end of
the flat portion of the board.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.540
To attach each leg,
we'll use one screw to start,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.780
and then two carriage bolts
to really hold it in place.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.660
The screw is really just so
we have an easy way of holding

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.920
the leg right where we want it
as we drill the holes for the bolts.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.400
To keep the leg in place as
we pre-drill and screw in our screw,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.580
it can help to grab one of
the pieces that we just cut off the end.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:40.280
[Music]

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:41.880
Our picnic table now has legs,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.500
which I think most people would agree
is an important part of a picnic table.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.640
One quick note, if you build
a picnic table that's going to be outside,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.710
somewhere it's going to get wet,

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.740
or especially if it's
going to sit on grass or dirt,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.520
you'll want to make the
legs out of treated lumber,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.640
not the regular 2x4's
that you see me using here.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.080
Treated lumber has chemicals
embedded inside it,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.600
that help prevent rot,
and bugs, and fungus,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.640
which is going to be important
if the legs are going to be

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.800
sitting on wet ground.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.880
We now need to add some supports
that are going to hold the seats up.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.760
Those will run along the legs,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.200
and stick out the sides.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.790
That's the two 51 and 1/2 inch
pieces we cut from our 2x4's.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.180
We'll want to measure so that's
9 inches from the bottom of the feet,

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.420
to the bottom of this board.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.840
And of course, we need
to make sure it's level

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.920
all the way across.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.760
This is what the benches
are going to be attached to,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.120
so if they're at a weird angle,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.060
someone's going to be falling
off the back of the table,

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.800
and someone's going to
be falling in to the table.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.720
That's no good.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.340
It's not starting at zero,
which is why it's not ending it 9,

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.320
it's going from 1 to 10.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.940
Similarly to the cross pieces that
are holding up the top of the table,

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.400
we want to take off the corners,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.700
making this into a
sort of trapezoid shape.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.970
Once again,
this isn't structurally necessary,

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.940
it just makes it
less likely for you to like,

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.560
scrap a knee or leg
while getting onto the bench.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.200
[Music]

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.960
We do need to make sure that
this cross piece is evenly centered.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.940
We don't want to have
three planks on one side,

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.940
and one on the other.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.080
We're going to line
this up the best we can,

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.020
we'll clamp that in place,

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.780
pre-drill,
and add one screw,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.250
and then we'll use a level to
make sure the support is balanced

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.580
just the way we need it.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.100
Just like in the
cross pieces of the top,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.960
we'll use two bolts to connect
the leg to the support beam.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:27.280
[Music]

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.780
With those cross beams attached,

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.510
we have one remaining piece of our 2x4,

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.640
and that's the 37 inch piece,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.520
and what we're going
to do with that is span the gap

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.740
between the two supports we just installed,

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.500
and add some screws to make it so

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.920
our bench doesn't shake
back and forth very much.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.820
[Music]

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:52.440
[Music]

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.890
Okay guys, time to
learn from my mistakes.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.100
I said before that
we needed to have 9 inches

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.560
from the feet of the table up to this bar,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.060
and then I proceeded to attach
this beam on the wrong side

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.170
of the 9 inch mark.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.310
Meaning that this whole setup
was one 2x4 width too low,

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.310
too close to the ground.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.290
Leaving it like that
would cause a lot of problems,

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.960
so I had to undo
the screws, and bolts,

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.740
and lower it back down into place.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.200
With that sorted out,
let's flip our table over,

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.400
and add the benches.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:31.320
[Music]

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.100
That is an assembled picnic table.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.700
It's got a top.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.640
It's got benches,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.800
and it's honestly really sturdy.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.240
Now, this picnic table
is a mid-sized picnic table,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.600
which means if you
are over 6 feet like I am,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.700
it may be a little short,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.420
you know, my knees don't
fit underneath it super well.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.840
This isn't really meant
for full size adults,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.360
which I like to pretend
that I am sometimes.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.980
But, we do have a few more
little things that we need

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.280
to add on to it still.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.400
So, let's take it off
of the workbench,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.560
put it down at ground level,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.570
and see what we can do.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.200
Now, we know that we have
a cooler in the middle of our table,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.320
but at the moment,
it's a little tricky to get to.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.740
There we go.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.580
Let's drill a hole big enough
that we can reach through the board,

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.540
and lift this out.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:20.160
[Music]

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.920
With that hole drilled in the center,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.060
it's a lot easier to access the cooler,

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.150
and put the lid back on
right where you want it.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.570
I want another small addition,

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.810
that will work as a sort of
condiment or accessories holder.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.880
I want these little trays
to be able to stay right

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.180
at the edge of the table,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.540
so we can put you know ketchup,
mustard, or whatever we want in them.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.860
They should also be removable
so that when we're not using them,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.580
you can just take them off,

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.480
and drop them down into
the cooler for storage.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.400
Our goal with the trays
is going to be to drive two screws

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.790
into the sides of the board,

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.500
so that just the head is sticking out.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.560
We then want to be
able to put the trays on,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.680
and drop them down,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.660
which means we need
to make a small hole,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.560
and a small slot that will
fit over the neck of a screw.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.860
These plastic containers are actually
sold as desk organizing containers.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.640
I grabbed them at Walmart
for about 4 bucks each.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.020
This screw bit is just barely
larger than the head of this screw,

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.080
so, if we put a hole
into the [inaudible] with this,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.640
it should fit over nicely.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.280
[Music]

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.120
Excellent.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.820
To make the slot that will drop
down onto the neck of the screw,

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.700
let's hit this screw with a blowtorch,

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.820
and then just melt our
slot right into the plastic.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.660
That way we'll know
it will fit just right.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.320
[Music]

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.980
Now, we can mark on the table
where we want the screw to be attached.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:49.260
[Music]

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.360
Our  condiment containers are working well.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.140
They're easy to
put on and take off,

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.380
and they store nicely
inside our cooler.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.240
But there's still one more little
element that I want to add onto that,

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.800
and that is cup holders.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.430
I have these 2 and 1/2 inch grommets

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.820
that are designed for
cable management through a desk.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.380
But I also think they could
make some pretty slick cup holders

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.630
if we just drill into the table,

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.860
and apply these things.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:22.600
[Music]

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.170
If you aren't interested in
using the composite decking material

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.880
that I built these surfaces out of,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.260
you can do the whole thing out of wood.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.540
A 2x6 board will be the same width,

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.360
and just a little bit
thicker than these boards.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.060
This same design
should scale up nicely

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.410
if you prefer the 6 foot long
full-size picnic table,

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.560
rather than the mid-size
table that this one is.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.560
[Music]

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.720
This is a good sturdy
picnic table design,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.320
and because the benches
and the tabletop

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.580
are completely weatherproof,

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.580
it should last for quite a while.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.220
Guys, there's still more for you to see.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.160
That little box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.000
The box at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.220
you should be watching next,

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.100
and this bomb here
will subscribe you to our channel,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.640
so you never miss a video.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.680
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.880
and we will see you in the next one.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.560
Talk to you then.
