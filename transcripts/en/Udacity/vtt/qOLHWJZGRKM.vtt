00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You can see it looks pretty similar to the way we solved the zebra puzzle.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We did the same technique of assigning something to each of these numbers--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
bottom to 1, top to 5. These we left unassigned.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Then we have this for loop.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I chose not to use a generator expression here,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because I thought this looked pretty readable in a simple for loop.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We have this extended if statement, where each of these clauses corresponds

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to one of the original constraints of the problem.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For example, we know that Hopper doesn't live on the top floor.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Key is not on the bottom. Liskov isn't on the top or the bottom.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Perlis lives on a higher floor than Kay.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Richie and Liskov do not live on adjacent floors,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so the absolute value of their difference must be greater than one.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Likewise with Liskov and Kay.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
When we return this and run the function,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we get our solution--3, 2, 4, 5, 1.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This means that Hopper lives on the 3rd floor, Kay on the 2nd,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Liskov on the 4th, Perlis 5th, Richie 1st.
