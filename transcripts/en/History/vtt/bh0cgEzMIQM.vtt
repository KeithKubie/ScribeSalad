00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.460
You ever shot any guns before?

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.170
- Huh-uh.
- Why not?

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.920
To get that wood I
need, we've got to go

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.420
to the gator nesting spot.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.170
I call it Alligator Alley.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.210
It's a dangerous
place, [inaudible]..

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.500
NARRATOR: Now, the Swamp
Man knows a thing or two

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.710
about gators, and
he's tangled with them

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.380
on more than a few occasions.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.580
- Watch him, Shel!
- Ah!

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.120
Gators know when their
damn food's ready.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.540
They can smell it.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.580
I just want them to know that
the food is the fish, not me.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.540
Ow!

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.880
Put one in it.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.620
NARRATOR: So he's going to
teach his young protege, Angela,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.710
how to provide some
added protection

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.380
for when they go down river.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.710
Don't never point
a gun at nobody,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.290
and don't never walk
around with his safety off.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.580
[gunshot]

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.750
I barely know
anything about guns,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.580
and Shelby was basically
born with one in his hand.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.080
[gunshot]

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.670
Boy, that's a good one, Pawpaw.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.380
You ready to shoot
some targets, man?

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.790
Yeah!

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.960
Shelby's like a gun master,
so it's kind of intimidating.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.830
I just hope I can measure
up to his standards.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.210
We're going to try
this one right here.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.460
Looky here.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.920
.44 magnum.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.250
This is my daddy's gun.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.120
Get up on that log, so
you have the height.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.960
Let's see how she does.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.460
Is she Annie Oakley,
or is she just Annie?

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.540
I have to cock it first.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.750
Good thing we
wasn't in the war.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.620
We'd have been dead
a long time ago.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.580
[gunshot]

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.670
Got it?

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.210
Dang, that's got a kick on it.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.620
Shoot it!

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.540
[gunshot]

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.790
Got to shoot it
from the hip, baby.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.120
There ain't no
sights on that gun.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.540
[gunshot]

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.380
[bleep]

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.750
Oh my god.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.420
NARRATOR: Angela
with a pistol has

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.330
proven to be about as useful
as a steering wheel on a mule.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.830
Too close.
[inaudible]

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.120
Did you get it?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.330
No, I hit-- do you see
that big hole in front of me?

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.250
That's what I hit.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.500
This is humiliating, and
kind of embarrassing.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.460
[gunshot]

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460
You're definitely missing it.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.330
I'm not very good at it.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.290
That girl couldn't hit
the side of a damn barn door

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.380
with a cannon.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.040
Let me show you this
other gun right here.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.830
This is the gun my
grandpa's daddy gave me

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.000
when I was a little bitty
child, children child,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.330
when I couldn't even walk.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.830
I was just crawling, and still
sucking on a cow's titty.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.620
NARRATOR: But nobody thought
following in the Swamp

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.500
Man's footsteps would be easy.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.670
It's a 12 gauge.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.920
[gunshot]

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.040
NARRATOR: So Shelby is
bringing out a rifle that might

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.250
be a tad easier to steady.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.120
Here, shoot it one time.
Ready?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.000
Yeah.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.330
Put the safety in.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.880
And hold it tight
to your shoulder.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.710
Put it on your shoulder now.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.670
Go ahead.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.460
[gunshot]
- [bleep]

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.750
[laughing]

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.830
[gunshot]

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.790
Woo!

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.210
You are getting better.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.880
[inaudible]

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.710
Now this one here, this
is a Rossi .44 magnum.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.000
Always on safety.
- OK.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.040
There you go.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.790
See if [inaudible]
tell you-- teach you.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.620
[gunshot]

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.670
[bleep] She's
doing good, Junior.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.540
[inaudible] And
let them have it.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.040
[gunshot]

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.540
Woo!

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.540
[gunshot]

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.830
NARRATOR: Now this
young logger may

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.880
not be the next Dirty Harry--

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.120
[gunshots]

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.750
--but thanks to the
Swamp Man, she's

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.540
got one more skill
under her belt,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.670
and she's ready for
Alligator Alley.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.580
We've got to get in the
water and swim with the gators.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.170
Here we go.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.120
Give me the bullets.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.120
That's how it's done.
