Speaker 1:          00:01          Religion can't be divorced from social, political, and historical context and issues. And so what we're gonna do today is do one the first of two lectures. Now these are going to be sort of dreary, boring, typical Martin lectures, dreary and boring historical survey. Uh, and I just have to do it this today on the Greco Roman world. Tell you everything you need to know what the Greco Roman world at least for this semester. And then next time next Wednesday, cause remember we're not meeting on Monday. The next Wednesday I'll do a similar kind of lecture for everything you need to know about ancient Judaism to put the New Testament into its historical context. So you'll just have to survive these two very historical survey lectures because it's material that you need to know. I'll try to make it as interesting as I humanly can do. We now find the New Testament in the same book as the Old Testament as Christians call it.

Speaker 1:          00:59          And as Jews call it, the Hebrew Bible or the Tanakh. Clearly early Christianity has got to be studied in the context of ancient Judaism. And so we'll do so next time we'll look at the Jewish context, for example, for the development of the New Testament and early Christianity, but to understand Judaism of the time of Jesus and Paul, which is centuries after the chronological end of the Hebrew Bible, we need to understand Judaism as a Greco Roman cult. It is a Greco Roman religion, and that means the need to understand at least a little bit about the Greco Roman world. For us, we can start not so all the way back at classical Greece, but with Alexander the Great in the beginning of Hellenization. That is the Greg Ization of the eastern part of the ancient Mediterranean. That's all Hellenization means, making it Greek. Alexander the Great's father was Phillip the second king of Macedonian king a methadone, and he conquered different Greek city states by defeating Athens and its allies at Kira Neha in 338 BC and I've got some of these names and some of these dates on the handout that you have before you.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Alexander himself was born in three 56 he was educated a BCE. Of course he was educated by Aristotle beginning in three 43 he was made king after the assassination of his father in three 36 BCE. As your textbook points out is urban points that, and you probably already know, but for some of you who may, this may sound like odd lingo. I'm using CE for the common era, which is exactly the same thing as a d. And I'm using BCE for before the common era, which is back the same dates as before Christ. We in religious studies tend to like these terms rather than BC before Christ and ady because Ada actually stands for on no Domini in the year of our Lord. And we in religious studies include people in our departments who are in Judaic Studies, Islam, Hinduism, all kinds of religions. You can imagine that people who are in other religions might not want to call things in the year of our Lord, since Jesus is not their Lord. So in simply that, uh, the interest of reflecting the plurality of our own departments, we tend to use these terms rather than BC and 80. But it means the same thing.

Speaker 2:          03:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:25          Alexander defeated the Er, the Persian army, which at that time controlled all of Asia minor modern Turkey and had even threatened to control Greece. He defeated the Persian Army in Asia minor at Granicus, the battle of Granicus in three 34 that put Alexander and his Macedonian army in charge of both Greece and Asia Minor. When Darious the second died, who was the king of the Persians, uh, Alexander himself took on Darious his title, which was great king after defeating the Persians again, he pushed his army all the way to the Indus River, uh, in India to the western part of what's now India and what was then called India. Also by Greeks. He wanted to go all the way to the Ganges River, but his army forced him to turn back. He died in three 23 when he was not yet 33 years old and he died in Babylon of a fever. That is of course, modern day Iraq. After his death, his empire was divided up among his generals. And after some fighting and maneuvering and negotiations for successors to Alexander the great finally ended up splitting up his large empire into four smaller empires. And we call these four successors simply the auto key. I think that's actually not on your handout. So I'll write it up for you. This is a great word. That simply means

Speaker 2:          05:00          this successors.

Speaker 1:          05:04          So the doubt of Koi and the Greek plural diotic key as we often refer to it, uh, ended up splitting his army into four parts and four dynasties descending from the four successors. There were four generals of Alexander. Now next time I in I lecture on introducing you to Judaism. I'll talk about the importance of at least two of these empires because they're very important for the history of Palestine in Israel at this time. But for now, all you need to know is that these four different kingdoms, one was where we were, where we now have Greece. Another one was where Syria is, another was Egypt. And then there was another, uh, further north. But that's not as important for us. The, the Syrian Greek empire and the Egyptian Greek Empire will become very important for the history of Judaism and Jesus himself also. But for right now, all you need to know is that all of these generals, although there were Macedonians and had a spoke Macedonian and not themselves, but they had just like Alexander, they hit adopted Greek language, Greek culture.

Speaker 1:          06:02          They educated their children in Greek ways. Alexander, of course, I've been educated by Aristotle when he was a young and so he had adopted Greek language and Greek literature and a lot of other Greek ways. All of the, what Alexander he wanted to do was to take all these different peoples who spoke different languages and had different customs and use a Greek layer to sort of unite his empire overall. Now, he didn't really care about the lower class people as much, so they could just still live in their villages and out in the country and do their farming and speak their own local language. But if you were going to be elite, he wanted this, he wanted to establish cities throughout his empire that would be actually Greek cities. And you want it to have the elite people all be able at least to speak Greek.

Speaker 1:          06:47          You have therefore one world and in fact this whole dream of Alexander and it was a very self conscious propaganda campaign and a cultural campaign on Alexander's part. He wanted to make one world. You really have therefore a for in some way, the first time in history, a dream of making all of his empire basically universal, a dream of a universal vision for one world, one world under one kind of culture, one kind of language. This really hadn't been a tip. Did you see in the previous empires like the Assyrian Empire or these kinds of the Egyptian empire, when they, when people conquered other people's, often all they wanted was tribute. They just wanted taxes and and food and money and that sort of thing. They didn't really care about turning those people into Egyptians are into a Syrians but, and Alexander didn't really care that much about the lower class are doing that, but he still wanted the elites and so he would plant Greek cities and settle his veterans in different parts of his empire.

Speaker 1:          07:44          In Egypt, in Syria all the way over and sometimes in the western part of India. And he would take his veterans of his army and he would drum them out of the army when they retired and he would give them land and that build a city there. And that city would be just like a Greek city back home and they all would speak what developed to be a common form of Greek, slightly different from classical Greek. And we call that coin a Greek and Koine a is just a Greek word that means common or shared. So the Bible is actually written in Koine Greek because this was the form of Greek that had become spread around the eastern Mediterranean. By the time the Hebrew scriptures were translated themselves and by the time the new testament writings where themselves written the Greek Polis, which is simply the Greek word for city, had several institutions that are very important and will become important for early Christianity and for Judaism.

Speaker 1:          08:38          So you need to know what some of those are. The Polis itself is just a Greek word for city, but you can't think of this as in huge cities like we have now. What they would call a polis might only be 1000 citizens are 5,000 so it wasn't like millions of people. It wasn't nearly as big as Rome, which would be consist of a million inhabitants fairly quickly around this time. The Polis, that's plural for Greek city, the Polis, the the is, they were much smaller than that, but they would have several things [inaudible] the city of the center, the town would be the center of this, and that's where the institutions would be. That's where the government would be. That's where the different buildings would be that I'm gonna explain later. But it also, the Polis also included the surrounding farm land and the villages.

Speaker 1:          09:19          So Athens was the Polis for Attica, but Attica. But it was also the Polos for all of Attica, all that region around Athens, including villages and farms and other small towns too. So there was a rural dependency on these Greek cities. They all practice a certain kind of Greek education. The Greek word [inaudible], which is right there on your handout means education. But it also means more than simply rote learning or memorization or running to read. Like we think Pi Day as the Greek word, that means the formation of the young man. And I say young men because PR throughout all this, it was mainly young men and boys who are educated girls could be given some education if their families were wealthy enough, but the, the city's didn't really concern themselves so much with girls education. Their family might, but the city's concerned themselves with the education of their boys.

Speaker 1:          10:08          So paideia referred to the education of the young man, both mentally and, but militarily. So you were taught to fight and culturally you might be taught other things about culture. You might even have some music training or something like that. The place where this took place was the goon nauseum. Now the gym a good nauseum doesn't mean what it means to us in English. The gymnasium like Payne Whitney over there, uh, it actually comes from the Greek word for naked goodness. And the reason it was called the naked place is because of course young Greek men always exercised in the nude and played sports in the nude. And so this is where you did it. So what, where where you do this that that can be called the naked place, the goon nauseum. But this also became the place where you do other kinds of learning.

Speaker 1:          10:54          So if you were pro, if you were learning rhetoric, for example, you might practice giving speeches at the goop nauseum, but also men in town would just kind of gathered that it was kind of the place where men gathered and they'd gone to school the same place you would meet your friends. You might play some games you might play like checkers and these kinds of bones, bone knuckle bones games that you can still see if you travel around in Greek cities throughout the the ancient Mediterranean, you can see where they've carved a little game boards into flagstones of different temples or buildings in Greek cities. So this would all take place in the goon nauseum. You also had what they call the [inaudible]. When you were a young boy, you would've studied just reading and writing homer. When you got to be about the age of what you guys are here, you might enter the f debate, you have to become an [inaudible] and that just meant that you were pasture sort of early secondary training and now you were being really in trying to be a warrior and a citizen.

Speaker 1:          11:50          So the a where those boys who are between age of maybe 16 or 17 and 20 or 22 you would be, you had marched together in a parade in town, you would go on military training perhaps together you would also engage in sports together and you would develop a camaraderie because you are expected then to be the fighting force for your city, your city state. So the f abate or the FMLA was this institution that every boy had to go through in order then to be a full citizen of the city. You are, y'all had had these political structures that are in your handout. The first political structure is the demas. Demas just means the people. It's just the Greek word for the people. But it actually referred more, uh, in politically to all of the male citizens and in Greek cities. By tradition, only men were citizens of the city.

Speaker 1:          12:41          This will change in Rome because it Rome women were citizens also, although that didn't mean they were equal to men. But in Greek cities, men were citizens and women weren't citizens. But with the revolution of democracy in Athens, which also spread them to other Greek cities, partly because Athens did what George Bush tried to do in Iraq, he tried to force, they tried to force democracy on other Greek cities around the eastern Mediterranean also. So democracies in Assam sort existed in different places and ended up democracy. The demas meant all the men of a adult citizenship that is excluded people, men who lived there from who came from elsewhere. It excluded foreigners. It excluded some laborers and excluded slaves and excluded women that all the men who are citizens, uh, had a vote. And the Deimos referred to that political body of voting men. Now that democracy's collapsed obviously later.

Speaker 1:          13:34          And Philip Have Mattson on an Alexander did not promote democracies, but they kept this idea that the demos that is the adult citizen males of a city, we're a political body. And that's when, if you had everybody come to the theater for a, a big debate about something, you could still have people voting on certain things that the city might decide to do. Although they couldn't rule themselves completely by themselves. Then you had a smaller council that might be 50 people. It varied the size according to the city. The council is called the Boulay, which is also in your handout. And that referred to a cow, a smaller council of older men usually who made decisions that they then would put before the whole, uh, the demos, the whole bowling population. And then you had the term called the Ekklesia, which is on your handout that really did refer to the voting body of the citizens or the gathering of the gathered, uh, citizens together.

Speaker 1:          14:26          The EKKLESIA is a Greek word, just means the calling out Ekklesia therefore is what you would call it, the assembly, the Greek, the at the Athenian Assembly who would debate things in vote on things that the Boulay the council would put forward for a debate or a vote that was called the Ekklesia. This is very important because Zima Ekklesia then in our Bible gets translated as ecclesiastics does, but it's, it's called Ecclesiastes these because that means the preacher. That's the translation from the Hebrew word, the preacher Kohala for that book. Uh, so Ecclesiastes is means the preacher, but Achilles Ekklesia is the term for the church. So this'll be odd and we'd get to early Christian groups. Why did these early Christian groups decided to call themselves the town assembly? Cause that's the, about that time. That's the basic meaning of this term Ekklesia. And then you have other social structures of any city.

Speaker 1:          15:19          State. For example, you have a theater. The theater was a place where you had performances by, by the first century when Christianity was coming around, it was not so much the place where you go to see necessarily high literal hi theater. Like, like, um, you know, Solomon or uh, uh, I can't you rip a ds or something like that. What you would often do is go see he farces or comedies or sometimes that the Romans like to take a big theater and fill the, the central part of the theater, the coffee with water and in stage naval battles, you know, and that kind of thing. So people have all kinds of entertainments in the theater, but it was also where often the demo, so the Ekklesia would meet to have, uh, meetings and Holler at each other and have big debates. So the Ekklesia was, was this city place and it would often meet in the theater.

Speaker 1:          16:05          You also had games. So, uh, you had gum, the gum nauseum where games would take place. But also you had the hippodrome, which is in Greek, which basically just means the horse running place. This is when you have this big track. If you have wandered around different Greek cities, uh, that are dug up, some of them will have the hippodrome there and you can see how huge they were. They had a huge stance and it was sort of like a football stadium except it was longer and narrower than what our football stadium would be. But it has rows of seats like that usually made that over a hill or dug into the ground in some way. And the hippodrome, which becomes the circus in Latin, that's just the Latin translation of hippodrome. Cause there is, you'll see Romans started adopting a lot of these were originally Greek institutions into their society also.

Speaker 1:          16:50          So the hippodrome is the circus in Latin and eventually for the Romans this would be very popular for big chariot races. That's the big thing for the Romans later. And you'll also have bads that is public places sometimes where only men could go or sometimes women could go or sometimes they would be mixed in some places or sometimes amount have men one day, women at the time and mixed rounds. Other Times. So different cities had their bags differently. But the bath would be a place where at least especially the men would go after they'd been working out in the gymnasium and you go and you know, this is where the public toilets were to. If you can't wander around any Greek city or Roman city of the ancient world without seeing the latrine, you can always find the latrine. And they always had latrines and Baz and you'd have the, the cold room where you have cold water, you'd have the tepid room.

Speaker 1:          17:36          We have kind of lukewarm water and you'd have the hot room. We didn't have hot water. So this is where you go to relax, to make a business deal, to meet your friends, to chat, to try to have sex, try to meet somebody. You know, all kinds of things go on in these bads. But those basic structures are part of any kind of Greek city in the ancient world. And what Alexander and his successors did was they took that basic Greek structure and they transplanted it all over the eastern Mediterranean, whether they were in Egypt or Syria or Asia minor, Ernie place cells, which is why you can travel right now to Turkey or Syria or Israel or Jordan are Egypt and you can see excavations of towns. And it's remarkable how they all look so much alike because they're all inspired by this originally Greek model of the city, the next really.

Speaker 1:          18:26          So that's one of the most important things about Alexander and his successors is they hellenized the entire eastern Mediterranean. And that meant every major city would have a certain commonality to it. It would, it would have a certain coin a to it that is a Greek overlay over what may be also be there. The original indigenous kind of cultures and languages. The other thing you have is religious syncretism. And I didn't put that down. So just in case the Greek word soon crisis means the mixing to a mixing together. When Alexander gets to Persia, unless side, when he gets to Egypt, he knows that there is this God isis, this female got isis. That's very important. You see statues of her all over the place. Well, Alexander just followed a customer that had been taught by philosophy and other kinds of things that, oh well they worship Isis, but you know, isis is sort of like a Artemis.

Speaker 1:          19:30          So sometimes you'd see they'd make statues of isis look like statues of Artemis back home. Artemis is the Greek goddess of you might know the hunt. See all you guys really know your Greek and Roman mythology that shows that you did well on your sats. I bet. Then so we'll talk a bit about what that means, but the, with the different Gods and goddesses and how you learned all this in mythology, mythological courses in English in high school, but we'll get back to that. But the artist is the goddess of the hunt. So these grease would say, well, we have another goddess of the hunt, and you'd find other goddesses of the hunt or when they'd get to Jerusalem, they see, oh, these people worship Yahweh. Well, that's just Zeus. That's just another, this is another name presumes it's the same God. They just have a different name for it.

Speaker 1:          20:15          Alexander took this tendency of syncretism of mixing together different religious traditions from different places and he used it as a self conscious propaganda technique. He, I haven't identified himself because he started claiming divine status for himself. He went around passing out rumors that his mother had actually been impregnated by the god Apollo when he appeared as a snake in her bed. So Alexander is putting himself forward as divine. Why? This is not a Greek tradition, but it's very much a tradition in the east for for kings to be considered by their people to be God's Alexander says, well, if they can be God's, that can be a god. So we start spreading rumors that he is divine himself. He probably hadn't believed it. I don't think he necessarily lied about it and probably believed that he was divine and was, and so he had a, a godfather had a human mother and so then he would identify himself with whoever was a god in the different places.

Speaker 1:          21:05          So he would identify himself as a Greek God with the Persian God. He would identify the goddess Isis with some Greek Greek goddess. And so all the time these, these different gods from different places where basically all said to be simply different cultural representations, different names for what we're generally the same gods all over the place. Also though, what they would do is sometimes they wouldn't try. It has simply say these gods are the same. What they would just as add on more gods than just say, oh well we've got to Egypt. We found out there are a whole lot more gods than we knew about, or we get to Syria and look at all these gods that the Syrians worship. Well, we'll just add those into our pantheon of gods too. And this is part of what ancient religion was like is that people were not exclusive. This, you didn't have to worry bitch cause you worship one God doesn't mean you couldn't worship another God or several guides or five guys are a hundred gods. Gods knew that everybody was, they weren't particularly jealous in that sense. So this is the way people did. But what Alexander and his successors did was they made a sort of a conscious propagandistic decision to use religious syncretism to bind together their kingdoms.

Speaker 1:          22:13          Now this will become a problem obviously when we talk about Judaism because Jews that the, the Greek rulers, we're trying to do the same thing with Jewish gods and Jewish figures as they had elsewhere. And some Jews would go along with this and some Jews would resist it. The Romans, when they came on the scene in the east and they gradually became more and more powerful, they destroyed Corinth and a big battle in one 44 BCE, Pompei was the drum in general who took over Jerusalem and 63 BCE. So the Romans were in charge of Judea from 63 BCE on. And this is very important because the Romans, as their power grew in the east, they simply moved increasingly into the eastern Mediterranean and they adopted the whole Greek system, the Greek world. And they didn't even try to make it non Greek. So Romans didn't go around trying to get people in the east to speak Latin.

Speaker 1:          23:06          Uh, they, they might put up as an official inscription in an eastern city in Latin, but that almost always, if it was official inscription, it would also be listed in Greek. So Romans who ruled in the east, we're expected to speak Greek. And by this time all educated Roman men were expected to be able to speak Greek. Well if possible. So the Romans didn't try to make the east Roman in that sense, culturally, nor they tried to change the language. Greek language, culture and religions Grieco different religions and is syncretism, Greek education, the polar structure. All of these things remained in the east throughout the Roman rule of east, all the way up until the time you had had a Christian, uh, emperor with Constantine and later. But there's one thing that the Romans made even more of a that then the Greeks had made of, and this is the patron client structure.

Speaker 1:          24:01          This is a bit more of a distinctly Roman institution, even a legal institution, but it's important for understanding both the Roman Empire as well as early Christianity and its patron client relations. The household structure of a Roman household was this, and I say household because our word family, which we usually take to mean the biological family, the father, the mother, the children, maybe the grandchildren made the extended family, but we usually mean by it. The immediate, the the nuclear family with some extension that use of the English word family, although it comes from the Latin familiar means something totally different. In Latin, the Latin word familiar didn't mean that biological kin group it actually was originally used for are the slow, the slaves of a household, the slaves and the freed persons of a Roman household where are legally the ones who are the familiar but so when I say family we, we tie it. We try to avoid even talking about the Roman family because it means something so different to them than what it means to us. What, so I'll tend to talk about the Roman household because that's what's more meaningful. Uh, sociologically, when we talk about this, the Roman household was constructed like a pyramid. Imagine this is a pyramid, not a triangle. At the top of it is the head of the household, the man,

Speaker 1:          25:25          the potter, Familias and increasingly likely see this Whitten and the New York Times. Or you can use Bible in politics, but it comes from the Latin who, and it referred to the head of the household. Patera father familias is the household, the family, the potter. Familiars is the oldest man of the household. Under him is his sons.

Speaker 2:          25:49          Yes,

Speaker 1:          25:49          his daughters. And then at the bottom are his slaves. And here are his freedmen freed persons.

Speaker 2:          26:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:06          And then also you consider us in some ways free people who are may exist as clients, but legally the word client in Latin refers to the freed slaves of a potter. Familias.

Speaker 2:          26:23          Now,

Speaker 1:          26:24          where's the wife in this picture? Notice I didn't put the wife and the mother in there. Why is that? Because legally she's actually not part of this man's household. She remains part of the household of her father and she's legally under the control of her father probably or her brothers and her father is dead or her grandfather, if her grandfather is still alive. But since life expectancy, the ancient world was much less than hours. You didn't have usually several generations in these households because older people just died. The wife though is legally a part of her own household over here. Why did the Romans do that? That's very different from the Greeks. Very different from other people. The ancient Mediterranean. Why did they want to make sure that the the daughters stayed in the households of their fathers. They did this because they didn't want the upper class in Rome who are the elite.

Speaker 1:          27:20          They didn't want any one household or any small group of households to become too powerful and if you have women marrying off into other families and then they leave that there, the household of their fathers and they are officially illegally of households. My else that's, that may end up increasing those households that have intermarriage coming in and not so much into marriage going out by keeping women under the household of there, the men of their original family that the upperclass rooms tried to balance these different households in size and importance. They didn't care about the lower class. Really. The lower class didn't really count much what they cared about because Roman, the Roman republic by this time was basically a bunch of very important households, wealthy men and their households, and they were the members of the Senate. They were the night class. They weren't people who ran Rome, so they, they didn't want one king to arise and they didn't want a small coterie of leaders to arise.

Speaker 1:          28:14          They wanted there to be some kind of balance of power among the several major households of Rome, the families of Rome. Now slaves obviously are in the potter familias when a slave is freed and in the ancient world in Roman par, most slaves were eventually freed unless they just die. Before long, they became a freed man. They didn't become a free man. It became a freed man and that was legally different. So there's the status of slave was Lois freed persons, was Nixon highest in Roman law and free people were next. But even though they became freed, they were still considered a member of this guy's household as his client and his Friedman. And they owe certain duties to him. For example, they might, uh, a familiar, would often put a slave up in business, give us a slave as enough money to have to run a business and that the slave could keep a lot of the income from that business for himself. And the slave could actually gather together a bit of money for himself. He couldn't legally own the money. His master legally owned everything that slave owned, but practically, and in some legal contexts, what they would do is they allow the slave, the use of that money and that's called the peculiar them.

Speaker 1:          29:25          Now when the slave is freed by the owner, the slave could take the peculiar them with him and then he can set up his own business. But he'd still be a client of the owner because he's still officially part of his household. So this maintained even when, and why would a person free of slave? Well, if you have a sleigh that slave can't actually sign contracts, the sleigh might be your business manager, but all of a slave could do with the paperwork. But if you need a sleigh representing your business and you live in Rome and you need somebody in Ostia, the port city of Rome, to be able to be there and watch your inch, your inputs, and your exports of your business, you need someone who can sign contracts, who can lend money, who can borrow money, who can do things like that.

Speaker 1:          30:03          Slaves can't do that legally, but Friedman can. So rich Romans were often freeing slaves and for their own purposes, it was not like they were giving them a great deal. This was part of, they're constructing their own business expansion, sons and daughters, though we're still part of the household. As long as the potter Familias was alive, so son's legally was done in their pop formula. Now this is all legally and officially was the case. You wouldn't really see this working all like this. For example, I said wives were not really part of their husbands household. Uh, legally. That's correct. But you see cases in letters and and all kinds of stuff from the ancient world that women actually did were more unofficially part of their husbands house. They ran it when he was away. For example, they told his slave she might have her own slaves and her own property.

Speaker 1:          30:50          The wife had her own property that was separate from the husband's property, but in practical purposes, most of the time they didn't. They just mix these together and they might use different things. So the, the legal situation was set up to try to keep the wives ownership and as part of her a different family. And so her money didn't go to her husband and his money didn't go to her. But this was a legal situation to try to keep this balance of power among households. Practically sons didn't all live in the same place with their father. They would get married and move off to an apartment or some place down the street or to another city. But this is the legal situation. Now when you go to jail, I mean when you go to court, slaves of course can't represent themselves in court at all.

Speaker 1:          31:31          They're not. You don't have any legal standing, but if you're a freed man, you're, the other thing I should tell you is that in Roman law, if you're a manumitted as a slave, you're made free. If you're mandated in the normal way they did it. That makes you a Roman citizen. If your owner was a Roman citizen, notice what this means. Only the Roman Empire could slavery actually start being away that you can move up in society because you could. If you are a talented slave, your owner, Mike Free, you probably would for you when he freed you. If he was a Roman citizen, you would automatically become a Roman citizen also, and your children would be Roman citizens and although you are a freed man, which was lower in status in a free person, there was something privileges you couldn't have. Your children would be if they were born after you had been freed would be free people not fried. So within a couple of generations, people could move up from being the lowest slaves to two generations being free Roman citizens. So Roman slavery and freedom of that was actually one way that a few people in the ancient world recognized some kind of social mobility, which was very rare in the in the Roman Empire. Any questions about any of that?

Speaker 1:          32:42          Now, why is this important for the rest of this stuff? This will be a very important cause, a Christian, how Christians charted out his house, churches and their house churches fit. Sometimes the model of a Greek Ekklesia an assembly, but sometimes the model of the Roman household. And so this household structure becomes very important for the growth and structure and even the theology of Christianity eventually. This is also important though for Roman politics because if you're a free man or even if you're a free person, sometimes see free men would connect themselves to have powerful Roman who is higher status than them because they could use him for, for important things. For example, say you want to take a your neighbor to court cause your neighbor's starting impinging on your land. Well if you're of lower status, lower social status, the judge is gonna look at you say, you know, come on, you're poor, your neighbor's rich.

Speaker 1:          33:31          I'm going to side for the neighbor because Roman legal structures and even citizen Roman laws. If you're a judge and you have a rich man and a poor man in your court, of course you're going to decide for the rich man because the poor man is has, has incentive to cheat. He's poor, but the Richmond already has money. He doesn't have any incentive to cheat. That's their logic. But so, so Roman legal system was really geared toward the wealthy and the people of high status that for that reason, if you want it to win a court case, it helped or have somebody represent you in politics talking. It helped to have strong patrons. So you'd have a patron who would be higher class, richer, more powerful, have some political power and you will be loyal to your patron and your patron within represent you in court.

Speaker 1:          34:16          Try to get you jobs, try to get you more business, do all the kinds of things that patrons do for their clients. Also, if your patron wanted to run for us a city office, your patron would expect you to be loyal and vote for him. So lower class people. Now what happens though, when you have see the, your clients, your Friedman, your sons, your daughters, all of these are part of this pyramid structure and they all benefit from a strong potter familias and he'd benefits by having a strong household and the large house sold. But most of the free citizens of the Roman Empire there, all of Rome were poor people, free and even citizens, but they were poor people who weren't part of any rich household. So what do you have with all these other people, these other Romans around here who don't have a powerful patron who don't have a powerful Petrocelli's to help them out?

Speaker 1:          35:04          This is where Julius Caesar was quite the genius. Julius Caesar in came from a patrician family that is a family of an aristocratic family. But he started signing with a party in Rome called the Polaris, and I think this is on your handout, correct? The Roman city, the Roman Senate in the late part of the republic. Yeah. Started dividing itself. Two sort of parties, not official parties. The factions, the Optima test meaning the best tended to the support, the interests of the wealthy senators and the few wealthiest families. The papilla rs started representing the interests of everybody else in Rome. There that popularity has comes from the work hard. The people, Julius Caesar was from one of these aristocratic patrician families, although he didn't have a lot, his family didn't have a lot of money. They weren't really, really wealthy, but he had, he had great birth and so he started getting more power politically and financially by setting himself up as the patron of the patron list.

Speaker 1:          36:18          They also it the general's ran their armies this way, so Julius Caesar in our, if you are really going to be important in Rome, you had to serve as a general. At some point, Julius Caesar capitalized on his role as a general of a large army. That was at the time, uh, winning battles in Gaul, the modern France one. One example about this is how Julius Caesar was the patron, the fo potter familias in a sense of his army, his soldiers is that one time the Senate who had got a nervous about Julius is growth in popularity in power. They wanted to take some legions, some Roman legions away from Julius Caesar in Gaul and send them to another general in Syria. The reason they did this because they wanted to take some of Julius has power away. They was, he was, they were afraid he was going to set himself as a dictator, which of course he did. Uh, so they took these root Roman legions away and this end to the Syria, when they left Julius Caesar out of his own pocket, gave every soldier in those legions a year's pay.

Speaker 1:          37:18          This is what patrons do. You see, he bought the loyalty of his soldiers when they were being taken out of his control. This is the patron client structure at work in the Roman army. Julius also then set himself up in the city when he started gaining more power in Rome. Uh, actually he gained power in Rome, mainly by military might, uh, by kind of making the senate nervous and winning a few battles. And that was against the law. It was against the law for Julius Caesar to do that, but he did it anyway. He tried to consolidate his power though by putting forth policies that moderately help the lower classes. He didn't cancel taxes for a canceled debts, but he mitigated debts. He, uh, you know, ease some of the strains on the poor. He was assassinated by conservative Senate forces, you know, Brutus and Cassius and others on the ides of March, as you all know, March 15th, 44 BCE, he had adopted another Roman Octavian and Julius Caesar's adopted son Octavian then formed an alliance with Mark Anthony, who had been, Julia sees his friend and a lesser known figure named Lapidus, whom you don't really need to remember because the end, it turned out that Mark Antony and Octavian fought a civil war Octavian one and Octavian defeated Mark Antony.

Speaker 1:          38:46          And by this time, our candidate, he had palled up with Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, and Octavian beat both of them and he became the sole ruler of the empire. In 27 BCE, he refused the title of King and he took the traditional Republican titles. One of his propagandists said this about him. The pristine form of the republic was recalled as of old or Augustus. He had taken the title Augustus by this time, which means the great, he's himself said, I transferred the republic from my power to the dominion of the Senate and the people of Rome. In other words, in his propaganda, Augustus basically said, I'm not a king. I'm just another senator and I'm trying. I'm giving the Senate and the people all their power back, a lie. All lies. See, allying in government didn't start with our government. So Augustus actually reconstituted the Senate and it was just that a Senate reconstituted by the emperor.

Speaker 1:          39:48          He became more and more the patron of all the people, and this is why the emperor would forever them try to present himself. He and his family. The emperor's family was in a sense the patron for the whole people of the Roman Empire, at least for all the Romans, the potter familias of the entire empire. This led to what we famously called the Pax Romana, the Roman peace, because he had the end of long, hundreds of years of civil wars and other wars, at least within Rome itself, there were always battles and wars going on in the, on the boundaries, the frontiers of the Roman Empire. But, uh, within the, the SINFONIETTA entire, there was a, an amazing period of peace. Most people saw this piece. Uh, many people in history say it is good. It's debatable whether it was good for everybody, non Romans and poor people may have seen the Pax Romana as more oppressive than a liberation, just like people saw the pox Americana.

Speaker 1:          40:47          Uh, that way after the collapse of the Soviet Union before the beginning of the Iraq war, the Romans maintain piece for one thing by leaving local population's pretty much alone when it came to local customs, religions and living arrangements when they thought it was necessary. They maintained piece by destroying communities and forcibly moving populations. But they tried to do that only when they needed to do so to keep their absolute control. The Romans prospered by taxation. They did held censuses, not universal ones as mentioned in the Bible, but that local censuses in order to keep taxes high and fully paid, but they didn't. The Romans themselves didn't want to be bothered with collecting taxes. So they would have local sort of higher class. Local elites would for the right to collect local taxes. And so the Romans would take the highest bid. In other words, I would say if I'm a rich, wealthy person in corn, I'll say, I'll be the local tax collector and I'll guarantee you I'll send around this amount of money per year.

Speaker 1:          41:46          Of course the Romans didn't care then how much I charged you, the people of Corinth, and it's a area, actually the city of Corinth wouldn't have been taxed because it was a Roman colony. And one of the benefits of being a room in college that you ended up paying taxes, or at least the citizens that didn't have to pay taxes. But the people in the outlying villages and towns and farms and everything, we pay taxes. And if I'm the tax collector, the way I make a profit is by charging you a lot more than I need just to send to Rome, Romans and care about this. They just knew it was going to happen. This is the way they collected their taxes. This is why the word tax collector is such a bad word for everybody with the Romans. Why you see in the, you'll see in the gospels, the term tax collectors and sinners. Why? Because the Jews didn't like the tax collectors because they were being ripped off by them. Your hand up.

Speaker 1:          42:34          Well, number one, um, we'll talk about who the historical Matthew is. The figure in Matthew, in the gospel of Matthew, uh, we don't know much about his actual history and he just appears, but when it caused him a tax collector, it doesn't necessarily mean that he was the one who owned the right for that whole area. It just means he was, he could have been hired by somebody to sit at a roadside and collect taxes and tolls and stuff. So the word tax collector didn't necessarily mean that the person themselves were wealthy, but whoever had the tax, um, let's things, right, I'm looking for franchise. Whoever had the tax franchise for that area would be someone from a wealthy background, but then you'd hire out of the people to do the taxes. So these people, of course, were very unpopular. The Romans maintain peace to a great extent by keeping the poor poor.

Speaker 1:          43:29          So the Pax Romana may have sounded great if you are an elite, but if you're, we're not in the elite, it may have seemed more oppressive than anything. There were some other benefits so that the Romans did. They made travel much easier. They clear it. Pompei paid, cleared the Mediterranean, a pirates, which is something that our governments can't seem to do. They built roads, maintained some communication that you had a mail service, although it was for official use only, but this meant that you could get the, at least the Roman officials could get mail delivered fairly quickly. They use even a horseback relay that could go a hundred kilometers a day. Soldiers were expected to be able to travel 30 kilometers per day in full pack, and that was only possible because besides using the see the shipping lanes for travel, which was much faster than overland travel, they, the Romans maintained roads.

Speaker 1:          44:19          They didn't really care about roads for everybody else. They wanted the roads for their army, just like the US interstate system was originally created for in case the army needed to be moved across the country very quickly if the Soviets attacked. So this is the same way with the Romans. They built roads for the army, but of course other people use the roads too. This was why Christianity and other things where we're able to spread so easily. Why Paul was able to travel around the empire. He would prefer to go by sea if possible because as much quicker, but at least he could travel on the roads that the Romans built and maintain. As far as religion, urban talks about this in your textbook, so I won't go into a lot of um, uh, detail, but the common Hollywood idea that the Romans were kind of oppressive of other religions or the Christians is just that a Hollywood idea.

Speaker 1:          45:02          The Romans actually were very tolerant of local religions. They didn't care what God's you worshiped there. Romans are actually very pious in the sense that they believe that whatever land they were in, they should provide sacrifices and honors for the local gods, especially the important ones. So the Romans would honor local gods, other people's Gods. Every people was allowed to use their own gods. Jews, for example, by since the time of Julius Caesar who befriended the Jews because they helped him out politically a lot, um, he gave them certain privileges. Jews didn't have to, they could observe the sabbath. They didn't have to do things on the sabbath and they didn't want to, they didn't have to serve in the army. Uh, they got to observe their own religions. They weren't expected to sacrifice either to the emperor, to other gods. So the Romans basically were very tolerant when they weren't tolerant was when some religious group or club started looking like they might be rebellious if they started looking like insurrection would happen.

Speaker 1:          45:53          The Romans didn't do it. So the Romans for example, outlawed volunteer fire departments in local places because they were afraid that volunteer fire departments could be a place where locals, especially maybe lower class locals could get together and Start Gossiping about what they could do to cause trouble for the, the Romans. So the Romans were only concerned about religions when it looked like those religions were going to cause political problems. As we'll see next time Jews fell into the system in any different ways. Sometimes they were relatively happy clients of the Romans. Sometimes they were subversive enemies, other Roman order. As I said, they were officially recognized by the Romans. But this caused problems for Jews sometimes in Alexandria, the local Egyptian population resenting the Jews because they were recognized as a legal ethnicity in Alexandria and they weren't given complete privileges of the Greeks in Alexandria was a Greek city.

Speaker 1:          46:47          So there were a Greek speaking, maybe people of Greek descent, but if they fully adopted Greek customs, they were considered Greeks. The Jews were not considered Greeks, but at least they were higher in status in Alexandria, in law then local Egyptians, the Egyptians were the lowest in the city. So the local Egyptians resented the Jews because the Jews were recognized as their own ethnicity and given some privileges. So this is why you sometimes had Jews getting in trouble with local groups and have violence with Jews in different places. And sure enough, pogroms arise in places local people would, uh, you know, attack the Jews are, the Jews would try to set up an extra big, uh, uh, meeting house for themselves and it would cause local problems. But these were not problems brought on by the, these were local problems. And part of it was precisely because the Jews had been recognized by the Romans as having a special status in some places and this caused some kind of local resentment.

Speaker 1:          47:40          As we'll see though, the very fact that the Romans had allowed this one universal empire that had been created by Alexander originally and with a Greek veneer and they allowed the Latin, the the west to stay Latin and the east to stay Greek and they melded these two different things. All of this was one of the reasons that Christianity was able to spread at this time in the way it didn't. In fact, you might even think that had had Jesus come and had Paul lived had they tried to spread this new group, this new movement at a time, 500 years before this are 500 years afterwards. It may not have never happened because it was precisely because there's one world that run by the Romans and maintained by the Romans that allowed the spread of Christianity to a great extent, both ideologically and you know, thought wise as well as simply physically. Any questions? Okay. Time's up. See you. Not on Monday, but on Wednesday.
