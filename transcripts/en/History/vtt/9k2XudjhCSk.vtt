00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.546
NARRATOR: Located just 30
miles northeast of Mexico City,

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:07.507
the Teotihuacan
complex encompasses

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:13.346
nearly eight square miles and is
dated to the first century AD.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.724
It is the oldest and
most sophisticated

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.476
city of Mesoamerica,
an area that

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:21.896
extends from northern Mexico
down through Central America.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.815
[music playing]

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.280
The civilization predated the
Maya by at least 100 years.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.824
At its peak, it was
said to have supported

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:36.286
nearly 100,000 residents.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:40.582
It was also the largest city in
the entire Western hemisphere

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:44.169
prior to the 15th
century, and served

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.588
as the major commerce
and religious center

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:47.172
for the region.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:50.550
EXPERT 1: The significance
of Teotihuacan

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.219
cannot be overstated.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.098
It is the Rome of Mesoamerica.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:01.352
The things that Teotihuacan
did set the pattern for

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.354
all other city-states after it.

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:05.064
[music playing]

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:07.400
NARRATOR: The central
features of the complex

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.864
are two large pyramids known
as the Pyramid of the Sun

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:16.993
and the Pyramid of
the Moon, as well

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:20.538
as a temple dedicated
to Quetzalcoatl,

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:24.000
the feathered serpent.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.587
These structures stand alongside
a thoroughfare referred

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:31.466
to as the Avenue of the Dead.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:35.762
Over 200 smaller buildings,
platforms, and pyramids are

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:39.265
found adjacent to the avenue.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.434
And there are thousands
of living quarters

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.729
just outside the complex.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.024
But as incredible
as Teotihuacan is,

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:51.319
no one knows exactly who
built this metropolis

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.363
or what happened
to its occupants.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.284
EXPERT 1: Teotihuacan,
despite its size,

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.787
has no hieroglyphs whatsoever.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.789
There are other cultures
in Mesoamerica that

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.374
were using writing systems.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:08.127
There's nothing like
that at Teotihuacan.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:12.090
So we don't really have a
clear history of what happened

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.343
at Teotihuacan,
and we can't really

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.512
find evidence of their rulers.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.787
WILL HART: We have such
a sophisticated site

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:48.793
that embodies engineering
principles, craftsmanship, art.

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:51.462
Where did it originate?

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:54.924
Where are the smaller
versions of this?

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.467
Well, we don't find any.

00:02:56.467 --> 00:03:00.889
So we don't have a
progression, an evolution,

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.975
to show where this came from.

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:07.395
So we have to ask,
where did it come from?

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:08.938
DAVID WILCOCK: We've
become conditioned

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.190
to look at these awesome
works of stone architecture

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.067
and think, oh,
primitive people did

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:17.071
that, in these primitive methods
and primitive technology.

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:20.909
But we have to rethink the
fundamental assumptions

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.661
and come to a greater and
greater level of understanding

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.789
that the technology required to
build these artifacts, in fact,

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.959
is greater than anything
that they possessed.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.591
NARRATOR: But based on the
local lore of the region,

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:39.010
ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.095
that the original
builders of the site

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:45.058
may not have been human at all.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.768
JONATHAN YOUNG: All of
the people in this area

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:52.106
felt this city was a sacred site
connected to a divine realm.

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:56.527
The population along the
coast were the Totonac.

00:03:56.527 --> 00:04:00.156
They believe that the place
was founded by a dozen

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.367
sky gods, the lords of thunder.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.535
[music playing]

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.540
Other nearby
Mesoamerican cultures

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.584
had their own theories.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:15.046
One associated the site
with the feathered serpent

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:18.257
god, Quetzalcoatl, who was
said to have come from Venus.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.426
[music playing]

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:27.141
It was the Aztecs who
gave the place its name,

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:29.519
Teotihuacan, city of the gods.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.646
[music playing]

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.861
EXPERT 2: The name
speaks for itself.

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:41.864
So one has to ask the
question, what gods?

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:44.158
[music playing]

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.454
Who were they?

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:52.166
Were they just a figment of
our ancestors' imagination,

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.627
or did they see someone?

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.922
Did somebody visit
them to essentially

00:04:57.922 --> 00:04:58.923
jump-start civilization?
