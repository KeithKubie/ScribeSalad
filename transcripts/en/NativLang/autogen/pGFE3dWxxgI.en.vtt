some basic words in three latina core

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690
some basic words in three latina core
 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.200
some basic words in three latina core
Romance languages and determined how

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210
Romance languages and determined how
 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.790
Romance languages and determined how
they were related to each other

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800
they were related to each other
 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.220
they were related to each other
we also filled out their family tree

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230
we also filled out their family tree
 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.560
we also filled out their family tree
back in time and saw that they had this

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570
back in time and saw that they had this
 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.050
back in time and saw that they had this
relationship dependent on the existence

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060
relationship dependent on the existence
 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.900
relationship dependent on the existence
of some common ancestor that was an

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910
of some common ancestor that was an
 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.440
of some common ancestor that was an
actual language spoken in the past we

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450
actual language spoken in the past we
 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.720
actual language spoken in the past we
also determined that if we didn't have a

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730
also determined that if we didn't have a
 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.570
also determined that if we didn't have a
tested data for that language we'd have

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580
tested data for that language we'd have
 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.180
tested data for that language we'd have
to go back and reconstruct the language

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190
to go back and reconstruct the language
 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.000
to go back and reconstruct the language
to know what it was like in this lesson

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010
to know what it was like in this lesson
 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.680
to know what it was like in this lesson
we're going to do some of those basic

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690
we're going to do some of those basic
 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.750
we're going to do some of those basic
reconstructions to determine the shape

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760
reconstructions to determine the shape
 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.700
reconstructions to determine the shape
of an ancestral language that isn't

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710
of an ancestral language that isn't
 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.980
of an ancestral language that isn't
attested in other words we have no

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990
attested in other words we have no
 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.470
attested in other words we have no
written records of it we're going to

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480
written records of it we're going to
 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.870
written records of it we're going to
start with some fresh data from a few

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880
start with some fresh data from a few
 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.960
start with some fresh data from a few
new languages these are all Polynesian

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970
new languages these are all Polynesian
 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.580
new languages these are all Polynesian
languages I'll start out by saying

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590
languages I'll start out by saying
 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.160
languages I'll start out by saying
they're all related to each other we're

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170
they're all related to each other we're
 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.440
they're all related to each other we're
not trying to determine here if they're

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450
not trying to determine here if they're
 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.599
not trying to determine here if they're
related but rather what is the common

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609
related but rather what is the common
 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.730
related but rather what is the common
ancestral form that these cognates all

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740
ancestral form that these cognates all
 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.940
ancestral form that these cognates all
share these cognates all come from some

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950
share these cognates all come from some
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.700
share these cognates all come from some
one word in the past what was the shape

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710
one word in the past what was the shape
 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.429
one word in the past what was the shape
of that one word so here are some words

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439
of that one word so here are some words
 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.739
of that one word so here are some words
for numbers in these languages as you

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749
for numbers in these languages as you
 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.230
for numbers in these languages as you
can see the forms are all very close

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240
can see the forms are all very close
 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.590
can see the forms are all very close
it's easy to tell based on this data at

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600
it's easy to tell based on this data at
 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.209
it's easy to tell based on this data at
least that the languages are related

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219
least that the languages are related
 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.660
least that the languages are related
I've given you the IPA forms the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670
I've given you the IPA forms the
 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.059

international phonetic alphabet forms of
 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:41.770
international phonetic alphabet forms of
these words because we need to look at

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780
these words because we need to look at
 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.469
these words because we need to look at
sounds and sound change to determine how

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479
sounds and sound change to determine how
 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.419
sounds and sound change to determine how
these words changed if you're not

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429
these words changed if you're not
 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.669
these words changed if you're not
familiar with the IPA even though the

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679
familiar with the IPA even though the
 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.679
familiar with the IPA even though the
symbols used here are fairly basic I

introduce you to innovations and

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380
introduce you to innovations and
 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.399
introduce you to innovations and
retention innovations are changes to

some point in the past they may occur in
 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.899
some point in the past they may occur in
one language or they may be shared by a

ancestor what we need to do is determine
 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.270

which of the sounds here are retentions
 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.850
which of the sounds here are retentions
and which are innovations once we can do

look at this data notice that Hawaiian

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310
look at this data notice that Hawaiian
 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.000
look at this data notice that Hawaiian

voiceless dental glow civ that shows up
in most languages but also notice this

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230
in most languages but also notice this
 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.949
in most languages but also notice this
curiosity that some languages instead of

curiosity that some languages instead of
 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.620
curiosity that some languages instead of
having the phoneme T have this voiceless

have a pretty good indication that T was
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.670

changed to the innovation K in a
 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.310
changed to the innovation K in a
specific language in Hawaiian so we

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320
specific language in Hawaiian so we
 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.250
specific language in Hawaiian so we
choose T as the ancestral inherited

us to stop there we should go and
confirm against further data what we'd

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370
confirm against further data what we'd
 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.400
confirm against further data what we'd
find is that this is indeed the case

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410
find is that this is indeed the case
 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.890
find is that this is indeed the case
where there's a k in Hawaiian other

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900
where there's a k in Hawaiian other
 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.050
where there's a k in Hawaiian other
cognates and other languages have a T

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060
cognates and other languages have a T
 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.870
cognates and other languages have a T
and vice versa where there's a T in the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880
and vice versa where there's a T in the
 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.270
and vice versa where there's a T in the
other languages there's a K in Hawaiian

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280
other languages there's a K in Hawaiian
 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.060
other languages there's a K in Hawaiian
so this seems to be confirmed across the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070
so this seems to be confirmed across the
 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.820
so this seems to be confirmed across the
board we can posit some T in the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830
board we can posit some T in the
 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.330
board we can posit some T in the
ancestral language what's more we're not

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340
ancestral language what's more we're not
 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.790
ancestral language what's more we're not
surprised to find that the number seven

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800
surprised to find that the number seven
 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.820
surprised to find that the number seven
has a form with T and not with a K in

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830
has a form with T and not with a K in
 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.430
has a form with T and not with a K in
that ancestral language so our

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440
that ancestral language so our
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.279
that ancestral language so our
reconstruction of that root

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289
reconstruction of that root
 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.709
reconstruction of that root
pretty straightforward the question

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:33.719
pretty straightforward the question
 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:35.749
pretty straightforward the question
becomes a bit more complicated when we

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759
becomes a bit more complicated when we
 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.839
becomes a bit more complicated when we
look at ELLs and ours take a look at the

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849
look at ELLs and ours take a look at the
 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.359
look at ELLs and ours take a look at the
word for the number two and for the

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:41.369
word for the number two and for the
 

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:44.809
word for the number two and for the
number three and the number eight in the

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819
number three and the number eight in the
 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.820
number three and the number eight in the
Polynesian languages that we have here

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830
Polynesian languages that we have here
 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.950
Polynesian languages that we have here
should the reconstructions of these

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960
should the reconstructions of these
 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.639
should the reconstructions of these
languages have an L or an R one thing to

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:52.649
languages have an L or an R one thing to
 

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:54.409
languages have an L or an R one thing to
notice here is that languages that have

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419
notice here is that languages that have
 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.049
notice here is that languages that have
an L seem to always have an L and

00:04:57.049 --> 00:04:57.059
an L seem to always have an L and
 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:59.059
an L seem to always have an L and
languages that have an R seem to always

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069
languages that have an R seem to always
 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.339
languages that have an R seem to always
have an R and there's a good

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349
have an R and there's a good
 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.679
have an R and there's a good
distribution here so which one should we

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689
distribution here so which one should we
 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.859
distribution here so which one should we
choose as I mentioned this isn't so

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:06.869

straightforward

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949
straightforward
 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.249
straightforward
what we'll need to do is to extend our

what we'll need to do is to extend our
 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.100
what we'll need to do is to extend our
comparison to other languages these

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110
comparison to other languages these
 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.829
comparison to other languages these
languages aren't as closely related

they'll give us some comparative
 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:19.100
they'll give us some comparative
evidence for the distribution of ELLs

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110
evidence for the distribution of ELLs
 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.559
evidence for the distribution of ELLs
and ours throughout the whole family you

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569
and ours throughout the whole family you
 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.469
and ours throughout the whole family you
can see in these languages that l and r

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479
can see in these languages that l and r
 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.439
can see in these languages that l and r
are distinct phonemes in other words L

doesn't always show up when R does
what's even more important is that these

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099
what's even more important is that these
 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.609
what's even more important is that these
languages are consistent in their

languages are consistent in their
 

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:37.639
languages are consistent in their
distribution of Ln R so it's reasonable

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:37.649
distribution of Ln R so it's reasonable
 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:39.529

to suppose that this distinction was
 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.879
to suppose that this distinction was
also made in the common ancestor
