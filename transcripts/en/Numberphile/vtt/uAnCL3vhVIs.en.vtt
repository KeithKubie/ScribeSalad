00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
We got these weird sort of skew dice.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.300
Like usual dice are cubes, right?

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.380
And these are not, these are kind of squished somehow.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.210
Well they are a little bit sorta eldritch,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.700
or like occult or distorted from the fourth dimension or something.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.080
And what's the first question?

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.840
[Well the first question is are they fair?]

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.470
Are they fair?

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.880
Well let's roll them and find out shall we, I don't know.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.780
Uhh, ahh that looks fair to me.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.280
Uhh, yeah well so you know they work just like ordinary dice,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.090
and right, are they fair? Well ok.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.430
This is an ordinary dice.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.150
So that's your, you know, your usual cube-shaped dice.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.230
So why do you think this is fair?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.470
And what is it about it to make it fair?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.080
[It seems very symmetrical and all the sides seem the same area.]

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.070
Right, right yes, so really the reason why you know this thing,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.810
I mean it's not actually fair

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.730
cause you know there's different like the six dents taken out of this,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.730
but there isn't and you know what, forgetting all that.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.840
Suppose it is an ordinary, you know just the perfect mathematical cube.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.190
Physics sort of messes things up

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.730
and it, and it makes things, you know, bounce around in some crazy way.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.380
And you want to know that there's no bias, right?

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.230
So, so here is a way to think about like what is it that makes this fair.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.980
So if I sort of take this away and erase all the faces

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.660
and and write new ones on them and give it back to you,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.810
you wouldn't be able to tell that I've done anything

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.540
because it's got these sort of symmetries that I can like move this around.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.870
So it's about the symmetry.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.910
It's about like, you know, I guess the three is the same as the five,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.850
because you can move the thing to change the five into three

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.200
but it doesn't change the shape of it.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.340
Ok so now I got these things,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.050
so all I have to do is convince you that, that all the faces are the same,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.050
that the symmetry can take any to any others.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.480
So there you go, like so you can see the three-fold rotational symmetry here.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.190
Like if I rotate it, like that, it's the same,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.170
and then the three on the back: if I do this they're also the same.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.480
So they're all the same as well, it's got the same...

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.190
So the property's called "isohedral".

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.090
"Isohedral" is the property of a polyhedron

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.340
which is like the symmetries move the faces to,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.720
you can move any face to any other face.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.780
I can rotate 120 degrees. I can rotate 120 degrees again, whoops.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.830
And I can do this switch around thing here.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.210
So these have like just enough symmetry.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.730
These have the minimum amount of symmetry you can have to be fair,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.080
whereas your ordinary cube has excessive amounts of symmetry, you could say, right?

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.000
I mean there is way, there's extra symmetries like this thing is the same as...

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.600
It's the same shape, but like I haven't... It's still face two.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.690
Right so this has way more symmetry than you need

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.470
than this has just enough to be fair.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.400
This is the symmetry of the cube, that doesn't make it any more fair, right?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.660
The two is still the two.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.020
Whereas this thing is nothing you can do that doesn't sort of

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.570
mean, right to anything I can do to this symmetry.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.490
It means that, you know, it moves some face to some other face,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.990
showing that you know and you need that to be fair,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.710
all the things are like necessary.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.500
Ok so we have like six-sided dice

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.780
and people have seen like 10-sided dice and 20-sided dice.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.140
How far can you go?

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.010
Right so, well if you want a fair die?

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.900
Right so this is a 60- sided die,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.060
which has the same sort of symmetry properties as we were talking about before.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.370
Every face is the same as every other one.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.110
So here's face 24, right,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.190
and I guess I've got face, what's the opposite, opposite of 24?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.800
'Cause they have to add to up 61, right?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.700
'Cause that's what you do.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.620
So that's 24, that's 37.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.310
You turn it around and I guess maybe after turn it upside down again

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.070
and then it makes it the same, the same shape after you're done.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.960
So 24 is the same as 37.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.410
You do that with any of the other ones here.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.120
One problem with this is that it's really round,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.890
so kind of rolls forever,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.120
so I can try and do it like, here we go.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.690
[You rolled a one!]

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.100
That that's a critical fail I think. I wanna do 60.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.430
[This one you're showing me now looks kind of fair again.]

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.230
[Does this one have excessive symmetry or this one is as bare minimum?]

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.850
Well it's getting tough like when you get to sixty sides, like,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.130
like you run out of kind of symmetries that you can do.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.300
There's one extra symmetry this has that isn't necessary in some sense,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.390
which is the reflection.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.270
Right, so like you can see a line of a mirror symmetry there.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.670
So there is a way that, there is an isohedron, err…

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.930
a polyhedron that has the symmetry thing with sixty sides.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.370
The only problem like I really really wish we could have done this,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.830
the only problem is that it doesn't have opposite sides parallel.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.760
So when it lands on the table there isn't an obvious face that's up.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.000
Its kinda, we're really disappointed actually that we can't do that.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.410
But yeah so that there are a couple of other candidates out there with sixty

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.290
which have a little bit less symmetry but they don't work for other reasons.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.380
[Can you make bigger?]

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.300
Can you go bigger? Yeah yeah.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.150
So, so there is one more thing you can do with a hundred and twenty sided die.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.440
I can actually sort of explain how you do it just looking at this.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.530
So this is got sixty

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.100
and as you said it's got too much symmetry, right?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.120
This is reflection.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.330
So what you do is you take each of these sort of kite-shaped faces,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.730
and you divided it into two.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.730
You have two little triangles, one on either side,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.790
and then you've gone from 60 to 120.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.790
So we're working on it.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.310
Do you know about Numberphile2?

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.830
That's our second channel where there's bonus footage and out-takes.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.730
Make sure you see the extras from this video. They're really interesting.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.940
So this is a skewed version of the D12 which is similarly weird.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.600
And while you're there, why not subscribe to Numberphile2?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.780
That way you know all about the extra stuff

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.170
I don't always mention here on the main channel.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.710
…, which means that of course we had to do both of them, right?

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.540
So we had to make two mirror images.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.560
'Cause... I don't know, that's the right thing to do, right?
