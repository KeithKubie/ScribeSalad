discovery of Mazur well see I had been

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
discovery of Mazur well see I had been
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.810
discovery of Mazur well see I had been
working very hard thinking of different

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820
working very hard thinking of different
 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.240

now committee travelled around and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
now committee travelled around and
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330
now committee travelled around and
looked at what people were trying to do

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
looked at what people were trying to do
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.259
looked at what people were trying to do
and so on

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
and so on
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.179
and so on
we just didn't come up with any good

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
we just didn't come up with any good
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.510
we just didn't come up with any good
ideas so we would have our last meeting

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
ideas so we would have our last meeting
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.830
ideas so we would have our last meeting
in Washington DC and just before that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
in Washington DC and just before that
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.389
in Washington DC and just before that
last meeting I woke up early in the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
last meeting I woke up early in the
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.280
last meeting I woke up early in the
morning we thought I was worried about

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
morning we thought I was worried about
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110
morning we thought I was worried about
we hadn't been able to do anything I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
we hadn't been able to do anything I
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330
we hadn't been able to do anything I
went out I sat in the park is a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
went out I sat in the park is a
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.549
went out I sat in the park is a
beautiful day and the flowers were

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
beautiful day and the flowers were
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.189
beautiful day and the flowers were
blooming under sunny and I sat on the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
blooming under sunny and I sat on the
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.080
blooming under sunny and I sat on the
bench and I why haven't we been able to

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
bench and I why haven't we been able to
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.150
bench and I why haven't we been able to
do this and I went through all the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
do this and I went through all the
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069
do this and I went through all the
possibilities we had thought of you see

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
possibilities we had thought of you see
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170
possibilities we had thought of you see
and I had thought of things I had tried

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
and I had thought of things I had tried
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.760
and I had thought of things I had tried
and this didn't work and this didn't

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
and this didn't work and this didn't
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.460
and this didn't work and this didn't
work very well why can't we do it now

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
work very well why can't we do it now
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.340
work very well why can't we do it now
well I thought you know if we could get

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
well I thought you know if we could get
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530
well I thought you know if we could get
radiation from molecules molecules can

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
radiation from molecules molecules can
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.340
radiation from molecules molecules can
produces very short wavelengths but how

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
produces very short wavelengths but how
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.030
produces very short wavelengths but how
can do that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
can do that
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.359
can do that
oh wait a minute wait a minute I thought

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369
oh wait a minute wait a minute I thought
 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.649
oh wait a minute wait a minute I thought
hey this is the way to do it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
hey this is the way to do it
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.190
hey this is the way to do it
oh yes we can do it from molecules we

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
oh yes we can do it from molecules we
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840
oh yes we can do it from molecules we
get molecules in a right kind of state

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
get molecules in a right kind of state
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.649
get molecules in a right kind of state
and that can happen and it was exciting

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
and that can happen and it was exciting
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.280
and that can happen and it was exciting
it was exciting and I went back to my

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
it was exciting and I went back to my
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.760
it was exciting and I went back to my
hotel room and I was in the same hotel

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
hotel room and I was in the same hotel
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.410
hotel room and I was in the same hotel
room with office although who was a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
room with office although who was a
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.390
room with office although who was a
postdoc with me at the time I told him

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
postdoc with me at the time I told him
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.830
postdoc with me at the time I told him
that he said oh well you know that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
that he said oh well you know that
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.810
that he said oh well you know that
sounds sound all right so then I went

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
sounds sound all right so then I went
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850
sounds sound all right so then I went
back to Columbia and after a little

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
back to Columbia and after a little
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.590
back to Columbia and after a little
while I got a student to work on it and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
while I got a student to work on it and
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.250
while I got a student to work on it and
we've actually made it work
