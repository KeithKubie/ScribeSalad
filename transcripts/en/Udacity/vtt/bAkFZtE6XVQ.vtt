00:00:00.186 --> 00:00:03.786
Statistics is a discipline that makes you understand data

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:05.953
and make decisions based on data.

00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:09.053
Data comes in different shapes, and sizes and colors.

00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:12.836
If you are Google, this might be webpages.

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:18.353
Or in finance, these might be stocks and bonds going up and down.

00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:22.620
I will teach you lots of basic things, like how to chart data.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.903
We will build bar charts! We will talk about continuous data.

00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:28.953
Such as Gaussian distributions.

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:32.703
You will fit curves to data, like this line over here.

00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:37.152
We have a special track in the class, where you can program certain aspects.

00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:41.953
But if you can't, this class can be entirely taken without any programming whatsoever.

00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:46.061
You will be empowered to use all the basic common tools of statistics yourself.

00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:49.359
Use them yourself, solve interesting problems

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.634
and it will forever change the way you look at data.
