President of Ralston College,

11
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.020
Dr Steven Blackwood.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.430
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

13
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.550
<v 1>Thank you.
A warm welcome to all of you here this evening.</v>

14
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:48.551
Both of those here in the feed or in Toronto and those following online.

15
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.170
You know,

16
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:55.170
it's not very often that you see a country's largest theater packed for an

17
00:08:56.101 --> 00:09:00.810
intellectual debate,
but that's what we're all here for tonight.
Please join me

18
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.900
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

19
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:13.060
<v 1>please join me in welcoming to the stage Dr Slab was Gtech and Dr. Jordan</v>

20
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.920
Peterson.

21
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.920
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

22
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.300
<v 1>just a few words of introduction.</v>

23
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:46.730
There can be huge things I think now more urgent and necessary in an age of

24
00:09:49.571 --> 00:09:54.571
reactionary partisan allegiance and degraded civil discourse.

25
00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.130
Then real thinking about hard questions.

26
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.970
The very premise of tonight's event is that we all participate in the life of

27
00:10:07.721 --> 00:10:08.554
thought,

28
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.730
not merely opinion or prejudice,

29
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.460
but the realm of truth,

30
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.870
access through evidence and argument.

31
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:26.130
But these two towering figures of different disciplines and domains share more

32
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.620
than a commitment to thinking itself.

33
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:38.910
They are both highly attuned to etiology and the mechanisms of power,

34
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:45.870
and yet they are not principally political thinkers.

35
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.380
They are both concerned with more fundamental matters,

36
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.650
meaning truth freedom.

37
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.500
So it seems to me likely we will see tonight not only deep differences,

38
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.060
but also surprising agreement on deep questions.

39
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.050
Doctor [inaudible] is a philosopher.

40
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.630
He has not one but two doctoral degrees,
one in philosophy

41
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:18.710
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

42
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.980
<v 1>what in philosophy from the University of Lube,</v>

43
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.430
Leanna and a second in psychoanalysis from university

45
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.340
<v 1>Let's hear it for cycle analysis</v>

46
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:41.030
for the University of Paris eight he is now a professor at the Institute of

47
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.350
Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Louisiana and the director of the

48
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.170
Berbick Institute for the humanities at the University of London.

49
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.010
He has published more than three dozen,

50
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
many on the most seminal philosophers of the 19th and 20th centuries.

51
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.600
He is a dazzling theorist with extraordinary range,

52
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.970
a global figure for decades.

53
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.300
He turns again and again with dialectical power to radical questions of

54
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.740
emancipation,
subjectivity and art.

55
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.490
<v 0>[inaudible],</v>

56
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.720
<v 1>Dr. Jordan Peterson is an academic</v>

57
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.900
<v 0>and political [inaudible],</v>

58
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.510
<v 1>an academic and clinical psychologist.</v>

59
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.620
His doctorate was awarded by Mcgill University and he was subsequently,

60
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.830
we've got some new go gap graduates out here.

61
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:06.850
He was subsequently professor of psychology at Harvard University and then the

62
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.360
University of Toronto where he is today.

63
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.480
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

64
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.500
<v 1>the author of two books in well over a hundred academic articles.</v>

65
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:23.250
Dr Peterson's intellectual roots likewise lie in the 19th and early 20th

66
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:28.891
centuries where his reading of Nicha Dostoyevsky and above all,

67
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:34.830
Carl EWM inform his interpretation of ancient myths of 20th century

68
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.040
totalitarianism and especially his endeavor to counter contemporary nihilism.

69
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.850
His 12 rules for life is a global best seller and his lectures and podcasts are

70
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:50.560
followed by millions around the world.

71
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:56.090
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

72
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.240
Both

73
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.350
<v 1>doctors Jijak and Peterson transcend their titles,</v>

74
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.850
their disciplines,
and the academy.
Just as this debate,

75
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.360
we hope will transcend purely economic questions by situating those in the frame

76
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:21.070
of happiness of human flourishing itself.

77
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.620
We're in for quite a night,
a quick word about format.

78
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.990
Each of our debaters will have 30 minutes to make a substantial opening

79
00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:35.050
statement to lay out an argument.

80
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:40.160
Dr. Peterson first followed by Doctor Jijak each.

81
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.930
We'll then have in the same order,
10 minutes to reply.

82
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:49.600
I will then moderate 45 minutes or so of questions,

83
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.430
many of which will come from the audience,

84
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.590
<v 2>both here in Toronto and online.
With that,</v>

85
00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.420
let's get underway.

86
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.110
Please join me in welcoming Dr. Jordan Peterson for the first opening

87
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.750
<v 0>statement.</v>

88
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:08.750
[inaudible]

89
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.460
<v 2>well thank you for that insanely enthusiastic welcome for the entire event and</v>

90
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:25.430
also for being here.
I have to tell you first,
um,

91
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.460
that this event and I suppose my life in some sense hit a new milestone that I

92
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.600
was just made aware of by a stage hand today backstage who informed me that last

93
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.170
week the tickets for this event,

94
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.190
we're being scalped online at a higher price than the tickets for the leafs

95
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:46.363
playoff games.

96
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.480
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

97
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:59.290
<v 2>so,
uh,
I don't know what to make of that.
That's all right.</v>

98
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.150
So how did I prepare for this?
Um,
I went,

99
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.490
I familiarized myself to the degree that it was possible with Slava was GCX work

100
00:16:09.491 --> 00:16:13.150
and that wasn't that possible because he has a lot of work and he's a very

101
00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:17.170
original thinker.
And this debate was put together in relatively short order.

102
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:22.180
And what I did instead was returned to what I regarded as the original cause of

103
00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:25.570
all the trouble,
let's say,
which was the communist manifesto.

104
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.460
And what I attempted to do because that's marks and we're here to talk about

105
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.030
Marxism.
Let's see.
And um,

106
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.280
what I tried to do was read it and to read something.
You don't just

107
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.360
follow the words and follow the meaning,

108
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.600
but you take apart the sentences and you ask yourself at this level of phrase

109
00:16:49.571 --> 00:16:54.310
and that the level of sentences in it,
the level of paragraph,
is this true?

110
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.870
Are there counter arguments that can be put forward that are credible?

111
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.820
Is this solid thinking?
And I have to tell you,

112
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.400
and I'm not trying to be flippant here,

113
00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:10.960
that I have rarely read a track.
Now I read it when I was 18.

114
00:17:10.961 --> 00:17:14.110
It was a long time ago,
right?
That's 40 years ago.

115
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:18.040
But I've rarely read a track that made as many errors per sentence,

116
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.920
conceptual errors percent and says the communist manifesto.

117
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.070
It was quite a miraculous.
Reread it.

118
00:17:24.071 --> 00:17:28.510
And it was interesting to think about it psychologically as well because I've

119
00:17:28.511 --> 00:17:33.190
read student papers that were of the same ilk in some sense,

120
00:17:33.191 --> 00:17:36.760
although I'm not suggesting that they were of the same level of glittering

121
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.360
literary brilliance and polemic quality.

122
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.260
And I also understand that the communist manifesto was a call for revolution and

123
00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:47.830
not a standard logical argument,
but that not withstanding,

124
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.690
I have some things say about the author's psychologically.

125
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.740
The first thing is that it doesn't seem to me that either Mark's or ingles

126
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.000
grappled with one fundamental with this particular fundamental truth,

127
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:04.200
which is that almost all ideas are wrong.

128
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.450
And so if you,

129
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.750
and it doesn't matter if they're your ideas or someone else's ideas,

130
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.130
they're probably wrong.
And even if they strike you with the force of brilliance,

131
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.430
you're job is to assume first of all,
that they're probably wrong.

132
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:22.530
And then to assault them with everything you have in your arsenal and see if

133
00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:24.570
they can survive.
And what,

134
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.950
what struck me about the communist manifesto was it was akin to something young

135
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:31.110
said about typical thinking.

136
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.960
And this was the thinking of people who weren't trained to think.

137
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.750
And he said that the typical thinker has a thought,

138
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.780
it appears to them like an object might appear in a room the thought appears and

139
00:18:42.361 --> 00:18:45.630
then they just,
they just accepted as true.

140
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.340
They don't go to second step,
which is to think about the thinking.

141
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.190
And that's the real essence of critical thinking.

142
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:57.990
And so that's what you try to teach people in university is to read a text and

143
00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:01.560
to think about it critically,
not to destroy the utility of the text,

144
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.290
but to separate the wheat from the chaff.

145
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.950
And so what I tried to do when I was reading the communist manifesto was to

146
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.780
separate the wheat from the chaff.
And I'm afraid I found some wheat,

147
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:17.550
yes,
but most of the chaff.
And I'm going to explain why,
um,
hopefully,

148
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.680
uh,
in relatively short order.

149
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.920
So I'm going to outline 10 of the fundamental axioms of the communist manifesto.

150
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.380
And so these are truths that are basically held as self evident by the authors

151
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.430
and their truths that are presented in some sense as unquestioned.

152
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.450
And I'm going to question them and tell you why I think they're,
um,

153
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.300
unreliable.

154
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.740
Now we should remember that this tract was actually written 170 years ago.

155
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.150
That's a long time ago.

156
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.920
And we have learned a fair bit from since then about human nature,

157
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:55.620
about society,
about politics,
about economics.

158
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.950
There's lots of mysteries left to be unsolved,
but left to be solved.

159
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.750
But we are slightly wiser,
I presume then we were at one point.

160
00:20:03.751 --> 00:20:07.020
And so you can forgive the authors to some degree for what they didn't know,

161
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.030
but that doesn't matter.

162
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:14.270
Given that the essence of this doctrine is still held as sacrosanct by a large

163
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:20.901
proportion of academics probably are among the most,

164
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.810
what would you call guilty of that particular sin?

165
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.990
So here's proposition number one.

166
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:36.000
History is to be viewed primarily as an economic class struggle.

167
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.580
All right,
so,
so let's think about that for a minute.
Um,

168
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.930
first of all,
is there,

169
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.020
the proposition there is that history is primarily to be viewed through an

170
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:47.130
economic lens.

171
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.460
And I think that's a debatable proposition because there are many other

172
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:54.760
motivations that drive human beings than economics.

173
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.650
And those have to be taken into account,

174
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.280
especially the drove people other than economic competition,

175
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.660
like economic cooperation for example.
And so that's a problem.

176
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:09.250
The other problem is that it's actually not nearly a pessimistic enough,

177
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.570
um,
description of the actual problem because history,

178
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.190
history,
this is to give the devil his due.

179
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:25.470
The idea that one of the driving forces between history is hierarchical struggle

180
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.580
is absolutely true.

181
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.610
But the idea that that's actually history is not true because it's deeper than

182
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:34.031
history.

183
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:38.680
It's biology itself because organisms have all sorts organized themselves into

184
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:39.514
hierarchies.

185
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.720
And one of the problems with hierarchies is that they tend to arrange themselves

186
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.290
into a winner,
take all situation.
And so,

187
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.240
and that that is implicit in some sense in Marx,

188
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.890
Marx is thinking because of course,
Marx believed that in a capitalist society,

189
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.830
capital would accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer people.

190
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.060
And that actually is in keeping with the nature of hierarchical organizations.

191
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:06.510
Now the problem with that is it so much the fact of the,

192
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.200
so there's the,

193
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.200
there's accuracy in the accusation that that is a eternal form of motivation for

194
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:15.310
struggle.

195
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.790
But it's an underestimation of the seriousness of the problem because it

196
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:23.791
attributed to this structure of human societies rather than the deeper reality

197
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:26.500
of the existence of hierarchical structures per se,

198
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:31.390
which as they also characterize the animal kingdom to a large degree are clearly

199
00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:36.391
not only human constructions and the idea that there's hierarchical competition

200
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:39.370
among human beings.
There's evidence for that.

201
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:42.040
That goes back at least to the Paleo Olympic Times.

202
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.060
And so that's the next problem.
It's that,
well,
the,

203
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:51.150
this ancient problem of hierarchical structure is clearly not attributable to

204
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:57.301
capitalism because it existed long in human history before capitalism existed

205
00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.660
and then it predated human history itself.

206
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.330
So the question then arises,

207
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.160
why would you necessarily at least implicitly link the class struggle with

208
00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:13.030
capitalism given that it's a far deeper problem.
And now it's also,

209
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.970
you got to understand that this is a deeper problem for people on the left,

210
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.410
not just for people on the right.

211
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.640
It is the case that hierarchical structures dispossess those people who are at

212
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:25.210
the bottom,
those creatures who are at the bottom speaking say of animals,

213
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.890
but those people who are at the bottom.

214
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.400
And that that is a fundamental existential problem.
I'll let,

215
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:34.050
the other thing that marks didn't seem to take into account is that there,
there,

216
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:39.060
there are far more reasons that human beings struggle then their economic class

217
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:42.940
struggle.
Even if you build the hierarchical idea into that,

218
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.030
which is a more comprehensive way of thinking about human beings,

219
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.710
struggle with themselves,

220
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:52.100
with the malevolence that's inside themselves with the evil that they're capable

221
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:56.300
of doing with the spiritual and psychological warfare that goes on within them.

222
00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:01.690
And we're also actually always at odds with nature and this never seems to show

223
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:05.960
up in marks and it doesn't show up in Marxist Marxism in general,

224
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:10.670
it's as if nature doesn't exist.
The primary conflict as far as I'm concerned,

225
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:15.671
or a primary conflict that human beings engage engaging is the struggle for life

226
00:24:16.551 --> 00:24:20.480
in a cruel and harsh natural world.
And it says,

227
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:24.080
if I just have,
that doesn't exist in the Marxists domain.

228
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.590
If human beings have a problem,
it's because there's a class struggle.

229
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:29.510
Let's essentially economic.
It's like,
no,

230
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:34.610
human beings have problems because we come into the life starving and lonesome

231
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.220
and we have to solve that problem continually.

232
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.780
And we make our social arrangements at least in part to ameliorate that as well

233
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:45.560
as to as to well upon occasion exacerbated.

234
00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:50.090
And so there's also very little understanding in the communist manifesto that

235
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.010
any of the like say hierarchical organizations that human beings have put

236
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:56.930
together might have a positive element.

237
00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.980
And that's an absolute catastrophe because hierarchical structures are actually

238
00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:03.830
necessary to solve complicated social problems.

239
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.820
We have to organize ourselves in some manner and you have to give the devil his

240
00:25:07.821 --> 00:25:12.380
due.
And so it is the case that hierarchies dispossessed people and that's a big

241
00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:14.840
problem.
That's the fundamental problem of inequality.

242
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.590
But it's also the case that hierarchies happened to be a very efficient way of

243
00:25:18.591 --> 00:25:19.700
distributing resources.

244
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.410
And it's finally the case that human hierarchies are not fundamentally

245
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:26.090
predicated on power.

246
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:31.370
And I would say that biological anthropological data on that are crystal clear.

247
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.550
You don't rise to a position of authority that's reliable in human society,

248
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.930
primarily by exploiting other people.

249
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.750
It's a very unstable means of obtaining power.
So,

250
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.420
so that's a problem.
Well,

251
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:49.370
the people that laugh might do it that way.

252
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:55.510
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

253
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.041
<v 2>okay.
Now the other,</v>

254
00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:03.270
another problem that comes up right away is that Mark's also assumes that you

255
00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:07.860
can think about history as a binary class struggle with clear divisions between

256
00:26:07.861 --> 00:26:11.310
say the proletariat,
proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

257
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:16.110
And that's actually a problem because it's not so easy to make a from division

258
00:26:16.111 --> 00:26:20.490
between who's exploiter and who's exploiting,
let's say.

259
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.830
Um,
because it's not obvious,
like in the case of small shareholders,

260
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:26.783
let's say,

261
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.510
whether or not they happen to be part of the oppressed or part of the oppressor,

262
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:35.220
this actually turned out to be a big problem in the Russian revolution and buy

263
00:26:35.221 --> 00:26:36.420
big problem.
I mean,

264
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:41.400
tremendously big problem because it turned out that you could fragment people

265
00:26:41.401 --> 00:26:45.030
into multiple identities and that that's a fairly easy thing to do.

266
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.040
And you can usually find some access along which they were part of the oppressor

267
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:50.874
class.

268
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.360
It might have been a consequence of their education or it might be a consequence

269
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.300
of their,
of their,
of their,

270
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.320
of the wealth that they strived to accumulate during their life.

271
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.680
Or it might've been a consequence of the fact that they had parents or

272
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:08.310
grandparents who are educated to rich or that they're a member of the priesthood

273
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.350
or that they were socialists or any ways that the listing of how it was possible

274
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:17.520
for you to be bourgeois instead of proletariat grew immensely.

275
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.180
And that was one of the reasons that the red terror claimed all the victims that

276
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:23.850
it claimed.
And so that was a huge problem.

277
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:28.890
It was probably most exemplified by the demolition of the Kulaks who were

278
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.620
basically peasants,
peasant farmers,

279
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:36.210
although effective ones in the Soviet Union who had managed to raise themselves

280
00:27:36.211 --> 00:27:40.290
out of serfdom over a period of about 40 years.
And together some,

281
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.470
some degree of material security about them.

282
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.830
And about 1.8 million of them were exiled,
uh,

283
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:51.270
about 400,000 were killed.
And the net consequence of that,
um,

284
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.720
removal of their private property because of their bourgeois status was arguably

285
00:27:57.151 --> 00:28:00.660
the death of 6 million Ukrainians in the famines of the 1930s.

286
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.640
And so the binary class struggle idea that was a bad idea.
That was a very,

287
00:28:05.641 --> 00:28:08.950
very bad idea.
It's also bad in this way.
And that,

288
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.470
and this is a real slight of hand that Mark's pulls off,

289
00:28:11.471 --> 00:28:15.900
is you have a binary class division proletarian bourgeoisie,

290
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.920
and you have an implicit idea that all of the good is on the side of the

291
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:23.790
proletariat.
And all of the evil is on this side of the bourgeoisie.

292
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.130
And that's classic group identity thinking.
You know,

293
00:28:26.131 --> 00:28:29.640
it was just one of the reasons I don't like identity politics is because once

294
00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:32.460
you divide people into groups and pit them against one another,

295
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.600
it's very easy to assume that all the evil in the world can be attributed to one

296
00:28:36.601 --> 00:28:41.250
group,
the hypothetical oppressors and all the good to the other and that.

297
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:48.210
Well,
and that's,
that's,
that's naive.
That's naive beyond comprehension because,

298
00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:49.080
um,

299
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.770
it's absolutely foolish to make the presumption that you can identify someone's

300
00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:55.770
moral worth with their economic standing.
So,

301
00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.800
and that actually turned out to be a real problem as well because,

302
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.093
um,

303
00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.370
Mark's also came up with his idea,

304
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.630
which is a crazy idea as far as I can tell of the,
that's a technical term,

305
00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:17.410
crazy idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

306
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.760
And that's the next idea that I really stumbled across.
It was like,
okay,

307
00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.540
so what's the problem?
Well,
the problem is the capitalists own everything.

308
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.170
They own all the means of production and they're oppressing everyone.

309
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.670
That would be all the workers.

310
00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.720
And there's going to be a race to the bottom of wages for the workers as the

311
00:29:34.721 --> 00:29:39.721
capitalist strive to extract more and more value from the Labor of the

312
00:29:39.731 --> 00:29:44.110
proletariat by with other capitalists should drive wages downward,

313
00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:47.170
which by the way,
didn't happen partly because wages,

314
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.710
wage earners can become scarce,
and that actually drives the market value upward.

315
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:56.100
But the fact that you assume a priori,

316
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.540
that all the evil can be attributed to the capitalists and all the good that the

317
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:05.800
bourgeoisie and all the good could be attributed to the proletariat meant that

318
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.390
you could hypothesize that a dictatorship of the proletariat could come about.

319
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:13.840
And that was the,
the first stage in the communist revolution.

320
00:30:13.841 --> 00:30:16.840
And remember this is a call for revolution,
not just revolution,

321
00:30:16.841 --> 00:30:21.841
but bloody violent revolution and the overthrow of all the overthrowing of all

322
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.860
existence,
social structures.

323
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:40.683
<v 0>MMM.</v>

324
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.240
<v 2>Anyways,
the,
the,
the,
the,</v>

325
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.900
the problem with that you see is that because all the evil isn't divided so

326
00:30:47.901 --> 00:30:49.820
easily up into oppressor and oppressed,

327
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.930
that when you do establish a dictator of the proletariat to the degree that you

328
00:30:53.931 --> 00:30:54.561
can do that,

329
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:58.400
which you actually can't because it's technically impossible and an absurd thing

330
00:30:58.401 --> 00:31:02.630
to consider to begin with not least because of the problem of centralization,

331
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:06.290
and you have to hypothesize that you can take away all the property of the

332
00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:07.220
capitalists.

333
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.960
You can replace the capitalist class with a minority of pro proletariats.

334
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.830
How they're going to be chosen isn't exactly clear in the communist manifesto

335
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.430
that none of the people who are from the proletarian class are going to be

336
00:31:19.431 --> 00:31:24.431
corrupted by that sudden access to power because they're well by definition.

337
00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:25.970
Good.
So,

338
00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.540
so then you have the good people who are running the world and you also have

339
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:34.460
them centralized so that they can make decision decisions that are insanely

340
00:31:34.461 --> 00:31:37.730
complicated to make in fact impossibly complicated to make.

341
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:43.160
And so that's a failure conceptually on both dimensions because first of all,

342
00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.530
all the proletariat aren't going to be good.

343
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:49.970
And when you give put people in the same position as the evil capitalists,

344
00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:54.170
especially if you believe that social pressure is one of the determining factors

345
00:31:54.171 --> 00:31:56.510
of human character,
which the Marxists certainly believed,

346
00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.560
then why wouldn't you assume that the proletariat would immediately become as or

347
00:32:00.561 --> 00:32:03.410
more corrupt than the capitalists,
which is of course,

348
00:32:03.411 --> 00:32:07.520
I would say exactly what happened every time this experiment was run and then

349
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.210
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

350
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.610
<v 2>The next problem is,
well,</v>

351
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.050
what makes you think that you can take some system as complicated as like

352
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:24.110
capitalist free market society and centralize that and put decision making power

353
00:32:25.381 --> 00:32:28.890
in the hands of a few people.
The mechanisms by

354
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:34.080
without specifying the mechanisms by which you're going to choose them,

355
00:32:34.081 --> 00:32:37.740
like what makes you think they're going to have the wisdom or the ability to do

356
00:32:37.741 --> 00:32:41.300
what the capitalists were.
Unless you assume,

357
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.300
as Marx did that all of the evil ones with the capitalists and all the good was

358
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.880
with the proletariats and that nothing that capitalists did constituted valid

359
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:52.400
labor,
which is another thing that Marx assumed,

360
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:57.580
which is palpably absurd because people who are like maybe if you're a dissolute

361
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.880
aristocrat from 1830 and or earlier and you run a feudal estate and all you do

362
00:33:04.611 --> 00:33:08.300
is spend your time gambling and,
and,
and,
and chasing prostitutes,

363
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:11.690
well then your labor value is zero.
But if you're,

364
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:15.470
if you're running a business and,
and it's a successful business,
first of all,

365
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:19.310
you're a bloody fool to explore exploit your workers because even if you're

366
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:23.660
greedy as sin because you're not going to extract the maximum amount of labor

367
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:27.740
out of them by doing that and the notion that you're adding no productive value

368
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:32.510
as a manager rather than a capitalist is it's absolutely absurd.

369
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.620
All it does is indicate that you either know nothing whatsoever about how an

370
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:41.450
actual business works or you refuse to know anything about how an actual

371
00:33:41.451 --> 00:33:42.980
business works.
So that's

372
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:48.070
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

373
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.580
<v 2>That's also,
that's also a big problem.</v>

374
00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:55.470
So then the next problem is the criticism of profit.

375
00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:00.330
It's like,
well what's wrong with profit?
Exactly what,

376
00:34:00.331 --> 00:34:02.100
what's the problem with profit?
Well,

377
00:34:02.101 --> 00:34:06.180
the idea from the Marxist perspective was that profit was theft.

378
00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:11.640
No one but profit well can be theft because crooked people can run companies and

379
00:34:11.641 --> 00:34:13.140
so sometimes profit is theft,

380
00:34:13.141 --> 00:34:16.470
but that certainly doesn't mean that it's always three theft.

381
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.800
What it means in part at least if the capitalist is adding value to the

382
00:34:22.171 --> 00:34:23.004
corporation,

383
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:28.190
then there's some utility and some fairness in him or her extracting the value

384
00:34:29.311 --> 00:34:34.110
of their abstract labor,
their thought,
their abstract abilities,

385
00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:39.060
their ability to manage the company and to engage in proper competition in

386
00:34:39.061 --> 00:34:43.140
product development and efficiency and the proper treatment of the workers and

387
00:34:43.141 --> 00:34:45.750
all of that.
And then if they can create a profit,

388
00:34:45.751 --> 00:34:49.400
well then they have a little bit of security for times that aren't so good.

389
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.800
And that seems absolutely bloody necessary as far as I'm concerned.

390
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.420
And then the next thing is,
well how can you grow if you don't have a profit?

391
00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:00.930
And if you have an enterprise that's valuable and worthwhile and some

392
00:35:00.931 --> 00:35:02.790
enterprises are valuable and worthwhile,

393
00:35:02.791 --> 00:35:06.210
then it seems to me that a little bit of profit to help you grow seems to be the

394
00:35:06.211 --> 00:35:10.650
right approach.
And so,
and then the other issue with profit,

395
00:35:10.651 --> 00:35:12.540
and you know this,
if you've ever run a business is it,

396
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.860
it's really useful constraint.
You know,
like it's not enough to have a good idea.

397
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:21.180
It's not a good enough to have a good idea and a sales and marketing plan.

398
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.090
And then to implement that in all of that,
that's bloody difficult.

399
00:35:24.091 --> 00:35:26.010
Like it's not easy to have a good idea.

400
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.040
And it's not easy to come up with a good sales and marketing plan.

401
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.910
And it's not easy to find customers and satisfy them.

402
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.940
And so if you allow profit to,

403
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:41.430
to a limitation on what it is that you might reasonably attempt,

404
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.500
it provides a good constraint on,

405
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.950
on wasted labor.

406
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.510
And so most of the things that I've done in my life,
even psychologically,

407
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:53.610
that were designed to help people,
psychological health,

408
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.900
I tried to run on a for profit basis.
And the reason for what that was,

409
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.510
apart from the fact that I'm not averse to making a profit,

410
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.520
partly so my enterprises can grow,

411
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.840
but it was also so that there were forms of stupidity that I couldn't engage in

412
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:10.470
because I would be punished by the market enough to eradicate the enterprise.

413
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.360
And so

414
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.360
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

415
00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.770
<v 2>Okay.
And then,
so the next,
the next issue,
this is a weird one.</v>

416
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:27.100
So Marx and Engels also assume that this dictatorship of the proletariat,

417
00:36:28.251 --> 00:36:30.860
which involves observed centralization,

418
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:36.190
the overwhelming probability of corruption and impossible computation as the

419
00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.960
proletariat now try to rationally compute the manner in which an entire market

420
00:36:41.961 --> 00:36:43.310
economy could run,

421
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:47.210
which cannot be done because it's far too complicated for anybody to think

422
00:36:47.211 --> 00:36:48.470
through.
Um,

423
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:54.340
the next theory is that somehow the proletariat dictatorship would become

424
00:36:54.861 --> 00:36:56.480
magically hyper productive.

425
00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.760
And there's actually no theory at all about how that's going to happen.

426
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.200
And so I had to infer the theory and the theory seems to be that once you

427
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.150
eradicate the bourgeoisie,

428
00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.770
because they're evil and you get rid of their private property and Ew,

429
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.100
ew,
ew,
ew,
eradicate the profit motive,

430
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:20.930
then all of a sudden magically the small percentage of the proletariat who now

431
00:37:20.931 --> 00:37:25.931
run the society determine how they can make their

432
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.750
productive enterprises productive enough.

433
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:34.670
So they become hyper productive now and they need to become hyper productive for

434
00:37:34.671 --> 00:37:39.671
the last error to be logically coherent in relationship to the Marxist theory,

435
00:37:40.581 --> 00:37:43.190
which is that at some point the proletariat,

436
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:46.670
the dictatorship of the proletariat will become so hyper productive that

437
00:37:46.671 --> 00:37:51.671
there'll be enough material goods for everyone across all dimensions.

438
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.300
And when that happens,

439
00:37:53.301 --> 00:37:58.301
then what people will do is spontaneously engage in meaningful creative labor,

440
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.370
which is what they had been alienated from in the capitalist horror show.

441
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.670
And the utopia will be magically ushered in,

442
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:11.900
but there's no indication about how that hyper productivity is going to come

443
00:38:11.901 --> 00:38:13.430
about.
And there's no walls.

444
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:18.490
There's also no understanding that well that isn't the utopia that is going to

445
00:38:19.671 --> 00:38:24.650
suit everyone because there are great differences between people when some

446
00:38:24.651 --> 00:38:29.360
people are going to find what they want in love and some are going to find it in

447
00:38:29.361 --> 00:38:30.680
social being in,

448
00:38:30.681 --> 00:38:35.320
some are going to find it in conflict and competition and some are going to it

449
00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:37.210
in creativity as mark pointed out.

450
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:42.450
But the notion that that that will necessarily be the end goal for the Utopian

451
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:47.530
state is preposterous.
And then there's the dusty in observation too,

452
00:38:47.531 --> 00:38:50.070
which is one not to be taken lightly,
which is well,

453
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.370
what sort of shallow conception of people do you have that makes you think that

454
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:58.960
if you gave people enough bread and cake and the Dostoyevsky in terms and

455
00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.290
nothing to do with busy them except the busy themselves with the continued to

456
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.870
continuity of the species,

457
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.610
that they would also all of a sudden become peaceful in heavenly Dostoyevsky's

458
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:10.540
idea was that,
you know,

459
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:14.840
we were built for trouble and if we were ever handed everything we were,

460
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.420
we needed on a silver platter,

461
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:20.170
the first thing we would do is engage in some form of creative destruction.

462
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.430
Just so something unexpected could happen just so we could have the adventure of

463
00:39:24.431 --> 00:39:28.360
our lives.
And I think there's something,
there's something to be said for that.

464
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.270
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

465
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.130
<v 2>So and then the last error let's say,</v>

466
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.590
although by no means the last was this,

467
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:42.800
and this is one of the strangest parts of the communist manifesto was Mark's it

468
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:43.330
agree,

469
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:48.330
admits and angels admit repeatedly in the Communist manifesto that there has

470
00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:52.380
never been a system of production in the history of the world that was as

471
00:39:52.381 --> 00:39:57.310
effective at producing material commodities in excess than capitalism.

472
00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:02.110
Like that's,
that's extensively documented in the communist manifesto.

473
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.480
And so if your proposition is,
look,

474
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:09.100
we got to get as much material security for everyone as we as,

475
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:11.380
as possible,
as fast as we can.

476
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.430
And capitalism already seems to be doing that at a rate that's unparalleled in

477
00:40:15.431 --> 00:40:19.390
human history within the logical thing be just to let the damn system play

478
00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:20.590
itself out.
I mean,

479
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:25.000
unless you're assuming that the evil capitalists are just going to take all of

480
00:40:25.001 --> 00:40:29.830
the flat screen televisions and put them in one big room and not let anyone else

481
00:40:29.831 --> 00:40:30.664
have one,

482
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.990
the logical assumption is that while you're already on a road that's supposed to

483
00:40:34.991 --> 00:40:38.320
produce the proper material productivity,
and so,

484
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:41.350
well that's 10 reasons as far as I can tell that.

485
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.310
And so what I saw in that did that that the communist manifesto is,

486
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:50.080
is like seriously flawed in,
in virtually every way it could possibly be flawed.

487
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:54.850
And also all in an in an um,
uh,

488
00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:00.480
evidence that Marx was the kind of narcissistic thinker who could think he was,

489
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:07.270
he was very intelligent person.
And so it was angles,
but what he thought,

490
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.770
what he thought when he thought was that what he thought was correct and he

491
00:41:11.771 --> 00:41:14.920
never went the second stage,
which is,
wait a second,

492
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.910
how could all of this go terribly wrong?

493
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.680
And if you're a thinker,

494
00:41:20.681 --> 00:41:24.750
especially a sociological thinker especially I think are on the broad scale as a

495
00:41:24.751 --> 00:41:29.350
social scientist,
for example,
one of your moral obligations is to think,
you know,

496
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:34.220
you might be wrong about one of your fundamental axioms or two or three 10 and

497
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:39.400
as a consequence you have the moral obligation to walk through the dam system

498
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:42.410
and think,
well what if I'm completely wrong here?

499
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:46.070
And things in divert and go exactly the wrong way.
Like I can't,

500
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.640
I just can't understand how anybody could come up with an idea like the

501
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:51.350
dictatorship of the proletariat,

502
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.560
especially after advocating it's implementation for with violent means,

503
00:41:56.991 --> 00:41:59.030
which is a direct part of the communist manifesto.

504
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.630
And actually think if they were thinking,

505
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:07.400
if they knew anything about human beings and the proclivity for malevolence,

506
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.690
that's part and parcel of the individual human being that that could do anything

507
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.830
but lead to a special form of hell,
which is precisely what did happen.

508
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:19.610
And so I'm going to close because I have three minutes with,

509
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.470
with a bit of evidence as well,
that

510
00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:30.770
Mark's also thought that what would happen inevitably as a consequence of

511
00:42:30.771 --> 00:42:34.640
capitalism is that rich would get richer and the poor would get poorer.

512
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.230
So there would be inequality.

513
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.280
The first thing I'd like to say is we do not know how to set up a human system

514
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.520
of economics without inequality.
No one has ever managed it,

515
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:48.470
including the communists.
And the form of inequality changed.

516
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:52.640
And it's not obvious by any stretch of imagination that the free market

517
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:57.620
economies of the West have more inequality than the less free economy is in the

518
00:42:57.621 --> 00:42:58.460
rest of the world.

519
00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:02.000
And the one thing you can say about capitalism is that although it produces

520
00:43:02.001 --> 00:43:05.600
inequality,
which it absolutely does,
it also produces wealth.

521
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.500
And all the other systems don't.
They just produce inequality.

522
00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:14.580
<v 0>[inaudible] so</v>

523
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:22.390
<v 2>here's,
here's a few stats.
Here's a few free market stats.
Okay.
Um,</v>

524
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.010
from 1800 to 2017,

525
00:43:25.011 --> 00:43:29.830
income growth adjusted for inflation grew by 40 times for production workers in

526
00:43:29.831 --> 00:43:34.130
16 times for unskilled labor.
Um,
well,

527
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:39.131
GDP fact GDP rose by a factor of about 0.5 from one 80 to 1800.

528
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:44.810
So from 180880980,
it was like nothing flat.

529
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.010
And then all of a sudden in the last 217 years,

530
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:51.830
there's been this unbelievably upward movement of wealth.

531
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:56.450
And it doesn't only characterize the tiny percentage of people at the top who

532
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:59.000
admittedly do have most of the wealth.

533
00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:02.840
The question is not only though what's the inequality,
the question is,
well,

534
00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:05.390
what's happening to the absolutely poor at the bottom?

535
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.410
And answer to that is they are getting richer faster now than they ever have in

536
00:44:09.411 --> 00:44:12.380
the history of the world.
And we're eradicating poverty

537
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:18.400
in countries that have adopted moderate free market policies at a rate that's

538
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.920
unparalleled.
So here's an example.
The UN millennial,

539
00:44:21.921 --> 00:44:24.470
what are the UN millennial goals too,
was to reduce the,

540
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:29.740
the rate of absolute poverty in the world by 50% between 2000 and 2015 and they

541
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:34.050
define as a dollar 90 a day,
pretty low,
you know,
uh,

542
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:38.820
but you have to start somewhere.
Um,
we beat,
we hit that at 2012,

543
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.390
three years ahead of schedule.
And you might be cynical about that and say,
well,

544
00:44:42.391 --> 00:44:43.650
it's kind of an arbitrary number,

545
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:48.800
but the curves are exactly the same at $3 and $83 and 80 cents a day at $7 and

546
00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:51.480
60 cents a day.
Not as many people have hit that,

547
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:54.060
but the rate of increase towards that as the same,

548
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.830
the bloody u n thanks that will be out of poverty defined by a dollar 90 a day

549
00:44:58.831 --> 00:45:02.760
by the year 2030.
It's unparalleled.
And so,
so the,

550
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.200
so the rich may be getting Richard,
but the poor are getting rich or too,
that's,

551
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:10.730
that's not the look,
I'll leave it at that.
Um,

552
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.150
because I'm out of time.
But one of the,
I'll leave it with this,
um,

553
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.280
the poor are not getting poor under capitalism.

554
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.810
The poor are getting richer under capitalism by a large margin.

555
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.640
And I'll leave you with one statistic,
which is that now,
um,

556
00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.620
in in Africa,

557
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:39.180
the child mortality rate in Africa now is the same as the child mortality rate

558
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.530
was in Europe in 1952.
And so that's happened within the span of one lifetime.

559
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.710
And so if you're for the poor,
if you're for the poor,

560
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:51.210
if you're actually concerned that the poorest people in the world rise above

561
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.700
their starvation levels,
then the,

562
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.120
all the evidence suggests that the best way to do that is to implement something

563
00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:59.610
approximating a free market economy.
And so

564
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.730
<v 0>thank you very much.</v>

565
00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:05.740
[inaudible]

566
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:17.120
<v 3>thank you,
Dr. Peterson.
Dr G,
Jake.
Thank you.</v>

567
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:22.900
<v 0>[inaudible] okay.</v>

568
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:33.703
First,

569
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.500
<v 3>a brief introductory remark.
I cannot,</v>

570
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:42.501
but notice the irony of how Peter [inaudible] the participants in this UL of the

571
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.200
century are both marginalized by the official academic community.

572
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:54.440
I'm supposed to defend here the left liberal line against neoconservative.

573
00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.470
Really,
most of the attacks on me,

574
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.990
I don't know precisely from left liberals.

575
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:06.260
Just remember the outcry against my critique of LGBT plus ideology and time.

576
00:47:08.011 --> 00:47:12.450
Sure.
That if the leading figures in the field ready to be asked,

577
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:14.760
if I even feet to stand for them,

578
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:18.500
they will turn in their grave even if they're still alive.

579
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:25.270
So let me begin by bringing together the three notions from the title happiness,

580
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:31.060
communism,
capitalism in one exemplary case,

581
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.680
China today,

582
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.980
China in the last decades is arguably the greatest economic success story in

583
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:40.060
human history.

584
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.480
Can't reach of millions raised from poverty into middle class existence.

585
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.880
How did trying to achieve it?

586
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:54.330
The 20th century left was defined by its opposition to the two fundamental

587
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:56.560
tendencies of modernity,

588
00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:00.790
the reign of capital we teach aggressive market competition,

589
00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.880
the authoritarian bureaucratic state power.

590
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.120
Today's China combines these two features in each extreme forum,

591
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:14.200
strong,
authoritarian state,
state,
wild capitalists dynamics,

592
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:19.330
and it's important to note they do it on behalf of cattiness.

593
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.830
Of the majority of people,

594
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:24.760
they don't mention communism to legitimize their rule.

595
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:29.970
They prefer the old [inaudible] notion of a harmonious society.

596
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.880
But are the Chinese any happier for all that?

597
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.520
Although even the Dalai Lama justifies Tibetan Buddhism in Western terms of the

598
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.160
pursuit of happiness and the avoidance of pain.

599
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:49.690
Happiness as a goal of our life is very problematic notion.

600
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.110
If we learned anything from psycho analysis,

601
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:58.440
it is that we humans are very creative in sabotaging our pursuit of happiness.

602
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:04.120
Happiness is a confused notion.
Basically,

603
00:49:04.121 --> 00:49:09.121
it relies on the subject in ability or unreadiness to fully confront the

604
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:13.500
consequences of his shirt,

605
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:16.240
their desire in our daily lives.

606
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:21.360
We pretend to desire things which we don't not really desire,

607
00:49:21.521 --> 00:49:26.521
so that ultimately the worst thing that can happen is for us to get what we

608
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.140
officially desire.

609
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.920
So I agreed that human life of freedom and dignity does not consist Justin

610
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.940
searching for happiness.

611
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:42.150
No matter how much we spiritualize it or in the effort to actualize our inner

612
00:49:43.211 --> 00:49:44.110
potentials,

613
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:49.230
we have to find some meaningful cause beyond the mural struggle for pleasurable

614
00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.710
survival.
However,
I would like to add here a couple of

615
00:49:56.170 --> 00:50:00.430
qualifications.
First,
since we live in a modern era,

616
00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:05.610
we cannot simply refer to an unquestionable authority to confer emission or

617
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:11.410
tasks on us.
Modernity means that yes,
we should carry the burden,

618
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.990
but the main burden is freedom itself.

619
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:16.900
We are responsible for our burdens.

620
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:22.380
Not only are we not allowed trip excuses for not doing our duty.

621
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.860
Duty itself should not serve as an excuse.

622
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.520
We are never blessed instrument of some higher cause.

623
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:37.190
Once traditional authority loses its substantial power,

624
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.830
it is not possible to return to eat.

625
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.790
All such returns are today a postmodern fake.

626
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.900
Does Donald Trump stand for traditional values?
No,

627
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:51.410
he's conservativism is the postmodern performance.

628
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:56.650
I began tick ego trip in this sense of playing with traditional values of mixing

629
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:02.210
references to them with open obscenities.

630
00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:05.600
Trump is the ultimate postmodern president.

631
00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:09.380
If we compare Trump with Bernie Sanders,

632
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:13.160
Trump is the postmodern politician at its purest.

633
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:16.610
While senders is rather an old fashioned moralist,

634
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:22.450
conservative thinkers claim that the origin of our crisis is the loss of our

635
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:29.080
reliance on some transcendent divinity or higher value if we are left to

636
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:34.580
ourselves.
If everything is historically conditioned and relative,

637
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.680
then there is nothing preventing us to indulge in our lowest tendencies.

638
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:44.330
But is this really the lesson to be learned from mob killing,

639
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.320
looting,
and burning on behalf of religion?

640
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.800
It is often claimed that true or not religion make some otherwise bad people do

641
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:57.950
good things from today's experience.

642
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.870
I think we should rather stick to Steve Weinberg claim that while without

643
00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:07.820
religion,
good people would have been doing good things and the bad people,

644
00:52:07.821 --> 00:52:08.810
bad things.

645
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:13.940
Only something like religion can make good people do bad things.

646
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:20.110
More than a century ago in his brothers Karamazov Dostoyevsky warned against the

647
00:52:21.501 --> 00:52:25.550
dangers of godless,
godless moral mutualism.

648
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.820
If God doesn't exist,
then everything is permitted.

649
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:34.330
The French philosopher and Glucksman applied the stair skis critique of a

650
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:41.200
godless myths Elysium to September 11th and the title of his Book Dostoyevsky in

651
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:46.610
Manhattan suggest that as the title suggests,

652
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.290
he couldn't have been more wrong.

653
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:53.030
The lesson of today's terrorism is that if there is a god,

654
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:58.240
then everything even blowing up hundreds of innocent bystanders is permitted to

655
00:52:59.211 --> 00:53:03.800
those who claim to act directly on behalf of God.

656
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:08.690
The same ghosts also for Godless,
Stalinists Communist.

657
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.550
They are the ultimate proof of it.

658
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:15.880
Everything was permitted to them since they perceived themselves as direct

659
00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.320
instrument of their divinity,

660
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:23.210
of the historical necessity of progress towards communism.

661
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.120
That's the big problem of radiologists.
How to make good,

662
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:31.170
decent people do horrible things.
Second,
yes,

663
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:35.490
we should carry our burden.
Accept the suffering that goes with it,

664
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.480
but a danger lurks here that have a subtle reversal.

665
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:44.010
Don't fall in love,
that might position with your suffering.

666
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:47.250
Never presumed that your suffering is in itself.

667
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:52.520
A proof of your authenticity and Annunciation of pleasure can easily turn into

668
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:58.620
pleasure of renunciation itself.
For example,

669
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:00.450
an example not from New York,

670
00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:05.451
conservative white left liberals love to denigrate their own culture and blame

671
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.390
Eurocentrism for our evils,

672
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:14.810
but it is instantly clear how this self denigration brings a profit of its own

673
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:18.390
through this renouncing

674
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:22.410
of their particular routes.

675
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.950
Multicultural liberals reserved for themselves,

676
00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:31.040
the universal position graciously soliciting other's to assert their particular

677
00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:32.723
identity.

678
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:37.800
White multiculturalists liberals embodied the lie of identity politics.

679
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.233
Next point.

680
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:45.050
Zach LACOE wrote something paradoxical but deeply true that even if what,

681
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.250
uh,
a jealous husband claims about his,

682
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.090
about his wife,

683
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.420
that she sleeps with other men is all true.

684
00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.480
His jealousy is nonetheless pathological.

685
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:06.050
The Palette pathological element is the husband's neat for glog is the only way

686
00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.000
for him to sustain his identity.
Along the same lines,

687
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:17.070
one could say that even if most of the Nazi claims about goose,

688
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.770
they exploited gentleman's,

689
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:24.780
they should use German girls and so on where through which they were not of

690
00:55:24.781 --> 00:55:29.781
course that antisemitism would still be pathological phenomenon because it

691
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:36.500
ignored the true reason why the Nazis need that antisemitism in the Nazi vision.

692
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:43.220
Their society is an organic whole of harmonious collaboration,

693
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:48.890
so an external intruder is needed to account for divisions and antagonisms.

694
00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:55.490
The same holds for how today in Europe at least the anti-immigrant populists

695
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.500
deal with the refugees.
The cost of problems we clarify,

696
00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:04.540
I claim imminent to today's global capitalism is projected onto an external

697
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.140
intruder.
Again,

698
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:12.290
even if the reported incident with the refugees that are great problems.

699
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:16.620
I admitted even all these reports are true.

700
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:21.920
The published story about them is alive with antisemitism.

701
00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:25.810
We are the topic of telling stories.

702
00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:30.640
Hit Hitler was one of the greatest storytellers of the 20th century.

703
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:32.440
In the 1920s

704
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:38.320
many Germans experienced their situation as a confused mess.

705
00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.240
They didn't understand what is happening to them with military defeat,

706
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:47.260
economic crisis,
what they perceived as moral decay and so on.

707
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.440
She provided a story,
a plot,

708
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:53.590
which was precisely that of a Jewish plot.

709
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.110
We are in this mess because of the juice.

710
00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.320
That's what I would like to insist on.

711
00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:04.350
We are telling ourselves stories about ourselves in order to acquire a

712
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:09.730
meaningful experience of our lives.
However,
this is not enough.

713
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:13.960
One of the most stupid wisdoms and they are mostly stupid,

714
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:18.990
is an enemy is someone who's story you have not hurt.

715
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:26.070
Really they is is are you also ready to affirm that Hitler was our enemy because

716
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:30.430
he story was not hurt.

717
00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:35.940
The experience that we have of our lives from within the story we tell ourselves

718
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:41.890
about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing is,

719
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.490
and this is what I call it,
theology,
fundamentally a lie.

720
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:50.680
The truth lies outside in what we do.
In a similar way,

721
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:55.950
the old trite obsession with cultural Marxism expresses the rejection to

722
00:57:58.271 --> 00:58:03.271
confront the fact that the phenomena they criticize as the effect of the

723
00:58:04.691 --> 00:58:08.890
cultural Marxist plot,
moral degradation,
sexual promiscuity,

724
00:58:08.891 --> 00:58:13.891
consumers had an aneurysm and so on are the outcome of the imminent dynamic of

725
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:18.100
capitalist societies.

726
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:23.730
I would like to refer to a classic Danielle Bell cultural contradictions of

727
00:58:24.071 --> 00:58:29.071
capitalism written back in 1976 where the author argues that the unbounded,

728
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:35.670
the drive of modern capitalism undermines the moral foundations of the original

729
00:58:35.951 --> 00:58:40.951
Protestant ethics and in the new afterwards they'll offers embracing perspective

730
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:45.100
on contemporary Western societies.

731
00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:50.340
Revealing the crucial cultural fault lines we face as the 21st century is here.

732
00:58:55.030 --> 00:59:00.030
The turn toward sculpture is a key component of capitalist reproduction and

733
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:01.690
concomitant to eat.

734
00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:06.900
The commodification of cultural life itself are I think crucial moments of

735
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.240
capitalists,
expanded reproduction.

736
00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:13.030
So the term cultural Marxism,

737
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:18.300
I think plays the same role as that of the Jewish plot in antisemitism it

738
00:59:19.391 --> 00:59:24.310
projects or can supposedly some [inaudible].

739
00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:28.490
I'm Taco Neesan,
however you call it,
ambiguity,

740
00:59:28.491 --> 00:59:33.491
tension of our social economic life on an external costs in exactly the same

741
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:39.230
way.
Now let me tell you a different,
give you a different model.

742
00:59:39.231 --> 00:59:44.231
Problematic example in exactly the same way liberal critics of Trump and

743
00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:51.530
outright never seriously asked how our liberal society could give birth to

744
00:59:52.671 --> 00:59:54.140
Trump.
In this sense,

745
00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:57.850
the image of Donald Trump is also a fetish.

746
00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:03.370
The last think illiberal sees before confronting actual social tangents.

747
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.630
Hegel's motto,
evil resides in the gaze,
which is evil.

748
01:00:08.631 --> 01:00:10.760
Everywhere fully applies here.

749
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:16.030
The very liberal gaze with demonizes Trump is also evil because it ignores how

750
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.960
its own failures opened up the space for Trump stype of patriotic populism.

751
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.850
Next point,
one,

752
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:33.620
stop blaming head on East EquityZen for our worlds,

753
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.790
the true opposite of equities.
Shelflife is not altruism,

754
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.620
a concern for the common good,
but envy,
resentment,

755
01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.980
which makes me act against my own interest.

756
01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:51.460
This is why as many perspicuous to philosophers clearly saw evil is profoundly

757
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:56.480
spiritual in some sense,
more spiritual than goodness.

758
01:00:56.810 --> 01:01:01.810
This is why egalitarianisms itself should never be accepted at its face value.

759
01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.440
It can well secretly envelop the standard renunciation accomplished to benefit

760
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:11.563
others.

761
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:16.850
Egalitarianism often facto means I am ready to renounce something so that others

762
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:22.490
will also not habit.
This is,

763
01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:26.870
I think now comes the problematic part for some of you may be the problem with

764
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:30.890
political correctness.
What appears as it's excesses,

765
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:36.130
it's regulatory zeal is I think an impotent reaction to that masks the reality

766
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.170
of a defeat.
My hero is here,
a black lady,
Tirana Burke,

767
01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:46.550
who created the me too campaign more than a decade ago.

768
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:52.060
She observed in a recent critical note debt in the years since the movement

769
01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:53.960
began.
It deployed.

770
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:59.290
An unwavering obsession with the perpetrators meet too is all too often

771
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:04.160
adrenaline protests filtered through resentment.

772
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:07.760
Should we then drop egalitarianism?
No.

773
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:11.390
Equality can also mean and that's the quality.

774
01:02:11.391 --> 01:02:16.391
I advocate creating the space for as many as possible individuals to develop

775
01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:22.080
their different potentials.
It is that my paradoxical claim,

776
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.640
if this today's capitalism that equalizes us to mark and causes the loss of many

777
01:02:29.521 --> 01:02:30.354
talents,

778
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:35.630
so what about the balance between equality and he did we really move too much in

779
01:02:36.151 --> 01:02:37.560
the direction of equality?

780
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.880
Is there in today's United States really too much equality?

781
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:47.570
I think a simple overview of the situation points in the opposite direction far

782
01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:49.830
from pushing us too far.

783
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:54.510
The left is gradually losing its ground already for decades.

784
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.130
It's trademarks,
universal healthcare,

785
01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.200
free education and so on are continuously diminished.

786
01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:05.220
Look at Bernie Sanders in that don't idealize him program.

787
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:06.780
It is just

788
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.400
a version of what half a century ago in Europe was simply the predominant social

789
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:20.870
democracy and it's today decried as a threat to our freedoms to the American way

790
01:03:21.661 --> 01:03:23.280
of life and shown and so on.

791
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.860
I see no threat in two free creativity in this program.

792
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.880
On the contrary,

793
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:35.030
I see healthcare and education and so on as enabling me to focus my life on more

794
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:41.610
important creative issues.
I see equality,

795
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:46.790
this basic equality of transition as a space for creating differentiation and

796
01:03:48.331 --> 01:03:52.740
yes,
why not even different,
more appropriate here,

797
01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.810
Cheryl,
he's furthermore,

798
01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:00.020
I find it very hard to ground today's inequalities as they are documented.

799
01:04:00.811 --> 01:04:04.680
For example,
by Piketty in his book on

800
01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:11.280
to ground today's inequalities in different competencies.

801
01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:16.460
Competencies for what in totalitarian states competencies are determined

802
01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:17.604
politically,

803
01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:22.440
but market success is also not innocent and neutral.

804
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:26.670
As a regulator of the social recognition of competencies,

805
01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:31.090
let me know briefly deal
with uh,

806
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:32.550
in a friendly way.

807
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:37.551
I claim with what became known story for the irony is the lobster topic.

808
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.530
I'm far from a simple social construction is in here.

809
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.580
I deeply appreciate evolutionary thought.
Of course,

810
01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:52.230
we are also natural beings and our DNA,

811
01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:53.850
as we all know,
overlaps.

812
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:58.380
I may be wrong around 98% with debt of some monkeys.

813
01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:03.750
This means something,
but nature,
I think we should never forget,

814
01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:07.650
this is not a stable hierarchical system,

815
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:09.540
but full of improvisations.

816
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.870
It develops like French cuisine.

817
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.680
A French guy gave me this idea that French,

818
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:22.270
the origin of many famous French deeply or drinks is that when they wanted to

819
01:05:22.871 --> 01:05:26.830
produce a standard piece of food or drink,
something went wrong,

820
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:31.480
but then they realize that this trailer can be resold as success.

821
01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:34.300
They were making cheese in the usual way,

822
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:39.640
but the trees got rotten and infect that smelling bad and they said,

823
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:40.600
oh my God,
look,

824
01:05:40.601 --> 01:05:45.601
we have our own original French trees or they were making wine in the usual way.

825
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.460
Then something went wrong with fermentations and so they began to produce some

826
01:05:51.461 --> 01:05:52.900
pain and so on and so on.

827
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:58.170
I am not making just a joke here because I think that it is exactly like this,

828
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:04.561
that and that's the lessons of psycho analysis that our sexuality works.

829
01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:09.520
Sexual instincts are of course biologically determined,

830
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:13.180
but look what we humans made out of them.

831
01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:18.160
They are not limited to the mating season.

832
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:23.020
They can develop in a permanent up into a permanent obsession,

833
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:28.170
sustained by obstacles that demand to be overcome in short into appropriately

834
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:33.620
metaphysical passion that perturbs the biological rhythm with twitch,

835
01:06:33.621 --> 01:06:37.510
like endlessly prolonged in satisfaction in courtly love,

836
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:42.280
engaging in different perversions and so on and so on.
So it still,

837
01:06:42.281 --> 01:06:46.330
yes,
biologically conditioned sexuality,
but it is,

838
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.690
if I may use this term trans functionalized,

839
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:54.040
it becomes a moment of a different cultural,

840
01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:58.990
however you call it,
logic and I claim the same goes for tradition.
DSL,

841
01:06:58.991 --> 01:07:01.780
yet the great conservative route pope.

842
01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:06.790
What happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens

843
01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.500
simultaneously to all the work of art which preceded it.

844
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:17.100
The past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by

845
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:20.590
the past and have quote,
what does this mean?

846
01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.870
Let me mention the change enacted by Christianity.

847
01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.730
It's not just that in spite of all our natural and cultural differences,

848
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:33.880
the same divine spark dwells in everyone,

849
01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:39.180
but this divine spark enables us to create what Christians Call Holy Ghost or

850
01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:40.480
Holy Spirit.

851
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:45.730
A community in which he had our family values are at some level at least

852
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.990
abolished.
Remember Paul's words from Galatians.

853
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:52.090
There is no longer Jew or Greek.

854
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.480
There is no longer male and female in Christ.

855
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:59.890
A democracy extends this logic to the political space.

856
01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.650
In spite of all differentiation in competence,

857
01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:05.860
the ultimate decision should stay with all of us.

858
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.720
The wager of democracy is that we should not give all power to competent

859
01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:11.613
experts.

860
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.620
It was precisely communist in power who legitimize that rule by posing fake

861
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:21.130
experts.
And incidentally,

862
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:25.970
I'm far from believing in ordinary people's wisdom.

863
01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:31.210
We often need a master figure to push us out of an inertia,

864
01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:38.290
and I am not afraid to say that forces us to be free.

865
01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.780
Freedom and responsibility hurt that required an effort and the highest function

866
01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:49.210
of an authentic master is to literally to awaken us to our freedom.

867
01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:54.800
We are not spontaneously really three.
Furthermore think,

868
01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:01.520
I think that social power and authority cannot be directly grounded in

869
01:09:01.521 --> 01:09:03.920
competence in our human universe.

870
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:09.070
Power in the sense of exerting authority is something much more mysterious.

871
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:12.440
Even irrational Kierkegaard,

872
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:16.670
my and everybody's favorite theologist wrote,

873
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:22.240
if a child says he [inaudible] his father because his father is a con competent

874
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.660
and good guy.

875
01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:29.380
This is an affront to father's authority and he applied the same logic to Christ

876
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:32.743
himself.

877
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.010
Christ was justified by the fact of being got son,

878
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.980
not by his competencies or capacities as Kierkegaard put it.

879
01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:46.190
Every good student of theology can put things better than Christ.

880
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:50.180
This there is no such authority in nature.

881
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:53.930
Lobsters may have Cheryl,
he undoubtedly,

882
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.390
but the main guy among them,

883
01:09:56.690 --> 01:10:01.040
I don't think he has authority in the sense,
again,

884
01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:04.820
the wager of democracy is that and that's the subtle thing,

885
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:07.850
not against competence and so on,

886
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:13.030
but that political power and competence or expertise should be kept apart in

887
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:16.430
Stalinism.
Precisely.

888
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:20.120
They were not kept apart while already in ancient Greece.

889
01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.860
They knew that they have to be kept apart,
which is why they're popular.

890
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:27.920
Weight was even combined with Lateri often,

891
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:33.380
so where does communism,
just to conclude,
where does communism enter here?

892
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:38.720
Why do I still cling to this first name?

893
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:43.990
When I know in fully admit the 20th century Communist project in all its

894
01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:44.930
failure,

895
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:49.930
how it failed giving birth to new forms of murderous terror capitalism one but

896
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.960
today and that's my claim,
we can debate about it.

897
01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:59.230
The question is that's today's global capitalism contained strong enough

898
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.310
antagonisms which prevent it's indefinite reproduction.

899
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:09.640
I think there are such antagonisms the threat of ecological catastrophe,

900
01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:16.650
the consequence of new techno scientific developments,

901
01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:21.340
especially in viral genetics and new forms of apart,
apart,
right?

902
01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:26.040
All this antagonism is concerned what Marx called Commons,

903
01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:31.130
the sheriff substance of our social big first of course the common of external

904
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.310
nature,
threatened by pollution,
global warming and so on.

905
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.140
Now let me be precise here.

906
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.440
I am well aware of how uncertain analysis and projections are in this domain.

907
01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:52.010
It will be certain only when it will be too late and I am well aware of the

908
01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:56.340
temptation to engage in precipitous extrapolations.

909
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:59.340
When I was younger.
To give you a critical example,

910
01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:02.870
there was in Germany and obsession with Val Starobin,

911
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:07.440
the dying of forest with predictions debt in a couple of decades.

912
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:11.580
Europe will be without forests,
but according to recent estimates,

913
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:16.820
there are now more forest areas in Europe then 100 years or 50 years ago.

914
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:22.980
But there is nonetheless,
I claim the prospect of a catastrophe here.

915
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.400
Scientific data seemed to me at least abandoned enough and we should act in a

916
01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:31.650
large scale collective way.

917
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:36.030
And I also think this may be critical to some of you.

918
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:38.370
There is a problem with capitalism,

919
01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:43.410
care for the simple reason that it's managers not because of data evil nature,

920
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.320
but that's the logic of capitalism.

921
01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:51.770
Care to expand self reproduction and environmental consequences are simply not

922
01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:54.390
part of the game.

923
01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:59.780
This is again not a moral reproach in incidentally so that you will not think

924
01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:03.570
that I don't know what I'm talking about.
In Communist countries,

925
01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:08.580
those empower were obsessed with expanded pre production and we're not under

926
01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:12.120
public control.
So the situation was even worse.

927
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:16.080
So how to act first by admitting we are in a deep mass.

928
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.020
There is no simple democratic solution here.

929
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:24.410
The idea that people themselves should decide what to do about ecology sounds

930
01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:26.460
deep,

931
01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.810
but it backs an important question even with their comprehension is not

932
01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:32.850
distorted by corporate interests.

933
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.860
What qualifies them to pass a judgment in such a delicate matter?

934
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.460
Plus the radical measures advocated by some ecologists can themselves trigger

935
01:13:45.361 --> 01:13:46.620
new catastrophes.

936
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:51.870
Let me mention just the idea which is floating around of solar radiation

937
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:52.763
management.

938
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.040
The continuous massive dispersal of Iris falls into our atmosphere to reflect

939
01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.960
and absorb sunlight and that's cool.
The planet.

940
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:10.100
Can we even imagine how the fragile balance of our earth function and in what

941
01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:15.810
unpredictable ways geo engineering can disturb eat in such times of urgently

942
01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:22.510
when we know we have to act but don't know how to act.
Thinking is needed.

943
01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:26.260
Maybe we should turn around a little bit.

944
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:31.470
Mark famous physics 11 in that in our new century we should say that maybe in

945
01:14:35.261 --> 01:14:39.340
the last century we tried all too fast to change the world.

946
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:42.760
The time has come to step back and interpreted.

947
01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:44.620
The second threat,

948
01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:49.690
the Commons of internal nature with new biogenetic technologist,

949
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:54.580
the creation of a new man in the literal sense of changing human nature becomes

950
01:14:54.581 --> 01:14:55.870
a realistic prospect.

951
01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.200
I mean primarily so-called popularly link the direct link between our brain and

952
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:08.170
digital machines and then brains among themselves.

953
01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.300
This I think is the true game changer.

954
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:13.960
The digitalization of our brain opens up.

955
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:18.990
I'm hurt of new possibilities of control directly sharing your experience with

956
01:15:19.631 --> 01:15:22.000
your beloved may appear attractive,

957
01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:26.980
but what about chatting them with an agency without you even knowing it?

958
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:30.760
Finally,
the common space of humanity itself.

959
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:36.030
We live in one in the same world which is more and more interconnected but

960
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000
nonetheless deeply divided so how to react to this.

961
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:46.900
The first and sadly predominant reaction is the one of protective self
enclosure.

962
01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:49.480
The world out there is in a mess.

963
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.720
Let's protect ourselves by all kinds of walls.

964
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:58.150
It seems that our countries are around relatively well but is the mess.

965
01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:03.900
The so called ropes countries find themselves in not connected to how we

966
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:06.940
interact with them.

967
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:12.300
Take what is perhaps the ultimate rogue state Kongo warlords who rule province

968
01:16:13.251 --> 01:16:18.251
is there are always dealing with Western companies selling them minerals.

969
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:23.790
Where would our computers be without Colton from Congo and mark about foreign

970
01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:28.981
intervention in Iraq and Syria or by our proxies like Saudi Arabia in Yemen.

971
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.640
Here refugees are created a new work order is emerging world of can I just

972
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:40.150
finish the page?
Two minutes.

973
01:16:40.210 --> 01:16:45.210
Literally a world of peaceful coexistence of civilizations,

974
01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.040
but in what way does he traction?

975
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:52.300
Forced marriages and homophobic homophobia are okay.

976
01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.890
Just that they are really limited,

977
01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:58.980
limited to another country which is otherwise fully included into the world

978
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.240
market.
This is how refugees again are created.

979
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.920
The secondary action is global capitalism with a human face.

980
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:14.290
Think about socially responsible corporate figures like Bill Gates or George

981
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.470
Sorrows.
They passionately support LGBT.

982
01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:23.030
They advocate clarity and Chavon,
but even in the extreme forum,

983
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:28.040
opening up our borders to refugees,
treating them like one of us,

984
01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:33.700
they only provide what is made between what in medicine is called a symptomatic

985
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:35.323
treatment.

986
01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:40.010
This solution is not for [inaudible] Western countries to receive all

987
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.903
immigrants,

988
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:46.120
but somehow to try to change the situation which creates massive waves of

989
01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:48.530
immigration and

990
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:51.000
<v 0>we are completely in.
This</v>

991
01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:54.610
is such a change,

992
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.950
<v 3>a utopia.
No,</v>

993
01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:01.900
that through your Tapia is that we can survive without subject change.

994
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:07.060
So here I think,
I know it's provocative to call this a bleed.

995
01:18:07.061 --> 01:18:11.100
Bar Communism.
I do eat a little bit to provoke things,

996
01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:15.520
but what is needed is nonetheless in all these fears,

997
01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:18.790
I claim a call,
Oh gee,
did you tell control

998
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:25.140
you need to have a capitalist market,

999
01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.200
which does great think I admitted have to be somehow limit that,

1000
01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:35.790
regulate that and so on.
Before you say it's a utopia,

1001
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:36.960
I will tell you,

1002
01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:42.170
but let's think about in what way global market already fund clings to date.

1003
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:46.300
I always thought that neoliberalism is a fake term.

1004
01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:47.940
If you look closely,

1005
01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:53.090
you will see that state place today more important role than ever precisely in

1006
01:18:54.151 --> 01:18:57.360
the capitalist economy.

1007
01:18:58.170 --> 01:19:01.710
So you know the market is already limited,

1008
01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:04.540
but not in the right way to put it nicely.

1009
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:09.830
So especially means to conclusion what will happen in spite of protest here and

1010
01:19:09.991 --> 01:19:10.824
there.

1011
01:19:11.010 --> 01:19:16.010
We will probably continue to fly to or some kind of apocalypse awaiting large

1012
01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.050
catastrophes to awake enough.

1013
01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:24.290
So I don't accept any peep optimism when somebody tries to convince me that in

1014
01:19:24.601 --> 01:19:28.530
spite of all the problems that is a light at the end of the tunnel.

1015
01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.900
My instant reply.
Yes.

1016
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:35.310
And it's probably another train coming to work,
sir.
Thank you very much.

1017
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.360
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

1018
01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:01.750
<v 3>please don't do this because I really think that's my,</v>

1019
01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.720
I,
I hope you [inaudible] bet why we are here.

1020
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.800
Engage in this debate.

1021
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:12.470
Don't take it as a keep competition.
It may be debt,

1022
01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.300
but we are,
as you said in your introduction,

1023
01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:19.860
desperately trying to confront curious problems.

1024
01:20:20.890 --> 01:20:22.400
<v 0>I did.</v>

1025
01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:27.960
<v 3>What is junk food?
When I mentioned China,
China,</v>

1026
01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:32.700
I didn't mean to celebrated.
That worries me terribly.
My goat.

1027
01:20:32.701 --> 01:20:37.470
Is this our future?
No,
no.
Sorry.
Sorry for the story.

1028
01:20:37.471 --> 01:20:41.580
Please discount.
Take away this from my 10 minutes.
No,

1029
01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.100
no problem.
No problem.

1030
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:47.490
<v 4>That'd Peterson.
10 minutes to you to reply.</v>

1031
01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:54.643
<v 0>So</v>

1032
01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:59.740
<v 4>I like to speak extemporaneously,
but doctors Egx,
um,</v>

1033
01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:04.830
discussion was so complex that there's no way that I can juggle my responses

1034
01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.980
spontaneously,
so cheap.

1035
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:12.110
<v 3>Okay.
Yeah.
Well,
and,
and achievement managed,</v>

1036
01:21:12.111 --> 01:21:13.770
I would say.
Um,

1037
01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:16.600
<v 4>so,
so I heard much of,</v>

1038
01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.640
I heard much of what I heard I agreed with.
Um,
but we can get to that.
Um,

1039
01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:22.760
I'm going to respond

1040
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:26.610
<v 3>well,
I lived the knife.
All right.
All right,
well,
hi.</v>

1041
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.980
<v 4>I heard a criticism of capitalism,</v>

1042
01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:35.160
but no real supportive Marxism and,

1043
01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:39.480
and that's an interesting thing because for me,
the,
the terms of the argument,

1044
01:21:39.481 --> 01:21:43.470
we're of other,
the three terms of the argument,
let's say there was capitalism,

1045
01:21:43.471 --> 01:21:48.180
there was Marxism and there was happiness and I would say dark DJ focus probably

1046
01:21:48.181 --> 01:21:52.350
more on the problems of capitalism and the problems of happiness then on the

1047
01:21:52.351 --> 01:21:53.580
utility of Marxism.

1048
01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:57.990
And that actually comes as a surprise to me because I presume that much of what

1049
01:21:57.991 --> 01:22:02.991
I would hear would be a support of something approximating traditional or even a

1050
01:22:03.241 --> 01:22:07.200
traditional Marxism,
which is why I organized the first part of my talk

1051
01:22:07.450 --> 01:22:11.740
<v 3>as an attack against Marxism per se.
Okay.
So now she's here</v>

1052
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.040
<v 4>points out that there are problems of capitalism.</v>

1053
01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:18.540
And I would like to say that I'm perfectly aware that there are problems with

1054
01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:22.710
capitalism.
Um,
I wasn't defending capitalism actually.

1055
01:22:22.711 --> 01:22:25.980
In some sense I was defending it in comparison to communism,

1056
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:30.540
which is not the same thing because as Winston Churchill said about democracy,

1057
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.030
you know,

1058
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:34.500
it's the worst form of government there is except for all the other forms.

1059
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:39.090
And so you might say the same thing about capitalism is that it's the worst form

1060
01:22:39.091 --> 01:22:42.870
of economic arrangement you can possibly manage except for every other one that

1061
01:22:42.871 --> 01:22:46.170
we've ever tried.
And that,
and I'm dead serious about that.

1062
01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:50.190
I'm not trying to be flippant.
I mean that it isn't obvious to me.

1063
01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.310
And when doctors use jack is speaking in more apocalyptic terms,

1064
01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:58.110
it isn't obvious to me that we can solve the problems that confront us,
you know,

1065
01:22:58.111 --> 01:22:58.470
and it,

1066
01:22:58.470 --> 01:23:03.470
it's not also not a message that I have been purveying that unbridled capitalism

1067
01:23:04.741 --> 01:23:07.300
per se,
as an isolated,

1068
01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.500
what would you say social economic structure actually constitutes the proper

1069
01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:13.360
answer to the problems that confront us.

1070
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:17.320
So I haven't made that case in any of the lectures that I've,

1071
01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:20.500
anything I've written or any of the lectures that I've done because I don't

1072
01:23:20.501 --> 01:23:24.820
believe it to be true.
He said,
well,
what's the problems with capitalism?

1073
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:30.430
Well,
the commodification of cultural life,
all life,
fair enough.
Um,

1074
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:35.350
there's something that isn't exactly right about reducing everything to economic

1075
01:23:35.351 --> 01:23:39.730
competition and capitalism certainly pushes in that direction.

1076
01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.680
Advertising culture pushes in that direction.

1077
01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:45.250
Sales and marketing culture pushes in that direction and there's reasons for

1078
01:23:45.251 --> 01:23:45.461
that.

1079
01:23:45.461 --> 01:23:49.660
And I have a certain amount of admiration for the necessity of advertisers and

1080
01:23:49.661 --> 01:23:50.920
salesmen and marketers,

1081
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:54.790
but that doesn't mean that the transformation of all elements of life into

1082
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:55.300
element,

1083
01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:59.860
into commodities in a capitalist sense is the best way forward.

1084
01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.390
I don't think it is the best way forward.
Um,

1085
01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:07.030
I think the evidence for that is actually quite clear.
There is,
by the way,

1086
01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.610
a relationship,
this is something I didn't point out before.

1087
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:13.420
There is a relationship between wealth and happiness.

1088
01:24:13.690 --> 01:24:16.750
It's quite well defined in the psychological literature.
Now,

1089
01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:20.650
it's not exactly obvious whether the happiness measures are measures of

1090
01:24:20.651 --> 01:24:24.130
happiness or whether they're measures of the absence of misery.

1091
01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:28.480
And my sense is as a psychometrician who's looked at these scales that people

1092
01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:31.660
are more concerned with not being miserable than they are with being happy.

1093
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:33.950
And those are all actually separate,
uh,

1094
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.720
emotional states mediated by different psycho biological systems.

1095
01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:41.860
But it's a technical point but it's an important one.
The,

1096
01:24:41.861 --> 01:24:46.861
there is a relationship between absolute level of income and self reported,

1097
01:24:47.621 --> 01:24:51.940
lack of misery or happiness and it's pretty linear until you hit,

1098
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:56.560
I would say something approximating decent working class income.

1099
01:24:56.950 --> 01:25:01.950
And so what seems to happen is that wealth makes you happy as long as it keeps

1100
01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:04.420
the bill collectors at bay.

1101
01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:09.480
Like once you've got to the point where the misery is staved off as much as it

1102
01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:15.271
can be by the fact that you're not absolutely in your not in absolutely

1103
01:25:16.031 --> 01:25:17.800
economically dire straights,

1104
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:21.850
then adding more money to your life has no relationship whatsoever to your

1105
01:25:21.851 --> 01:25:25.930
wellbeing.
And so it's clear that past a certain minimal point,

1106
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:31.590
additional material provision is not sufficient to let's say redeem us

1107
01:25:31.721 --> 01:25:32.890
individually or socially.

1108
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:38.130
And it's certainly the case that the radical wealth production that

1109
01:25:39.521 --> 01:25:44.521
characterizes capitalism might produce a fatal threat to the structure of our

1110
01:25:46.151 --> 01:25:49.450
social systems and our broader ecosystems.
Who knows?

1111
01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:53.200
I'm not absolutely convinced of that for a variety of reasons.
I mean,

1112
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:55.240
Jack pointed out,
for example,

1113
01:25:55.241 --> 01:25:58.870
that there are more forests in Europe now than there were a hundred years ago.

1114
01:25:58.871 --> 01:26:02.620
There's actually more forest in the entire northern hemisphere than there were a

1115
01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.400
hundred years ago.
And the news on the ecological

1116
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.400
<v 2>front is not as dismal as the people who put out the most dismal news would have</v>

1117
01:26:09.771 --> 01:26:12.050
you think.
And there is some possibility.

1118
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:17.030
That doesn't mean that there aren't elements of it that are dismal.
You know,

1119
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:21.030
what we've done to the oceans is definitely something catastrophic and we,

1120
01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:22.580
we definitely have our problems,

1121
01:26:22.581 --> 01:26:26.360
but it is possible that human ingenuity might solve that.
Um,

1122
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:30.200
what else?
There are inequalities generated by capitalism,

1123
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:34.900
a proclivity towards a shallow materialism,
the probability of corruption.
Um,

1124
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:38.850
the thing about that for me is those are catastrophes that are part of the

1125
01:26:38.851 --> 01:26:43.520
struggle for human existence itself and not something to be laid at the feet of

1126
01:26:43.521 --> 01:26:46.100
any given social political system,

1127
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.270
especially one that seems to be producing a fair modicum of wealth for the

1128
01:26:50.271 --> 01:26:54.110
poorest section of the population.
And raising people up to the point where,

1129
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.100
you know,
they,

1130
01:26:55.100 --> 01:27:00.100
their lives aren't unending an unending day to day struggle for mere survival.

1131
01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:03.080
And there's some evidence,
for example,

1132
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:08.000
that if you can get GDP up to about $5,000 per person per year,
oh,

1133
01:27:08.001 --> 01:27:09.530
that's GDP,
um,

1134
01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.030
that people start to become concerned about environmental degradation and start

1135
01:27:14.031 --> 01:27:15.230
to take actions to prevent it.

1136
01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.960
And so there is some possibility that if we're lucky,

1137
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:22.280
we can get the bottom billion or 2 billion people in the world,

1138
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:25.940
or 3 billion as the population grows up to the point where they're wealthy

1139
01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:26.360
enough.

1140
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.660
So they actually start to care enough about the environment so that we could act

1141
01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:32.840
collectively to solve environmental problems.
Now you might say,

1142
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:35.870
well by that time we'll be out of earth.
You know,
we'll have,

1143
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:39.980
we'll have exhausted the resources that are in front of us so desperately that

1144
01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:40.880
there's no hope of that.

1145
01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:45.881
But I would like to remind you of a famous bet between Julian Simon and um,

1146
01:27:47.690 --> 01:27:52.250
the biologist at at Stanford who wrote Paul Erlick who wrote the population
bomb.

1147
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:57.230
They bet Eric who thought we were going to be overpopulated by the year 2000

1148
01:27:57.231 --> 01:27:58.280
bet,
Simon,

1149
01:27:58.281 --> 01:28:02.030
that by the year 2000 commodity prices would have increased dramatically as a

1150
01:28:02.031 --> 01:28:04.940
consequence of evidence that we were running out of material resources.

1151
01:28:05.150 --> 01:28:09.290
They made a famous bet over a 25 year period and Erlick paid off Simon in the

1152
01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:12.470
year 2000 because commodity prices went down and not up.

1153
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:17.000
And so there is no solid evidence that the fact that our population is growing

1154
01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:19.160
and will peak out,
by the way,
at about 9 billion,

1155
01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.600
there's no solid indication that the consequence of that is that we are in fact

1156
01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:27.630
running out of necessary material resources.
And so it's a danger.
But if there's,

1157
01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.990
it's not a danger that's proven.

1158
01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:34.340
And there is some utility and considering that the addition of several billion

1159
01:28:34.341 --> 01:28:35.690
more brains to the planet,

1160
01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:39.320
especially if they were well nourished brains as they increasingly are,

1161
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:43.790
might help us generate enough problem solvers so that we can stay ahead of the

1162
01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:47.840
looming ecological catastrophe has our population balloons outwards.

1163
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:49.490
Now we're going to peak at 9 billion.

1164
01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:52.430
It's not much higher than we are now and it looks like we might be able to

1165
01:28:52.431 --> 01:28:54.970
manage it.
Um,
the,
uh,

1166
01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:58.980
the other thing is that I didn't hear an alternative really from doctor

1167
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:00.560
[inaudible],
you know,
he,

1168
01:29:00.561 --> 01:29:04.680
he admitted the rise to success of the Chinese was in part a consequence of the,

1169
01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:08.490
of the allowance of market forces and decried the authoritarian tendencies.

1170
01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:10.260
And Fair enough,
that's exactly it.

1171
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:14.760
It also seemed to me that the social justice group identity processes that

1172
01:29:14.761 --> 01:29:17.700
Doctor d did you use Yak was decrying art to me,

1173
01:29:17.701 --> 01:29:20.310
a logical derivation from the oppression narrative.

1174
01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.750
That's a fundamental presupposition of Marxism.
So there,

1175
01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.060
I'd never heard a defense of Marxism and that part of his argument as well.

1176
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:31.380
And so for me,
again,
it's to ask what's the alternative?
Um,

1177
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:35.340
I also heard an argument for egalitarianism and but how I heard it defined as

1178
01:29:35.341 --> 01:29:38.310
equality of opportunity,
not as equality of outcome,

1179
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:40.800
which I see as a clearly defined Marxist aim.

1180
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:44.490
I heard an argument for a modified social distribution of wealth,

1181
01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:48.120
but that's already part and parcel of most modern free market states with a wide

1182
01:29:48.121 --> 01:29:51.270
variation and inappropriate variation of government intervention,

1183
01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.820
all of which constitute their own experiment.

1184
01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:59.060
We don't know how much social intervention is necessary to flatten tendency of

1185
01:29:59.701 --> 01:30:04.701
hierarchies to become tilted so terribly that only the people at the top have

1186
01:30:05.221 --> 01:30:07.620
everything and all of the people at the bottom have nothing.

1187
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:12.570
It's a very difficult battle to fight against that profound tendency,

1188
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:15.840
much deeper than the tendency of capitalism itself.

1189
01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.000
And we don't exactly know what to do about it.

1190
01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:23.360
So we run experiments and that seems to be working perfectly reasonably as far

1191
01:30:23.641 --> 01:30:25.290
as I can tell.
Um,

1192
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:29.543
<v 5>let's see.</v>

1193
01:30:32.650 --> 01:30:36.220
<v 2>Well,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll close with this.
Capitalism in the free market.</v>

1194
01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:39.460
Well that's the worst form of social organization possible as I said,

1195
01:30:39.461 --> 01:30:40.480
except for all the others.

1196
01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:44.110
There is a positive relationship between economics measure by income and

1197
01:30:44.111 --> 01:30:47.920
happiness or psychological wellbeing,
which might be the absence of misery.

1198
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:49.780
I certainly do not believe,

1199
01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:53.530
and the evidence does not suggest that material security is sufficient.

1200
01:30:53.650 --> 01:30:54.580
I do believe however,

1201
01:30:54.581 --> 01:30:58.090
that insofar as there is a relationship between happiness and materials
security,

1202
01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.720
that the free market system has demonstrated itself as the most efficient manner

1203
01:31:01.721 --> 01:31:05.740
to achieve that.
And that was actually the terms of the argument.
So thus,

1204
01:31:05.741 --> 01:31:08.860
if it's capitalism versus Marxism with regards to human happiness,

1205
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:13.260
it's still the case that the free market constitutes the clear winner and maybe

1206
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:17.080
capitalism will not solve our problems.
I actually don't believe that it will.

1207
01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.820
I in fact argued that the proper pathway forward is one of individual moral

1208
01:31:21.821 --> 01:31:24.400
responsibility aimed at the highest good.

1209
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:28.390
And something for me that's rooted in our underlying Judeo Christian tradition

1210
01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.560
that insists that each person is uh,
uh,

1211
01:31:31.630 --> 01:31:36.490
what is his sovereign in their own right and a locus of,
of,
of,

1212
01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.650
of,
of,
of ultimate value,

1213
01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:42.130
which is something that you can accept regardless of your religious

1214
01:31:42.131 --> 01:31:46.750
presuppositions and something that you do accept if you participate in a society

1215
01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:47.584
such as ours.

1216
01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:51.640
Even the fact that you vote that you're charged with that responsibility is an

1217
01:31:51.641 --> 01:31:55.870
indication that our society is structured such that we presume that each person

1218
01:31:55.871 --> 01:32:00.871
is a locus of responsibility and making of such import that the very stability

1219
01:32:02.051 --> 01:32:06.990
of the state depends upon the integrity of their,
um,
psych,

1220
01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.610
the integrity,
the integrity of their character.

1221
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:12.880
And so what I've been suggesting to people is that they adopt as much

1222
01:32:12.881 --> 01:32:15.970
responsibility as they possibly can in keeping with that,

1223
01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.420
in keeping with their aim at the highest possible.
Good.

1224
01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:23.590
Which to me is something approximating a balance between what's good for you as

1225
01:32:23.591 --> 01:32:27.820
an individual and what's good for your family in keeping with what's good for

1226
01:32:27.821 --> 01:32:30.970
you as an individual.
And then what's good for society.

1227
01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:35.110
And the larger frame such that it's also good for you and your family.

1228
01:32:35.111 --> 01:32:38.620
And that's a form of an well an elaborated it rated game,

1229
01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:41.320
a form of elaborated cooperation.

1230
01:32:41.321 --> 01:32:45.610
It's a sophisticated way of looking at the ways society could possibly be

1231
01:32:45.611 --> 01:32:46.390
organized.

1232
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:50.230
And I happen to believe that that has to happen at the individual level first

1233
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:54.530
and that's the pathway forward that I see.
And so that's my tip.

1234
01:32:55.620 --> 01:33:00.620
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

1235
01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:10.490
<v 6>thank you Dr. Peterson.
Dr Jay.
Jay spent a little bit of my time.</v>

1236
01:33:10.491 --> 01:33:13.640
I will try to be as short as possible.

1237
01:33:13.670 --> 01:33:17.690
So a couple of remarks and then my final point,

1238
01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:22.960
why I think the shelf limitation of capitalism isn't needed first about

1239
01:33:25.190 --> 01:33:28.420
happiness.
Just a couple of remarks.
Lauren,

1240
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:32.540
I want to ask you but isn't it I am I dreaming?
I think I'm not.

1241
01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:36.950
I remember a couple of years ago it was your fault at all around the world.

1242
01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:38.233
Some kind of

1243
01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:43.670
investigation percentage of people interviewed in different countries.

1244
01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:46.340
Do they feel happy with their life?

1245
01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:51.130
And the shock was that some Scandinavian countries,
which we,

1246
01:33:51.230 --> 01:33:55.360
which we concede that social democratic paradise,

1247
01:33:55.361 --> 01:34:00.080
you got a very low while.
Bangladesh I think was close to the top.

1248
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:04.550
Now I know this logic has a limit.
I don't buy the bullshit of pool.

1249
01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:08.570
People are happy in the world there and so on.
But you know,

1250
01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.460
my argument is not against you.

1251
01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:15.580
My argument here problematizing happiness even more.

1252
01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.830
Look,
Dick may interest you.
I was year ago in uh,

1253
01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:27.280
in I think Lithuania and we debated [inaudible] in one of my books.

1254
01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:31.500
When we're people in some pervert that change,

1255
01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:34.400
and this is the critique of the category of happiness for me,

1256
01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:39.350
Gabby and we came to the crazy result after the Soviet intervention,

1257
01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:44.180
Czechoslovakia in 1970s and eighties.

1258
01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:48.200
Why for happiness first you don't have,

1259
01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:51.980
you should not have too much democracy because this brings the burden of

1260
01:34:51.981 --> 01:34:56.390
responsibility.
Happiness means there is another guy out there.

1261
01:34:56.391 --> 01:35:01.280
You can put the blame on him and as the joke went in Czechoslovakia,

1262
01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:05.210
if there is bad weather,
a storm or this communist screwed it up again,

1263
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.720
that's one condition of happiness.
The other condition,

1264
01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:13.310
much more subtle ones is,
and this was done in Czechoslovakia,

1265
01:35:13.311 --> 01:35:14.930
did those dark times after.

1266
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:19.930
So the life was relatively moderately good but not perfect.

1267
01:35:21.441 --> 01:35:23.810
Like there was neat all the time.

1268
01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.160
Maybe once a month there was not meat in the stores.

1269
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.010
It was very good to remind you how happy you are.

1270
01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:37.150
The other times and other thing they had a paradise which should be at the

1271
01:35:38.241 --> 01:35:41.090
appropriate distance.
West Germany affluence,

1272
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:46.100
it was not too far but not directly accessible.
You know,

1273
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.760
so I I it was so maybe in your critique of communist regimes,

1274
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:53.750
I agree with you,

1275
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:58.700
you should more focus on something that I experience of,
you know,

1276
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:03.380
don't look only at the terror.
Ultimately totalitarian regime,

1277
01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:07.970
there was a kind of a silent perverted pact between,

1278
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.230
at least in this late,
little bit more tolerant,
but they still publish them.

1279
01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:14.810
Communist regimes between power and population.

1280
01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.180
The message was leave us the power,

1281
01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:21.680
don't Mesh it with us and we guarantee you a relatively safe life.

1282
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:26.000
Employment,
private players,
there's private niche and so on and so on.

1283
01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.610
So I am not sure priced,
but again,

1284
01:36:28.611 --> 01:36:32.100
this is not for me the argument for the communist but against happiness.
That's,

1285
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:36.230
you know,
people said when,
uh,
when the wall fell down,

1286
01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:41.420
what the wonder in Poland,
my goat in,
in,
uh,
in,

1287
01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:41.840
uh,

1288
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:46.840
like solely Darnos which was prohibited a year ago now triumph at the elections.

1289
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:48.800
Who could imagine these?
Yes,

1290
01:36:48.801 --> 01:36:53.330
but the true miracle in a bad sense for me was four years later,

1291
01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:58.100
democratically x communist came back to power.
So,
you know,
don't,

1292
01:36:58.310 --> 01:37:01.280
again,
this is for me,
not the argument for them,

1293
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:03.410
but simply for the,

1294
01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:07.640
let's call it corruptive nature of happiness.

1295
01:37:07.641 --> 01:37:10.070
So my formula,
maybe you agree with it,

1296
01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:15.100
is my basic dogma is setting this should be treated as a necessary byproduct.

1297
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:18.710
If you focus on it,
you are lost.

1298
01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:24.040
It comes as a byproduct of you working for a cause and so on.

1299
01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:29.120
That's the basic thing.
For second point,
maybe we disagree here.

1300
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:30.350
China,

1301
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:35.350
of course the miracle economic miracle was due to unleashing a market report and

1302
01:37:38.381 --> 01:37:41.360
so on.
But and here comes my passion museum.

1303
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:44.270
Some of my liberal friends are telling me,
yes.

1304
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:49.300
Imagine what would they have achieved with also political democratization.

1305
01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.890
I'm a passionist here.
No,

1306
01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:55.220
they found a perfect formula of how,

1307
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:57.780
and that is the paradox of China today.

1308
01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.080
The Communist Party is the best men at [inaudible] of capitalism and protector

1309
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.640
against workers.

1310
01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:10.760
The truly dangerous thing in China today is not to flirt with Western ideas,

1311
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.590
is to organize trade unions too.
You know,

1312
01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.200
like this is what worries me,

1313
01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:21.290
this perfect combination between unleashing capitalism and still the

1314
01:38:22.171 --> 01:38:24.990
authoritarian rule or to put it in another way,

1315
01:38:24.991 --> 01:38:28.860
my worry is debt today,
all around the world,

1316
01:38:29.010 --> 01:38:34.010
this eternal marriage between capitalism and democracy is slowly disappearing

1317
01:38:36.690 --> 01:38:41.220
till now.
I admitted capitalism need that from time to time.

1318
01:38:41.221 --> 01:38:46.221
Some 10 20 years of dictatorship when things started to improve democracy,

1319
01:38:46.531 --> 01:38:49.530
return [inaudible],
South Korea and so on.

1320
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:54.560
I wonder if we are still at that now at just very quickly,

1321
01:38:55.890 --> 01:39:00.250
your basic point in the introduction,
in your introduction,

1322
01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:01.081
you know,

1323
01:39:01.081 --> 01:39:06.081
I almost am tempted to say the way you presented communist manifesto,

1324
01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:09.660
the simplified image and Trayvon Trayvon.
It's crazy to say,

1325
01:39:09.661 --> 01:39:12.360
but on many points it,

1326
01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.040
I agree with you and it's a very complex argument.
Marx didn't have,

1327
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:21.510
for example,
a good theory of how social power exists.

1328
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.740
His idea was simply [inaudible] disappearance of class structure.

1329
01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:31.380
It secretly,
although he wouldn't have accepted it a technocratic dream,

1330
01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:36.680
like by experts social life will be around exert a perfect machine.

1331
01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:41.010
Although he was at least aware of the problem,

1332
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:45.990
which is why he was so enthusiastic marks about Paris commune,

1333
01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:49.950
you know,
which was precisely not centralized power.

1334
01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:52.260
So I'm not just defending marks,

1335
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.170
I'm saying it was not clear to him.
And uh,
uh,

1336
01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.120
so let's drop that.
Maybe I have more interesting things to say.
Ah,

1337
01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:08.010
another point.
Uh,
nonetheless,
uh,
where,

1338
01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:12.140
where at one point I'm ready to take.

1339
01:40:12.210 --> 01:40:16.710
Where did you find this discourse maybe for today's politically correct drugs

1340
01:40:16.711 --> 01:40:19.930
and so on that this,
uh,
egalitarianisms,

1341
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:25.070
there is one passage in his late critique of gotta program where Mark's directly

1342
01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.560
addresses the problem of equality and he dismisses it as a strick bourgeois

1343
01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:38.400
category explicitly,
explicitly for him,

1344
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:42.960
communism is not egalitarianism.
It's yes,

1345
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:47.790
here are his but not based on capitalism.
Okay.

1346
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:50.580
I am not totally defending earmarks.

1347
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:54.520
I'm just saying don't republish the much.
Okay,

1348
01:40:54.521 --> 01:40:56.470
but to complete because yes,

1349
01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:00.400
I want to keep my promise to be a little bit shorter.
You know,

1350
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:04.920
I agree with you on many points,
but you know what?
My problem with

1351
01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:12.450
my problem that I was aiming at with all of the openings,

1352
01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:17.520
I know we don't know really what is happening with ecology and Shavon who,

1353
01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:21.700
and this is an okay,
let's take oceans.
You mentioned them,

1354
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:26.950
but isn't it for me?
Correct me if I'm wrong and I don't mean this rhetorically,

1355
01:41:26.951 --> 01:41:31.270
maybe I'm really wrong,
but the problem of oceans can,

1356
01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:36.900
the only way for me is some kind of cooperative international actions and Shawan

1357
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:41.410
you cannot simply leave it to the market.
That's what I'm saying.

1358
01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:46.740
This is tasteful limit that I see about this diminishing poverty and so on.

1359
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:52.780
I am aware of it.
I tend to agree with I also,
but I at the same time,

1360
01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:56.800
she show many explosive tensions.
For example,

1361
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:58.780
do you know about South Africa?

1362
01:41:59.050 --> 01:42:03.850
It's a terrifying situation on the edge of the civil war to be very brutal.

1363
01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:08.890
The only thing that I can simplify it that really happened with end of apartheid

1364
01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:14.130
is that the old ruling class,
a simplified in grotesque mark,

1365
01:42:14.150 --> 01:42:16.990
Stan was joined by a new black ruling class,

1366
01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:21.160
which is not doing a good job so they are trying to play the race card.

1367
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:26.230
It's still the consequence of white colonialism and so on and so on,

1368
01:42:26.530 --> 01:42:31.530
but the tangents are terrifying and here I was pleading for not abolishing

1369
01:42:32.471 --> 01:42:36.640
borders and so on,
but this type of,
I don't know how to put it.

1370
01:42:36.670 --> 01:42:39.880
Global change cooperation like again,

1371
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:44.420
the example of Congo that I mentioned or like the,

1372
01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:47.920
forget that killing of that Guy Khashoggi it's horrible,

1373
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:50.680
but the true nightmare is Yemen today.

1374
01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:56.250
What I mean you said somewhere that we should well think without engaging in

1375
01:42:56.861 --> 01:43:01.390
large scale reform what the consequences will be if you,

1376
01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:03.310
okay.
Very briefly,

1377
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:08.430
I agree with you that the gap of standard mark season was the proletarian

1378
01:43:09.701 --> 01:43:14.701
revolution will be a place where you do something and you know exactly what you

1379
01:43:15.581 --> 01:43:16.300
do.

1380
01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:21.300
If there is a lesson of the 20th century is that this tragic logic you want

1381
01:43:21.311 --> 01:43:26.110
something may be good.
The result is catastrophic Holt,
absolutely.

1382
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:31.030
Also for revolutions and so on and so on.
But uh,

1383
01:43:32.190 --> 01:43:33.550
but like,
uh,

1384
01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:38.570
in spite of all this and I don't know what form will it have,

1385
01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:42.760
I'm not pleading for a new land in his party or whatever and just pleading for

1386
01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:47.940
new forums of international cooperation and Shawan I agree with you when you

1387
01:43:48.791 --> 01:43:53.791
said the majority of us is not even really aware of the seriousness of

1388
01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:59.960
especially the pool of ecological problems and Lavonne and I think,

1389
01:43:59.961 --> 01:44:04.720
would you agree that [inaudible] much more supple and Aquin?

1390
01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:06.330
Uh,
we,

1391
01:44:06.570 --> 01:44:10.670
it's logic that in [inaudible] is called the survival.

1392
01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:15.760
Caroline ignored in frank [inaudible] a BM MECO men we know ecological problems,

1393
01:44:18.230 --> 01:44:21.230
but we don't really take them seriously.

1394
01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:26.660
And here I see problems and I don't see an easy way,
oh,

1395
01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.220
are you,
I am affecting me.
If you asked me when people say no,

1396
01:44:31.221 --> 01:44:35.840
but they are growing,
protests are growing and so on and so on.
Yes.

1397
01:44:35.841 --> 01:44:39.920
I'm listening to this story from when I was young.
You know,
they are grown.

1398
01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:44.180
And then look what happened.
The mega tragedy is for me for a jumper.

1399
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:46.160
What happened to Teresa?

1400
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.980
They were elected for clean,
keep,
whatever.
And they become,

1401
01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:56.390
and I'm not blaming them,
they become the perfect executors of,
uh,

1402
01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:01.150
of austerity program.
So I just see problems.

1403
01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:04.580
I am a pessimist and I'm not a radical pessimists,

1404
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:08.300
but you have to maybe here we are different.

1405
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:10.010
I noticed with your final speech,

1406
01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:15.040
that final moment of your invention that it's very strange because usually mark,

1407
01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:18.410
she's kept this stupid optimist entrepot locally.

1408
01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:23.180
Just get rid of capitalism.
[inaudible] all be happy.

1409
01:45:23.690 --> 01:45:28.460
My God,
and much more a passion.
I don't believe in human goodness.

1410
01:45:28.670 --> 01:45:32.290
I beat never under estimate,
uh,
evil.

1411
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:36.920
Never under estimate envy.
I mean,
it's part of my nature.

1412
01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:40.890
In Levenia we hear [inaudible] story,
uh,

1413
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:45.970
a godlike figure comes to a farmer and I will stop immediately and ask and ask

1414
01:45:46.841 --> 01:45:50.390
him.
I will do to you,
do you whatever you want.

1415
01:45:50.690 --> 01:45:53.780
Just I want a new IB.
Do twice the same to your neighbor.

1416
01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:58.610
You know what Levine farmer answer Tine.
Take one of my eyes.
You know,

1417
01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:02.040
we are indeed.
Don't underestimate this.

1418
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:04.640
I don't see any simple clear way out.

1419
01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:10.200
<v 0>You're [inaudible]</v>

1420
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:22.810
<v 6>thank you both very much.</v>

1421
01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:27.040
It's pretty clear I think to all of us that you both have quite a bit to say to

1422
01:46:27.041 --> 01:46:30.830
each other and so and through ourselves on and,

1423
01:46:31.330 --> 01:46:34.570
and so I think before we jumped to some audience questions,

1424
01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:39.700
I thought it would be nice to give each of you a chance to ask a response or ask

1425
01:46:39.701 --> 01:46:42.940
a question or two from each other.
So starting with you,
Dr. Peterson,

1426
01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:47.970
maybe you want Kimberly to wasn't fair to well I've only to do your reply.

1427
01:46:48.610 --> 01:46:50.460
I like three questions

1428
01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:54.870
<v 4>in two of them are now completely irrelevant.
And so,
um,</v>

1429
01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:56.880
I have one left,
I guess.

1430
01:46:57.210 --> 01:47:00.210
And I'm not sure that it's a fair question,

1431
01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:03.900
but maybe it's seems to me to be a fair question.

1432
01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:06.871
You're a,

1433
01:47:06.871 --> 01:47:11.520
you're a strange marks as to have a discussion with and well,

1434
01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:15.930
but here's why.
This is not an insult by any stretch of the mind nation.
I mean,

1435
01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:21.260
one of the things that struck me when I was looking at your work was that your,

1436
01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:25.410
well first of all,
you're a character,
you know,
and that's,
that's,

1437
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:27.850
that's an interesting thing.
Like you're decently,

1438
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:34.380
it's a sign of,
it's a sign of originality,
Huh?
And,

1439
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:38.250
and it's a sign of a certain amount of moral courage and,
and,

1440
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:43.440
and it's a sign of a certain temperament and it makes you humorous and

1441
01:47:43.441 --> 01:47:47.910
charismatic and attractive.
And,
um,
and,
and,

1442
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:52.930
and I think you appeal to young people the way that outside intellectual rebels

1443
01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:54.780
appeal to young people.

1444
01:47:55.260 --> 01:48:00.090
And so those are all positive things that can be used positively or negatively.

1445
01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:05.180
And my question is like,
it seems to me that your,

1446
01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:09.780
your um,
your reputation,

1447
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:13.680
unless I'm very misinformed about this,

1448
01:48:14.850 --> 01:48:19.850
is as a strong supporter of Marxist doctrines on the left or was that,

1449
01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:25.380
and so then my question is,
given the originality of your thought,

1450
01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:31.140
why,
why is it that you came to presume at some point in your life,

1451
01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:32.910
perhaps not now,
and perhaps steel,

1452
01:48:32.911 --> 01:48:37.911
that the promotion of Marxism rather say rather than disease that chasm was

1453
01:48:38.431 --> 01:48:39.264
appropriate?

1454
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:44.460
Because it seems to me that there's enough originality in your body of thought

1455
01:48:44.461 --> 01:48:48.930
and lateral thinking in the manner in which you approach intellectual ideas,

1456
01:48:48.931 --> 01:48:53.931
that there's just no reason for you to be allied with a doctrine that's a 170

1457
01:48:54.661 --> 01:48:55.231
years old.

1458
01:48:55.231 --> 01:49:00.231
And that is if capitalism is rife with problems is twice as ripe as broad with

1459
01:49:02.281 --> 01:49:06.360
problems as that.
And so you're kind of a mystery to me in that way.

1460
01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:07.920
And so that's my question.

1461
01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:10.160
<v 7>Okay.
All right.</v>

1462
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:14.250
Very briefly.

1463
01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.460
<v 6>Alright.
Well I develop,</v>

1464
01:49:17.461 --> 01:49:22.190
kicked him out typically in my book critical insights into many traditional mark

1465
01:49:22.191 --> 01:49:25.730
leash,
the leash.
So no doubt Pier,
you know what,

1466
01:49:25.731 --> 01:49:29.030
I still admire him nonetheless in March,

1467
01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:31.880
not though simplicities of communist manifesto,

1468
01:49:31.881 --> 01:49:36.881
but I still think that he show called critique of political economy capital and

1469
01:49:38.451 --> 01:49:43.451
Travon is a tremendous achievement as a description of the dynamics of

1470
01:49:44.781 --> 01:49:46.580
capitalist society in the fury.

1471
01:49:46.590 --> 01:49:51.490
Ditch mark is much more ambiguous and opened that,

1472
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:52.324
for example,

1473
01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:57.360
he mentions for example a proport what you refer to.

1474
01:49:57.670 --> 01:50:01.390
He mentioned that law of diminishing return,

1475
01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:05.410
like while white crisis will arrive necessarily poor,

1476
01:50:05.411 --> 01:50:06.550
are getting poorer,

1477
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:11.790
but then he is honest enough to enumerate seven or eight counter tendencies and

1478
01:50:13.331 --> 01:50:18.331
if you read him closely you will see that precisely those tendencies prevailed

1479
01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.980
later or forget communist manifesto,

1480
01:50:23.981 --> 01:50:28.981
go to read his political analysis of unsurpassable 18 Bremer and so on of the

1481
01:50:31.570 --> 01:50:36.460
1848 revolution,
which are incredibly complex,
no traces,

1482
01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.020
traces of that class binary there,

1483
01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:44.340
there march deals with middle classes with crucial lumpenproletariat with the

1484
01:50:46.001 --> 01:50:49.300
ambiguous role of intellectuals and so on and Travon.

1485
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.600
But basically what I was pleading for and I like to put it in paradoxical term,

1486
01:50:55.930 --> 01:51:00.930
was for a return of from Mark's back to Kegel,

1487
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:06.270
I define myself more as like a yet why Hegel is conceived or Hegel is considered

1488
01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:11.270
a madman,
you know the guy absolute knowing and so on and summer.

1489
01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:15.610
No Kegel is much more modest and open.

1490
01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.760
The danger in Marxism is for me this tell logical structure we are at the zero

1491
01:51:22.481 --> 01:51:27.481
point but there is a unique chance of reversal into a new emancipated society

1492
01:51:28.241 --> 01:51:29.074
and so on.

1493
01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:34.110
And the danger here is that of self instrumentalization proletarian Communist

1494
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:39.960
Party is an agent of history which knows the loss of history to put it follows

1495
01:51:40.961 --> 01:51:44.470
them and so on.
That's the catastrophe in Hegel.

1496
01:51:44.530 --> 01:51:48.190
Such a position is strictly prohibited in Kegel.

1497
01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:53.580
Whenever you act you are so you know you have to,

1498
01:51:55.510 --> 01:52:00.510
there is no position of this pure acting where you know what you are doing and

1499
01:52:00.581 --> 01:52:04.950
the result be beach will be.
So I'm this,
this would be,

1500
01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:08.800
this would be my main point.
So yes,
my,
my,

1501
01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:14.590
my formula is kind of a,
ironically,

1502
01:52:14.591 --> 01:52:16.750
I know Hegel is the greatest idea list,

1503
01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:22.620
materialists reversal of marks by turning back to Hegel for Hegel,

1504
01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:26.740
Hegel assess in a part that people don't read.

1505
01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:31.210
Introduction to forward 30 to philosophy of,
right.

1506
01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:36.360
He says explicitly that the all of Minerva takes off in the evening when there

1507
01:52:38.171 --> 01:52:39.004
is dusk.

1508
01:52:39.370 --> 01:52:44.370
So philosophy can just grasp a social order when it's already in its philosophy,

1509
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:50.780
cannot see into the future.
It's radical openness.

1510
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:52.970
We need this openness today.

1511
01:52:52.971 --> 01:52:57.971
The tragedy today maybe we agree here is that we really don't have a basic,

1512
01:52:59.790 --> 01:53:02.840
how to,
they call it cognitive mapping.

1513
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:07.850
I don't think we have here a clear insight into where we stand,

1514
01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:12.530
where we are moving and so on and so on.
So I'm much more against,

1515
01:53:12.531 --> 01:53:13.950
you surely have a pessimist.

1516
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:20.590
<v 7>Can I ask you now a question?
Let me get</v>

1517
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:24.950
<v 6>and then you can ask me postcards.
So John,
well,</v>

1518
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:26.400
<v 7>yeah,</v>

1519
01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:30.290
<v 4>I don't have any thing to quibble about with what you just said about,
um,</v>

1520
01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:34.490
well no,
there's not even a,
but really it's that the,

1521
01:53:35.190 --> 01:53:36.420
even if the,

1522
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:41.010
if what you said about Mark's is more sophisticated thought is true,

1523
01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:46.640
I think the unfortunate reality is that any support for Marxism

1524
01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:55.340
especially
directed towards those are who,

1525
01:53:55.460 --> 01:54:00.230
who are young is likely to be read as support for the most radical and

1526
01:54:00.231 --> 01:54:02.330
revolutionary proclivities.

1527
01:54:02.331 --> 01:54:05.670
And I would say that as they're outlined in a,

1528
01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:10.370
in the document that I described,
yeah.
Um,

1529
01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:15.110
in the communist manifesto and that they're of extraordinary danger.

1530
01:54:15.111 --> 01:54:19.850
And so it seems to me that by attempting to,

1531
01:54:20.690 --> 01:54:23.950
you know,
rescue the sheep,
you've been,

1532
01:54:24.170 --> 01:54:29.150
you've sort of invited the dragon into the house and that seems to me to be

1533
01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:31.640
dangerous and unfortunate

1534
01:54:31.730 --> 01:54:36.090
<v 6>here.
I can assure you by asking you mind question because,
uh,</v>

1535
01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.233
you know,

1536
01:54:37.630 --> 01:54:41.710
very naively you mentioned first,

1537
01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:43.360
do you really,

1538
01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:48.070
where did you find the data that I completely don't see it.
Okay,

1539
01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:52.720
let me begin by this.
You designate your under quotation marks.

1540
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:57.750
I'm not characterizing and me or what you are fighting against as sometimes you

1541
01:54:59.441 --> 01:55:02.980
call it postmodern,
neo Marxism.

1542
01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:04.630
I know what you mean.

1543
01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:10.200
All of this from political correctness to these excesses of whatever spirit of

1544
01:55:10.930 --> 01:55:12.830
envy and so on and so on.

1545
01:55:13.930 --> 01:55:18.610
Do you think they are really,
where did you find this data?
I don't know them.

1546
01:55:18.611 --> 01:55:23.110
I would ask you here,
give me some names or whatever.
Where are the Marxists here?

1547
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:25.500
<v 7>I don't know anything.
I don't</v>

1548
01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:31.890
show me any big name of political correctness.

1549
01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:36.180
<v 6>I think they they fear like a good vampire,
a fear of garlic.</v>

1550
01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:37.740
Any Disney,
Shanghai,

1551
01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:42.620
they are already the one who is not a matter kids but at least approaches

1552
01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:44.700
economic Bernie Sanders,

1553
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.880
he's already under attack is white male and all that stuff and Travon I him I

1554
01:55:50.851 --> 01:55:55.851
him plea by probably would be be Dishman what you describe as postmodern neo

1555
01:55:58.321 --> 01:56:02.550
Marxism,
where is really the market element in it?

1556
01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.840
They are for equality,
sorry.

1557
01:56:04.841 --> 01:56:09.841
Where they are for equality at these sculptures struggles or proper names.

1558
01:56:09.931 --> 01:56:11.310
How do we call the trigger?

1559
01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.520
Do you see in them in political correctness and Travon any genuine will have to

1560
01:56:17.821 --> 01:56:20.070
change society.
I don't see,

1561
01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:25.280
I think it's a heifer moralization typer moralization which is silent admission

1562
01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:32.160
of a defeat.
That's my problem.
Why do you call?
Give me no,

1563
01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:36.660
it's,
again,
it's not a rhetorical question for politely saying you are an idiot.

1564
01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:38.610
You don't know what you're talking about.

1565
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:44.030
It's simply I would like to know because you and I like this often when you

1566
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:48.870
attack somebody,
you said aggressively and my truth read more.

1567
01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:53.760
Tell me whom.
So I'm asking you now know there is more,
I don't advise you,

1568
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:57.480
but who are,
give me some names and so on.

1569
01:56:57.481 --> 01:57:01.440
And who are this post?
Modern Egalitarian,

1570
01:57:01.441 --> 01:57:05.640
neo Marxist.
And where do you see any kind even of Marxism?

1571
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:10.820
I see enough mostly and impotent and utterly impotent.

1572
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:17.140
Moralization
please.
I'm so sorry to tell us.
No,
that's,

1573
01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.750
that's no problem.
Well,

1574
01:57:18.910 --> 01:57:23.350
<v 4>I mean,
um,
organization like Jonathan Heights,
um,</v>

1575
01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:25.330
what's it called?

1576
01:57:26.110 --> 01:57:31.110
Heterodox Academy and other organizations like that have documented an absolute

1577
01:57:31.781 --> 01:57:35.500
dearth of conservative voices in the social sciences and the humanities,

1578
01:57:35.501 --> 01:57:39.790
and about 25% according to the what I think are reliable surveys,

1579
01:57:39.791 --> 01:57:43.840
approximately 25% of social scientists in the u s identified themselves as

1580
01:57:43.841 --> 01:57:46.270
Marxists.
And so there's that.

1581
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:50.180
<v 6>Well,
okay,
but
the,</v>

1582
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:54.010
I know a capital of Mark's list,
for example,

1583
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:57.170
that's very Charlotte economic work,

1584
01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:01.040
which I don't totally Davey Tavey one,

1585
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:05.750
but he ride very serious book of Economic Analysis and kill one in Taiwan.

1586
01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:09.350
Then there is the old guy who is far from complete fication,

1587
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:11.160
Frederick drained Sean and Sean,

1588
01:58:11.170 --> 01:58:16.170
but they are totally marginalized today in this politically correct mainstream.

1589
01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:18.560
You know,
I don't see,

1590
01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:23.170
<v 4>well,
yeah,
your questions seem to me to focus more on the PR,</v>

1591
01:58:23.230 --> 01:58:28.150
the peculiar relationship that I've noticed and that people have disputed

1592
01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:32.170
between postmodernism and neo Marxism.

1593
01:58:32.171 --> 01:58:37.171
And I see the connection between the postmodernist types and the Marxist as a

1594
01:58:38.921 --> 01:58:39.970
sleight of hand.

1595
01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:45.180
That replaced notion of the oppression of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie as

1596
01:58:46.031 --> 01:58:50.980
the oppression by one identity group by another.
Totally agree.
Okay.

1597
01:58:50.981 --> 01:58:53.930
So,
but that,
but so now look,
we could,

1598
01:58:54.190 --> 01:58:59.190
we could precisely a non a non [inaudible] fellow that that's the seat that I

1599
01:59:01.481 --> 01:59:05.620
guess that's where we might have a dispute because I think what happened,

1600
01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:08.860
especially in France in the 1960s,
is as the,

1601
01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:14.160
as the radical Marxist postmodern types like Dera Down Fuko realized that they

1602
01:59:15.671 --> 01:59:17.080
were losing the moral battle,

1603
01:59:17.081 --> 01:59:21.400
especially after the information came out of the Soviet Union in the manner that

1604
01:59:21.401 --> 01:59:25.390
it came out that the nation.
And so yeah,
that the whole bloody is telling us,

1605
01:59:25.690 --> 01:59:26.523
yeah.

1606
01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:31.260
The whole Stellan this catastrophe along with the entire mouse catastrophe that

1607
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:33.130
they didn't really have a leg to stand on.

1608
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:36.910
And instead of revising their notion that human history,

1609
01:59:36.970 --> 01:59:40.520
and this is a Marxist notion,
should be regarded as,
uh,

1610
01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:45.670
the eternal class struggle between the economically deprived and the oppressors.

1611
01:59:45.850 --> 01:59:50.590
They just recast it and said,
well,
it's not based on economics.

1612
01:59:50.591 --> 01:59:52.000
It's based on identity,

1613
01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:55.600
but it still fundamentally oppressor against oppressed.

1614
01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:59.630
And to me that meant that they smuggled the,
the,

1615
01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:04.780
the fundamental narrative of Marxism and many of its goals back into the

1616
02:00:05.051 --> 02:00:08.860
argument without ever admitting that they did.
So now I've been criticized,

1617
02:00:08.890 --> 02:00:13.810
you know,
for this position because people who are postmodernists say,
look,

1618
02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:18.190
one of the hallmarks of postmodernism is skepticism of Meta narratives.

1619
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:21.830
It's like I know that perfectly well and I also know that Mark's is as

1620
02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:25.270
[inaudible] is a Meta narrative and so you shouldn't be able to be a

1621
02:00:25.271 --> 02:00:27.310
postmodernist and a Marxist.

1622
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:32.430
But I still see the union of those two things in the insistence that the best,

1623
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:36.970
the appropriate way to look at the view world is to view it as the battleground

1624
02:00:36.971 --> 02:00:41.380
between groups defined by a particular group,

1625
02:00:41.381 --> 02:00:45.250
identity between individuals defined by a particular group identity so that the

1626
02:00:45.251 --> 02:00:46.780
group identity becomes paramount.

1627
02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:51.130
And then the proper reading is always oppressor versus oppressed with the

1628
02:00:51.131 --> 02:00:52.720
secondary insistence.

1629
02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:57.100
That's very similar to Marx's insistence upon the,
um,

1630
02:00:57.130 --> 02:01:02.130
moral superiority of the proletariat that the oppressors are by definition

1631
02:01:02.231 --> 02:01:06.010
because they're all pressed morally superior.
And,

1632
02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:07.780
and there's the call for

1633
02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:12.580
perhaps not revolutionary change,
although that comes up above,

1634
02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:17.500
but change in the structure so that that oppression disappears so that a certain

1635
02:01:17.501 --> 02:01:19.510
form of equality comes about.

1636
02:01:19.511 --> 02:01:24.340
Now you argued that Mark's wasn't a believer in equality of outcome and I'm not

1637
02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:29.400
so sure about that because his notion of the eventual utopia that would

1638
02:01:29.861 --> 02:01:34.861
constitute genuine communism was a place where all class divisions were

1639
02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.380
eradicated.
When,
so there's,
well,

1640
02:01:38.410 --> 02:01:42.410
well there's at an implication that the most important of the hierarchies had

1641
02:01:42.411 --> 02:01:43.244
disappeared.

1642
02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:46.400
And so maybe he had enough sophistication to talk about other forms of

1643
02:01:46.401 --> 02:01:48.950
hierarchies.
But if,
if that's the case,

1644
02:01:48.951 --> 02:01:53.951
then I can't imagine why he thought that the utopia that would emerge as a

1645
02:01:54.681 --> 02:01:58.640
consequence of the elimination of economic hierarchies would be a utopia.

1646
02:01:58.790 --> 02:02:01.490
Because if there were other forms of hierarchies that still existed,

1647
02:02:01.491 --> 02:02:05.150
people would be just as contentious about them as they are now.

1648
02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:07.850
Like we have hierarchies of attractiveness,
for example,

1649
02:02:07.851 --> 02:02:11.360
that have nothing to do with economics or very little to do with economics.

1650
02:02:11.361 --> 02:02:16.010
And there's no shortage of contention around that or any other form of ability.

1651
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:21.310
And so that's why I associate the social justice types who are basically

1652
02:02:22.371 --> 02:02:27.371
postmodernist with Mark's post there postmodernist with Marxism.

1653
02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:32.600
It's the insistence that you view the world through the narrative of Oh,

1654
02:02:32.601 --> 02:02:35.660
pressed versus oppressor.
And I think it's a catastrophe.

1655
02:02:36.170 --> 02:02:38.530
I think it's a catastrophe.
And you appear to think of,

1656
02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:42.760
<v 7>yeah,
well that's one sentence and then you can reply.</v>

1657
02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:47.260
It's so funny that you mentioned,
for example,
somebody like

1658
02:02:47.670 --> 02:02:51.350
<v 6>Fuko who,
uh,
for me,
uh,</v>

1659
02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.840
I don't know whether that his main target Mark Keaton okay for him represented

1660
02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:01.750
in he and he's,

1661
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:04.510
he's gained was never a radical claims,

1662
02:03:04.511 --> 02:03:08.700
but indicates what I don't like in this,
what you call postmodern,

1663
02:03:08.770 --> 02:03:11.250
let's not call them mark please.
But revolutionary,

1664
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:14.770
it's enjoying your own self marginalization.

1665
02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:17.980
The good thing is to be on the margin,
you know,

1666
02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:23.340
like not in the center and on and Travon it almost made me nostalgic for old

1667
02:03:25.361 --> 02:03:29.380
communist school at least had the honesty to say,
no,

1668
02:03:29.470 --> 02:03:32.200
we don't enjoy our market position.

1669
02:03:32.410 --> 02:03:36.670
We want to do something central power.
I find disgusting.

1670
02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:40.170
No wonder you don't get invited to lots of places yet.

1671
02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:42.770
You're now,

1672
02:03:42.770 --> 02:03:47.770
you're now a call for me embodies this logic of evolution and by revolution he

1673
02:03:49.211 --> 02:03:51.140
meant any social trend,

1674
02:03:51.141 --> 02:03:54.880
serious that small resistances and so on,

1675
02:03:54.970 --> 02:03:59.620
small marginal places of resistance and Travon and Travon.
So,
okay.

1676
02:03:59.621 --> 02:04:04.130
But let's maybe drop it here if you want,
but kings,

1677
02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:07.030
you are replying to my question.
You should have

1678
02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:11.190
<v 4>the last one up here.
I'll stop with that.
Let's move to the next,</v>

1679
02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:14.530
we'll get back to these topics.
No doubt as we move forward with the question.

1680
02:04:14.531 --> 02:04:17.040
So I'm happy to let that,
that particular issue store,

1681
02:04:17.410 --> 02:04:22.410
<v 6>did you already do your Stalinists manipulation and tens that the questions echo</v>

1682
02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:29.760
because this program that she described to us through some screens,

1683
02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:31.270
scratches and Travon,

1684
02:04:31.450 --> 02:04:36.450
I think it booked scheme to the one who decides which questions are established

1685
02:04:36.821 --> 02:04:37.654
with foot in

1686
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:42.030
<v 4>the real voice of the people in,
hopefully we can trust him.</v>

1687
02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:46.990
Let's move on from that,
uh,

1688
02:04:47.670 --> 02:04:50.580
hurt this evening.
Uh,
we're talking about happiness.

1689
02:04:50.581 --> 02:04:53.940
At least that's the frame of the debate that we have tonight.

1690
02:04:54.930 --> 02:04:57.210
And you've both been in your work and also tonight,

1691
02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.660
very critical of happiness as mere hedonism.

1692
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:03.390
Pleasure seeking or even simply as a feeling,

1693
02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:09.320
what does true or deeper human happiness consist of and how is it obtained you?

1694
02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:18.720
I don't care.
Well,
I don't,
I don't,
first of all,

1695
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:22.560
there's something you said five minutes ago or so.

1696
02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.580
I think you were still at the podium that I agree with profoundly,

1697
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:30.960
which is that happiness is a side effect.
It's,
it's not,

1698
02:05:31.230 --> 02:05:35.100
it's not a thing in itself.
It's something that comes upon you.

1699
02:05:35.590 --> 02:05:39.070
It's like an act of grace in some sense and my sense,

1700
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:44.470
even the pure logical undertone of what not the category of grace can be used in

1701
02:05:46.051 --> 02:05:50.880
a perfect eight,
eight clench.
It loves the deepest.
Sorry.
Okay,
good.

1702
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:51.780
Well,
I would think,

1703
02:05:51.781 --> 02:05:55.770
I would think that we can find agreement about that because partly because of

1704
02:05:55.771 --> 02:05:57.090
your psychoanalytic background,

1705
02:05:57.091 --> 02:06:02.040
you know perfectly well that were subject to forces within us that aren't of our

1706
02:06:02.041 --> 02:06:06.690
voluntary control and certainly happiness is one of those because you cannot

1707
02:06:06.691 --> 02:06:11.520
will yourself to be happy.
You might be able to will yourself to be unhappy,

1708
02:06:11.850 --> 02:06:13.650
but you can't will yourself to be happy.

1709
02:06:14.130 --> 02:06:17.550
There are certain preconditions that have to be met that are quite mysterious in

1710
02:06:17.551 --> 02:06:22.551
order for you to be happy and then it happens and then maybe if you're wise you,

1711
02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:28.160
you regard that as as a like an a minor in comprehensible miracle that somehow

1712
02:06:29.161 --> 02:06:31.440
you happen to be in the right place at the right time.

1713
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:36.830
Now I've made the case that the most effective means of pursuing the good life,

1714
02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:41.790
which is not the same as pursuing happiness,

1715
02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:46.200
is to adopt something like a stance of maximal responsibility towards the

1716
02:06:46.201 --> 02:06:49.860
suffering and malevolence in the world and I think that that should be pursued

1717
02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:52.710
primarily as an individual responsibility.

1718
02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:57.780
It's not like I don't think that political and familial larger organizations are

1719
02:06:57.781 --> 02:06:58.411
necessary,

1720
02:06:58.411 --> 02:07:03.411
but in the final analysis we'd suffer alone in some fundamental sense and we

1721
02:07:04.111 --> 02:07:07.950
have our own malevolence to contend with in some fundamental sense and the

1722
02:07:07.951 --> 02:07:10.800
proper beginning of moral behavior,

1723
02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:15.600
which is that proper beginning of the right way to act in the world is to take

1724
02:07:15.601 --> 02:07:16.800
responsibility for that.

1725
02:07:17.070 --> 02:07:21.900
I think you do what you can to conceptualize the highest good that you can

1726
02:07:21.901 --> 02:07:25.980
conceptualize.
That's the first thing,
to develop a vision of what might be,

1727
02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:29.550
and it has to be a personalized vision as well as a universalized vision.

1728
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:34.740
And then you work diligently to ensure that your actions are in keeping with

1729
02:07:34.741 --> 02:07:35.290
that.

1730
02:07:35.290 --> 02:07:40.290
And you allow yourself on that pursuit to be informed by the knowledge of your

1731
02:07:41.231 --> 02:07:46.231
ignorance and the necessity for acting and speaking in truth.

1732
02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:50.230
And a fair bit of that I believe is derived.

1733
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:54.610
I think it's fair to say that that's derived from an underlying Judaeo Christian

1734
02:07:54.611 --> 02:07:59.170
ethic.
And I make no bones about the fact that I think of those stories,
um,

1735
02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:04.500
metaphysically or it philosophically or psychologically as fundamental to the

1736
02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:11.160
proper functioning of our society in so far as it can function properly.

1737
02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:13.510
And so it's not happiness.

1738
02:08:13.511 --> 02:08:17.950
It's meaning and meaning is to be found in the adoption of responsibility.

1739
02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:20.110
And then I'll close with this.

1740
02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:24.130
And responsibility is not only to do what you believe to be right,

1741
02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:27.040
that's not cause that's duty.
That's not enough.

1742
02:08:27.250 --> 02:08:30.430
That's sort of what the conservatives put forward as the ultimate virtue,

1743
02:08:30.431 --> 02:08:33.760
which is duty.
It's not that it's,
it's that you're,

1744
02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:38.260
you're acting in a manner that is in accordance with what you believe to be

1745
02:08:38.261 --> 02:08:38.860
right,

1746
02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:43.600
but you're doing it in a manner that simultaneously expands your ability to do

1747
02:08:43.601 --> 02:08:48.010
it,
which means that you cannot stay safely ensconced within the confines of your

1748
02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:49.240
current ethical beliefs.

1749
02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:53.740
You have to stand on the edge of what you know and encounter continually the

1750
02:08:53.741 --> 02:08:58.741
consequences of your ignorance to expand your domain of knowledge and ability so

1751
02:08:59.381 --> 02:09:01.930
that you're not only acting in an efficient manner,

1752
02:09:01.931 --> 02:09:05.920
but you're increasing the efficiency and productivity and meaningfulness of what

1753
02:09:05.921 --> 02:09:09.130
it is that you're engaged in.
And I think that,

1754
02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:12.850
and I believe that the psychological evidence supports this.

1755
02:09:12.851 --> 02:09:17.851
Even the neuropsychological evidence is that that's when true happiness descends

1756
02:09:18.551 --> 02:09:22.990
upon you because it's an indication from the deepest recesses of your psyche,

1757
02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:27.130
biologically instantiated,
that you're in the right place at the right time.

1758
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:28.750
You're doing what you should be doing,

1759
02:09:28.751 --> 02:09:32.170
but you're doing it in a manner that expands your capacity to do even better

1760
02:09:32.171 --> 02:09:34.870
things in the future.
And,
and that's the,

1761
02:09:34.871 --> 02:09:38.680
I think that's the deepest human instinct there is.
It's not rational.

1762
02:09:38.681 --> 02:09:42.610
It's far deeper than that and it's something that it's something that's genuine

1763
02:09:42.611 --> 02:09:47.020
and that exists within us and that constitutes a proper guide if you don't

1764
02:09:47.021 --> 02:09:51.620
pervert it with just self deception and deceit.
So that's my first

1765
02:09:51.810 --> 02:09:56.810
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>

1766
02:09:59.970 --> 02:10:04.740
<v 6>Yeah.
Okay.
I'll try if you're stupid enough to believe me to be brief.</v>

1767
02:10:04.890 --> 02:10:07.430
Yeah.
Furnished.

1768
02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:10.330
I liked very much what you began with this

1769
02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:16.290
gray or whatever we call it,
moment of happiness.

1770
02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:22.020
And uh,
I would like to,
would you agree that the same goes for love?

1771
02:10:22.050 --> 02:10:25.340
I think we have a new dean in [inaudible] in France.

1772
02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:26.940
I don't know if he not their language.

1773
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:30.630
Dicavid do you use the verb to fall in love,

1774
02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:32.940
which means it's in this sense,

1775
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:37.550
in some sense of fall you or surprised you or shocked.

1776
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:42.380
Authentic love.
I think it's something very traumatic.
Even in this sense.

1777
02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:47.300
I always like to use this example.
Let's say you leave a stupidly happy life,

1778
02:10:47.630 --> 02:10:50.810
maybe one night stand here and there.
You drink with friends,

1779
02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:53.330
then you fall in love passionately.

1780
02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:58.220
This is in some sense a catastrophe for your life.
All the balance is lost.
Yes.

1781
02:10:58.240 --> 02:10:59.450
So all,
you know,

1782
02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:04.810
so that's why it has arrows.
Sorry.
Yeah,
yeah.
Right.

1783
02:11:04.830 --> 02:11:09.590
Yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.
So,
uh,
but uh,
uh,

1784
02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:13.680
when I first second,
surprisingly maybe for you,

1785
02:11:13.850 --> 02:11:18.850
I agree with your point about Judeo Christian legacy for which I am very much

1786
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:25.910
attacked,
Eurocentric and so on and so on.
You know,

1787
02:11:26.630 --> 02:11:29.900
I wonder if you would agree with it.
I will try to condense it very much.

1788
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:32.750
You know,
what's,
for me,
the deepest,

1789
02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:38.260
I simplify it to the utmost something unheard off and I as an eight A's accept

1790
02:11:39.201 --> 02:11:42.920
the spiritual value of it happens in Christianity,

1791
02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:46.640
in other religions.
You have got up there,

1792
02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:48.530
we fall from God,

1793
02:11:48.710 --> 02:11:53.710
and then we try to climb back through spiritual discipline in whatever training,

1794
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:56.900
good deeds and so on and so on.

1795
02:11:57.470 --> 02:12:02.390
The former of Christianity is a totally different one is we philosophers would

1796
02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:06.770
have put it,
uh,
you don't climb to God.

1797
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:10.760
God,
you are free in a Christian sense.

1798
02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:15.820
When you discover that the distance that separates you from God is inscribed

1799
02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:17.780
into God himself.

1800
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:22.930
That's why I agree with those intelligent geologists like my favorite Gilbert

1801
02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:26.450
Keith Chesterton who said that this,
the cross,

1802
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:31.480
the crucifixion is something absolutely unique because in that moment of alien,

1803
02:12:32.081 --> 02:12:34.280
the Llama,
Starbuck,
God father,

1804
02:12:34.281 --> 02:12:38.150
why have you abandoned me for a brief moment?

1805
02:12:38.151 --> 02:12:40.640
Symbolically got himself,

1806
02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:43.970
becomes an eighties in the sense of,
you know,

1807
02:12:43.971 --> 02:12:48.971
you get get there and that is something so absolutely unique.

1808
02:12:49.970 --> 02:12:54.800
It means that you are not simply separated from God.

1809
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:59.950
Your separation from God is part of divinity itself and we can then put it also

1810
02:13:01.521 --> 02:13:04.700
in other terms,
maybe closer to you like that.

1811
02:13:06.590 --> 02:13:11.330
That's why for me,
happiness is not some blissful unity,

1812
02:13:11.331 --> 02:13:15.890
which highest value.
It's the very struggle,
the fall and so on.

1813
02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:21.010
And that's why I hope we both worry about what will this possibility of

1814
02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:23.120
so-called,
I'm horrified with it,

1815
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:28.270
what Ray Kurzweil calls singularity and this blissful state I prefer not to know

1816
02:13:29.391 --> 02:13:31.990
about,
but the final point,
very brief,
uh,

1817
02:13:32.990 --> 02:13:36.960
what I only don't quite get.

1818
02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:40.620
Why do you put so much access to this?

1819
02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:45.800
We have to begin with the person with personal trainers.

1820
02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:48.910
I mean this is also the second tour.
[inaudible] I don't remember,

1821
02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:53.400
forgive me of your slogans in your book,
you know,

1822
02:13:53.401 --> 02:13:56.550
first set your house in order then,

1823
02:13:57.060 --> 02:14:00.750
but I have an extremely common sense,
naive question here,

1824
02:14:01.110 --> 02:14:04.470
but what if in trying to set your house in order,

1825
02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:09.540
you discover that your house in is in this order?

1826
02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:14.820
Precisely because the way the society is messed up with doesn't mean,

1827
02:14:14.970 --> 02:14:17.670
okay,
let's forget about my house.

1828
02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:20.700
But you can do both at the same time.

1829
02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:25.820
And I would even say I will give you now the ultimate example yourself,

1830
02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:27.901
isn't it?

1831
02:14:27.901 --> 02:14:32.901
That you are so socially active because you realize that it's not enough to tell

1832
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:39.030
to your,
to your,
to your patients,
set your house in order.

1833
02:14:40.230 --> 02:14:42.970
March of the reason of why they are in disorder.

1834
02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:48.000
They're house is that there is some crisis in our society and so on and so on.

1835
02:14:48.361 --> 02:14:52.740
So my reproach to you benevolent would have been,

1836
02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:57.780
you know that joke.
Tea or coffee?
Yes,
please.
Like individual or social.

1837
02:14:57.930 --> 02:14:58.531
Yes please.

1838
02:14:58.531 --> 02:15:03.531
Because this is obvious in extreme situation like I hope we agree to say to

1839
02:15:04.231 --> 02:15:08.820
somebody in,
in North Korea,
set your house in order.

1840
02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:09.713
No,

1841
02:15:11.070 --> 02:15:16.070
but I think in some deeper sense it goes also for our societies.

1842
02:15:16.441 --> 02:15:20.910
I'm just repeating what you are telling you see some kind of associate crisis

1843
02:15:20.911 --> 02:15:25.911
and I don't see clearly why insist so much on this choice.

1844
02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:27.900
Because let's say just to finish,

1845
02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:32.340
I will give you an example that I think perfectly does it.

1846
02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:37.580
How do we usually deal with ecology by this false personalization?

1847
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:43.740
You know,
they tell you,
ah,
what did you do?

1848
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:48.660
Did you put all the coke cans on the side?
Did you recycle old paper?

1849
02:15:48.661 --> 02:15:52.440
And so yes we should do this.
But you know,

1850
02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:55.560
like I,
in a way,

1851
02:15:55.561 --> 02:16:00.561
this is also a very easy way to discharge yourself as like you say,

1852
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:06.060
okay,
I do the recycling,
so up,
you know,
I did my duty,

1853
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:11.160
let's go on.
So I would just say why the choice there?
Okay.
So,
well,

1854
02:16:11.161 --> 02:16:13.320
so first of all I have to point out that it's,

1855
02:16:13.710 --> 02:16:18.420
you have unfairly tasked me with three very difficult questions.

1856
02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:21.430
And so I'm,
I'm hoping that I can then slide,

1857
02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:25.770
as you said,
life is a challenge.

1858
02:16:27.530 --> 02:16:30.010
So I'm going to,
I'm that I have the

1859
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:32.830
<v 4>mental wherewithal to keep them in track and answer them in order.</v>

1860
02:16:32.831 --> 02:16:34.540
But you can help me if I stray.

1861
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:39.750
I was very interested in your comments about the,
about,
um,

1862
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:43.270
Christ's atheism on,
on the cross,

1863
02:16:43.271 --> 02:16:45.940
that final moment of atheism that that's something I,

1864
02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:51.300
I'd never thought about it in that way.
[inaudible] [inaudible] no,

1865
02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:55.960
no,
it's a,
it's a very,
it's a very interesting thought because what it,
what it,

1866
02:16:56.410 --> 02:16:57.310
it's a really,

1867
02:16:57.311 --> 02:17:02.311
it's an unbelievably merciful idea in some sense that the burden of life is so

1868
02:17:04.481 --> 02:17:08.950
unbearable.
And you see in the Christian passion,

1869
02:17:08.951 --> 02:17:10.540
of course,
torture,

1870
02:17:11.650 --> 02:17:16.540
unfair judgment by society,
betrayal by friends and then,
and then,

1871
02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:20.560
uh,
uh,
low death.
And so that's,
that's kind of,

1872
02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:26.150
that's about as bad as it gets.
Right?
Which is why it's an architectural story,

1873
02:17:26.210 --> 02:17:27.830
right?
It's about as bad as it gets.

1874
02:17:28.430 --> 02:17:33.430
And the story that you describe points out that it's so bad that even God

1875
02:17:34.311 --> 02:17:39.311
himself might despair about the essential quality of being.

1876
02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:41.070
Yup.
Right,
right.

1877
02:17:41.071 --> 02:17:45.540
So and so that is merciful in some sense because it does say that there is

1878
02:17:45.541 --> 02:17:47.670
something that's built into the fabric of existence.

1879
02:17:47.671 --> 02:17:52.260
The tests are so severely in our faith about being itself that even got himself

1880
02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:58.140
falls prey to the temptation to doubt.
And if so,
that's okay.
Now

1881
02:18:01.290 --> 02:18:04.950
this is where things get very complicated because I want to use that in part

1882
02:18:04.951 --> 02:18:07.140
dance.
The other questions that you answered.

1883
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:09.360
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1884
02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:10.110
<v 4>look,
there's,</v>

1885
02:18:10.110 --> 02:18:15.110
there's a very large clinical literature that suggest that if you want to

1886
02:18:15.871 --> 02:18:17.880
develop optimal resilience,

1887
02:18:18.730 --> 02:18:22.050
and what you do is you lay out a pathway towards somewhere better,

1888
02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:24.870
someone comes in,
they have a problem,

1889
02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:28.110
you try to figure out what the problem is and then you try to figure out what

1890
02:18:28.111 --> 02:18:32.910
might constitute a solution.
And so you have something approximating a map,
right?

1891
02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:34.081
And it's a,

1892
02:18:34.081 --> 02:18:38.670
it's a tentative map of how to get from where things aren't so good to where

1893
02:18:38.671 --> 02:18:41.160
they're better.
And then you,

1894
02:18:41.570 --> 02:18:45.480
you have the person go out in the world and confront those things that they're

1895
02:18:45.481 --> 02:18:49.950
avoiding that are stopping them from moving towards that higher place.

1896
02:18:50.190 --> 02:18:54.030
And there's an archetypal reality to that.
It's you're in a fallen state,

1897
02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:58.470
you're attempting to redeem yourself and there's a process by which that has to

1898
02:18:58.471 --> 02:18:59.280
occur.

1899
02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:04.080
And that process involves voluntary confrontation with what you're afraid of

1900
02:19:04.081 --> 02:19:07.980
disgusted by an inclined to avoid.
And that works.

1901
02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:12.990
Every psychological school agrees upon that is that exposure therapy.

1902
02:19:12.991 --> 02:19:16.440
The psychoanalysts expose you to the tragedies of your past,
you know,

1903
02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:21.000
and and redeem you in that manner and the behaviorist expose you to the terrors

1904
02:19:21.001 --> 02:19:22.920
of the present and redeem you in that manner.

1905
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:27.030
But there's a grip broad agreement across psychological schools that that's
that.

1906
02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:32.740
And my sense is that we're called upon as individuals precisely to do that in

1907
02:19:33.771 --> 02:19:34.604
our life,

1908
02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:39.560
is that we are faced by this unbearable reality that you made reference to when

1909
02:19:39.561 --> 02:19:43.820
you talked about the situation on the cross is that life itself is

1910
02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:45.170
fundamentally,

1911
02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:49.460
and this is a pessimism that we might share is fundamentally suffering and

1912
02:19:49.461 --> 02:19:53.420
malevolence.
But,
and this is I think where we differ.

1913
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:58.700
I believe that the evidence suggests that the,

1914
02:19:59.060 --> 02:19:59.750
the,

1915
02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:04.160
the light that you discover in your life is proportionate to the amount of the

1916
02:20:04.161 --> 02:20:07.880
darkness that you're willing to forthrightly confront and that there's no

1917
02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:09.560
necessary upper limit to that.

1918
02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:14.090
So I think that the good that people are capable of his,
actually,

1919
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:18.860
it's a higher good than the evil that people are capable of.
And believe me,

1920
02:20:18.861 --> 02:20:22.880
I do not say that lightly given what I knew about the evil that people are

1921
02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:25.190
capable of.
And I think that,

1922
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:30.250
I believe that the central psychological message of the biblical Corpus

1923
02:20:30.561 --> 02:20:32.860
fundamentally is that that's why it,

1924
02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:37.880
it culminates in some sense with the idea that it's necessary to adopt.

1925
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:39.170
It's,

1926
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:43.760
it's necessary to confront the devil and to except your,

1927
02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:45.050
what would you say?

1928
02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:50.500
You're the unjustness of you're tortured mortality if you can do that and that,

1929
02:20:51.111 --> 02:20:53.270
and that's a,
it's a challenge as you just pointed out,

1930
02:20:53.271 --> 02:20:57.170
that that's sufficient to challenge even God himself,
that you have the,

1931
02:20:57.650 --> 02:21:02.420
you have the best chance of transcending it and living the kind of life that

1932
02:21:02.421 --> 02:21:06.920
will set your house in order and everyone's house in order.
At the same time.

1933
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:11.420
And so I think that's even true in states like North Korea and like I'm not

1934
02:21:11.421 --> 02:21:16.421
asking people to foolishly immolate themselves for pointless reasons.

1935
02:21:16.641 --> 02:21:17.570
You know,
if I'm a,

1936
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:21.380
when I'm working with people who are clinic clinically and they have a terrible

1937
02:21:21.381 --> 02:21:23.840
oppressor,
who's their boss at work,

1938
02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:27.830
I don't suggest that they march in and tell them exactly what they think of them

1939
02:21:27.831 --> 02:21:31.070
and end up on the street.
It's not helpful,
you know?

1940
02:21:31.430 --> 02:21:36.110
And so the pathway towards adopting individual responsibility happens to be a

1941
02:21:36.111 --> 02:21:37.190
very individual one.

1942
02:21:37.370 --> 02:21:42.370
But I do believe that the best bet for most people is to solve the problems that

1943
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:44.240
be set them in their own lives,

1944
02:21:44.241 --> 02:21:48.560
the ethical problems that be set them that they know our problems and that they

1945
02:21:48.561 --> 02:21:52.880
can set themselves together well enough so that they can then become capable of

1946
02:21:52.881 --> 02:21:57.320
addressing larger scale problems without falling prey to some of the errors that

1947
02:21:57.350 --> 02:21:58.520
characterize,
let's say,

1948
02:21:58.521 --> 02:22:03.521
over optimistic and intellectually arrogant ideologues that I'll pose while you

1949
02:22:05.961 --> 02:22:08.330
have a let me close with one thing.

1950
02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:12.050
One of my favorite quotes from Carl Young,

1951
02:22:12.051 --> 02:22:14.840
it's actually a quote that I used at the beginning of my first book,

1952
02:22:14.841 --> 02:22:16.100
which was called maps of meaning,

1953
02:22:16.101 --> 02:22:21.050
was that if you take a personal problem seriously enough,

1954
02:22:21.890 --> 02:22:26.160
you will s Cymbalta obviously solve a social problem.
And this bears on,

1955
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:30.480
on your point because it's not like you're a small family.

1956
02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:35.040
Even the relationship between you and your wife is immune in some sense to the

1957
02:22:35.041 --> 02:22:37.020
broader social problems around you.

1958
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:40.590
And so let's say right now there's tremendous tension between men and women in

1959
02:22:40.591 --> 02:22:43.680
the West and that's certainly the case given the divorce rate,

1960
02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:46.270
let's say that would be some evidence.
Um,

1961
02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:51.240
and the later in later state ages that people are waiting to become,

1962
02:22:51.890 --> 02:22:55.650
uh,
to,
to,
to,
you know,
enter into permanent relationships.
There's a,

1963
02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:56.820
there's a real tension there.

1964
02:22:56.821 --> 02:23:01.080
And then if you do establish a relationship with a woman or a partner,

1965
02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:04.410
but we'll say a woman in this particular case,
um,

1966
02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:09.980
you are instantly faced with all of the sociological problems in a microcosm,

1967
02:23:10.261 --> 02:23:13.710
in that relationship.
And then if you work those damn problems out,

1968
02:23:13.711 --> 02:23:16.980
if you can work them out within your relationship,
then you can get some insight.

1969
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:18.360
It's not complete insight,

1970
02:23:18.570 --> 02:23:22.740
but you can get some partial insight into what the problem actually is and get

1971
02:23:22.741 --> 02:23:27.741
the diagnosis right and you've moved some small measure forward in addressing

1972
02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:34.460
what might constitute the broader social concern and what's even better.

1973
02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:38.520
You're punished for your own goddamn mistakes.

1974
02:23:39.060 --> 02:23:42.630
And that's another thing I like about the idea of,
of working locally is that,

1975
02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:46.770
you know,
if I do broad scale social experiments and they fail,
it's like,
well,

1976
02:23:47.130 --> 02:23:49.110
tough luck for the people for whom they failed.

1977
02:23:49.350 --> 02:23:53.700
But if I'm experimenting on myself within the confines of my own relationship

1978
02:23:53.701 --> 02:23:57.870
and I make a mistake,
I'm going to feel the pain and then I,
and that's good.

1979
02:23:57.871 --> 02:24:00.690
That's just,
but it also gives me the possibility of learning.

1980
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:05.990
And so I believe that you do solve what you can about yourself first before you

1981
02:24:08.191 --> 02:24:12.300
can set your family's straight and before you should dare to try to set the

1982
02:24:12.301 --> 02:24:15.630
world straight.
Otherwise you degenerate into this kind of,

1983
02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:20.100
you've already talked about it,
this shallow moralizing the this,
well,

1984
02:24:20.101 --> 02:24:25.101
I've divided my goddamn coke cans up and now I can spend more money on new

1985
02:24:25.801 --> 02:24:28.140
packaging at the supermarket,

1986
02:24:28.141 --> 02:24:32.070
which is exactly what the psychological research indicates that people do.

1987
02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:36.000
If they perform a casual moral action,

1988
02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:38.550
they immediately justify

1989
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:45.110
committing a less moral action because they've put themselves in a higher moral

1990
02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:48.630
place and you might,
if you are a real pessimist,
you'd say,

1991
02:24:48.631 --> 02:24:50.850
well that's why they perform the action to begin with.

1992
02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:54.420
I think that's often true as associated with that shell or moralized

1993
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:59.630
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

1994
02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:05.740
<v 6>again,
I've been putting my stallion [inaudible] uh,</v>

1995
02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:08.920
what do you go at parish to say who needs the people?

1996
02:25:08.921 --> 02:25:13.360
We talk for the people and we know better than the paper.
No,

1997
02:25:13.450 --> 02:25:14.640
because I don't want,

1998
02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:18.850
don't want to take too much of the time for the public,

1999
02:25:18.851 --> 02:25:20.410
but you know what interests me.

2000
02:25:20.411 --> 02:25:23.790
Would you then agree because this is how Cagle rich,

2001
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:28.830
the story of the fall that fall really is fairly cold pack in the sense that for

2002
02:25:29.021 --> 02:25:32.950
Hagle before the fall,
we are simply animals.

2003
02:25:33.010 --> 02:25:34.570
It's through the fall.

2004
02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:39.430
Did you perceive goodness s what?

2005
02:25:39.490 --> 02:25:41.440
We'll drag you out of the fall.

2006
02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:45.910
So in this sense fall if constitutive of the very,
you know,

2007
02:25:45.970 --> 02:25:50.970
it's not you fall from goodness you fall and that's that the electrical paradox,

2008
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:56.790
your fault retroactively creates what you fell from as it were.

2009
02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:03.200
And that's the tough lesson for trip Miraleste to,
uh,
to,
uh,

2010
02:26:03.430 --> 02:26:07.850
to accept.
But,
uh,
you know,
where I see very briefly maybe a counter questions.

2011
02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:11.140
What fascinates me,
we didn't cover this,
I didn't cover this,

2012
02:26:11.141 --> 02:26:15.340
but speaking about ideology,
would you agree?

2013
02:26:15.341 --> 02:26:18.970
What fascinates me more and tomorrow is,
uh,

2014
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:23.590
not Dick ideology in the sense of projects and so on.

2015
02:26:23.591 --> 02:26:27.010
In our cynical era,
people claim,
Oh,

2016
02:26:27.011 --> 02:26:31.720
we no longer take them seriously and swan,
but,
and here for me,

2017
02:26:31.721 --> 02:26:36.400
social dimensions enter entrust,
even our intimate space,

2018
02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:41.320
implicit beliefs,
it theological presu positions.
Why not,

2019
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:46.950
which we embody in our most common daily practices.

2020
02:26:47.801 --> 02:26:51.010
For example,
probably some of you already know it.

2021
02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:54.130
I will nonetheless repeat a very shortened version.

2022
02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:59.400
I was occupied at some point by the structure of toilets in western Europe.

2023
02:27:01.450 --> 02:27:03.520
I notice this especially,
yeah.
Yes,

2024
02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:08.470
specificity of German toilets where you know the street doesn't,

2025
02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:12.130
she doesn't disappear in water.
It is,
they're exposed to that.

2026
02:27:12.130 --> 02:27:15.640
You smell it and control it for whatever.

2027
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:20.790
And I immediately associated with German spirit of poetry and reflection and

2028
02:27:22.410 --> 02:27:26.260
it's a bad joke.
But what I'm saying is that in a sense,

2029
02:27:26.290 --> 02:27:31.210
and I've spoken with some specialists,
I was so intrigued by,
uh,

2030
02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:36.240
of how do construct toilets and they admitted it.
There is no direct,

2031
02:27:36.241 --> 02:27:39.430
a direct utilitarian reason.

2032
02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:44.520
It is as if even in something as vulgarus going to the toilet in theology in

2033
02:27:45.911 --> 02:27:47.950
this deeper sense.

2034
02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:51.880
Is there another thing that at the same level,
I repeat,

2035
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:56.910
one of my old jokes that fascinates me intensely is how it's not just as

2036
02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:00.310
superficial psycho analyst claim.

2037
02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:05.640
We pretend to be moral to believe but deeply we are cynical egotists quite often

2038
02:28:06.701 --> 02:28:11.470
in today's times we think that we are free,
permissive and so on,

2039
02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:16.750
but secretly we are dominated by an entire pathological or not even often

2040
02:28:16.751 --> 02:28:21.620
pathological structure of prohibitionists and so on.
So we may,

2041
02:28:21.770 --> 02:28:26.770
and this is what interests me so much precisely in today's time where Dickies,

2042
02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:32.080
how would you agree?
We will explain the Hempel effect,

2043
02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:35.810
which may appear we are the cow apparently day,

2044
02:28:35.811 --> 02:28:37.970
so they tell us we live in,

2045
02:28:38.130 --> 02:28:41.880
but initially if times take your pleasure mate,
enjoy it.

2046
02:28:42.050 --> 02:28:47.050
But at the same time there is probably some clinicians are telling me more

2047
02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:50.570
frigidity and impotence than ever.
Yes.

2048
02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:55.910
The lesson of Pica and Leds,
I hope we agree,
is not this vulgar one.

2049
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:58.760
You are cannot perform sexually.

2050
02:28:58.761 --> 02:29:01.700
You go to a site called the [inaudible],

2051
02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:05.270
he teaches you how to get rid of authority and Travon.

2052
02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:08.760
It's a much more complex situation.
It's a,

2053
02:29:09.350 --> 02:29:12.530
and this is what interests me immensely.

2054
02:29:12.650 --> 02:29:17.450
All this set of implicit belief SCO you don't even know,
but you,

2055
02:29:17.810 --> 02:29:22.130
you know,
I will repeat the story that half of you know.
And you my favorite,

2056
02:29:22.430 --> 02:29:24.650
that Neil's bar anecdote.

2057
02:29:24.770 --> 02:29:27.470
You know he had the house outside Copenhagen,

2058
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:29.810
the quantum physics guy,

2059
02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:34.570
and he had a horse to a superstitious above each door.

2060
02:29:34.590 --> 02:29:38.270
Yes.
And then a friend asked him,
but do you believe you need,
why do heavy dead?

2061
02:29:38.271 --> 02:29:41.780
And he said,
of course,
no time.
The scientist why didn't do heavy dad,

2062
02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:46.090
because I was told it works.
The idea is it's prevent evil spirits.

2063
02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:49.550
I to enter the health.
It works.
Even if you don't believe me.

2064
02:29:50.350 --> 02:29:54.380
If theology today,
that's today fundamental.
Okay,

2065
02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:56.150
<v 4>so,
so,
so</v>

2066
02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:02.920
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

2067
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:08.730
<v 6>I'd want to solicit from you patellar Joe.
Don't you see that people,</v>

2068
02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:11.500
I think,

2069
02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:13.060
<v 4>I think that people are,</v>

2070
02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:18.600
are possessed by ideas that aren't theirs there.

2071
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:20.750
Yeah.
And their personalities that aren't there.

2072
02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:24.460
And that's the great psychoanalytic insight.
It's not ideas,
it's personalities.

2073
02:30:24.461 --> 02:30:26.380
It's way worse than,
than ideas.

2074
02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:30.970
And some of those personalities might be the ones that are Sodi associated with

2075
02:30:30.971 --> 02:30:35.971
the idea that freedom is found in maximizing hedonistic moment to moment

2076
02:30:36.521 --> 02:30:40.780
pleasure or something like that,
which sounds like freedom.
Like for me,

2077
02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:46.720
one of the things that I suggest to people is that they watch themselves as if

2078
02:30:46.721 --> 02:30:50.590
they do not understand who they are or what they're ruled by.

2079
02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:54.670
And then notice those times when they're there,

2080
02:30:55.090 --> 02:30:56.930
they're where they should be.
That,

2081
02:30:57.220 --> 02:31:00.400
and that's back to our discussion about meaning rather than happiness.

2082
02:31:00.401 --> 02:31:05.200
It's like you'll see there are times in your life where you're somewhere or

2083
02:31:05.201 --> 02:31:09.610
you've done something and all of a sudden you're,
you're together.
You're,

2084
02:31:09.611 --> 02:31:14.170
you're where you should be.
Your conscience is not disturbing you.
You're,
you're,

2085
02:31:14.290 --> 02:31:17.320
you're not proud of what you did because pride is the wrong term,

2086
02:31:17.321 --> 02:31:21.780
but you understand deeply you've done something that you should have done.

2087
02:31:22.110 --> 02:31:25.170
You might not understand why,
you might not even understand what it is,

2088
02:31:26.010 --> 02:31:31.010
but the study of that can help elucidate the difference between what actually

2089
02:31:32.191 --> 02:31:35.490
constitutes you is a very difficult thing to discover.

2090
02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:40.500
And what constitutes the accretion that characterizes you because of the,

2091
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:45.570
well,
let's say you're intense.
You're intense proclivity for socialized mimicry.

2092
02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:49.470
And so,
you know,
you're,
I don't mean you personally,

2093
02:31:49.471 --> 02:31:54.471
but people are amalgams of everything they've seen and everything they've been

2094
02:31:55.840 --> 02:32:00.750
personally,
they've watched it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And everything they've read.
And,

2095
02:32:00.810 --> 02:32:05.810
and to integrate that and define tha tha tha tha tha tha truth,

2096
02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:10.440
that constitutes,
that integration isn't incredibly difficult endeavor.

2097
02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:15.300
And one of the reasons why in 12 rules for life,
for example,
I suggested that,

2098
02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:19.920
oh,
try to tell the truth or at least don't lie,
is because one of the ways,

2099
02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:24.720
apart from pursuing what you,
what appears to you to be meaningful,

2100
02:32:25.170 --> 02:32:30.170
one of the ways of escaping from that possession by the kind of videology that

2101
02:32:30.721 --> 02:32:33.060
you're describing,
which is like it.
It's like a,

2102
02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:37.660
it's like an unconscious of unidentified axioms.
It's something like that.

2103
02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:39.600
Even though they take personified form,

2104
02:32:39.601 --> 02:32:44.130
they're like personalities is to stop saying things.

2105
02:32:44.131 --> 02:32:47.790
You know not to be true.
It's a nice pathway forward.

2106
02:32:47.791 --> 02:32:50.730
It's the original rule was tell the truth and I thought,
no,

2107
02:32:50.731 --> 02:32:55.260
that's not any good because you're so biased and limited and ignorant and

2108
02:32:55.290 --> 02:32:58.980
possess that you don't know what the truth is and so you can't be asked to tell

2109
02:32:58.981 --> 02:32:59.100
it,

2110
02:32:59.100 --> 02:33:04.100
but everyone does have the experience of being about to say or do something that

2111
02:33:05.971 --> 02:33:07.890
they know by their own.

2112
02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:15.340
They know as deeply as they can know anything about themselves that that outer

2113
02:33:15.671 --> 02:33:20.350
rinse or action is wrong and they still do it.
Now,

2114
02:33:20.351 --> 02:33:21.550
my suggestion is

2115
02:33:23.970 --> 02:33:25.650
try to stop doing that.

2116
02:33:26.490 --> 02:33:30.480
And one of the consequences while you can try and small ways like you might not

2117
02:33:30.481 --> 02:33:31.920
be able to manage it in big ways,

2118
02:33:31.921 --> 02:33:35.790
but now and then you know you're tempted to do something that you know to be

2119
02:33:35.791 --> 02:33:39.240
wrong and you could not do it.

2120
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:44.750
And if you practice that you get better and better at not doing it and that

2121
02:33:44.821 --> 02:33:49.821
means you lie less and you and you take the easy route out lesson you pursue.

2122
02:33:50.130 --> 02:33:53.520
He dawn it,
pleasures that cost you in the future less.

2123
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:57.090
You start to straighten yourself out,
you take the beam out of your eye,

2124
02:33:57.240 --> 02:33:58.710
that's essentially what you're doing.

2125
02:33:59.010 --> 02:34:04.010
And over time you have some modicum of hope that your vision will clear up and

2126
02:34:05.131 --> 02:34:07.860
you'll be able to see the proper pathway forward.

2127
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:11.370
And that's part of the process of redemption.

2128
02:34:11.730 --> 02:34:16.650
And it seems to me to be in your grasp.
You're capable of doing that.

2129
02:34:16.651 --> 02:34:17.650
You have conscience,

2130
02:34:17.651 --> 02:34:21.280
it doesn't form you from time to time correctly about the difference between

2131
02:34:21.281 --> 02:34:23.770
good and evil.
The consequence,
the knowledge,

2132
02:34:23.771 --> 02:34:25.750
the consequence of the fold that you described,

2133
02:34:25.751 --> 02:34:30.751
which I think you described it very eloquent terms and that you can slowly make

2134
02:34:31.271 --> 02:34:36.271
your way back to the straight and narrow path that's characterized by maximal

2135
02:34:36.971 --> 02:34:37.570
meaning,

2136
02:34:37.570 --> 02:34:42.570
but also see the this instinct of meaning is a sophisticated one.

2137
02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:48.040
It's not that I'm making a case for the individual,

2138
02:34:48.041 --> 02:34:51.850
like Ayn rand makes a case for the individual.
That's not it.

2139
02:34:51.851 --> 02:34:55.720
I'm making a case for individual responsibility.
That's not the same thing.

2140
02:34:55.721 --> 02:34:58.120
It's like there is something that's good for you,

2141
02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:02.470
but it has to also be good for your family.
If it's just good for you,

2142
02:35:02.471 --> 02:35:03.610
that's not good enough,

2143
02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.540
and if it's good for you and your family and it's not good for society,

2144
02:35:07.541 --> 02:35:09.070
then that's not good enough either.

2145
02:35:09.550 --> 02:35:14.550
And so the responsibility is to find a pathway that balances these things in a

2146
02:35:14.561 --> 02:35:16.040
harmonious manner.
It's like,
uh,

2147
02:35:16.270 --> 02:35:19.600
I got a lot of this thinking from John Piaget and his idea of vehicle and

2148
02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:21.500
braided states,
right,
is you're,

2149
02:35:21.501 --> 02:35:26.050
you're attempting to find something like a game that everyone is willing to play

2150
02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:30.670
that can be played in an iterative manner and not degenerate.
Well,

2151
02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:33.520
hopefully actually ascend if that's possible,

2152
02:35:33.521 --> 02:35:37.600
hopefully become a better and better game across time.
And I do believe that.

2153
02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:39.640
I do believe that you can do that.

2154
02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:42.610
I do believe that you can do that if you're guided by truth.

2155
02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:46.360
And I do believe that the pathway to that is the phenomenology of meaning.

2156
02:35:46.690 --> 02:35:51.690
And then the secondary consequence of that is if you do that now and then you

2157
02:35:52.301 --> 02:35:56.590
might be happy and then you should be profoundly grateful because happiness as

2158
02:35:56.591 --> 02:36:00.850
we already agreed upon is something like a grace.
What basically,

2159
02:36:01.050 --> 02:36:01.883
<v 0>sorry,</v>

2160
02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:08.010
<v 6>I gave,
okay,
my best and museum come here.
I agree with you.</v>

2161
02:36:08.460 --> 02:36:13.350
But the danger here,
here he,
they all look,
he can massively enter,

2162
02:36:13.351 --> 02:36:17.470
you describe a nice situation you are attempt at or [inaudible] or whatever to

2163
02:36:17.471 --> 02:36:21.840
do something that you know it's wrong.
But

2164
02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:28.520
folk up totalitarian ideologies step in at this point and try to present to you

2165
02:36:31.831 --> 02:36:36.831
that the true greatness to do what you individually think it's wrong for the

2166
02:36:38.671 --> 02:36:42.630
higher costs.
You know who says this wonderfully,
Eh,
Eh,

2167
02:36:43.010 --> 02:36:46.160
according bird guy,
not uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

2168
02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:51.050
how many [inaudible] of s s no,
no,
no.
Sorry.
Seriously.
No,

2169
02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:53.430
he,
he,
he knew the problem.
Yes.

2170
02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:58.250
German office setups must do horrible things.
Yes,
he'll do it.

2171
02:36:58.310 --> 02:37:03.310
And solution was Dabora first to let them know [inaudible] every EDL,

2172
02:37:05.610 --> 02:37:09.000
IDL,
okay,
ordinary men can do something great.

2173
02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:13.410
Maybe not all sacrifice himself for his country,

2174
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:15.920
but his reply was,
his point was,

2175
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:21.010
but it takes a truly great men to be ready to lose his soul and to do horrible

2176
02:37:22.311 --> 02:37:23.890
things for his country.
Yeah.

2177
02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:29.170
And I read some good memoirs of relatively honest communists who broke down when

2178
02:37:31.041 --> 02:37:34.730
they were sent to the countryside for me in early thirties.

2179
02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:39.470
And this is what,
this is what they were told by apparat chick.

2180
02:37:39.530 --> 02:37:43.490
You will see horrible things till and starving and Chavon.

2181
02:37:43.850 --> 02:37:48.850
Remember there is the higher costs and your highest ethical duty is to is to

2182
02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:56.620
overcome this small bourgeois sentimentality and so here I see the danger of

2183
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:59.240
again my pessimism,

2184
02:37:59.390 --> 02:38:03.620
false meaning which can massively cover this false narrative.

2185
02:38:03.770 --> 02:38:08.400
Second thing also the solution by,
I wonder if you share this pessimism of mine,

2186
02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:13.640
another one by him let you know what was his sacred book I read,

2187
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:18.910
he all the time had a special leather bound copy in his pocket.

2188
02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:24.170
Bhava got Gita,
he must've Lee.
He said he probably was at least one.

2189
02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:25.370
He puts it perfectly.

2190
02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:30.560
Nazi officers have to do assess horrible things.

2191
02:38:31.010 --> 02:38:36.010
How to enable them to do it without themselves becoming curable beings.

2192
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:42.620
He solution was oriental wisdom to learn to act from distance.

2193
02:38:42.650 --> 02:38:47.210
I am not really there and this is was the sock of my life based on this.

2194
02:38:47.211 --> 02:38:51.530
Do you know the book?
I found a book.
The guidance wrote many books.
Brian,

2195
02:38:51.531 --> 02:38:55.310
Victoria Zen at war.
It's a shocking book,

2196
02:38:55.340 --> 02:39:00.340
especially horrible for many so-called enter Eurocentric who flame out of

2197
02:39:00.631 --> 02:39:04.220
monotheism is guilty of everything we need oriented.
Yeah.

2198
02:39:04.221 --> 02:39:06.830
But that book is about the,

2199
02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.040
apart from a couple of exceptions,

2200
02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:15.190
the behavior of Zen Buddhist community in Japan in the thirties early forties

2201
02:39:18.590 --> 02:39:19.341
not only,

2202
02:39:19.341 --> 02:39:23.810
they totally supported Japanese expansion into,

2203
02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:29.270
into China,
they even provide that properly.

2204
02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:34.310
Zen Buddhist justification for it.
For example,
the one,
you know who did this?

2205
02:39:34.311 --> 02:39:39.110
No,
you are not as old as me.
I remember him [inaudible] Suzuki the great pre,

2206
02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:43.280
yeah.
But okay,
he was doing this in the 60s but as a younger guy,

2207
02:39:43.850 --> 02:39:48.850
he was fully supporting Japanese militarism and one of his justifications was

2208
02:39:49.131 --> 02:39:49.964
this one,

2209
02:39:50.090 --> 02:39:55.090
the advice to have Japanese military to them to support Zen Buddhist training

2210
02:39:56.810 --> 02:40:00.710
because he says it's one of the most horrifying thing that I've ever read.

2211
02:40:00.830 --> 02:40:03.270
He said,
sorry,
don't take no personally.

2212
02:40:03.290 --> 02:40:07.780
But let's say an officer orders me.
If I were to take these two,

2213
02:40:07.790 --> 02:40:11.880
it would be too obvious.
So APQ I have to kill you or stab you with my,

2214
02:40:11.970 --> 02:40:15.810
and he says,
if I remain in this illusionary shelf,

2215
02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:20.170
then I feel responsible,
I kill you.
But he says,

2216
02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:22.680
if you are enlightened by Zen Buddhism,

2217
02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:25.860
then you know there is no substantial reality.

2218
02:40:26.010 --> 02:40:29.820
You become a neutral observer of your life,

2219
02:40:29.850 --> 02:40:33.300
just a flow of phenomena and you tell yourself,

2220
02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:38.430
it's not that I'm killing you,
but in the cosmic dance of phenomena,

2221
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:43.340
my knife is floating and somehow your knife falls.

2222
02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:44.510
You know what I'm saying?
This,

2223
02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:48.600
I'm not disputing some spiritual greatness of Zen Buddhism.

2224
02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:53.880
I'm seeing how even the most enlightened,

2225
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:59.510
the spiritual experience can set up a teddy bear costs now because we're running

2226
02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:01.980
very quickly out of time

2227
02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:07.610
and it's clear that this conversation could go for a very long time.

2228
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:11.180
I'm going to ask one representative question here and I'll give you each one

2229
02:41:11.181 --> 02:41:13.160
minute each and that is,

2230
02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:17.390
and that is simply this coming from online.

2231
02:41:18.050 --> 02:41:22.910
<v 4>What is one thing you hope people will leave this debate with and why?</v>

2232
02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:25.713
<v 0>Jordan,</v>

2233
02:41:33.410 --> 02:41:33.610
<v 4>I,</v>

2234
02:41:33.610 --> 02:41:38.610
I hope they leave this debate with a belief in the power of communication

2235
02:41:39.541 --> 02:41:41.640
between people with different views.

2236
02:41:42.570 --> 02:41:42.850
<v 0>No,</v>

2237
02:41:42.850 --> 02:41:47.850
that's [inaudible]

2238
02:41:53.050 --> 02:41:57.630
<v 4>I mean there,
there,
there is this,
there is a growing idea on college campuses.</v>

2239
02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:02.560
Tell me if I go over my minute that there really is no such thing as free speech

2240
02:42:02.561 --> 02:42:06.160
because people are only the avatars of their group identity and they have

2241
02:42:06.161 --> 02:42:07.510
nothing unique to say.

2242
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:11.840
And besides that there's no communication across boundaries of identity,

2243
02:42:11.841 --> 02:42:13.210
your belief.
And,

2244
02:42:13.330 --> 02:42:18.010
and I think that that's an unbelievably dangerous and pernicious,

2245
02:42:18.430 --> 02:42:20.830
um,
uh,
doctrine.

2246
02:42:21.430 --> 02:42:23.890
And I think that people of goodwill,

2247
02:42:23.950 --> 02:42:28.950
despite their differences can communicate and they can both come out of that

2248
02:42:30.071 --> 02:42:34.930
communication improved even though there might be some dissent and some,

2249
02:42:35.470 --> 02:42:38.410
some dissent and some dissent on the way.

2250
02:42:38.770 --> 02:42:42.110
And so that's what I would hope people would come out of that.
Right.

2251
02:42:42.250 --> 02:42:47.250
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

2252
02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:50.050
<v 6>it'd be model concrete.</v>

2253
02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:53.170
Even politically there is today show,

2254
02:42:53.171 --> 02:42:58.171
it appears this big conflict between other debt both smarter and stop that you

2255
02:42:58.670 --> 02:43:03.670
oppose and this all trite and Shawan I hope can hear Lee debt we made at least

2256
02:43:06.371 --> 02:43:08.350
some people to think.

2257
02:43:08.410 --> 02:43:12.790
And to redirect this opposition there are quite reasonable.

2258
02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:18.960
The only alternative to all tonight is not a political correctness and so on.

2259
02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:24.580
And I know I'm speaking not for you but for me.
Please.

2260
02:43:24.850 --> 02:43:29.200
If you are a leftist,
don't feel obliged to be politically correct.

2261
02:43:31.530 --> 02:43:35.280
<v 0>Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid to be.</v>

2262
02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:37.153
And uh,

2263
02:43:37.850 --> 02:43:39.330
<v 6>thanks.
Thankfully.
Would you agree?</v>

2264
02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:44.360
One great version of not thinking is how immediately if they don't agree with

2265
02:43:45.451 --> 02:43:49.170
you,
you are labeled a fascist.
But that's the laziness.

2266
02:43:49.350 --> 02:43:52.020
People find something,
they don't agree with it.

2267
02:43:52.050 --> 02:43:54.930
Instead of thinking they think about something,

2268
02:43:54.970 --> 02:43:58.620
we all agreed was the best thing up.
You are a fascist and so on.

2269
02:43:58.770 --> 02:44:01.050
You know it's not as simple as that.

2270
02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:06.240
Even Trump of whom I am deeply critical.
No,
I'm sorry to tell you.

2271
02:44:06.241 --> 02:44:10.590
Yes,
he's the catastrophe in the long term and so on,
but he is not a factory.

2272
02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:14.310
You make it all too easy to play these games.

2273
02:44:14.490 --> 02:44:17.100
I blushed one not a positive result,

2274
02:44:17.101 --> 02:44:20.940
but to shatter a little bit too to make you think.

2275
02:44:21.330 --> 02:44:25.140
I have always felt that the greatest conversations or unfinished ones,

2276
02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:27.830
please join me in thanking slash [inaudible]

2277
02:44:27.890 --> 02:44:31.360
<v 0>in Jordan Peterson for a grade on finished conversation.</v>

2278
02:44:31.470 --> 02:44:36.470
[inaudible].
