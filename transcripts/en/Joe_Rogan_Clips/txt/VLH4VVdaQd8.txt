Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Do you see that male who identifies as a female just broke all these world records in weightlifting? The new one just came out. Wonderful. Congratulations. Everybody broke everything. Fucking so progressive and so preposterous that we broke everything. You have men that are women when women's world records in fucking weightlifting, which is like the dumbest shit I agree for men and women compete against. If there's ever one thing, even though I like the tennis argument, it's like, well, you know Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs. Yeah, but Bobby Riggs was 55 she was 29 and they say that he threw the match because he bet against himself. I'll write. He was a big gambler. That was what I heard. But yeah, I would say that too of I lost. Yeah. You know, let's say I threw the match. Yeah. Well, yeah. Basketball is 10 is this the woman? The One? Yes. Says Chelsea, this is, uh, the women who's winning is not Bruce Jenner records. Okay, let's get a look. Oh my goodness. Here we go. It seems like I go, Huh? That seems like a very strong man.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Yes. So how much weight is that? It doesn't look very a lot of weight. It's like, oh, this, this is all about, this is about reps here. 300 303 15 yeah. I'm like, okay, that's a ridiculous amount of weight for a woman to lift to [inaudible] for if you're going to be a real woman, biological woman, excuse me, and lift that kind of weight. You have to be a real outlier. Yeah. It's very rare. Yeah, but this is so ridiculous. Wow. Oh, what is this? This is, what does this guy's quote? What does it say? One guy in the comments say, congratulations on your excellent performance. Screw. Anybody who tries to knock achievements, the hard work speaks for itself. Hey, whoever you are, fuck you. Yeah, fuck you and your nonsense. You're the reason why this shit is happening in the first place because people tolerate this and that is nuts.

Speaker 1:          01:57          If you, if you had a daughter that trained her whole life to be a weightlifter and she's really into it and this fucking guy decides, he identifies as a woman and then compete as a woman in weightlifting, it's just fucking stop. Everybody just stopped. You're in crazy town. This is officially crazytown. Yeah, out of our fucking miles and how it's legal, what is illegal? It's, it has nothing to do with being open minded or tolerant. It has something to do with logic. Just basic reason. This is craziness. This is you're enabling people to do something that's preposterous. This is nothing to do with being open minded are kind to people. I'm 100% for people being trans. I'm 100% for people doing whatever they want to do. Just don't hurt anybody and I'm cool with that same Mary's, but this is just, you're in make believe town.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Why not? Pretend you're a fox and go live in the forest you're in. Make believe this is make believe you can't. You can't just decide you're a woman and compete with women, right? It's make belief you. Oh, I, there's no advantage. Make belief that's make believe it is. Michael is an advantage. Yeah, I fucking know there's an advantage. Yes. Everyone knows this is crazy. I want to uh, see that in the NFL. You know, you got like what does that before and after? Is it two different looks the same day to see this person is sick. I don't want to shame this person. Look, someone's letting her do this. Right. You know, it's nice. The problem. That's the problem. They should sit, there should be a transgender league, right? Or there should be some rules where you have to compete with the chromosome, your birth.

Speaker 1:          03:24          You don't have to fucking compete. Most people don't compete in organized sports. Most people don't know. And if you're trans, maybe that should be something you can't do it. And particularly for girls who transitioned to boys, you know that school in Texas that won't let this girl is transitioning to a boy, they won't let her compete with boys. So they make her compete with girls and she's on fucking testosterone. Right? So she's taking testosterone to be, or he's taking testosterone, whatever you want to say. I get so confused. Yeah. To become a board Zur is taking testosterone to become a boy. Yes. And then now is forced to wrestle with women. Yes. Young girls. Yeah. In fact, all jacked. Right Jack? Like a boy. It's like a boy wrestling girls. It's crazy. Probably pop a boner doing that. I don't think she has one yet. You can get a little thumb.

Speaker 1:          04:12          You grow a thumb. Yeah. That's what happens. Oh yeah. Yeah. The clearest gets a little bit bigger. Yeah. And did the ovary sort of like start getting suspended in a, I don't know, they come to these drops. What do they do? No wonder the wonder that if they remove those parts, you know, because they do, hysterectomy is on women when they have diseases. And what if they do that when a man, when a man transitions from a woman. Yeah. When a man transitions from a woman. Yeah. When you used to be a woman and now you're going into the dude. Yeah. What do they do? I just can't wait til the day where they can do it genetically. Where a woman really becomes a woman, like a man becomes a woman or a woman becomes a man. But guess what? Even if they do, here's the issue.

Speaker 1:          04:53          If you knew that a woman took steroids for 30 years and developed insane tendon strength and muscle strength and then stopped doing steroids, it is a scientific fact that you are going to keep a very big percentage of those gains. What are the games? What is the percentage that 30% or 40% whatever the fuck it is, whatever percentage that you would keep after you get off the steroids, that is significant in, even if you're not currently on these performance enhancing drugs, your body has been artificially boosted to the superior level through these drugs. Yeah. And you lose a lot of the feminine and you lose the breast. Yes. Does it might not come back? Um, well, I mean I think if you take estrogen, they'll probably call ray. I don't know. I'm not a fucking doctor. I'm a moron. I thought what I do know is when this is, we're in nonsense land.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Yeah, okay. It's not, it's not saying that someone can't become a woman and be a woman. I'll talk, I'll call them a woman. I'll treat him like a woman. I'm cool with it and I'm 100% cool that I'm in as open minded as I come with this. But this is, this is unfair for which is what's so ironic about this. Yeah. Cause everyone's supposed to be looking out for women. If you're looking out for women, but you're also blindly progressive to the point where you let and shit like this fly, well now you're not looking out for women. Right? Because now women are in this weird position where you're putting them there at an unfair disadvantage. Right. Fucking crazy. I agree. Goddamn. And it makes me want to drink real Heineken. I'm getting beyond this double zero. No, they're just sent this stuff to me. It's good. Yeah. Um, I used to love Heineken light. I talk about that subject a little bit too much, but it's just, it's a symptom of a sick society. It's a symptom of a lack of rational thinking. It's a symptom of people just just be being bending over backwards. So hard to be progressive and open minded that you're just, you're giving into these extremists, these crazy people that are looking at this thing completely delusional.
