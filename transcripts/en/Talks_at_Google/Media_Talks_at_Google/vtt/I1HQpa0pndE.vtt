00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.583
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Great, well, thank you

00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:04.312
all so much for coming and
braving the rainy weather

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:05.710
and dreariness.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.375
AUDIENCE: It's a
[INAUDIBLE] event.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:07.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: I know.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.709
I know.

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:11.120
But we got the hard-core
group here live in the room.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.980
But as we just mentioned
to our panelists,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.462
we actually have probably
several hundreds more

00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:18.170
around the world in
different time zones,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.229
watching you guys right now.

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:21.770
And we've got at
least a dozen people

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.353
saying, "Where's the
Livestream link?"

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:25.340
So just to let you
know that there

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.768
is a global audience that's
very interested in what

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:30.160
we're going to talk about.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.788
And so today we have our Senior
Director of Media and Social

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:35.328
Products, Richard
Gingras, hosting

00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:40.010
a panel of three very,
very respected editors

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.504
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:45.987 --> 00:00:47.278
RICHARD GINGRAS: Great, thanks.

00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:47.778
Whoops.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.545
Forgot to turn this back on.

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:56.090
Great.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.720
Well, thanks.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.440
Glad you're here, and everyone
else who's participating

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.040
remotely.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.860
I have to admit that
the title of this panel

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.615
is a little bit more pessimistic
than my own view of the future

00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:15.076
of investigative journalism.

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:17.450
And I'm going to just put out
a couple of quick thoughts.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.010
And obviously, I know
my panelists here

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.780
will be quick to
disagree, if they do.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.860
But that also makes
good conversation.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.000
The reason for my own optimism
is that with the internet,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.580
we have, obviously, this
tremendous ability for everyone

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.570
with good thoughts to
get them out there.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.080
We're not going
through gatekeepers.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.530
In fact, the very fact that
these organizations exist

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.780
is because we have this
extraordinary thing called

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.930
the internet.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.260
Secondly, I think we have
incredible new capabilities

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.970
available to us today to do
investigative work-- data

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.370
journalism being a
very key part of that.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.139
And actually,
that's particularly

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:13.420
important in a world where big
data is increasingly important,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.110
both for good and for bad.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.020
We see it abused and disabused.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.270
And certainly the
role of the press

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.020
in shining a light on how big
data is used with big data

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.470
analysis of its own, I
think, is really crucial.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.720
And in that regard, not
only data journalism,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.450
but I think we
have-- as you guys

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.180
have shown-- the opportunity
now to actually put out

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.290
important information
in different ways.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.640
In past realms, investigative
reporting was an article.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.680
Or five minutes on "60
Minutes" for a story.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.000
But we can now do things
in different ways.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.480
You can-- as
ProPublica has done--

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.820
create, in a sense, knowledge.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.380
Utilities that are evergreen
and can provide ongoing value

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.360
to audiences beyond the
instance of the article.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.200
I think these are hugely
important attributes

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.440
to the ecosystem as it evolves.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.390
And while not every
one might agree,

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.060
I would actually
put forth that I

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.990
think the state of
investigative journalism today

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.670
is even today better than
what it was 20 years ago.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.580
I think there's been no
small degree of romantization

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.940
of the past performance
of traditional media,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.120
when it comes to
investigative journalism.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.450
And now we have, I
think, many more voices

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.060
participating in doing
interesting things.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.060
But even if I'm wrong in
my current assessment,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.540
I think the opportunity,
the potential,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.470
to do more and do more
interesting things is really

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.750
quite significant.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.920
But I'm sure you guys will jump
in and tell me where I'm wrong.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.720
And I am, on a regular basis, as
many people in this room know.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.950
We won't pretend.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.630
So first, let me do just
a very quick introduction

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.400
of our panelists.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.300
Because then I'd like to turn
to them individually and let

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.660
them say a little bit
more about themselves,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.640
their organizations,
and frankly, what

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.150
drives their passion in
doing what they're doing.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.430
And particularly today,
because you are, really,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.700
at the creative edge of
investigative journalism today.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.570
So we have Robin Fields,
managing editor of ProPublica.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.962
ProPublica has been
around now, what?

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:39.003
ROBIN FIELDS: Since 2008.

00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:40.780
RICHARD GINGRAS: Since 2008.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.990
has done a tremendous
amount of exquisite work.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.640
Won, what, two Pulitzers now?

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.277
Just giving an indication of
the impact that they've had.

00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:51.360
So great to hear from you.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.970
And I know I've been
in my own conversations

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.970
with Paul Steiger
and Dick Tofel,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.710
it's just been very
impressive to see

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.870
how the organization
has evolved.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.760
In fact, Dick mentioned
to me recently

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.970
that you guys are actually
making money off of your data,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.350
which I'd love to hear more
about when we get to that.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.640
Alisa Barba is executive
editor of Inside Energy.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.930
Again, the kind of
organization and editorial

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.560
focus that we wouldn't likely
have seen 20, 30 years ago--

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.350
that focus on a specific
area where people feel

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.460
there's an important
amount of journalistic work

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.142
that needs to be done.

00:05:34.142 --> 00:05:36.100
So we'll love to hear
more about those efforts.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.100
And then Andy Donohue
from the Center

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.310
for Investigative Reporting,
based over in Berkeley,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.220
which has also done just ongoing
superb investigative work.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.110
Superb work in
beginning to evolve

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.800
the models of engagement,
of presentation, of how

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.740
one builds a credible brand
in the world of the internet

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.320
and works to get the
results of your efforts

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.660
out to ever-larger audiences.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.830
So I'm really honored to
have you all here today.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.240
I think it's so important
for all of us here at Google

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.000
to really see the faces
and the people who

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.420
do this extraordinarily
important work.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.660
Who take the risks and toil
hard for what is not likely

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.860
the most remunerative profession
you could have selected.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.440
So we'll start with Andy.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.830
A little bit more about
yourself and what drives you.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.830
ANDY ANDY DONOHUE: Sure.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.810
So I had sort of an
interesting moment college,

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.040
actually, as a
college journalist,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.030
where I was working on
one of my first stories

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.260
and trying to think of some
different ways of doing

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.760
a story.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.640
And I had my editor
tell me, "There

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.740
is no creativity in journalism."

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.260
That was a pretty
dispiriting remark

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.990
to hear as somebody
who was just getting

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.870
started who was really
interested in journalism,

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.207
but also trying to
think about doing things

00:07:08.207 --> 00:07:09.290
in a little different way.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.630
And what has been, I think,
most exciting to me in my career

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.710
and what's changed
in the last, maybe,

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.900
10 years is not that
there wasn't creativity

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.400
in journalism, but it's really
being unleashed right now.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.340
You just have so many
different models.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.550
So many different
ways of storytelling.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.370
And so many different types
of organizations and types

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.060
of reporting.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.010
Different technology.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.810
That not only is creativity
part of journalism,

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.810
but it's really, really,
highly valued right now.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.050
And it's part of the lifeboat,
everybody understanding

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:46.800
that this is how we
create the new journalism.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.780
My background is,
before being at CIR,

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.330
I was a Knight
Fellow at Stanford.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.390
And then also,
before that, I was

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.650
at Voice of San Diego,
which was a start-up-- one

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.630
of the first nonprofit
start-ups to pop up.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.920
We basically were
created because people

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.590
were very unhappy with the
local media in San Diego

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.580
and had wanted to create a
new publication for a really

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.750
long time.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.100
And every time
they looked at it,

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.390
they would get into the cost
of trying to print a newspaper,

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.990
buy all the paper, get
the trucks, the gas.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.920
All that infrastructure
took up 2/3 of your costs.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.920
And so it never made
sense, and they could never

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.710
scale it in an interesting way.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.650
And then in about
2004, we sort of

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:40.750
realized that the internet was
ready to hold a legitimate news

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.220
organization.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.090
And that for-profit
wasn't the way

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.230
to go, because the
advertising revenue was

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.030
starting to decline,
or going to decline.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.180
So we went non-profit,
and that's, I guess,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.760
the model that supports
all three of us here.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.940
ALISA ALISA BARBA:
Yeah, for good or bad.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.669
So I go back a lot
farther than a lot

00:09:05.669 --> 00:09:07.460
of people working in
journalism these days.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.010
And I was thinking about
this as I was coming up here,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.660
because part of what we're
going to be talking about

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.610
is the tools that we
use to do what we do.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.670
And I was thinking
about my earliest tool.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.200
This was 30 years ago,
and I was a news clipper

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.121
in the Newsweek
office in Beijing.

00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:24.620
So that was my first
journalism job.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.740
And there was this
little, teeny tool--

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.323
I don't know if
anybody remembers it--

00:09:27.323 --> 00:09:29.670
where you could actually
cut through the newspapers.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.170
Right?

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.067
You remember those?

00:09:31.067 --> 00:09:32.900
I went looking for it
this morning to bring.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.775
I wanted to show you.

00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:35.344
You'd clip the
newspaper articles

00:09:35.344 --> 00:09:37.010
and you'd stick it
in a folder and you'd

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.500
stick it in a big
filing cabinet.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.990
And this was your source
of information for stories

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.936
that you were doing.

00:09:41.936 --> 00:09:46.680
You had communism, Maoism,
agriculture, whatever.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.770
And in those days-- I
was trying to remember.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.974
I think, was it teletype
machine to send the stories

00:09:50.974 --> 00:09:51.515
from Beijing?

00:09:51.515 --> 00:09:52.860
I don't even remember.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.090
It eventually evolved
to fax machines.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.270
And then, obviously, to today.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.910
So Inside Energy, the
group that I work with,

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.240
is very, very small, certainly
compared to these guys.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.610
I have five reporters on staff.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.760
One is a data journalist.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.860
We're in the center of the
country-- Denver, Wyoming,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.710
and North Dakota.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.570
We're covering the energy boom.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.050
What's going on there.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.850
And we're trying
to figure it out.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.058
We're trying to make it work.

00:10:21.058 --> 00:10:21.920
We're public media.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.950
We do television
and we do radio.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.000
And we also do digital,
obviously, as everybody does.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.600
We have one data journalist.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.990
And we're trying to go
deep into these stories

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.185
and uncover the good, the bad,
and the ugly about the oil

00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:37.960
and gas boom and
what's going on there.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.720
We're doing it with
a very small staff.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.330
And I have some really great
questions for you guys,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.130
when that comes.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.088
RICHARD GINGRAS: Great.

00:10:45.088 --> 00:10:46.704
And Robin.

00:10:46.704 --> 00:10:50.250
ROBIN FIELDS: I started
at ProPublica in 2008,

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:55.440
when it was mostly an empty room
and sort of an idea for what

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.410
we'd like to accomplish.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.260
And our mission has
always been to do stories

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.670
that have an impact
and that spark change.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.510
And it's been amazing to
see, over the six years

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.120
that I've been there,
that we've been

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.390
able to accomplish that so much.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.220
It's just been an
amazing ride so far.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.340
We are nonprofit.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.610
Today we are not an
empty room at all.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.230
We're almost squeezing
out of our original space.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.710
We're 45 journalists,
ten of whom

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.360
are basically data
journalists and developers.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.540
And as Richard was saying,
data and data applications

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.100
are central to our work and
central to our mission, in that

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.190
not only do they allow us
to do the stories that we do

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:50.120
and sort of quantify things
and use tools that journalists

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.440
didn't used to use, but
they allow other reporters

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.570
to take our stories
and localize them.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.850
Our Dollars for
Docs application,

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.640
for example-- which
is just one of them--

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.050
has been used by something like
180 other news organizations

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.590
to write stories of their own.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.230
And it shows you how
an organization that's

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.690
45 people, most of
them in New York,

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:17.470
can have a ripple effect
that goes on and on.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:22.120
And I think that so
much of our challenge

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.210
is always to-- as you
were saying-- be creative.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:31.540
Cut through the outrage fatigue,
the numbness, the noise,

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:37.920
to try to do stories that stay
with people and do make change.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.740
So that's pretty much our story.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.090
RICHARD GINGRAS: As
I noted, each of you

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.500
are in relatively
new organizations.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.195
CIR has been around the
longest in a pre-digital form,

00:12:53.195 --> 00:12:55.701
actually.

00:12:55.701 --> 00:12:57.450
But given that, and
given your experience,

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.020
and given that all three
of you really come out

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.790
of traditional
media organizations

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.820
in your backgrounds-- what's
the advice you would give the LA

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.860
Times, ABC News, as they
struggle with change?

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.980
Do you do you have
any advice for them?

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.820
ANDY DONOHUE: I think
maybe one thing would

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.630
be not to try to be
everything to everybody.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.020
I mean, there's one
thing, one of the threads

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.270
you can run through all
of us, which is really

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.200
trying to be specialized and
focused in certain things.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.950
And that's what you're
seeing in all kinds

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.460
of different start-ups
whether they be the Marshall

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.040
project, which is a new
nonprofit start-up that's just

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.740
about criminal justice
issues, or if it's Vox, just

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.900
about explaining things.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.910
And even you see the
New York Times sort

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.330
of moving this way
now, that they're

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.900
starting to build
more micro-sites.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.060
They have a whole cooking
site, which has totally

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.660
revolutionized the
eating in my family.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.750
They've got The Upshot,
which is sort of election.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.710
The internet organizes
itself around communities.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.204
It doesn't really organize
itself around general interest.

00:14:03.204 --> 00:14:04.620
And so what you're
starting to see

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.100
is just a lot more organizing
around communities.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.290
And what it looks like is,
you organize communities

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.370
and then maybe if you
organize a bunch of them,

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.012
then it ends up becoming general
interest in some of them.

00:14:17.012 --> 00:14:17.970
RICHARD GINGRAS: Robin?

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.100
Alisa?

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:25.455
ROBIN FIELDS: Well, I think that
what we were seeing happening

00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:26.830
in a lot of these
organizations--

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:33.650
the idea that you could cut your
way to the future-- I think,

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.420
people have sort of realised
the futility of that.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.970
And I think the path
forward probably does

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.470
lie exactly where
Andy was saying.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.070
I think that it's tough to--
it's kind of like they're

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.600
trying to take this giant
Lincoln Continental.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.300
They're driving down the
highway at 60 miles an hour

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.720
and trying to turn
it into a Prius

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.270
while they're still driving it.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.205
And I in some ways have a
lot of compassion for that,

00:14:58.205 --> 00:14:59.830
because they still
have to deal with so

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.430
many of the expectations
of the past.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.000
And also, so much
of their revenue

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.500
is still coming from paper.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.950
So I guess if I had a business
model that would work for them,

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.450
I'd probably be in a different
line of work than I am today.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.010
But I don't think that
they have the option

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.940
of going non-profit and
funding themselves our way.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.860
So they're going
to have a soldier

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.780
forward in a different way.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.780
ALISA BARBA: And those
organizations-- you know,

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.780
the LA Times, the New
York Times, all those guys

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.030
--they're still built
on fabulous reporters,

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.290
great storytelling.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.840
And I think that what we
have learned, whether you're

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.760
in the profit or the
non-profit sector,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.110
is that great reporting
will find a way

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.310
to pay for itself,
one way or the other.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.910
Whether it's smaller,
leaner, deeper.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.627
Those are the key elements.

00:15:50.627 --> 00:15:52.210
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Well so far, anyways,

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.490
it seems that at
least in your efforts,

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.340
that great reporting
is finding a way.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.600
But let me go to the other
extreme and ask you this.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.120
As I said, I have a
rather optimistic view

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.170
from an architectural
perspective.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.860
But what scares you?

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.240
What makes you
nervous as you try

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.134
to move your efforts forward?

00:16:16.134 --> 00:16:17.550
ALISA BARBA: I'll
just say that we

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.980
are funded right now through
a grant from the Corporation

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.000
for Public Broadcasting,
which has sought

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.830
to foster local journalism
centers across the country.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.740
So what I'm scared of is
when the CPB money goes away.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.090
So basically, when our
grant funding ends,

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.330
we have to find a model
for sustainability that

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.577
is going to be something
along the lines of what

00:16:37.577 --> 00:16:38.160
these guys do.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.090
But again, we're
only six, seven.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.030
And we're based
in states without

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.620
a huge philanthropic community.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.190
We're not New York
or San Francisco.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.310
We're in North
Dakota and Wyoming,

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.780
and frankly a lot of
people in those states

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.770
don't listen to public radio
and don't watch public TV.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.630
I think the what they call the
cume-- the amount of people who

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:02.340
listen to us, it's maybe 5%
to 10% on a really good--

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.690
really good-- week.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.109
So finding sustainability
within these local communities

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.339
is really the nut that
we're trying to crack.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:16.730
And if you look at, I think,
large national organizations--

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.050
which these guys
both qualify as-- you

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.869
have a better,
easier, time of it

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.580
frankly, than local
non-profit journalists.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.550
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
we're going to actually

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.790
go to questions, shortly.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.640
In fact, we have
the Dory somewhere.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.940
The Dory is our internal
tool so that anyone

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.730
can surface questions
for this gathering.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.976
They don't have to
be here in the room.

00:17:39.976 --> 00:17:41.350
And I'm sure there
are good ones,

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.250
and we'll begin
with those shortly.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.630
In fact, gladly begin now.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.280
If there's a question in the
room, we can go right to that.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.490
Open this up broadly.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.406
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:06.268
So given the funding challenges,
are news organizations

00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:10.754
starting to do less emphasis on
the exclusive and more emphasis

00:18:10.754 --> 00:18:11.680
on finding the story?

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.763
Whether that would mean
aligning with competitors.

00:18:13.763 --> 00:18:19.000
Another way the movie
industry [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.880
came together to [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.500
ROBIN FIELDS: Well,
speaking for us,

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:33.510
we've always been sort of a
serial collaborator or partner.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.320
We're always looking to partner
with other news organizations

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.290
on our stories.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.080
And I think that
it's interesting

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.590
because we've seen
investigative reporting-- which

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:45.070
was once just perceived
as super-competitive, only

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.530
competitive, only
"mine, mine, mine" kind

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.930
of an attitude-- change
completely into something where

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.110
we want people to not only
partner with us on our stories,

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.120
we want them to
follow stories, do

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.270
stories modeled on our stories.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.490
We routinely release
our stories and then

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.890
put out a reporter's
recipe for our stories

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.290
to spark other
people's journalism.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.080
Because ultimately,
for us the mission

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.320
isn't just to be able to
stamp a giant "ProPublica"

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.610
on everything--
although that's fine,

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.180
so if you want to do
that, go right ahead--

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.720
but to have an
impact in this world.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.690
And have a story that
makes a difference.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:29.370
So we have partnered
probably with,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.850
at this point, a couple
hundred news organizations.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.060
And we're always looking
to find new partners.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.830
So yes, in answer to that.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.850
ANDY DONOHUE: I think that's
a really important result

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.440
of this business model, is that
when you do talk to funders

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.330
they want to know what the
impact of your story is.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.530
I mean, that's what
they're putting money into

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.850
and that's what they've funded.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.850
They're used funding other
things like education reform

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.810
or environmentalism,
where they do

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.832
want to see the impact of that.

00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:00.290
Sometimes it's a
fine line to walk.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.010
We can't be political
advocates for certain things.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.940
But that's generally not
that hard to figure out.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.160
But what they don't care
is who gets the credit.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.144
Unless it's them.

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:15.290
Just kidding.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.540
We've partnered.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.071
Even though you
could say that we

00:20:18.071 --> 00:20:19.820
compete for maybe some
of the same grants,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.778
or something like that.

00:20:20.778 --> 00:20:22.940
We've partnered on
stories together.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.550
But a really
important part of that

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:30.340
is localizing data so
that when we do a story,

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.820
and we'll get statewide
or nationwide data,

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.370
we are in an active
pursuit of trying

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.817
to find local publications
to get that out and do that.

00:20:38.817 --> 00:20:40.900
And that's just a whole
different world in the way

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.850
that we collaborate
than we used to.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:43.641
ALISA BARBA: Right.

00:20:43.641 --> 00:20:45.340
And so we, as a
small organization,

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.260
we can take the data
from one of these guys

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.730
if they're doing a big
data dive on some story.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.890
And not only can we
localize it, but we can

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.070
also-- we're in
different mediums.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.760
So I do radio and television.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.256
So a lot of these guys
focus is on print.

00:21:00.256 --> 00:21:02.380
[INAUDIBLE] does a lot of
radio and television too.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.670
But I can put you on NPR.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.250
I can get that megaphone
onto your story,

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.300
which is always good.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.630
RICHARD GINGRAS: In fact,
all three of you, all three

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.010
of your organizations
do, in a sense,

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:19.930
syndicate your content in a
quest for larger audiences.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.560
Last time I talked
to Robert Rosenthal,

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.059
he was talking about
how much effort

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:24.900
you put into measuring
impact, which I think

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.630
is a great thing to do.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.960
But you, I know, had
a question before,

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.790
which I think would be
good to raise for the group

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.780
and see if we can find
an answer for you.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.470
ALISA BARBA: OK, so, again, this
is a small news organization's

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.970
problem.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:42.270
This is not probably
their problem.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.620
Inside Energy is our group.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.830
We have our website,
insideenergy.org,

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.030
and we all put a lot of
attention into our website.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.630
We make it pretty.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:50.504
We make it beautiful.

00:21:50.504 --> 00:21:51.900
We do a lot of data.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.285
Then we also have seven
partners across our region

00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:58.714
who take our digital content
and put it on their sites

00:21:58.714 --> 00:22:00.880
as well, because they don't
have anybody doing this.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.080
So part of our mission
is to raise capacity.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.970
Is to take smaller newsrooms
and give them news stories

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.360
that they can put on there
and make them sound better.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.470
But digitally, that screws us.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.930
We lose our juice
when our one story

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.420
is on seven different
digital platforms.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.850
So, Google, do you guys
have a solution for me?

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:20.770
What can I do?

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.860
I know we can customize
all the local content

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.776
and make it different.

00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:26.390
But basically that's
been a huge problem.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:30.840
RICHARD GINGRAS: In a sense,
how to maintain your Google

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.510
juice, as it were?

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.290
ALISA BARBA: Here's the issue,
is that our own website-- we're

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.030
supposed to be
serving our partners.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.930
We're supposed to make
them all look better.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.560
Our website, the way we
sold it to them, we said,

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.660
we're just archival. .

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.340
We just need a little
place to put it

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.100
but we're doing all kinds
of digital-only content

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.230
that our partners are reluctant
to publish because of the fact

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.215
that it basically doesn't
seem to raise all boats.

00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:58.054
Does that make sense?

00:22:58.054 --> 00:22:59.220
RICHARD GINGRAS: I think so.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.840
I'll touch on one part of it,
and if others have perspective

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.850
in the room, I'd
like you to jump in.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.860
Because one thing-- and
what I was picking up

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.690
in earlier conversations--
is that issue of,

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.140
if we're syndicating
our content,

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.120
how do we do it in
such a fashion that we

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.940
as the organization and
wrote the canonical article,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.580
in a sense, retain
primary value.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.400
Which, by the way,
is not a question

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.540
that just comes from
small organizations.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.250
The New York Times,
obviously, syndicates content.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.910
And we've had similar
discussions with them.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:41.520
So in that specific point, there
are some things you can do.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.320
The simplest right now is
simply to have your syndication

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.310
partners, when they're putting
your content on their sites,

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.040
is to make sure
there's a "noindex"

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.990
tag in the articles, which
means that we won't crawl that.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.720
We won't include
that in our index.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.670
We'll actually then find yours.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.470
There's another tag
called "rel=canonical"

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.670
which you can also use.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.130
And ultimately, it
might be better,

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:10.920
but that is being used across
the industry isn't as clear.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.220
[INAUDIBLE] Make use of that.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.760
But others here
might have thoughts

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.740
about your general
question, or correct me

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.430
if they think I'm wrong in my
answer to that specific point.

00:24:22.298 --> 00:24:24.166
AUDIENCE: I don't
have a question.

00:24:26.802 --> 00:24:29.575
But since I have [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.418
Something big is happening
in investigative journalism,

00:24:37.418 --> 00:24:41.978
at least [INAUDIBLE],
the "Serial" podcast.

00:24:41.978 --> 00:24:44.270
And I was just wondering
what you thought about that.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.186
ANDY DONOHUE: I was
listening to it on my way.

00:24:46.186 --> 00:24:46.960
On my drive here.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.430
AUDIENCE: Me too.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.350
I'm halfway through it.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:58.850
How do you think that affects
the industry, especially

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.175
the non-profit,
public [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.390
RICHARD GINGRAS: First I
want to quickly repeat.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.560
How does the
increased popularity

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.957
of "Serial" podcasting
impact your work?

00:25:28.957 --> 00:25:29.790
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.835
ANDY DONOHUE: I
think it's fabulous.

00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:38.460
I mean, there's a
few different points,

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.900
but one is just like
the way that she

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.215
opens up and so
honest about her quest

00:25:43.215 --> 00:25:47.120
and her process is in
itself half of what's

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.070
fascinating about that show.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.150
And so she's just sort of turned
a lot of what we do inside out.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.400
I mean, we all
have-- there's always

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.710
interesting stories
about both what

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.290
you're doing when
you're reporting,

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.760
or also just the
doubts you have.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.220
I mean, a key
element of that show

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.820
is how much you wrestles
with what the truth is.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.250
And we don't like to admit
that, but we're always

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.260
doing that with a story.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.130
Where you're not quite sure.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.290
Am I even on this story?

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.281
Is this guy guilty?

00:26:14.281 --> 00:26:14.780
Innocent?

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.990
I mean, just to freely
and openly grapple

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.660
with that, I think,
is really liberating.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.867
I hope that's a key feature
of investigative reporting

00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:25.450
in the future.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.410
And then just the quest
narrative, in general,

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.500
is just such a powerful way of
telling a story that we haven't

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.890
really harnessed very much
in investigative reporting,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:33.390
as well.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.540
ALISA BARBA: It just
basically gives us

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.930
a new way to tell a story.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:41.330
And I mean, my staff is a
bunch of podcast addicts.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:42.875
And they're just
going nuts about it.

00:26:42.875 --> 00:26:45.250
So now every story is going
to become a "Serial" podcast.

00:26:48.934 --> 00:26:50.600
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Question from the Dory?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.389
Oh, question from Marisha.

00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:56.630
AUDIENCE: That actually
goes into a question

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.375
that I've been wondering.

00:26:59.375 --> 00:27:02.369
I sort of have this [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:18.684 --> 00:27:20.100
ANDY DONOHUE:
That's the fun part.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.170
ROBIN FIELDS: Well,
I think we often

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.120
start with a lead or a tip
or something like that.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.880
But the truth of
the matter is, we

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.010
may have an idea what the
minimum story would be.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:37.690
But as my boss is fond of
saying, whenever asked about,

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.106
"What's the best story that
could come out of this?"

00:27:40.106 --> 00:27:42.480
The best story that could come
out of this is one that we

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.290
cannot even imagine today.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.880
And that's what's
exciting about it.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.950
It's what's volatile about it.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.970
And in some ways,
investigative stories

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:56.010
are always the stories where
the people you're writing about,

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:57.480
or the thing you
are writing about,

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.150
often don't want
you to do the story.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.890
So they're often stories that
are difficult because you

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.780
get very little cooperation.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.290
When people get a call from
someone from ProPublica

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.620
they kind of know
the story is not

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.160
going to be puppies, clowns,
the latest press release.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.070
So we're constantly
having to overcome that.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:24.930
And the challenges
and twists and turns

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.020
of an investigative story,
to someone who did them.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.010
Is endlessly fascinating.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:31.630
But the great thing
is you can get

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:35.690
somewhere way more interesting
and better than you

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.240
ever, ever imagined.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.960
The truth is usually
stranger than you think.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:46.665
RICHARD GINGRAS: Can you give
a few insights into your craft,

00:28:46.665 --> 00:28:47.290
in that regard?

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.810
I mean, I often observe--
I have several friends who

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:54.950
are reporters, and
I'm always amused

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.670
at how good they are about
getting me to talk about things

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.870
that I wasn't necessarily
comfortable talking about.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.850
And you're like, "How
did you do that?"

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:07.844
You're not going to
tell us, are you?

00:29:07.844 --> 00:29:10.010
ROBIN FIELDS: I think that
one of the amazing things

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.030
about a life as a
reporter is you're often

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.795
talking to people on the best
or the worst day of their lives.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.420
And they do this
amazing thing, which

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.320
is that they trust you
with their stories.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.700
They trust you with their lives.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.830
They trust you with these things
that they haven't told anybody

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.040
else, sometimes.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.630
I mean, we just brought out
this story about Firestone

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:39.680
in Liberia and their
dealings with Charles Taylor,

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.050
the warlord.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.470
And one of the crucial
interviews for this story--

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.680
a story that was reported
over the course of a year--

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.850
we didn't get that interview
until maybe a week, or a week

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.540
and a half before publication.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:58.020
We'd been trying to talk to
this person for seven months.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.120
So trust-building takes time.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.860
It takes persistence.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.910
But he hadn't talked
about what happened

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.790
to him there for 23 years.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.650
And he finally spoke to us.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.470
And to be trusted
with somebody's story

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:17.960
like that-- it's an amazing
thing, and something

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.630
that you carry with
you all the time.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.825
Your trust with these people
who give you their stories.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.010
I can still remember
conversations

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.905
that I had where I remember
knocking on somebody's door

00:30:32.905 --> 00:30:36.130
and interviewing them
about something terrible

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.700
their son had done.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.620
And I was talking to this
man, the guy's father,

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.820
and this big, burly
Irishman burst into tears.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.210
And I was just like,
"Oh my goodness!"

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:53.630
And that is the amazing part
of being a reporter, I think,

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:56.240
is those kinds of
experiences that you

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.900
have that stay with you.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.960
And become part of the
story that you then

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.204
share with other people.

00:31:02.204 --> 00:31:03.870
ALISA BARBA: But
there's plenty of doors

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.812
that get slammed
in your face too.

00:31:05.812 --> 00:31:08.270
You've got the guy bursting in
tears, and then you've got--

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.310
I mean, I remember
as a reporter--

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:13.440
I worked for the
MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour,

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.590
and I was on the Middle
East beat out of Washington.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.950
And part of my job
was-- I don't know,

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.820
it's probably all before
everybody's time--

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:25.130
but there was a bunch of
hostages being held in Iran.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.330
And across the Middle East.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.080
I don't really remember
the circumstances.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.330
But my job, every time
there was news about this,

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.440
was to call the families
and to get a quote.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.630
So there's nastiness too.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.080
Real nastiness.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.121
ANDY DONOHUE: Just to
build on that a little bit.

00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:42.740
It's interesting how important,
in these kind of stories, just

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.830
story selection is.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.600
Like, picking the right stories.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.500
Because you do spend a year,
18 months, on the story.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.496
And it is a high-wire act.

00:31:51.496 --> 00:31:53.370
It's amazing to me how
many different stories

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.294
I've done that that key
source didn't come out

00:31:56.294 --> 00:31:57.210
till right at the end.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.990
And you're like,
"What the hell would

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.140
this nine months of my life
been if this person hadn't

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.490
out of the blue emailed
me and decided to talk?"

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.370
And so if you're
a daily reporter,

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:10.120
you pick the wrong story,
that that scar lasts for a day

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.740
and you move onto the next one.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.180
And so actually
like figuring out

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.210
how to pick the right
stories, and when

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.635
to give up on one when
it's not bearing fruit

00:32:18.635 --> 00:32:23.014
is really, really
tough calculus.

00:32:23.014 --> 00:32:24.930
RICHARD GINGRAS: We're
going to go to the Dory

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.388
and then we'll come
back to Maggie.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.710
"As nonprofit
organizations, how do you

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.250
ensure that donors
and their donations

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:42.309
never influence your reporting?"

00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:43.350
ROBIN FIELDS: It's funny.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:46.656
In my previous life, in
commercial journalism,

00:32:46.656 --> 00:32:48.905
we had the same question but
it was about advertisers.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.370
This is an issue
that we've always

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.650
dealt with in journalism.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:59.280
And I think that independence
is just something

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.350
that you accrue every day.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.130
I mean, I can sit here
and say, of course

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:05.220
our donors have nothing to
do with the stories we choose

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:05.969
or how we do them.

00:33:05.969 --> 00:33:07.610
And that's completely true.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:12.490
But you'll be the judge of
that by seeing what we do

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.380
and how we do it.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.030
We are very, very
scrupulous about what

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.690
strings we will allow to
be attached to any money

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.640
that we take.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:29.200
We would never, for example,
take money to do a story.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.330
Because investigative reporting
goes where it goes, and we're

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:37.220
not going to be limited in what
we report by virtue of promises

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.620
that we make like that.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.420
And we've set up a lot of
limits on that kind of thing,

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.580
to make sure that
that never happens.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.537
But again, independence is--
the proof is in the pudding.

00:33:49.537 --> 00:33:51.120
RICHARD GINGRAS: You
know, I've always

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.560
felt that having worked
in public broadcasting

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.610
myself, as well as in
commercial media, there

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.200
is no revenue model.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.230
There is no financial
support model for journalism

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:04.300
that doesn't come with the
potential for conflict.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.500
It is, as you say,
in the fastidiousness

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.760
of those in that
organization do adhere

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.699
to the principles of how
and why you do what you do

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.179
ANDY DONOHUE: I always say that
nonprofit journalism is not

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:20.380
any more holy than for-profit.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:24.270
It is just as much dependent on
the firewalls and the systems

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.909
you set up.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.280
There's these interesting
sort of sweet spots

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.080
you have to find.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.070
Because when you do get
grants, people generally

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.639
want to have an idea
of what kind of stuff

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:36.790
you're going to cover.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:40.489
They may fund environmental
coverage, or something.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.920
So we have to figure out, yes,
we will undertake an endeavor

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.800
to find out the most
toxic areas of California.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.020
But after that, you
don't get to pick.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.092
That's a very broad area.

00:34:50.092 --> 00:34:51.050
We'll look at the data.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.425
But after that, you don't get
to pick what stories we do,

00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:54.800
who, does them.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.739
Anything like that.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:58.510
And so you can't get like really
on granular what stories you're

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.010
doing, but at the
same time you have

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.050
to figure out how you
can make what you're

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.777
going to do appealing to donors.

00:35:03.777 --> 00:35:05.360
ALISA BARBA: And
just one last thought

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.810
is I think donors or advertisers
or supporters or underwriters

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.440
don't often understand that.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.720
What we take for
granted, and we know

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.360
as the absolute basis of
funding for journalism.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.360
There's a firewall between
editorial and fundraising.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.310
I would have to say
until very recently, I

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.480
had absolutely nothing
to with fundraising.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.780
But again, this is part
of the brave new world

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.190
and we're all raising money
for our operations as we go.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.990
But oftentimes, funders
will be astonished

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:39.184
to know that they can't have
a say in what the product is.

00:35:39.184 --> 00:35:40.600
ANDY DONOHUE: And
it's interesting

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:46.480
because I think people think
that because they're not

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.290
a for-profit business,
that it may not be corrupt.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:49.790
Right?

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.050
Or there may not be a
problem in asking for that.

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.630
Because they're not
like an old card dealer

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.452
at the newspaper hoping
to not get tough coverage.

00:35:57.452 --> 00:35:59.160
Like, they're not
making money off of it.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.366
They just have a viewpoint.

00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:02.990
But the fact of matter is, they
have a viewpoint and an agenda.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:05.000
And that can't drive
what we're doing, either.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.092
That's not as black and white
or as easy to explain to people.

00:36:09.092 --> 00:36:11.050
RICHARD GINGRAS: We're
going to Maggie Shields.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.160
Maggie Shields used
to work at the BBC.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.810
And then this weekend,
when I was hosting an AMA

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.420
with Daniel Ellsberg,
the challenge

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.885
was to as him a question that
he'd never been asked before.

00:36:20.885 --> 00:36:22.260
Which was a pretty
big challenge.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.840
And she won.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.465
So beware.

00:36:25.465 --> 00:36:27.405
AUDIENCE: My question
is about [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.750
RICHARD GINGRAS: Basically, I'm
going to go at that last part.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.490
How do you, in
your work, do work

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.510
that lasts longer than the
instance of the article?

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.640
ANDY DONOHUE: That is
really important question

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.570
that we're wrestling with right
now, because the old model

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.590
that even CIR used to do, was
drop the big investigation

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.200
and just walk away.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.790
And now online, you have
to have a community that's

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.260
ready to take that.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.250
Unless it's just
some blockbuster.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.390
And so one thing that
we're working on right now

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:37.640
is thinking of these as
investigations in context.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.810
So that we have, maybe,
researchers or newer reporters

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.090
constantly writing about the
themes that we've decided

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.880
are important.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.180
Public service kind of stuff,
or investigative things.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.470
So that there is sort of
an audience built up that's

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.910
ready and knows we might be
interested in these things

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:55.540
when the story drops.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.585
And then when the story drops--
this is an idea, actually,

00:37:58.585 --> 00:38:02.480
that the editor Stephen
Engelberg at ProPublica,

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.970
I sort of stole from him.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:05.670
His idea that he
had talked about,

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.640
and what they think
about is campaigns.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.990
Where you drop a
story, but then you

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:11.710
have all these other
things that come out

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:13.880
so that you find
ways to continuously

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.660
be in the news cycle,
beyond just that one day.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.120
And then creating durable and
sustainable data, I think,

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.210
is also a really important part.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.970
Because we put so much work
into the searchable data

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.270
apps that we create,
that they can't just

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:30.750
stand for that one story.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:32.960
They have to have uses beyond
what that one story is.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.320
RICHARD GINGRAS: In fact,
with ProPublica-- and this is

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.560
an example I often
cite-- you've continued

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.920
to make available this
knowledge utility on the state

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.080
of dialysis treatment centers.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.090
So I can understand
which one I should use,

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.090
should I need that help.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.050
Does that play a part as well?

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:56.005
ROBIN FIELDS: Well, that was
my project as a reporter,

00:38:56.005 --> 00:39:01.360
so now you're just--
[LAUGHING] Oh, yes!

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.360
Absolutely.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:09.510
We want to create resources
both for the consuming public

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:13.270
and for the journalistic
community that have enduring

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:19.510
value, and that can be refreshed
and renewed all the time.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:24.960
We want to-- first
of all, we follow up.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.240
We follow up relentlessly
on our investigations.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.200
I think we've
probably done, I don't

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.350
know, somewhere between 150
and 200 stories about fracking.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:38.830
And I can guarantee you right
now that if people are waiting

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.504
for us to go away on that
one, we're not gonna.

00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:43.420
I don't want to reveal
the ending or anything,

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.160
but that's not going to happen.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.680
So that's part of it.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:53.980
And I think for something
like-- we created something

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:58.050
for a project that we have yet
to do on patient harm, that

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.510
is in itself-- we have a
Facebook community of thousands

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:05.510
of members, and that in and of
itself has produced stories.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:08.390
And I'd anticipate that
that has a lifespan

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.270
of many, many, many years.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:14.370
So I think that, as Andy
was saying, that there's

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:17.470
a lot of different ways that
we keep a project relevant.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:21.610
And we don't just drop
a bomb and run away.

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.800
ALISA BARBA: You know,
we're six months old.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.900
RICHARD GINGRAS: A question
from the cloud, as it were.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.760
"What role do amateur
bloggers and individuals

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.160
sharing ad hoc messages, photos,
and video via social media

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.460
play in modern
investigative journalism?

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.750
Does leveraging
these sources enable

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:51.150
more targeted investments by
professional journalists?"

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.180
ROBIN FIELDS: You know, I
think that from my perspective,

00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:01.510
that's been more of a resource
for breaking news in places

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:03.990
that reporters
can't get to than it

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:05.770
has been for
investigative reporters.

00:41:07.881 --> 00:41:09.630
RICHARD GINGRAS: Maybe
I'm incorrect here,

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.730
but I thought
ProPublica specifically

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.600
had, around one
area of exploration,

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.220
sort of done crowdsourcing.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.120
ROBIN FIELDS: Oh, we
have done crowdsourcing.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.150
And we have done-- mostly
we do a very directed kind

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:23.420
of crowdsourcing.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.640
We did a project
called Free the Files.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.660
And that was about
political spending

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:33.240
on political ads,
which at one time

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.220
were very difficult to
track because the FCC,

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.110
at first, wasn't putting
any of this data online.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:41.030
They had to go to
television stations

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:44.060
and say, give us
your political file.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.370
Who did that?

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.700
Nobody.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.960
And then eventually they did
put some of this stuff online,

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:54.780
and it was in completely
ridiculous, undigestible form,

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.010
as these things are in
their first iteration.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.610
PDFs that nobody could
make hide nor hair of.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.780
And we harnessed a group
of more than 1,000 people

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:08.960
to basically take that
mishmash and turn it into data.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.600
And we actually put
together a database

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.570
of more than $1 billion of
TV spending in the run-up

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:20.700
to the 2012
presidential election.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.680
And I think what that
showed was that if you

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:28.910
can give the crowd an
interesting and vital task,

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:32.770
and give them a way to do it in
a uniform and standardized way,

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:37.850
that there is potential to
use that for investigations,

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.250
and to use that just to
inform the public on something

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:41.544
it needs to know.

00:42:41.544 --> 00:42:43.460
RICHARD GINGRAS: But to
the original point of,

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.480
can it stimulate
an investigation?

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.480
What Daniel Ellsberg
would say if he was here,

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.400
and what he said loud and
clear on Saturday night, was

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.930
how do we stimulate
more whistle-blowing?

00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:00.290
And how can journalists
find other additional ways

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.730
to ferret out whistle-blowing?

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.120
Because obviously the state
of affairs in whistle-blowing

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.870
in the United States
isn't terribly good--

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:07.994
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:07.994 --> 00:43:09.660
ROBIN FIELDS: Federal
government to stop

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.827
prosecuting whistle-blowers?

00:43:10.827 --> 00:43:12.993
RICHARD GINGRAS: Which is,
of course, his key point,

00:43:12.993 --> 00:43:15.690
is we've had more whistle-blower
prosecutions in the last six

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:18.406
years and we had
in the last 100.

00:43:18.406 --> 00:43:20.530
ALISA BARBA: Yeah, I think
whistle-blowers, though,

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.275
are different than
amateur bloggers.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:27.170
That is much, much
more of a pointed--

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.140
where they may go to
ProPublica, or they

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:33.560
may go to CIR or
something like that.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.170
We use this thing called the
Public Inside Network, which

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.780
is a public media thing, where
we have people who basically

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.970
signed up to kind of
provide us with stories.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.730
So this is, again,
targeted crowdsourcing

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.780
of people who are already
kind of in your community.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.901
That's something we do a lot of.

00:43:48.901 --> 00:43:49.984
RICHARD GINGRAS: Question?

00:43:49.984 --> 00:43:51.470
Paul?

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:52.970
AUDIENCE: So with
the rapid transfer

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:58.140
from old ways of consuming
news to these new form

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:03.680
factors and the context that
comes with their [INAUDIBLE],

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.653
how is that changing the way in
which you package and deliver

00:44:07.653 --> 00:44:08.652
investigative reporting?

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:16.160
ANDY DONOHUE: I think
in a very basic way

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.050
you're thinking about
the mobile phone.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:21.217
I'm thinking about the phone
as I'm editing stories,

00:44:21.217 --> 00:44:22.466
and seeing what it looks like.

00:44:22.466 --> 00:44:23.100
Right?

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.040
Now, a great narrative is a
great narrative no matter what.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.880
Long format isn't going away.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.960
But what we've tried
to do is give people

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.350
a lot of different
entries into a story,

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.100
and package it in
different ways depending

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.330
on what kind of consumer
or what kind of condition

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:43.630
you may be in when
you're consuming it.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.862
We just had a story last week
about the dangerous pesticides

00:44:47.862 --> 00:44:49.570
that are used in the
strawberry industry.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:52.370
That's an 8,000- word
narrative with five chapters,

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.330
but it's also a
listicle, "Seven Things

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.380
You Should Know Before You
Eat Your First Strawberry."

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.380
It's also a quick,
four-minute animation

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.170
that is narrated by Roman Mars.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:04.240
It's also data app.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.430
So it's just sort of finding
all these different ways.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:10.349
But then also making sure,
first and foremost when

00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:12.390
we're looking at what the
design is, that it just

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:15.405
fits on the phone.

00:45:15.405 --> 00:45:16.280
RICHARD GINGRAS: Yes?

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.352
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about data sources.

00:45:19.352 --> 00:45:23.772
[INAUDIBLE] Are there
any data sources

00:45:23.772 --> 00:45:26.604
that you wish you had access to?

00:45:26.604 --> 00:45:27.104
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.769
ROBIN FIELDS: I wish
I had subpoena power.

00:45:31.769 --> 00:45:36.359
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:39.580
But I sense that's
not going to happen.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:46.130
But certainly, we use
any and all databases

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:50.110
that we can get out of state,
local, and federal government.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:54.740
That's just sort of the standby.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.430
I think Dollars for Docs, which
has come up a couple times,

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:02.540
and is our database that
we sort of scraped out

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:06.030
of, at that point, I
think, seven or eight--

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:12.320
and now it's more than that--
drug companies' information

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.307
that they've been forced to put
online because of settlements

00:46:15.307 --> 00:46:16.140
with the government.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.900
And they put it
online in the way

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.400
exactly that you'd
think they would,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.480
so that no one could ever
possibly understand or use it.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.500
So we took all that.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:28.220
We scraped it together and made
a usable database out of it.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.340
And I think that that's
a lot of what we do,

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.560
which is take data
which exists but make it

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.700
into a useful and
accessible thing.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.840
A living thing.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.060
But we will accept interesting
and leaked data too,

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.490
so if you happen
to know anybody--

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:51.390
ANDY DONOHUE: Governments
could essentially half of us

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:55.260
out of business if they
just made their data usable.

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.366
Maybe I shouldn't say that.

00:46:57.366 --> 00:46:59.517
ALISA BARBA: I was
thinking the same thing.

00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:01.266
ROBIN FIELDS: I think
you're right, sadly.

00:47:01.266 --> 00:47:03.200
ALISA BARBA: We all of
us rely on government

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.820
regulatory agencies,
basically, for our data.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.840
And most of it is
so unusable that we

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.480
are employed to try to
figure out what it all means.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.511
And then to make
a story around it.

00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:14.760
But if, for instance, if
they had a whole bunch of you

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.301
guys working for
them and they really

00:47:16.301 --> 00:47:18.360
could figure out how
to make data useful,

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.682
then everybody would know.

00:47:19.682 --> 00:47:21.390
ANDY DONOHUE: I'd love
to be able to pose

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.700
that question to our data team,
though, and get back to you.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.450
I know one thing that
we've struggled with

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:28.770
is we do a decent amount
of work on farm workers.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.550
And there is almost
no reliable data

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.460
because they're undocumented
workers who will just not

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:38.520
interface with the
government in any way.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.300
So if you're dealing with
sexual abuse, sexual harassment,

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.460
pesticide poisoning, all
these kind of things.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.072
There is some data on
it, but it's just junk.

00:47:46.072 --> 00:47:47.530
And so one of the
things that we've

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.670
been trying to play
with is how to actually,

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.010
are there interesting
ways to create that data.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:54.760
ROBIN FIELDS: Another
area which is always

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.740
sort of a data disaster
that is really frustrating

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.420
is that anything having
to do with the courts

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:05.290
is chopped up by jurisdiction.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.092
And everybody wants to know
national things about what's

00:48:08.092 --> 00:48:10.050
happening in criminal
justice, and there's just

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:10.950
no way to do it.

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:17.260
Forget about the civil system.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.890
I think that so much
is done state-to-state

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:22.520
that we'd really benefit
from a national picture.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.100
So that's something.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.600
I know last year
we did something

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.790
on injuries involving
temp workers.

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:31.970
And we ended up doing an
analysis that had never

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:35.390
been undertaken before,
involving four or five states'

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:37.840
worth of workers' comp data.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.754
And it's just amazing that--

00:48:39.754 --> 00:48:40.920
ALISA BARBA: Nobody does it.

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.461
ROBIN FIELDS: Yeah,
that isn't there.

00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:46.190
That we don't know the answers
to these very basic questions,

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:47.739
even in the sea of
data that we have.

00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:48.530
ALISA BARBA: Right.

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:49.570
It's sea of data.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.990
So covering energy and
fracking, and you're

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.440
trying to compare regulatory
climates in Pennsylvania, North

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.940
Dakota, Texas, Colorado,
where it's all different

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:03.380
and everybody posts it in a
different way, if they post it.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:03.880
Yeah.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.850
That's what we do.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:07.391
ANDY DONOHUE: Sorry to belabor
this, but one other thing too.

00:49:07.391 --> 00:49:10.590
I think in education there's
actually too much data.

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:13.320
I feel like you can
find a piece of data

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.300
to make every case you want.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.675
So it's like this
cacophony of data.

00:49:17.675 --> 00:49:20.786
ROBIN FIELDS: And the Department
of Education data is filthy.

00:49:20.786 --> 00:49:21.722
It's awful.

00:49:21.722 --> 00:49:23.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:25.960
RICHARD GINGRAS:
It's all filthy.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.500
Probably our last
question, and I

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.750
think it's an interesting one.

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:33.560
It's how do you budget
a story, cost-wise?

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.660
Which actually reminds me.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.730
I worked at CPB about
40 million years ago,

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:40.730
and we were funding a
documentary series on death

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:41.730
and dying.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:44.571
And the key
character was a woman

00:49:44.571 --> 00:49:46.320
who was suffering from
a terminal illness.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.672
And I was going to follow
her until her demise.

00:49:48.672 --> 00:49:51.130
And her prognosis at the time
we started it was six months.

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.254
And then went to 12 months.

00:49:52.254 --> 00:49:54.020
And then it went to 18 months.

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:58.790
Which, suffice to say, caused
a tremendous amount of angst

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:00.690
on the part of the funders.

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:03.312
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:03.312 --> 00:50:05.270
ROBIN FIELDS: You were
like, "There's good news

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:06.830
and there's bad news."

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.130
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
how do you do it?

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:16.060
ANDY DONOHUE: Well,
you really don't.

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.770
I mean, I don't know that's
politically correct to say.

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:22.190
But you kind of let the
stories go where they go.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:25.520
And if it's really good,
we find ways to pay for it.

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.810
And if it's really
not good, then we

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:30.990
try to shut down as
fast as possible.

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:34.700
We had a donor event yesterday
based on the strawberry story,

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.260
and our executive
director estimated

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.140
that it cost $500,000.

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.600
And we had no way of
knowing that's what

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.880
it was going to cost.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.164
I would hate to know if
I came in from the start

00:50:48.164 --> 00:50:50.330
and said, "Hey guys, this
is going to cost $500,000"

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.114
if I would have
gotten it approved.

00:50:52.114 --> 00:50:53.530
But everybody kept
getting into it

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:55.071
and it kept getting
more interesting.

00:50:55.071 --> 00:50:57.800
And so just kind of felt right.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.720
ROBIN FIELDS: Well, I think
also, just to keep in mind,

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.735
the single-most expensive
item in any story

00:51:03.735 --> 00:51:06.510
is usually the
journalist's time.

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:09.360
And it's as you were
saying, you don't

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.250
know how long it will
take to do the story,

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:15.170
but you're going to do
it till you've got it.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:19.030
And that's an unknowable
thing at the beginning,

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.611
as you were saying.

00:51:20.611 --> 00:51:22.110
But that's the way
it's always been.

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:24.520
It's interesting that
this issue of cost

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:29.620
bubbles up to the surface
in organizations like ours.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.940
And yet it was exactly the
same at a traditional legacy

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.190
organization, but it was sort
of hidden in a larger editorial

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:39.470
budget, so you didn't
itemize these things.

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.200
But I think in
smaller organizations

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.620
that focus on very
resource-intensive work,

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:49.600
that question is one that we
come up against all the time.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.520
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
we're almost out of time.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.103
I'm going to close with a simple
question to all three of you.

00:51:54.103 --> 00:51:55.920
But before I do, I
want to A, thank you

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.340
for your time and your
eloquence in being here today.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:59.840
And I also want to
say-- and I think

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.090
I can speak for everyone
in the room-- I just

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:05.040
want to thank you for the
tremendous work that you do.

00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.840
The passion you put into it.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.270
It's hugely important.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:12.130
And I know you do it
for higher purposes

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:14.310
than making gobs
and gobs of money.

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:19.250
In today's world that's
a remarkable thing.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:23.200
And I think we couldn't
thank you enough for that.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.400
But in closing, let's
add if each of you

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.790
have a comment on,
again, what drives you?

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:30.820
Why do you love what you do?

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:34.150
What makes you get
up in the morning?

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.410
ANDY DONOHUE: I think
this is the best

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:39.550
time alive to be a
user of journalism.

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.340
I mean, just the amount
of different sources.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.350
The way to get it.

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:45.960
The democratization
of information.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.790
To me, it's just incredibly
exciting to be a part of that.

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.550
I think we're at this
incredible moment

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:55.980
where journalism completely
underwent a revolution

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.480
over the last decade,
but we haven't

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.220
known where that was
going to be going.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.080
And we're starting to
get a better sense.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.579
And I think-- as,
Richard, you write

00:53:03.579 --> 00:53:05.400
a lot-- this isn't a
thing where we're just

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.170
going from A to B.
Now we're in a state

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:08.790
of constant transformation.

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.325
And that's really exciting, to
not just step in and do a job

00:53:11.325 --> 00:53:13.170
that people have always
done, but step in

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:16.790
and do this job that gets
to be redefined every day.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.892
And to be a part of
that is just incredible.

00:53:18.892 --> 00:53:19.600
ALISA BARBA: Yes.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.100
Ditto.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:20.670
Absolutely.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:22.370
All that is awesome.

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:25.670
I work with five or six
journalists who are all

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.810
aged 28 to 32, and they are so
jazzed about what we're doing.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:30.860
They're so excited.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.170
They want to do
"Serial" podcasts.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:35.280
They want to do everything.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.040
For a legacy journalist,
it keeps me young.

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:38.970
I love it.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:42.150
And just even from the get-go,
even back 30 years ago when

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:45.630
I began, journalism
is the best job

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:47.180
because you come in
to work every day

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:50.350
and you learn something new
and you tell stories about it.

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:52.659
So I just love it.

00:53:52.659 --> 00:53:54.110
RICHARD GINGRAS: Robin?

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:57.520
ROBIN FIELDS: Well,
I think that what

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.400
drives me is the
same thing that's

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.226
driven ProPublica
from the start.

00:54:02.226 --> 00:54:04.600
We have this mission statement
that when we put out there

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.730
I almost thought
it was too much.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:13.060
It talked about doing
stories of moral force.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:19.230
And I was almost embarrassed
to realize how much I actually

00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:22.370
believe in that.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:25.360
We're all supposed to be
hard-bitten, irreverent sorts,

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:30.980
and not allow ourselves to
indulge in such thoughts.

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:34.650
But actually, I really
do believe in that.

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:38.060
And I do believe in
our job as reporters

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.950
to bring accountability
and to bring transparency

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:44.080
to this world.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.950
I believe that
without that, we can't

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.250
have our country as it is.

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:52.760
We need to have this
information to be citizens.

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.020
And, I mean, as we've seen
over the last couple of years

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.300
with the stories about the
NSA and so forth, there

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:03.710
is such an important role for
journalists-- particularly

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:09.970
investigative journalists-- to
play in keeping things the way

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:11.990
we want them in this society.

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:17.920
So anyway, still a
little embarrassed.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.364
But still a believer, I suppose.

00:55:20.364 --> 00:55:22.030
RICHARD GINGRAS:
You're talking to folks

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.030
at a company that has the
motto "Don't do evil."

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:26.460
So I think the moral
force thing actually

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.260
registers quite
strongly with us.

00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:30.690
Thank you very, very much
for your being here today.

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:34.940
[APPLAUSE]
