00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:10.540
Why we Kiss Under Mistletoe?

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.280
The name for mistletoe derives the fact that
mistletoe tends to spring from bird droppings

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.140
that have fallen on trees, with the seeds
having passed through the digestive tract

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.140
of the birds.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.089
Thus, the plant was given the name “misteltan”
in Old English from “mistel”, meaning

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.189
“dung”, and “tan”, the plural of “ta”,
meaning “twig”.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.559
Hence, “mistletoe” is another way to essentially
say “dung twig”.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.440
Not only is mistletoe a dung twig, but most
varieties of this plant are partial parasites,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.629
being unable to sustain themselves on their
own photosynthesis, so they leach what they

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.879
need from the particular tree they are growing
on.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.660
Some varieties of mistletoe, such as the North
America Arceuthobium pussilum, are full parasites

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.710
in that they get all their resources from
the tree they are growing on and have no leaves.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.200
So where did the tradition of kissing under
a parasitic poop twig come from?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.310
The mistletoe has been considered a prized
plant throughout history going all the way

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.410
back to the Ancient Greeks, Celts, the Babylonians,
and Scandinavians.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.000
For instance, the Ancient Greeks considered
the plant an aphrodisiac; believed it aided

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.800
in fertility; and could be used to achieve
eternal life.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.220
According to Ancient Babylonian legend, they
had the closest thing to our current tradition

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.780
of kissing under the mistletoe.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.640
At that time, single women looking for a mate
supposedly would stand outside of the temple

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.530
of the goddess of love.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.530
Mistletoe was hung over the entrance to the
temple and when a potential suitor would approach

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.560
one of the ladies, they were supposed to bond
with him.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.530
They did not kiss, however, as kissing wasn’t
a way to show affection at that time in the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.070
Babylonian empire.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.910
As for a more direct root of our kissing tradition,
Norseman had many traditions and legends concerning

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.040
the mistletoe.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.840
One tradition was that mistletoe was a plant
of peace and so that when enemies met under

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.350
the mistletoe they were obliged to stop fighting
for at least a day.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.350
Eventually, this spawned a tradition to hang
mistletoe over the doorway of one’s home

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.350
for peace and good luck.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.430
Mistletoe became associated with Christmas
from this tradition of hanging mistletoe in

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.119
one’s home to bring good luck and peace
to those within the house.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.610
The mistletoe would be hung around the New
Year and the previous year’s mistletoe would

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.500
be taken down, with its powers apparently
tapped.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.100
The new plant would then provide this luck
throughout the year.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.510
By the 18th century in Britain, this evolved
into the kissing tradition we have today.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.310
At this time, it became popular to create
a ball of mistletoe that would be hung as

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.110
a Christmas decoration.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.720
If a couple was found standing under the mistletoe,
they were then obliged to kiss if the mistletoe

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.630
ball still had berries.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.460
For each kiss, one berry would be taken from
the ball.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.330
Once all the berries were gone, all the “luck”
in love and marriage was considered to be

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.690
drained out of the mistletoe and it was now
considered bad luck to kiss beneath it, instead

00:02:49.690 --> 00:03:05.630
of good luck as before.
